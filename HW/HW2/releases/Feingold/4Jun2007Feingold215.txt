SENS. CLINTON, FEINGOLD, LUGAR INTRODUCE SENATE BILL TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS IN ZIMBABWE
  Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Russ Feingold announced today that they have introduced legislation, along with their colleague Sen. Richard Lugar, to address ongoing human rights concerns in Zimbabwe. As Zimbabwe approaches national elections in 2008, the "Support for Democracy and Human Rights in Zimbabwe Act of 2007" seeks to assist Zimbabweans in their efforts to promote democracy and human rights in their country, despite years spent under a repressive and violent government. 
   "Zimbabwe's courageous citizens need to know that the United States stands with them in their efforts to participate in the political process. As events have escalated, much of the international community has spoken out against President Mugabe's actions. However, more can be done," Senator Clinton said. "With the Zimbabwean national election less than a year away, this legislation will send a message to the region that we support a free and fair election and a lasting democratic peace in the years that follow. The people of Zimbabwe need to know not only that the world is watching, but that we will not look away."
   "President Mugabe's strong-armed tactics have long jeopardized the health, safety, and freedom of the people of Zimbabwe," Feingold said. "When the Mugabe regime intensified its brutal crackdown on opposition leaders and human rights advocates earlier this year, we saw the threat this government poses to democracy in Zimbabwe and the urgent need for major political reform. This legislation is a way for the U.S. to send a strong signal to the people of Zimbabwe that we stand firmly behind them in their efforts to promote democracy and human rights in advance of their elections next year."
   President Mugabe's government has systematically used violence and intimidation to repress political opposition, while consistently infringing on the human rights of Zimbabweans. On March 11, 2007, two citizens were killed and up to fifty opposition and civil society members were beaten, detained or arrested when Zimbabwean security forces disrupted a peaceful prayer meeting. The United States, United Nations, European Union, and many human rights organizations have condemned the events of March 11th and the ensuing government action against civilians. In the wake of the violence, the Southern African Development Community announced that South African President Thabo Mbeki will mediate between President Mugabe and the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, in advance of the 2008 presidential election. The "Support for Democracy and Human Rights in Zimbabwe Act of 2007" welcomes and commends this move by African leaders to resolve the political and humanitarian crisis in a way that reflects the will of the people and respects international standards.
   This bipartisan legislation calls for a number of measures to provide assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. The legislation notes that all possible preparations should be made to hold free, fair, and peaceful elections in accordance with international standards. The bill also calls on the Bush Administration to develop, in cooperation with African leaders and the broader international community, a comprehensive U.S. strategy to assist the people of Zimbabwe and authorizes additional resources to support democracy and human rights programs.
