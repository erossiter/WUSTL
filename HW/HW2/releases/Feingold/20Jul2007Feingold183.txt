SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON WISCONSIN RECEIVING OVER $200 MILLION TO HELP LOW-INCOME STUDENTS
  Late last night the U.S. Senate passed the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, which Senator Feingold supported, creating a new grant program called Promise Grants to help low-income students who benefit from the Pell Grant program. The Promise Grant program is designed to supplement Pell Grants and will only be available to students who are currently eligible for Pell Grants. 
   "Pell Grants were once the cornerstone of many students' financial aid packages in Wisconsin and around the country. But in recent years, the maximum Pell Grant award has not kept up with the rising costs of higher education. The Promise Grant program created in legislation passed by the Senate today will supplement the Pell Grant program and bring over $200 million back to Wisconsin to help low income students attend college. While more remains to be done to ensure access to higher education for low income Americans, by passing the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, we are one step closer to making college a reality for the many Americans who otherwise couldn't afford it."
   Feingold has successfully led efforts to increase financial aid for many years. Since 2001, Senator Feingold has worked to increase the maximum individual Pell Grant award. Under the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 a student can receive a maximum of $5,100 in need-based aid for 2008-09, compared to $3,750 in Pell Grant aid in 2001.
