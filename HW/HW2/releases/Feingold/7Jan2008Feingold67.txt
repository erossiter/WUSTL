SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON ONGOING VIOLENCE IN KENYA
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  On the Ongoing Violence in Kenya
   "Although President Kibaki's call for a government of national unity is welcome, such an initiative cannot be effective unless there is a true sharing of power. Ultimately, the current crisis in Kenya must be resolved through an independent and transparent review of the entire electoral process and its outcomes. The Bush administration should indicate that the consequences for failing to conduct such a review include cutting all non-essential U.S. assistance to Kenya. At the same time, the United States, in cooperation with the African Union and others in the region, must continue to urge both sides to take immediate steps to stop the violence that has already claimed hundreds of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands more."
   Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs.
