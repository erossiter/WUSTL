SEN. FEINGOLD RESOLUTION SETS MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR TRADE
  As part of Sen. Russ Feingold's (D-WI) continued effort to highlight jobs initiatives this week, today he introduced a resolution to set minimum standards for the trade agreements the United States enters into with other countries.  
 The standards put in place by this resolution are aimed at protecting American jobs, the environment and our health and safety. 
   "In recent years, we've lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, especially in our manufacturing sector, and a lot of the blame has to go to deeply flawed trade agreements that were supported by both Democrats and Republicans," Feingold said. "We cannot afford to continue trade policies that send good jobs overseas, like trade agreements such as CAFTA would do. Trade agreements like NAFTA and GATT have already hurt our businesses and workers by putting them at a tremendous competitive disadvantage. Those agreements have undermined policies we have established to secure our public health and safety, protect the environment, and safeguard our workers." 
   The Feingold resolution sets forth minimum standards for trade agreements. The resolution:
   * Calls for enforceable worker protections * Preserves the ability of the United States to enact and enforce its own trade laws * States that foreign investors should not be provided with greater rights than those provided under U.S. law * Ensures that food entering into our country meets domestic food safety standards * Preserves the ability of federal, state, and local governments to maintain essential public services and to regulate private sector services in the public interest * Requires that trade agreements contain environmental provisions * Preserves the right of federal, state, and local governments to use procurement as a policy tool, including through Buy American laws * Requires that trade negotiations and the implementation of trade agreements be conducted openly.
