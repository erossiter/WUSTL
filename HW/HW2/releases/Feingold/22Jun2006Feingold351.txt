SEN. FEINGOLD INVITES WISCONSIN FARM TECHNOLOGY DAYS PARTICIPANTS TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS
  Sen. Russ Feingold invites Wisconsin Farm Technology Days exhibitors and participants to stop by his booth, D145, to share their concerns and ideas on various agriculture issues with members of his staff. 
   "The theme for Farm Technology Days this year, "Tradition-Pride-Progress" is appropriate as this is a wonderful event that showcases the advances made in farming technology and the tradition that continues in Wisconsin farming," said Feingold. "Agriculture is an important part of Sheboygan County's economy with hundreds of family-owned farms, and businesses and industries that support the agricultural community."
   Hearing from farmers and other rural Wisconsinites about the interrelated impacts of trade policy and Farm Bill programs is especially important as the consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill begins in earnest. Feingold will continue to work to level the playing field for Wisconsin's farmers - whether it is fighting unfair trade, reforming the Federal Milk Marketing Order system or fighting to retain the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program. But with the majority of USDA programs being reconsidered, Feingold wants to hear specifics from the agricultural community on which programs work well and need to be defended versus those in need of an overhaul.
   "It is important for me to hear from Wisconsinites on these and other issues, so I invite visitors and exhibitors to stop by my booth to speak with members of my staff and share their concerns," said Feingold. "I will use this input to continue to fight to ensure that Wisconsin farmers receive fair treatment in Washington."
   This year's Farm Technology Days will be held in Sheboygan County at Quonset Farms LLP in Oostburg, W3018 Wilson-Lima Road. It runs from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 11 through Thursday, July 13.
