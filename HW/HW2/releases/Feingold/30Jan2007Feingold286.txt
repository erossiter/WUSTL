SEN. FEINGOLD INTRODUCES AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILL
  Sen. Russ Feingold has reintroduced The Affordable Housing Expansion and Public Safety Act to help increase affordable housing opportunities for low income Americans. In order to meet the housing needs of more of these families nationwide, the legislation would authorize funding for 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers and create new funding for extremely low income families within the existing HOME Investments Partnerships Program. The HOME program provides formula grants to state and local jurisdictions to produce, rehabilitate, and preserve affordable housing for low income families, and this bill would target the additional funding to families most in need. Feingold's legislation also calls for the reauthorization of the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program, a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program that provides grants to combat violent and drug-related crime in public and other federally assisted low-income housing. 
   "Many communities in Wisconsin and across our country are facing a housing affordability crisis," Feingold said. "This is an issue I have been hearing about from Wisconsinites, so I have taken this step forward to help combat the housing crisis and provide our cities and towns with the tools necessary to build, supply, and preserve affordable housing."
   Feingold's Affordable Housing Expansion and Public Safety Act would:
   * Authorize funding for 100,000 incremental Section 8 vouchers for FY2008 and their subsequent renewal and administrative fees.
   * Authorize new funding under the HOME Program to provide new home production, and rehabilitation or preservation of existing housing to some of our most vulnerable families. This new funding will offer local communities flexibility to address particular housing needs in their communities.
   * Reauthorize the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program. This important HUD program has gone unfunded for several years. It provides public housing authorities and other federally assisted low-income housing entities with the resources to hire public safety officers, make physical security improvements, sponsor crime prevention programs, and take other steps to combat violent and drug-related crime.
   * Call on Congress to create a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. More than 300 housing trust funds have been created by cities and states throughout the country. A national affordable housing trust fund would provide a dedicated source of funding for the purpose of supplying 1,500,000 additional affordable housing units over the next decade.
   "By revitalizing and expanding these effective programs, we are making a sound investment in the future of our communities, both in Wisconsin and across the country," Feingold said.
   Feingold's bill is supported by the National Low Income Housing Coalition; Wisconsin Partnership for Housing Development, Inc.; the Interfaith Hospitality Network of Madison; the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities; the City of Madison; Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council; Dane County Homeless Services Consortium; City of Milwaukee Housing Authority; and the Wisconsin Community Action Program Association.
