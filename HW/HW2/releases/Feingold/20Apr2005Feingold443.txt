SEN. FEINGOLD INTRODUCES TRUTH IN GINSENG LABELING BILL
  Sen. Russ Feingold has introduced legislation protecting both consumers and producers of ginseng.  
 The Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act, introduced by Feingold, would require that ginseng, as a raw agricultural commodity, be sold at retail with a label clearly indicating the country that the ginseng was harvested in. 
   "U.S. ginseng, and Wisconsin ginseng especially, is widely known as some of the highest quality ginseng produced anywhere in the world, making it the target of knock offs world wide," Feingold said. "Our bill aims to supply consumers with reliable labeling of ginseng so there is no confusion as to where it was grown, what quality it is, or whether it was grown using dangerous pesticides."
   Feingold introduced the bill because smugglers from Canada and Asia have labeled their ginseng product as "Wisconsin-grown," misleading consumers and undercutting domestic ginseng growers. Wisconsin ginseng commands a premium price in world markets because of its high quality and low chemical residue. Counterfeit labels and ginseng smuggling have become widespread throughout the world because of the superior quality of Wisconsin ginseng to that of ginseng grown abroad. 
   "Ninety-seven percent of America's ginseng is grown in Wisconsin including eighty-five percent grown in Marathon County alone," Feingold said. "Wisconsin ginseng producers need this protection to help maintain the dignity of Wisconsin grown ginseng. Consumers need this legislation so they are best informed about the ginseng they buy."
