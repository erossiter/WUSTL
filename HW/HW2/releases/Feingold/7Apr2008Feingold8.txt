SEN. FEINGOLD PUSHES FOR MORE ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is calling on Senate appropriators to fully fund the Low-Income Housing and Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for fiscal year 2009. Feingold is requesting $5.1 billion for LIHEAP; the Administration's budget request would only provide $2 billion, forcing states to either lower benefit amounts or assist fewer people. LIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low income families, disabled individuals, and senior citizens living on fixed incomes. The funding would help those in need cope with high energy bills by improving energy efficiency in their homes or providing them with emergency grants during waves of extremely cold or hot weather. 
   "While LIHEAP continues to go under-funded, many low-income people in Wisconsin are paying the price," Feingold said. "LIHEAP funding not only helps families cope with higher energy prices, it also improves children's health and well-being by helping to ensure that their homes are properly heated and cooled. We must provide energy assistance for families in need so no parents have to make the difficult decision between heating their home and feeding their family."
   Feingold has been a long-time champion for fully funding LIHEAP. Since 2005, Feingold has supported efforts that have led to $328 million in LIHEAP funding coming to Wisconsin. Currently for fiscal year 2008, Wisconsin will receive $17,916,977 of emergency contingency funding from LIHEAP, in addition to $69.7 million in regular funding. As the Energy Information Administration estimates electricity prices are expected to rise, the need for low-income home energy assistance is even greater than usual.
