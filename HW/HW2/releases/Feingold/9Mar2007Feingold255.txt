SEN. FEINGOLD BACKS BIPARTISAN BILL TO INCREASE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
  Sen. Russ Feingold is cosponsoring a bipartisan bill to help give children of immigrants access to higher education. Feingold is an original cosponsor of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, a bill to provide higher education opportunities for children who are long-term U.S. residents of good moral character, but who are undocumented because they were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) and has wide bipartisan support. 
   "Helping children, no matter what their background, receive a higher education is what the American dream is all about," Feingold said. "This legislation is critical to helping students with great potential receive the higher education they've earned through their hard work in school."
   The DREAM Act allows states to define residency requirements for higher education purposes and allows undocumented students who meet certain requirements to become legal permanent residents as they continue their studies or join the military. The bill also provides these students with access to federal student loans and federal work-study programs.
   "It is in all our interest that those who want to keep on learning have the ability to do so," Feingold said. "We should not punish children for their parent's actions, and we should not deny children who have worked hard the opportunity to live up to their potential."
