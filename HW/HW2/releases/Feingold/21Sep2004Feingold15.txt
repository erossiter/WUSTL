SEN. FEINGOLD SEEKS GRANTS TO HELP FARMERS IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
  Sen. Russ Feingold is seeking to give farmers access to a voluntary program that would help them identify environmental problems and come up with solutions that work for their business.  
 In a letter to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Feingold asked that a voluntary competitive grant program be authorized to provide on-farm assessments and environmental reviews for livestock operations in order to improve the quality of the nation's water resources. Existing programs have helped farmers in Wisconsin improve environmental conditions by having third-party assessors confidentially review the farming operation and provide individualized feedback.
   "These grants would be a great way to empower farmers to improve their operations and become even better stewards of the environment," Feingold said. "Our water resources are highly valued and the federal government should help farmers protect the quality of the water that we all depend on."
   Existing private programs that provide on-farm environmental reviews have addressed a number of water quality concerns and helped farmers find solutions to improve the condition of water resources. Feingold is urging the Committee to authorize federal support to these programs in order to help livestock operations become more environmentally sound.
   "Hog operations and dairy farms across the country have benefitted from private programs that offer on-farm assessments to improve environmental conditions," Feingold said. "The federal government should enable these programs through competitive grants to continue helping farmers improve both their operational efficiency and the environment."
