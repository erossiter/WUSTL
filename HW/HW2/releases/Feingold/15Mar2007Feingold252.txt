SEN. FEINGOLD PUSHES FOR ASSURED FUNDING FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is stepping up efforts to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs receives sufficient and reliable funding to care for our nation's veterans. In a letter to the Committee on Veterans Affairs, Feingold is calling for hearings to examine funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and specifically the issue of mandatory funding for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These hearings will also help Congress to properly address systemic failures at the VA and VHA. 
   "I have long supported assured funding for veterans, and Congress needs to address the need for mandatory funding as soon as possible," Feingold said.
   The VA has faced serious problems in the past because of funding shortfalls. The VA is currently facing problems because of the Administration's lack of planning for wounded servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, which has put serious strains on its resources and limited budget. Assured funding would help ensure that veterans have better access to quality care.
   "The men and women of our Armed Forces, who have served so bravely, deserve the best care possible," Feingold said. "Anything less does not do justice to the sacrifices these Americans have made for our country."
   A copy of the letter is available upon request.
