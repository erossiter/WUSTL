SEN. FEINGOLD ANNOUNCES MILWAUKEE ORGANIZATION RECEIVES GRANT FOR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold announced today that the Northwest Side Community Development Corporation (NWSCDC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin has been awarded a grant to improve the business environment for low-income communities in Milwaukee. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Community Services has awarded $677,000 to the NWSCDC. The organization will use the funding to promote economic development in the city through services such as tenant job training, business recruitment, and defraying costs of leasehold improvements for new tenants.  
   "NWSCDC has been committed to revitalizing Milwaukee's central city neighborhoods, and has been successful in creating jobs that have assisted the city's low-income residents," Feingold said. "I am pleased to have been able to help NWSCDC in its mission to improve the business environment for Milwaukee communities."
   Howard Snyder, Executive Director of NWSCDC says, "This continues a 25 year relationship with DRS Power and Controls Technologies, a great company located in the heart of Milwaukee's 30th St. Industrial Corridor. We are thrilled to have the chance to work toward rebuilding the corridor, investing in new small businesses, and linking job needy residents to these opportunities." 
   The Northwest Side Community Development Corporation is a non-profit community economic development agency that has served Milwaukee for over 15 years. For more information on NWSCDC, visit http://www.nwscdc.org/
