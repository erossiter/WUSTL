SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO EASE CROP REPORTING BURDENS ON FARMERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold, in a letter, is pressing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to expedite the development of an information management system to help farmers receive federal services like crop insurance.  
 Currently, farmers must report estimates of acreage planted to both their crop insurance agent and the Farm Service Agency, even though both are affiliated with USDA. A common information system would mean less paperwork for farmers, which, in turn, would lead to more accurate crop insurance coverage. 
   "While crop insurance is a necessity for farmers in years when Mother Nature doesn't cooperate, they shouldn't need to fight the crop insurance company because the numbers didn't exactly match," Feingold said. "If USDA could share the information between the Farm Service Agency and the Federal Crop Insurance Commission, farmers would not have this problem."
   One such problem occurs when farmers report planted acreage. Farmers must provide their crop insurance agent with acreage estimates much earlier in the year than they are required to report that same information to the Farm Service Agency. When there is a discrepancy between the reported information, insurance coverage is in question and indemnity claims can be challenged. In a letter to USDA Secretary Veneman, Feingold pushed for the expedited implementation of the information sharing program and asked what progress has been made since the 2002 legislation providing funding for the development of the system was passed.
   "With the heavy rains and tornadoes across Wisconsin this year, Wisconsin's farmers have already been through rough times," Feingold wrote in the letter. "We need to do all that we can to help farmers get the disaster assistance provided through the crop insurance program."
