SEN. FEINGOLD COSPONSORS AMENDMENT RESTORING RURAL HEALTH CARE FUNDS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is cosponsoring an amendment to the Budget Resolution to increase funding for rural health care.  
 Feingold is supporting an amendment to the 2006 budget resolution to restore funding to rural health initiatives including the Rural Access to Emergency Devices (AED) Grant program. The amendment would be paid for by reducing general government expenditures.
   "This amendment restores vital funding for rural health care programs that are stripped out in the President's proposed budget," Feingold said. "Our rural health care providers need this vital funding for programs like Rural AED grants, so they can offer people in their community the best possible care."
   Feingold has long supported rural health initiatives and has often reached across party lines to get rural health providers critical funds. Feingold, along with Senator Susan Collins, introduced the Rural AED Act, which was signed into law in 2000. 
   "Rural areas have been at a disadvantage in treating heart attack victims because of the lack of accessible AEDs and cutting funding for the program only endangers more lives," Feingold said. "I will continue to fight for increased funds for and access to AEDs. Cardiac arrest victims are in a race against time and an essential step in treating these victims is early access to defibrillation."
