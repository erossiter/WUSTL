SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON LABOR DAY 2007
  "Today is an opportunity to thank the innovative and dedicated American workers who are the bedrock of communities in Wisconsin and across the country. As they work hard to provide for their families and their communities, Congress should show a similar commitment to hard-working Americans. 
   Congress made real progress earlier this year to support Wisconsin's working families with the first increase of the federal minimum wage in ten years. But this is just a first step. Congress must support the right of workers to form and join unions, protect the safety of workers on the job, and keep fighting unfair trade agreements that send American jobs overseas. We also have to reform our broken health care system, strengthen public education, make housing more affordable, and address the many other issues that affect hard-working families. American workers have built this nation's prosperity, and we should take time this Labor Day to honor them, and to recognize how much they contribute to the strength of this great nation."
