BALANCING THE BOOKS TOPS SEN. FEINGOLD'S GOALS FOR SENATE BUDGET
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is putting balancing the books at the top of his priority list as the Senate Budget Committee takes up the budget for fiscal year 2009 today. Feingold, a committee member, also listed several other goals including making sure local law enforcement is adequately funded, increasing the annual Pell Grant award, targeting waste, fraud, and abuse in defense contracts, and supporting programs to help lower income Americans afford housing. 
   "The administration's policies have put us in a sinkhole which will take a serious commitment to fiscal discipline to get out of," Feingold said. "The President inherited a huge budget surplus, but he will leave office with four trillion dollars in debt added to the backs of future generations. We must return to the sound fiscal practices of the 1990s if we want any chance of balancing the books in the near future."
   In addition to balancing the books, Feingold will focus on:
   * Helping local law enforcement - Senator Feingold supports full funding of the COPS and Byrne grant programs to help get local law enforcement agencies the tools they need to keep our communities safe. The president's budget proposed eliminating these programs at a time when many violent crime rates across the country, including in Wisconsin, are rising at alarming levels. The COPS Grant program helps train new officers and invests in new technologies. The Byrne Grant program assists in the fight against violent and drug related crimes.
   * Sending more Americans to college - Senator Feingold is working with a bipartisan group of Senators in support of increasing the annual Pell Grant award. Over 30 years ago, the maximum Pell Grant award covered approximately 80 percent of the cost attending a four-year public college. Currently, the maximum Pell Grant award covers approximately 33 percent of those costs.
   * Supporting housing assistance programs - Senator Feingold has been a leader in pushing for adequate funding for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program to fund all the vouchers currently in use and to fund as many new Section 8 vouchers as possible this year.
   * Curbing wasteful spending on defense contracts - Senator Feingold intends to offer an amendment to the budget resolution to curb wasteful defense spending. The office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, which Feingold helped create, has found tens of billions of dollars of waste in reconstruction spending. Feingold's amendment is a continuation of his work to ensure American taxpayer dollars are used as effectively and efficiently as possible in Iraq reconstruction projects.
