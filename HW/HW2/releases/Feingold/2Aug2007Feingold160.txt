SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold on passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization: 
   "Today is a very good day for the nearly 100,000 Wisconsinites who depend on the BadgerCare program. With the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) reauthorization, we are one step closer to strengthening BadgerCare so even more Wisconsin families can stay healthy. As health care costs skyrocket and the number of uninsured rises, strengthening BadgerCare will ensure that many more Wisconsin families will have access to the healthcare they deserve."

   "We need to wiretap terrorists, and we should address the problem that has been identified with FISA with respect to foreign-to-foreign communications. But the administration's overly broad proposal goes far beyond that and would leave critical decisions related to surveillance involving Americans entirely up to the Attorney General. The proposal from the Democratic leadership is better and involves FISA court review from the start. But it does not have adequate safeguards to protect Americans' privacy. The bill should also include a 90-day sunset to ensure Congress has the chance to identify and fix any problems with this new proposal."
