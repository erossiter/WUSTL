SEN. FEINGOLD ANNOUNCES WISCONSIN TO RECEIVE FUNDING TO IMPROVE HISTORY EDUCATION
  Sen. Russ Feingold announced that Wisconsin has been awarded funding to help improve history education. Wisconsin will receive $998,158 from the U.S. Department of Education for the Cooperative Educational Service Agency Region 6 (CESA 6) as part of the Teaching American History (TAH) grant program. The program assists more than 42 public school districts in the state. In February 2007, Feingold wrote a letter of support for CESA 6, which will use the grant to provide specialized training in U.S. history for Wisconsin teachers. 
   "I applaud CESA 6 for working to help teachers give their students a greater appreciation of U.S. history," Feingold said. "This funding will help teachers in Wisconsin develop new methods for teaching American history. A good understanding of our country's history can help our children become more involved, informed citizens."
   The funding awarded to CESA 6 will provide specialized U.S. history training and professional development activities to 60 teachers for grades 4-12. The goal of the TAH program is to improve U.S. history instruction in area schools. Teachers will attend workshops over the summer at the Wisconsin Historical Society, among other locations, and will also go to several seminars throughout the year to further develop their lesson plans.
   Michael Derr of CESA 6 stated, "The employees of CESA 6 are thrilled to have an opportunity to provide professional development for our local history teachers. This project will feature wonderful opportunities to work with local Wisconsin museums and historical societies."
