SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S REMARKS ON FISA EXPANSION
  "Americans are no longer buying the fear-mongering this administration continues to employ in its efforts to consolidate as much power as possible in the executive branch. Congress must fix the Protect America Act to address the fundamental flaws in that new law: the lack of meaningful court involvement, the lack of privacy protections for the communications of law-abiding Americans, and inadequate congressional and administrative oversight. Congress now has the chance to get this legislation right, so we can go after terrorists without sacrificing the privacy of ordinary Americans."
