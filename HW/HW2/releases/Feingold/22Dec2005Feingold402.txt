SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTED PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Russ Feingold announced today that several provisions he authored were included in the final version of the Defense Department policy bill passed by the Senate yesterday.  
 The bill now heads to the President for signature. The Feingold-supported provisions put in the Defense authorization bill include:
   * Extending permanently the travel benefits for the loved ones of injured servicemembers injured in battle 
   * Authorizing portions of Senator Feingold's Veterans Enhanced Transition Services (VETS) Act to help troops returning home from active duty transition back to civilian life 
   * Requiring DOD to report on all it is doing to clearly communicate its stop loss policy to new recruits and those who re-enlist 
   * Requiring the Department of Defense to report annually on its funding plans for critical equipment to ensure that serious deficiencies such as those documented in a recent GAO report are addressed. 
   "I am pleased that these important provisions have been included in the final version of the Defense authorization bill," Feingold said. "I have worked hard to ensure our troops receive the support they need both when they are on the front lines and when they return home. Common sense measures like assisting our returning troops with the transition from military to civilian life, helping family members travel to the bedside of loved ones injured in combat, calling for clarity from the Defense Department on its stop loss policy, and making sure our troops are being provided with the best equipment will help give our men and women in uniform the support they so profoundly deserve."
