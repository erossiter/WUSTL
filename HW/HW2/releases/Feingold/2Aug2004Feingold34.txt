SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR ALL VETERANS
  Sen. Russ Feingold and 33 of his Senate colleagues have urged the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to rescind its ban on the enrollment of Priority 8 or "middle-income" veterans into the VA health care system. Unfortunately, by banning this group of veterans from enrolling, the VA will cause approximately 522,000 veterans to be shut out from receiving VA care by next year. In a letter to VA Secretary Anthony Principi, the Senators note that the country's hundreds of thousands of veterans have the reasonable expectation to be eligible for timely, quality VA health care after fulfilling their service to their country.  
   "Our men and women in uniform put themselves under enormous strain and in harm's way on behalf of the nation and it only makes sense to help repay them with access to VA health care," Feingold said. "We should be doing all we can to make sure that the man and woman who served this country so courageously have access to the health care benefits they have earned."
   According to the 2002 Veterans Health Administration Survey of Veteran Enrollees, 90 percent of Priority 8 veterans have private health insurance and consequently do not place any real financial burden on the VA health care system. The letter also points out that the VA-Health and Human Services "Medicare Advantage" program slated to begin in September 2003, which will allow Medicare-eligible Priority Group 8 veterans to have access to the VA health care system, has yet to begin, thus further limiting the ability of these veterans to gain access to their VA health benefits. 
   "We are committed to providing sufficient funding for VA health care so that all veterans have access to the system created to serve them," the letter read. "We urge you to send the message to our troops that they will all be taken care of when they come home by again opening the VA health care system to all veterans."
