SENS. MCCAIN, FEINGOLD ISSUE STATEMENT ON FEC'S DELAY OF RULING ON 527 GROUPS
  Today Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI), issued the following statement on the FEC's delay of ruling on 527 groups: 
   "Today the FEC proved, once again, why it is necessary to fundamentally restructure that ineffective and irresponsible bureaucracy. By refusing to take action today on the soft money activities of 527 groups, the Commission has failed to close a loophole that dangerously undermines the purpose of the federal campaign finance laws. As a result, a flood of soft money will enter the system which will violate the letter and the spirit of the law. The FEC has fundamentally weakened a law it is charged to enforce and has thereby betrayed its very purpose.
   "We congratulate commissioners Scott Thomas and Michael Toner for their proposal and for their efforts to have the FEC take the proper steps today to stop soft money from flowing once again into federal elections."
