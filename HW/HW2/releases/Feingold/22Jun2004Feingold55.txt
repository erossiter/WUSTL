SEN. FEINGOLD COMMEMORATES 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF WILDERNESS ACT
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) has introduced a resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act.  
 Feingold was joined by a bipartisan group of Senators, including Sens. John Sununu (R-NH) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE), in introducing the resolution, which commemorates the Wilderness Act being signed into law on September 3, 1964. The original Wilderness Act was introduced by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN) and Rep. John Saylor (R-PA) and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson. Wisconsin Sens. Gaylord Nelson and Bill Proxmire were cosponsors of the original act. The act is essential in preserving and protecting wild areas through the National Wilderness Preservation System.
   "From Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, Americans have treated our wilderness as an intrinsic part of our culture," Feingold said. "I am honored to be able to introduce this resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act, which, each year, protects more and more of our cherished lands."
   The Wilderness Act was instrumental in recognizing the United States' natural heritage as a resource of value that should be protected. When first enacted in 1964, nine million acres were protected by Congress. Currently, over 104 million acres have been preserved.
   "The concept of wilderness is inextricably linked with Wisconsin," Feingold said. "Wisconsin has produced great thinkers and leaders in the wilderness movement such as Senator Gaylord Nelson, writer and conservationist Aldo Leopold, Sierra Club founder John Muir, and Wilderness Society leader Sigurd Olson. Through the hard work of these Wisconsinites and people from all over the country and across the political spectrum, we are preserving our treasured wild places for future generations."
