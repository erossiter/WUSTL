SEN. FEINGOLD ADVOCATES FOR PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is part of a bipartisan effort pushing for more funding for the Fire Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act and the Staffing Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Act. In a letter to appropriators, Feingold and his Senate colleagues stressed that the nation's firefighters deserve the best equipment, training and personnel to do their jobs. The president's budget seeks to cut funding for the FIRE Act by 46 percent and eliminate the SAFER Act altogether. 
   "Initiatives like the FIRE Act and the SAFER Act help make sure our nation's fire departments are the strongest and most prepared that they can be to protect our communities," Feingold said. "Congress must support these programs, which are vital to our homeland security."
   Over the past four years, the FIRE Act has helped provide assistance for over 20,000 fire departments in all fifty states. The resources have helped fire departments obtain better equipment and improve firefighter training. The SAFER Act helps fire departments hire new firefighters - both paid and volunteer. According to the National Fire Protection Association, 75 percent of fire departments lack the number of personnel necessary to fight fires and effectively respond to other emergencies.
   "Our firefighters are first-rate and they risk their lives each and every day to ensure our safety," the Senators wrote. "Like our troops overseas, they deserve the best equipment, best training, and best number [of] personnel to do their jobs."
