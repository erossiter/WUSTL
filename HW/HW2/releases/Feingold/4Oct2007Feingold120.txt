SENS FEINGOLD, OBAMA COMMENT ON NOMINATION OF HANS VON SPAKOVSKY
  Statement of U.S. Senators Russ Feingold and Barack Obama 
  On the Nomination of Hans von Spakovsky
   "While at the Department of Justice, Hans von Spakovsky was directly involved in efforts to politicize the Department and use the Voting Rights Section to disenfranchise voters, rather than enforce our nation's civil rights laws. As a recess appointee to the FEC he has been a committed, ideological opponent of the campaign finance laws he is supposed to enforce. Putting him at the head of the FEC is just another example of this administration putting the fox in charge of the hen house. We oppose his nomination, and any effort to tie his nomination to the other pending nominations to the FEC."
