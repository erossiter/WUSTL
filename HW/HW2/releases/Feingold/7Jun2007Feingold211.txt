SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO ENSURE VETERANS, SERVICEMEMBERS RECEIVE QUALITY CARE
  Sen. Russ Feingold is introducing legislation to help servicemembers and veterans receive the quality health care and benefits they deserve. The Veterans Advocacy Act of 2007 would provide grants to veterans' advocacy organizations that provide legal assistance at no charge to those who have served, or currently serve, in our Armed Forces. 
   "The range of administrative and legal hurdles injured servicemembers face when they return home is unacceptable," Feingold said. "Congress has a responsibility to aid our nation's heroes in overcoming these hurdles."
   This bill will help provide veterans and servicemembers with independent, experienced advocates who can ensure that the military and VA properly evaluate, treat, and compensate people who have disabilities resulting from military service. By fostering the growth of the existing network of advocates, this bill will also ease the caseload of overburdened service officers.
   "The appalling situation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. demonstrated why our veterans and servicemembers need outside advocates," Feingold said. "This legislation is a simple solution to help those who sacrificed so much for our nation get the care they have more than earned."
