SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO ENSURE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR WISCONSIN
  Sen. Russ Feingold is working to ensure that all Wisconsinites have safe drinking water.  
 Feingold is part of a bipartisan group of Senators asking the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Development to increase funding for the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Revolving Funds. The revolving funds help states and local communities restore the health and safety of our nation's waters, meet water quality standards, and create jobs. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there will be a $535 billion gap between current spending and projected needs for infrastructure over the next 20 years if additional investments are not made.
   "The ongoing problems with naturally occurring radium and arsenic in the drinking water in over 70 communities across the state, including towns like Waukesha, Fond du Lac, and Algoma, underscore the immediate need for water infrastructure funding," Feingold said. "Municipal utilities across the state are in dire need of resources to upgrade their water infrastructure facilities."
   Discharges from aging and failing sewage systems, urban storm water and other sources pose serious threats to the nation's waters, endangering public health, as well as fishing and recreation industries. Population growth and development also place stress on the nation's water infrastructure. 
   "Safe drinking water should be the expectation of all Americans no matter where they live," Feingold said. "The federal government has a longstanding commitment to ensure that every citizen's basic need for clean and safe drinking water is met."
