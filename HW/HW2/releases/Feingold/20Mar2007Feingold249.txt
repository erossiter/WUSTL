SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTS BILL OF RIGHTS FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is standing up for the rights of airline passengers by cosponsoring the bipartisan Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act, introduced by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME). The bill would allow passengers to safely deplane if a plane sits on a runway for more than three hours. The bill also would mandate that food, water, and adequate restroom facilities are provided to passengers during a delay. The legislation was introduced following storms in February that left some airline passengers across the country stranded for up to 11 hours in some instances. 
   "Many of us have had air travel experiences we'd like to forget, but nobody should have to be stranded on a runway for hours on end," Feingold said. "While we can't do anything about the weather, we can make sure that airline passengers are not subjected to the terrible conditions we witnessed last month."
   While some airlines have voluntary codes of conduct and these incidents are not the norm, there are currently no government regulations addressing the amount of time passengers can be kept on a plane. The legislation Feingold is cosponsoring provides flexibility if the pilot determines the plane will take off less than 30 minutes after the three hour limit or if deplaning will endanger the safety of the passengers.
   "While the airlines have taken some positive steps on their own, passengers should not have to wade through each airline's fine print to find out what rights they have when they board a commercial airliner," Feingold said. "This bill is fair to both the airline industry and the countless Americans who depend on airline travel."
