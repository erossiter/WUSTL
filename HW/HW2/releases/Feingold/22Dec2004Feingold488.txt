SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO RELEASE LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Russ Feingold is urging the President to release the $300 million in emergency Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding provided in the omnibus spending bill passed by Congress last month.  
 LIHEAP helps low-income Americans cope with rising energy prices that disproportionately burden those who are also struggling to pay for higher food, housing and health costs. Along with a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues, Sen. Feingold sent a letter to President Bush asking that the emergency funds be released as record high prices for oil are driving up natural gas and propane costs this winter.
   "Congress has provided emergency funding to help low-income Americans stay warm this winter and I urge the President to make sure these funds get to the people who need them as soon as possible," Feingold said. "High energy prices are causing a crisis for low-income families in Wisconsin and throughout the nation. These LIHEAP funds are essential in helping families disproportionately burdened by skyrocketing energy costs."
   The current rise in energy prices, along with energy debt remaining from last winter, are leading to increases in utility disconnections and consumer debt. Emergency funding is needed immediately to help low-income families and seniors restore disconnected utility services and to obtain affordable heat for their homes. 
   "Families are facing an energy emergency that requires an immediate response," the letter read. "Without emergency assistance, these families will face impossible choices this winter: whether to heat their homes or eat; whether to buy prescription drugs or pay their electricity bill; or whether to pay their rent or mortgage or buy heating oil to stay warm."
