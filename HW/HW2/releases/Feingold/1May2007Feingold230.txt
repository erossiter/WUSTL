SEN. FEINGOLD ON 4TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT DECLARING 'MISSION ACCOMPLISHED'
  "The four-year anniversary of "mission accomplished" comes on the heels of one of the deadliest months since our invasion of Iraq. The anniversary reminds us that we shouldn't give credence to an Administration that has made such disastrous mistakes in Iraq. Congress should listen to the American people and not an Administration that has been so wrong, and so dishonest, so many times. The President should acknowledge the will of the American people and sign the Iraq spending bill Congress is sending him today.
