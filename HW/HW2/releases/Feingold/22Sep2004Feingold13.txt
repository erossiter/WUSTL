SEN. FEINGOLD PUSHES FOR EMERGENCY FUNDS TO HELP COMBAT HIGH ENERGY COSTS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is calling on Senate appropriators to set aside emergency funds for low-income families struggling to afford the increasing costs of home energy.  
 In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Feingold joined a bipartisan group of 30 senators that is concerned that rising energy prices disproportionately burden low-income Americans who are also struggling to pay for higher food, housing and health costs. The senators ask that the funding be included in one of the upcoming appropriations bills since there are not many opportunities remaining to address this issue before the arrival of winter.
   "Wisconsinites, as well as citizens all over the nation, are facing record energy costs this winter," Feingold said. "We need to provide this crucial funding to ensure that our seniors and low-income families stay warm this winter."
   According to the Energy Information Administration, the prices of natural gas, oil, and propane will all increase this winter. Compared to average heating costs from 1998 to 2000, expenditures for natural gas, heating oil and propane will all rise 49, 48, and 38 percent respectively. The emergency funding is needed to help low-income families and seniors restore disconnected utility service before the start of winter heating season and to ensure affordable heat for their homes. In Wisconsin alone, tens of thousands of people have been disconnected by their energy providers because they are unable to pay high energy costs.
   "Without emergency assistance, these families will face impossible choices this winter between heating their homes or eating, or buying prescription drugs, or paying their rent or mortgage," the letter read. "Unfortunately, these are the real choices that face low-income families, disabled Americans and seniors when energy prices are unaffordable."
