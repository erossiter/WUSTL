SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON U.S. DISTRICT COURT DECISION DECLARING PARTS OF USA PATRIOT ACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL
  Today, following a U.S. District Court decision striking down parts of the USA Patriot Act, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold released the following statement: 
   "The federal court decision declaring the statute unconstitutional comes as no surprise. The Justice Department's Inspector General has already found that the NSL authorities have been seriously abused by the government, and now a federal court has found parts of those authorities unconstitutional. Congress needs to fix the mess it created when it gave the government overly-broad powers to obtain sensitive information about Americans."
   Feingold was the lone U.S. Senator to oppose the USA Patriot Act in 2001. In 2005, during reauthorization of the bill, Feingold fought to fix flaws in the original bill but ultimately voted against the legislation because it did not do enough to protect the rights and freedoms of law-abiding Americans.
