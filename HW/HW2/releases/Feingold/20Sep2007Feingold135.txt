SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEINGOLD-REID AMENDMENT
  "I am pleased that the Senate leadership cosponsored and strongly supported this amendment and that, once again, the majority of Democrats supported ending the President's flawed Iraq policy. The time to safely redeploy our troops from Iraq is now, and I will not relent until it happens. A vote against Feingold-Reid was a vote to continue the President's disastrous Iraq policy. Every day that the Congress fails to act, our brave troops remain in harm's way, and our national security continues to be undermined."
