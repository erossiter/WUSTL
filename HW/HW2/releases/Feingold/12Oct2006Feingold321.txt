SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR COPS IN SCHOOLS PROGRAM
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) today joined a number of his Senate colleagues in calling for funding for the COPS in Schools Program to be restored for the current fiscal year. The letter was sent to Sens. Richard Shelby and Barbara Mikulski, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies. The COPS in Schools program, originally implemented in the wake of the 1999 tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, provides officers with specialized training to help them prevent and deal with school violence. The President's budget proposal has provided no funding for this program for five years in a row, and Congress eliminated funding for the program in 2006. The program's services are vital to creating a safe learning atmosphere for our nation's schoolchildren, teachers, and administrators.  
   "The tragic incidents of school violence we have seen in recent weeks only confirm the need for this program," Feingold said. "Congress needs to consider the safety of our children and teachers and provide the necessary funding for this program."
   The letter, led by Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), was sent in light of recent school tragedies, including incidents in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. Since its creation, the COPS in Schools Program has deployed more than 6,424 School Resource Officers in schools nationwide. The officers are specially trained to operate in schools, to utilize community policing techniques to prevent violence, and to ensure a rapid, coordinated response if an incident does occur. 
   "With the tight budgets faced by local school boards and local law enforcement, the federal government must do what it can to help protect the health and safety our children," Feingold said. "No child should have to fear for his or her safety at school."
