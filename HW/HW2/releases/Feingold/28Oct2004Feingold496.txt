SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO KEEP FUNDING FOR LIFESAVING DEVICES FOR RURAL AREAS
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is calling on Senate appropriators to retain the $9.9 million appropriated for the Rural Access to Emergency Devices (AED) Act as the Senate and House negotiate the fiscal year 2005 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. Feingold and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) co-authored the Rural AED Act, which became law in 2000. The Rural AED program helps smaller communities with limited budgets obtain automated external defibrillators, as well as the necessary training to operate them, which could help prevent deaths in the event of cardiac arrest. In a letter to the Senate conferees, Feingold and Collins ask that they do all they can to maintain the full amount of funding allocated by the Senate in the final conference report. 
   "Heart attack victims in rural communities find themselves in greater danger because of the lack of access to defibrillators," Feingold said. "The more we do to increase access to these devices in the critical moments after a cardiac arrest, the more lives we can save."
   According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard equipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency vehicles and getting these devices into more public places could save more than 50,000 lives a year. Since its passage, the Rural AED Act has provided over $30 million to rural first responders from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under a competitive grant program. However, Congress has failed to fully fund the program.
   "These devices now stand ready to save lives that would otherwise have been lost," the letter read. "Still, the need for greater, rapid access to defibrillation is far from met in the vast majority of our rural communities. We urge you to do all you can to keep at least this level of funding in the final conference report."
