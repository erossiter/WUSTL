SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  Martin Luther King Jr. Day
   "I join all Americans in honoring the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His lifelong fight to protect the civil rights of Americans has been an inspiration for people around the world to stand up and speak out against injustice. We must redouble our efforts to address the lingering inequities that Dr. King fought so hard against. In a year when we will elect a new president, we are reminded of the tremendous struggle for voting rights that Dr. King helped to lead. And we are reminded that the fight for voting rights - like so many things he fought for - isn't over yet. To ensure that every American has access to the ballot box, we have to put an end to deceptive practices and voter intimidation that poison the democratic process and undermine the hard-won gains of the civil rights movement. To truly honor Dr. King's legacy, we must keep moving forward with that same commitment to justice, that same dedication to a better America, that Dr. King showed us every day of his life."
