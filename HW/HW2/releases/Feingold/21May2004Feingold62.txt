SENS. FEINGOLD, KOHL PUSH FOR FUNDING TO ENSURE SMOOTH HMONG RESETTLEMENT
  Sens. Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl are pushing for additional funding to help smooth the resettlement process for Hmong refugees from Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand. Feingold, Kohl, and a group of their Senate colleagues sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education asking for additional funds for the Office of Refugee Resettlement because of the difficult challenges that resettlement of the refugees will bring. Many of the refugees have suffered from malnutrition, and approximately half of the children have never received schooling while living at Wat Tham Krabok. Additional funding will be needed to address these problems upon resettlement. The majority of these 15,000 Hmong refugees, many of whom fought alongside American forces during the Vietnam War, are expected to settle in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and California. 
   "The harsh conditions that the Hmong refugees have experienced in Thailand and the challenges they will face in resettlement in the U.S. necessitate resources to make their transition as painless as possible, " Feingold said. "We need to make sure that resources are available for the well being of the refugees, as well as for the communities in which they resettle." 
   "We need to move forward with great foresight and set aside sufficient resources for the resettlement of the Hmong refugees from Wat Tham Krabok. We need to do this properly, so that our communities and the refugees alike will be well served. We will work throughout the budget process to secure this important funding," Kohl said. 
   Without proper funding, the resources in the communities where they resettle might be strained beyond capacity. In the letter to the Subcommittee, the Senators say that most of the Hmong have limited education and literacy, and half of the refugees are under 14 and will require schooling.
