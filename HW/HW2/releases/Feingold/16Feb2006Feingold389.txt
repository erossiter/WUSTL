FEINGOLD BLASTS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Russ Feingold released the following statement this afternoon following the Intelligence Committee Meeting. 
   "The Intelligence Committee's failure today to begin an investigation of the administration's illegal domestic surveillance program is inexcusable. The Senate Committee charged with conducting oversight of intelligence matters has a responsibility to look more deeply into the President's illegal secret wiretapping of Americans. The President has broken the law and Congress needs to hold him accountable."
