SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  "Attorney General Gonzales' tenure was marked by unprecedented politicization of the Department of Justice, deception of Congress and the American people, and disrespect for the rule of law. He should never have been confirmed and should have resigned long ago. The first loyalty of the next attorney general must be to the law, not the president."
   U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
