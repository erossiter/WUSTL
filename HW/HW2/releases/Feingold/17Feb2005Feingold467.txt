SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO HELP DISPLACED WORKERS TRAIN FOR IN-DEMAND CAREERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is introducing legislation to help displaced workers retrain for jobs in the health care sector.  
 The Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act would help communities provide funding for programs to retrain interested displaced workers for different types of health professions, from lab technicians to nurses. The health care industry is in need of workers as it prepares for the health care needs of the aging baby-boomer generation. This opportunity offers people who lost their jobs in the manufacturing and service sectors an opportunity to train in a field with relative job security. According to the Wisconsin Hospital Association, 15 of the 30 fastest growing occupations in the state are in health care.
   "We need to find the resources to help job seekers get the training they need to be successful," Feingold said. "This bill would help those communities that have been hit hard by job losses, and also do not have enough health professionals to keep their communities healthy."
   According to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Wisconsin has lost nearly 80,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, while the administration has continued to support the outsourcing of American jobs, specifically in the service sector. Feingold is supporting the efforts of the country's workforce development system, especially in Wisconsin, to provide innovative solutions to retrain laid-off workers and other job seekers despite a strain in resources. 
   "Two concerns I consistently hear about from the people of Wisconsin are the shipping of tens of thousands of manufacturing and service jobs overseas, and the need for more quality health care," Feingold said. "This bill is a small step toward ensuring that our workers have the necessary training in high-demand fields to compete in the new economy."
