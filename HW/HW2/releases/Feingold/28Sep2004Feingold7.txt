NATIONAL FARMERS UNION PRAISES SEN. FEINGOLD'S WORK FOR FAMILY FARMERS
  Sen. Feingold has been given the Golden Triangle Award by the National Farmers Union (NFU) for his service to family farmers.  
 The Golden Triangle Award is the highest honor given by the NFU and is given to lawmakers who demonstrate leadership on issues affecting American farmers. NFU recognized Feingold for his work in favor of mandatory country-of-origin labeling, as well as fairer trade and policy initiatives for all agricultural producers, particularly dairy farmers. 
   "I am honored to receive this award from the hardworking farmers that Wisconsin and this nation are so proud of," Feingold said. "Farmers are the backbone of Wisconsin, and they play a vital role in the state's economy. I will continue to support measures like country-of-origin-labeling for American agricultural products and oppose trade agreements that are bad deals for our nation's farmers."
   "The Golden Triangle Award is the highest award given to legislators for their work on behalf of family farmers," said Sue Beitlich, President of the Wisconsin Farmers Union. "Sen. Feingold provides great leadership in Washington for Wisconsin's family farmers. He has spearheaded and supported legislation in the Senate that Wisconsin Farmers Union members greatly appreciate."
   Feingold has been a strong advocate for country-of-origin-labeling throughout his time in the Senate. Country-of-origin-labeling would add value to products raised by family farmers and give consumers much-needed information about the origin of the foods they buy for their families. Feingold has also adamantly fought against trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement (USFTA), that harm this nation's farmers. Earlier this year, Feingold helped lead the opposition to the USFTA because of the dire consequences it could have on American dairy farmers by allowing a flood of imports from Australia.
