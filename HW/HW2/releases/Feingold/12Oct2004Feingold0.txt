SENATE PASSES SEN. FEINGOLD-SUPPORTED BILL BRINGING MORE DOCTORS TO WISCONSIN
  The Senate has passed legislation cosponsored by Sen. Russ Feingold that will help states, including Wisconsin, bring physicians to medically underserved areas.  
 The Conrad State 30 bill will extend the State 30 program. This program allows states to sponsor foreign physicians who are attending training or other graduate programs in the U.S. for visas in return for these physicians practicing for at least three years in medically underserved areas. The bipartisan bill extends the program, which expired last May, for two years. Currently, the U.S. government designates 107 areas in Wisconsin as medically underserved.
   "The State 30 program is an excellent way to bring local health care to people who desperately need it," Feingold said. "This bill offers an effective solution to help curb the shrinking number of primary care physicians." 
   According to the Wisconsin Hospital Association and the Wisconsin Medical Society, Wisconsin has a shortage of 506 primary care physicians, a number that will only increase over the next ten years. As a result of physician shortages, many residents forgo primary care that they need because of the lengthy travel to the nearest doctor, or because of long waits.
   "Many Wisconsinites are missing out on the care they need because of the long distances they have to travel to receive primary care or the long waits they face when they get there," Feingold said. "By bringing these qualified physicians to areas that need them most, we can ensure that more people in underserved areas of Wisconsin and across the country receive the care they deserve."
