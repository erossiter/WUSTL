SEN. FEINGOLD ANNOUNCES MILWAUKEE ORGANIZATION RECEIVES GRANT TO HELP CHILD MENTORING SERVICES
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold announced today that the New Concept Self Development Center (NCSDC) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin has been awarded a grant to provide mentoring services for children of incarcerated parents. The Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Children, Youth and Families has awarded $162,500 to the NCSDC. Other services provided by the NCSDC include referral services and crisis counseling, mental health services, group services for teens, and in-school life skills training. In May 2007, Feingold wrote a letter of support for the NCSDC's grant request.  
   "Positive intervention is very important in helping these children, who face such trying circumstances," Feingold writes. "I applaud NCSDC's commitment to serving those most at risk in Milwaukee's community and I'm happy I was able to help in that effort."
   Vanessa Key, CEO of NCSDC said, "Our youth of today face greater challenges than those growing up in the 80's and 90's. The agency's comprehensive approach to service delivery will be greatly impacted by the implementation of services to mentor children of incarcerated parents.
   The New Concept Self Development Center is a non-profit comprehensive human services agency that has served Milwaukee for over 32 years. For more information on the NCSDC, visit http://www.ncsdc-inc.org/
