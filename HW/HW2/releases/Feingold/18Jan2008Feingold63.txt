SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON SUDANESE PRESIDENT'S APPOINTMENT OF JANJAWEED LEADER AS SPECIAL ADVISOR
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  On the Sudanese President's Appointment of Janjaweed Leader as Special Advisor
   "I am gravely concerned by reports that Sudanese president Omar Hassan Al-Bashir has appointed Musa Hilal as a special advisor to the Sudanese government. Hilal has been individually sanctioned by the UN Security Council and by President Bush, and is on the State Department list of suspected war criminals because of his suspected leadership of the Janjaweed militia, which has committed horrific violence against Sudanese civilians in Darfur. If this appointment goes through, the Sudanese government will have taken an unequivocal step in the wrong direction, once again signaling its support for a terror campaign that has claimed more than 200,000 lives and forced nearly 3 million Darfuris from their homes. The Bush Administration and broader international community must speak out against such an outrageous appointment."
