REP. FEINGOLD URGES LEADERSHIP TO PASS ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is calling on the Senate Majority Leader to ensure that a bill to adequately fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is passed during the November session.  
 LIHEAP helps low-income Americans cope with rising energy prices that disproportionately burden those who are also struggling to pay for higher food, housing and health costs. Sen. Feingold joined a group of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) asking that the bill reauthorizing LIHEAP, which was introduced with bipartisan support last month, be taken up and passed by the Senate.
   "It is my hope that Senate leadership takes advantage of this opportunity to adequately fund the LIHEAP program, which lower-income residents may need during harsh winters," Feingold said.
   The Energy Information Administration forecasts a sharp increase in heating costs this winter. The costs for oil heat will increase by more than $400 compared to one year ago. Homes relying on propane are expected to pay $1,443 this winter, a 26 percent increase compared to last year. Authorization for critically important LIHEAP funding expires at the end of fiscal year 2004.
   "The country is about to head into a cold winter with high fuel costs," the letter read. "This may be the Senate's last opportunity to act before the onset of severely cold weather. Constituents facing this winter's high heating bills deserve our help."
