SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE OPEN-ENDED, MASSIVE MILITARY ENGAGEMENT IN IRAQ
  "While the Administration tries to talk up its troop escalation in Iraq, it has little to say about the threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates worldwide. The al Qaeda-connected bombings in North Africa two weeks ago went virtually unnoticed by the Administration. Meanwhile, our brave troops are bogged down in the middle of an Iraqi civil war that has no end in sight. We need a global strategy to defeat the terrorist networks that threaten this country, not an open-ended, massive military engagement in Iraq."
