WISCONSIN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION BACKS GOVERNOR'S REQUEST FOR FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION
  All ten members of Wisconsin's Congressional Delegation have joined together to urge U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to act quickly on Gov. Doyle's request for federal disaster declarations for 19 counties that have sustained significant crop losses due to the continuing moderate, severe and even extreme drought across much of Northern and Central Wisconsin.  
   "It is urgent that Secretary Johanns approve Governor Doyle's request to get Wisconsin's farmers the federal disaster assistance they need," said Senator Russ Feingold. "Agriculture in Wisconsin generates over $50 billion a year, and without immediate action, our farmers and our state's economy could suffer."
   "Over a million acres in Wisconsin have already been affected by the drought, with losses topping 60% for many crops, and the economic impact from that will be felt by the entire state. Which is why Wisconsin's Congressional Delegation has spoken, with one voice, to make clear to Secretary Johanns that we need to act quickly to get Wisconsin's farmers what help we can before it's too late," added Seventh District Congressman Dave Obey (D-WI).
   Senator Herb Kohl (D-WI), Fifth District Congressmen Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), Sixth District Congressman Tom Petri (R-WI), Third District Congressman Ron Kind (D-WI), Second District Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Eighth District Congressman Mark Green (R-WI), First District Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), and Fourth District Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-WI) joined with Feingold and Obey to urge Secretary Johanns to accelerate the process for a federal disaster declaration for the Wisconsin counties affected by the drought. 
   Warning that the intensity and area of damage could increase as the season continues, the Delegation also urged Secretary Johanns to expedite any additional requests for disaster designations presented by the State of Wisconsin in response to the ongoing drought.
