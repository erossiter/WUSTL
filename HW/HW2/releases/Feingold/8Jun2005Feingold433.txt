SEN. FEINGOLD RESPONDS TO SECRET SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS ON PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Russ Feingold today released the following statement in response to the Senate Intelligence Committee's actions on the PATRIOT Act late yesterday.  
   "I am deeply concerned about the Intelligence Committee's actions late yesterday. We should not be expanding government powers behind closed doors. The Administration hasn't made the case that it needs any new authority, yet the Intelligence Committee reportedly wants to give the government unprecedented investigative powers. Its bill apparently contains provisions that may be far worse than anything we saw in the Patriot Act. I commend my colleagues who voted against this bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee can repair the damage. 
   The Committee should end its cloak-and-dagger routine and release the text of its bill. The American people have a right to know exactly what the Committee has done to compromise Americans' civil liberties and privacy rights."
   Last month, Feingold was joined by cosponsors of the SAFE Act, bipartisan legislation that fixes portions of the PATRIOT Act, in urging the Intelligence Committee to conduct its proceedings on this issue in an open forum. Unfortunately, it ignored that request. A copy of the bipartisan letter is available upon request.
