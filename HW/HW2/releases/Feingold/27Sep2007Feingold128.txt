SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ON SENATE PASSAGE OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  "The Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization passed by the Senate today is vital to ensuring Wisconsin's popular BadgerCare program continues to keep thousands of families healthy. BadgerCare helps nearly 67,000 Wisconsin families receive preventative and primary health care. I hope the president recognizes how important this bipartisan CHIP legislation is to families in Wisconsin and all over the country and drops his threat to veto it."
