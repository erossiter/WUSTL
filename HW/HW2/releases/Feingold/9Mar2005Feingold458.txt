SENS. FEINGOLD, KOHL OPPOSE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO PLACE TOLL ON GREAT LAKES TRAFFIC
  Sens. Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl are part of a bipartisan group of Senators from the Great Lakes region who are opposing a proposal in the President's budget that would place a toll on maritime traffic in the Great Lakes. Sens. Feingold, Kohl, and the bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee asking that he oppose this proposal, which could undermine the commercial viability of Great Lakes maritime commerce. The Senators wrote that new tolls, which would be used for operational costs of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC), could lead to the loss of maritime commerce, which in turn would lead to the loss of waterfront jobs, less access to foreign markets for farmers, and increased shipping rates for other modes of transportation. 
   "Businesses and farms throughout Wisconsin and the Midwest depend on commercial navigation through the Great Lakes and added tolls would jeopardize commerce and jobs," Feingold said. "Maritime traffic is relatively safe and environmentally sound, and we should act to keep the industry viable."
   "The Saint Lawrence Seaway is vital to Great Lakes commerce. The President's proposal to add new financial burdens on shippers in the Great Lakes would have an adverse affect on those who make a living on maritime commerce. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the maritime industry has every opportunity to thrive economically," Kohl said.
   The proposed toll also puts the Great Lakes ports at a competitive disadvantage as ship operators already pay into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund based on the amount of cargo that they carry. Driving commerce away from commercial navigation of the Great Lakes will also put additional burdens on the nation's other transportation infrastructure, which in many cases is already stretched thin.
