SEN. FEINGOLD PUSHES IMPACT AID PROGRAM TO HELP DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is part of a bipartisan effort to adequately fund the Impact Aid program, which helps local school districts that face financial burdens from federal activities, such as military bases, in their district. The Impact Aid Coalition, made up of a bipartisan group of Senators including Feingold, sent letters to appropriators in support of adequate funding for the program. 
   "All Wisconsin children should have access to a good education, including those in school districts that may lose out on revenue because of a federal presence in their district," Feingold said. "Impact Aid has been successful in making sure disadvantaged school districts receive needed education funding and Congress needs to continue to adequately fund this important program."
   Impact Aid works to compensate districts for the loss of tax revenue resulting from federal land ownership, like military bases, or education of "federally connected" children whose parents do not pay property taxes in that school district. Over 20 Wisconsin school districts have been impacted in communities including Ashland, Black River Falls, Bowler, Crandon, Cumberland, Freedom, Hayward, Lac du Flambeau, Minocqua, Keshena, Bayfield, Wisconsin Dells, Seymour, Shell Lake, Siren, Sparta, Tomah, Balsam Lake, Wabeno, De Pere and Winter.
