SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO LEGALIZE REIMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is cosponsoring the bipartisan Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, legislation that allows individual consumers to purchase prescription drugs for their own personal use from FDA-inspected Canadian pharmacies. The bill, introduced today by Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Olympia Snowe (R-WA), also permits U.S.-licensed pharmacies and drug wholesalers to import FDA-approved medications from Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan and pass along the savings to their American customers. The Dorgan-Snowe legislation will allow Americans to benefit from prices in these countries, which are 35-55% lower than in the U.S., while still enabling consumers to receive medications at their local pharmacy. 
   "I am pleased to join my colleagues in this effort to help Americans gain access to affordable prescription drugs," Feingold said. "Wisconsinites and all Americans need relief from the astronomical prices of prescription drugs. This legislation will help make safe medications more available to those who need them." 
   Sen. Feingold has long supported efforts to allow the safe importation of prescription drugs approved by the FDA, giving Americans access to their medicines at lower prices. He cosponsored a similar Dorgan-Snowe bill in 109th Congress, and has consistently voted for related legislation on the Senate floor. 
   Included in the Dorgan-Snowe legislation are provisions to prevent drug manufacturers from cutting off Canadian pharmacies from medications or attempting to make subtle changes to medications so they cannot be imported. If the legislation is passed, consumers will not have to wait for years to realize the savings they need and deserve since the bill proactively gives the FDA tools to ensure imported drugs will be safe.
