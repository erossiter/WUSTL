SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR HEARING ON MERCURY POLLUTION
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is calling on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) to hold a hearing on mercury pollution.  
 Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have discovered that twice as many American children are born each year with potentially unsafe levels of mercury in their blood than was previously thought. Despite these facts, the EPW committee has not held a hearing on the administration's proposed mercury emissions rule. In a letter to EPW Chairman James Inhofe (R-OK), Sen. Feingold requested that a hearing be held to determine if the rule complies with the Clean Air Act and protects our nation from toxic mercury contamination.
   "Mercury pollution poses serious dangers to our waters, our air, our wildlife and ultimately our health," Feingold said. "The federal government needs to act immediately to ensure that our policies protect our environment and our families from this dangerous toxin."
   Mercury emissions have contaminated ten million acres of lakes and 400,000 miles of streams across the country. Every one of Wisconsin's 15,057 lakes is currently under a mercury-related warning. In June 2004, over 100 hunters and anglers groups from Wisconsin wrote to the EPA expressing their concerns about the impact of mercury contamination on human health and on our rivers, lakes, and wildlife. 
   "EPA rules should be created in a transparent manner and in keeping with the spirit of true public participation," Feingold wrote in the letter to EPW. "Mercury contamination affects all Americans and we should address this problem in a bipartisan manner."
   A copy of the letter is available upon request.
