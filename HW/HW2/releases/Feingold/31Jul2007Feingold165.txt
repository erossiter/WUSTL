SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPPORTING PASSAGE OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold on Supporting Passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization: 
   "The children's health care legislation before the Senate right now, known as CHIP, is critical to the almost 100,000 Wisconsinites who depend on BadgerCare to provide health care for their families. As health care costs skyrocket and the number of uninsured rises, strengthening BadgerCare by increasing funding for CHIP is essential to ensuring that thousands of Wisconsin families stay healthy. At my listening sessions and around Wisconsin, I routinely hear how happy people are with the coverage they receive through BadgerCare. That is why I worked closely with the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year to make certain Wisconsin parents did not loose vital CHIP coverage. Not only do I plan on supporting the CHIP bill, but I will also be supporting amendments to boost the program's funding and coverage plans. It is time to pass CHIP reauthorization for the millions of Americans whose lives and health depend on this important program."
   Senator Feingold has worked with the Senate Finance Committee to include provisions in CHIP reauthorization to help Wisconsin families receive health care coverage. In the face of threats from the Administration to scale back CHIP earlier this year, Feingold aggressively worked to assure that no Wisconsin parents would lose coverage. Feingold also cosponsored legislation to avert CHIP funding shortfalls last year.
