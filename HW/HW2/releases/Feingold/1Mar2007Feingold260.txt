SEN. FEINGOLD BACKS BILL TO ENSURE HIGH-QUALITY CARE FOR INJURED SERVICEMEMBERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is an original cosponsor of legislation to ensure that servicemembers wounded in combat receive the health care they deserve. The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act, introduced by Sens. Barack Obama (D-IL) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), will improve care for wounded soldiers and their families and address the unacceptable conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center recently revealed in media reports. 
   "I was outraged by the recent reports of the poor conditions at the Walter Reed Medical Army Medical Center in Washington, DC," Feingold said. "Our heroic soldiers fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world make tremendous sacrifices. To hear that conditions at the Army's premier care facility were anything less than top-quality was simply unacceptable."
   The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act takes several steps to improve care for military personnel wounded in battle. The bill guarantees good housing, improves the efficiency of the Physical Disability Evaluation System (PDES), simplifies and reduces paperwork, strengthens care for family members, creates more frequent and improved communication between patients and caseworkers, and introduces greater accountability.
   Feingold has consistently pushed for adequate funding for the care of both injured servicemembers and veterans. Feingold recently passed legislation through the Senate to close a loophole which was denying some families of injured servicemembers assistance in visiting their wounded loved ones.
   "Our men and women in uniform, as well as their families, have sacrificed so much for this nation," Feingold said. "While this country can never truly repay them for their service, it is our duty to ensure they receive the care they deserve."
