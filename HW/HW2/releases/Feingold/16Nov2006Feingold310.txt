SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR REVISIONS TO MEDICARE PART D MARKETING GUIDELINES
  Sen. Russ Feingold has joined a number of Senate colleagues in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael J. Leavitt asking that immediate action be taken to redefine the current misleading Medicare plan names. The Senators are asking for revisions to the current Medicare Part D marketing guidelines, to make sure that plan names are not confusing or misleading. Nearly all of the national plans contain gaps in their coverage, but with plan names such as "complete," "premier plus," or "gold," these shortcomings are not readily apparent. 
   "The current Medicare Part D plan names are deceptive and misleading for our nation's seniors," Feingold said. "Significant changes to these plan names must be made so that the beneficiaries are aware of the full costs and risks associated with their health plans."
   The open enrollment period allows Medicare beneficiaries who do not have a Part D plan to enroll in one and for those who do have coverage to change their plan. Existing beneficiaries who do not take action will remain in their current plan. Seniors looking for a new plan, or those who are considering other plan options, need to be aware that while several plans do cover generic drugs in the so-called "donut hole," seniors in these plans will have to pay one hundred percent of the cost of brand name products out of their own pockets. 
   "These Part D plan names should accurately reflect the coverage that each plan offers, so that seniors can make informed choices," Feingold said. "Seniors should be able to count on Medicare, and trust the information that the Medicare Program puts out."
