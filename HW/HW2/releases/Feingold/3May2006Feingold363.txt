SENS. FEINGOLD, COLEMAN CALL FOR COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO STABLILIZNG SOMALIA
  Sens. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Norm Coleman (R-MN) have introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate urging the Administration to develop a comprehensive stabilization and reconstruction strategy for Somalia. The bipartisan resolution calls for the appointment of a senior-level official to coordinate U.S. strategy for Somalia and to engage with international and regional partners in support of the transition government's efforts to establish peace throughout Somalia. 
   Feingold, a 13-year member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the following statement upon introduction of the resolution:
   "Long known to be a haven for terrorists and regional warlords, Somalia is a key battleground in the fight against terrorism. Somalia's instability is a threat to our national security. We need to do more to combat terrorism and to support a path to sustainable peace in Somalia. Together with the international community, the Administration needs to develop a comprehensive strategy for eliminating the root causes of terrorism and instability with the wide range of political, economic, and humanitarian resources at our disposal."
