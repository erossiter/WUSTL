SEN. FEINGOLD COSPONSORS BILL TO AVERT FEDERAL SCHIP FUNDING SHORTFALLS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is cosponsoring legislation that would help avoid State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) shortfalls before Congress adjourns for the year. The Keep Children Covered Act of 2006 would provide the necessary funds for the states to keep coverage consistent for those currently enrolled. In Wisconsin, SCHIP funds provide coverage for 28,000 children and 65,000 adults through BadgerCare. 
   "Protecting BadgerCare is vital to the well-being of many families in Wisconsin and I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in an effort to ensure consistent funding for this program," said Feingold. 
   The SCHIP program was created to offer working families an affordable and comprehensive option for health care. Since then, the program has covered more than six million children nationwide. At least 17 states, including Wisconsin, will have insufficient federal SCHIP funding in the 2007 fiscal year to sustain their existing programs. 
   With the Census Bureau already reporting that the number of children without health insurance increased in 2005, the failure of Congress to address these SCHIP funding shortfalls could add even more children to the ranks of the uninsured. In the past, when states faced federal funding shortfalls, both Congress and the Administration have intervened to ensure that states had sufficient federal funding for their SCHIP programs. Just this past year, in the Deficit Reduction Act, Congress provided an additional $283 million to prevent shortfalls projected to occur in 12 states in fiscal year 2006. 
   "We cannot stand by during this lame duck session of Congress and abandon these critical health care services that will help millions of our nation's children," Feingold said. "To do nothing at this point is simply unacceptable."
