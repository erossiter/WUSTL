SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON OFFERING FEINGOLD-REID TO DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Today, in advance of introducing an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill based on the Feingold-Reid legislation to safely redeploy U.S. troops from Iraq, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold released the following statement: 
   "Iraq is the most important issue we face and the Senate must address it when we take up the Defense spending bill this week. Now is not the time for half-measures or compromises that do nothing to end the President's disastrous Iraq policy. If senators are serious about safely redeploying our troops from Iraq, passing Feingold-Reid is the surest way to do it."
