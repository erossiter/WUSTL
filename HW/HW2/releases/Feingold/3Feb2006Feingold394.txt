SEN. FEINGOLD ANNOUNCES WISCONSIN NATIONAL GUARD CIVIL SUPPORT TEAM FULLY CERTIFIED
  Sen. Russ Feingold announced today that the Department of Defense has fully certified the Wisconsin National Guard's Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, the 54th WMD-CST.  
 Feingold was a Senate leader in the successful efforts to assure that every state and territory received this important homeland security asset. 
   "I congratulate the Wisconsin National Guard and commend the members of the 54th CST for meeting the tough requirements needed for this certification," Feingold said. "The 54th CST is great asset for our state. Wisconsin first responders will now be able to call on the team's advanced skills and equipment to assist in the event of a terrorist attack or other complex emergency."
   The 54th CST, based in Madison, is a 22-member team made up of full-time members of the Wisconsin Army and Air National Guard who together have amassed more than 12,000 hours of specialized training. The team also has advanced equipment, including a sophisticated mobile laboratory and a powerful mobile communications vehicle. The primary mission of the 54th CST is to help local and state authorities identify potential WMD agents, assess consequences, advise on response options, and assist with requests for further support.
   "The National Guard plays a crucial role in providing for our nation's security," Feingold said. "The capability brought to Wisconsin by the 54th CST adds an important line of defense that will help protect the state's citizens."
