SEN. FEINGOLD BACKS EFFORTS TO SUPPORT WORKING WISCONSINITES
  Sen. Russ Feingold is working on a wide range of efforts to help working families in Wisconsin. Last month, Feingold joined his colleagues in voting to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time in ten years. This increase is projected to benefit over five million Americans directly who have not seen an increase in their hourly wage since 1997 despite the increased costs of housing, health care, energy, and education. 
   "I was pleased to join my colleagues and vote to increase the federal minimum wage," Feingold said. "This is a victory for working families, and I hope it is just the first of many steps that this Congress takes to support working Wisconsinites and American workers." 
   Feingold has been a long time supporter of several other legislative efforts to improve pay equity, increase health care benefits for working families and improving the rights of workers, including:
   * The Healthy Families Act, introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), which would require employers to provide certain amounts of paid sick leave to their employees. 
   * The Fair Pay Act, previously introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to require that employers base wages on the following: skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions.
   * The Paycheck Fairness Act, previously introduced by Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY), which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes.
   * The Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), which would require the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to certify a union if a majority of employees in a bargaining unit sign authorization cards designating the union as their bargaining representative rather than requiring a bargaining unit to be certified through the NLRB election process. The bill would also establish procedures for reaching an initial contract agreement. 
   "The government should support these and other measures that help hard-working Americans and provide them with the dignity and respect their work demands," Feingold said. 
   Fact Sheet on Feingold's Efforts to Support Working Wisconsinites
   U.S. Senator Russ Feingold supports a wide range of efforts to improve conditions for working families in Wisconsin. Earlier this year, he voted to increase the federal minimum wage and has backed a number of initiatives to support Wisconsin's workers, including:
   The Healthy Families Act would:
   * Apply to employers of 15 or more employees. 
   * Require that employers provide a minimum paid sick leave of seven days annually for employees working 30 hours per week and a prorated annual amount for employees working between 20-30 hours per week. 
   * Allow employees to use such sick leave for their own medical needs or to care for the medical needs of certain family members.
   * Require that employers post notice of availability of paid sick leave and how to file an enforcement action for denial of sick leave. 
   * Allow an employee or the Secretary of Labor to enforce the rights granted in the legislation in federal or state court.
   * Require a GAO study of how these paid sick leave policies are implemented. 
   The Fair Pay Act would:
   * Amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to require that employers base wages on the following: skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act would:
   * Amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to make firms that violate the Equal Pay Act liable for compensatory and punitive damages.
   * Amend the Civil Rights Act to have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission require employers to provide additional data deemed necessary for enhanced enforcement of pay discrimination laws.
   * Require the Department of Labor to develop voluntary guidelines enabling firms to compare different jobs based on objective criteria to determine if workers in female and male dominated occupations are being fairly compensated and to create a recognition program for employers who adjust their pay systems in light of job evaluations.
   * Require the Secretaries of Education and Labor to establish and carry out a competitive grant program to award grants to state, local, or community entities to provide negotiation skills training programs for girls and women to teach skills including those for negotiating for higher salaries, better benefits, and promotes during their careers. This section also would require the Secretaries to integrate negotiation skills and training into appropriate education and labor programs (such as Perkins, WIA, and NCLB). This section also requires an annual report on this program.
   * Direct the Bureau of Labor Statistics to continue collecting data on women workers in the Current Employment Statistics survey. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would:
   * Require the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a majority of employees in a bargaining unit sign authorization cards designating the union as their bargaining representative, called a card check. This allows workers to vote privately, for or against union membership and representation, lessening the pressure from employers and other employees. 
   * Establish procedures for reaching an initial contract agreement. If a union and employer cannot reach an agreement within 90 days, either party could request mediation by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). Disputes that cannot be settled through mediation would be subject to binding arbitration.
