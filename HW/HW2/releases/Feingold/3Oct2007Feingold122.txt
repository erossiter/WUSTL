SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold
  On the President's Veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program
   "By vetoing the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization bill today, the president disregarded the nearly 67,000 Wisconsin families who receive health care through Wisconsin's successful BadgerCare program. The Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization is vital to ensuring that BadgerCare continues. An overwhelming majority of both the American public and Congress supports this legislation and Congress should override the President's veto as soon as possible."
