SEN. FEINGOLD BRINGS AMENDMENT TO PROTECT SENIORS TO FLOOR OF SENATE
  Sen. Russ Feingold today offered an amendment to the Senate bankruptcy bill that will help protect seniors who have to file for bankruptcy from losing their homes. Sen. Feingold had offered his amendment during the Judiciary Committee's mark-up of the bankruptcy bill last week, but it was defeated on a party-line vote. Feingold's amendment sets a mandatory $75,000 federal minimum "homestead exemption" for debtors who are 62 or older. That exemption allows debtors in bankruptcy to protect some or all of the value of their homes from creditors. 
   "With the value of homes skyrocketing, seniors who have paid off their mortgages and who live in states with limited exemptions may lose their hard-earned homes if they have to file for bankruptcy because of high medical expenses or other unforeseen events. In many cases, the home may be an elderly individual's only significant asset, representing an entire life savings. Federal law should protect seniors in states where the homestead exemption is very low," Feingold said. "My hope is that my colleagues will support this measure - it goes a long way toward protecting our seniors." 
   Some states have very low homestead exemptions. Ohio has an exemption of $5,000, and North Carolina has an exemption of $10,000. That means that only that limited amount of home equity would be protected from creditors, effectively requiring homeowners to sell their homes if they seek bankruptcy relief.
   "[Senator Feingold's amendment] would permit older persons to file for bankruptcy, and reduce the risk that they will lose what is very often the primary - if not sole - financial asset they have," said David Certner, Director of Federal Affairs for the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in a letter supporting the amendment. "AARP supports this amendment... to provide this modest bankruptcy relief for older Americans."
