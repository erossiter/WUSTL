SENATE MAKES SEN. FEINGOLD FAMILY TRAVEL PROVISION PERMANENT
  The U.S. Senate has unanimously accepted a provision authored by Sen. Russ Feingold to make permanent a benefit to help families of injured servicemembers travel to the bedside of their injured loved ones. Feingold's provision, based on his Injured Servicemembers Family Travel Act, was adopted as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. Earlier this year, Feingold was successful in getting his family travel legislation into the Iraq and Afghanistan spending bill but the final version of that bill put a sunset on his provision. 
   "I'm happy that the Senate made these travel benefits permanent and I will push for this provision's inclusion in the final version of the Defense Authorization bill," Feingold said. "During an already difficult time, injured servicemembers and their families should not have to worry about whether or not the family can afford to visit their loved one."
   Feingold originally introduced his bill after hearing from Wisconsinites who were being denied federal assistance to travel to the bedside of loved ones injured in combat in Iraq. The assistance was denied because the wounded servicemembers weren't classified as "seriously injured" even though their injuries necessitated transportation to and hospitalization in the United States.
   "When I originally heard from people in Wisconsin facing these travel problems, I believed there must have been some sort of bureaucratic mix-up. After all, it makes no sense that the Army would spend all that money to evacuate personnel out of the combat theater, on to Germany, and finally to the United States, if that person was not seriously injured," Feingold said. "The problem was not bureaucratic however; it was in the law itself. I am pleased that the Senate has taken action to change that law."
