SEN. FEINGOLD BUDGET AMENDMENT PROTECTS ARCTIC REFUGE
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) has offered an amendment to the 2006 Budget Resolution that would strike an administration-backed proposal to use the budget to allow for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  
 Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg's (R-NH) proposed budget includes an instruction to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to authorize oil drilling in the pristine wildlife refuge despite the fact that major oil companies are reportedly not interested in drilling there.
   "For 20 years, there has been bipartisan support to prevent drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge and we will be fighting as hard as ever this year to continue to protect the Alaskan wilderness," Feingold said. "This is a back-door maneuver by drilling proponents to avoid an open debate because they know that drilling in the refuge lacks the support to be approved on its merits."
   The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge has been continually targeted as a location for oil and gas exploration and development. Under federal law, an 8-million acre area adjacent to the coastal plain, and within the larger 19-million acre Arctic Refuge, is already protected by a federal wilderness designation. Feingold is seeking to remove language from the resolution that would provide proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge an opportunity to pursue this destructive policy. 
   "Drilling in the Arctic Wilderness would greatly endanger wildlife including caribou, polar bears, muskoxen, and more than 135 species of birds, while only offering what the U.S. Geological Survey and oil company executives concede is only a few months' worth of oil that would not be available for a decade," Feingold said.
