SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT
  "I oppose the FY 2008 defense authorization conference report because it does nothing to end the President's misguided, open-ended Iraq policy, which has over-burdened our military, weakened our national security, diminished our international credibility, and cost the lives of thousands of brave American soldiers. 
   "There are certain provisions of the report that I support strongly, including a pay raise for military personnel. I am pleased that the conference report contains a number of provisions I supported, including Sen. Webb's amendment creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting to examine waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the misuse of force by private security contractors, and Sen. Lautenberg's amendment to create a Special Investigator General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.
   "But on balance, I can not vote to support a conference report that defies the will of so many Wisconsinites - and so many Americans - by allowing the President to continue one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in the history of our nation."
