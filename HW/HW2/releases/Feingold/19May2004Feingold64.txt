SEN. FEINGOLD BACKS BILL FOR VOCATIONAL, TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING
  Sen. Russ Feingold has joined a bipartisan group of Senators in an effort to block the President's proposed 25 percent cut in funding for local school districts that provide students with technical education and career training.  
 The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act provides crucial funds to help high school students and those pursuing post-secondary education gain necessary skills to compete in a changing economy. In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the Senators pressed for the protection of the program's funding.
   "The Perkins program is particularly important today, as workers struggle to gain the necessary skills to succeed in our knowledge and skills based economy and employers struggle to secure a qualified workforce," read the letter.
   The 25 percent cut proposed by the President's budget would be very damaging to the program. Funding cuts would force schools, training programs, and community colleges to reduce or eliminate programs. Cuts would also lead to the inability to buy or provide equipment, career guidance and counseling, integration of academic and technical skills, program improvement and other measures that would help students succeed in the 21st century workplace.
   "As I travel the state listening to Wisconsinites, jobs continue to be one of the most-talked-about issues," Feingold said. "With the current job crisis our nation is facing, we should be doing more - not less - to improve and strengthen our workforce."
