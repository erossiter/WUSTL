SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOBBYING AND ETHICS REFORM BILL
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold on the Lobbying and Ethics Reform Bill: 
   "The public voted for change last November in part because it was sick and tired of the way Washington works. The final lobbying and ethics reform bill that Congress will consider this week is landmark legislation. It includes a strong lobbyist gift ban, tough new restrictions on privately funded travel and corporate jet flights, much needed additional disclosure of lobbying activities, unprecedented new disclosure of all of the ways that lobbyists provide financial support to members of Congress, including bundling campaign contributions, a provision to slow the revolving door between the halls of Congress and the lobbying world, and far-reaching earmark reform. This lobbying and ethics reform bill is badly needed to help close the book on the Abramoff era. I plan to support it enthusiastically."
