SEN. FEINGOLD EFFORT TO SECURE GRANTS FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PASSES COMMITTEE
  Sen. Russ Feingold announced today that the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) reported to the full Senate a drinking water infrastructure bill which included a grant system for disadvantaged communities and small water systems to comply with federal drinking water standards.  
 Last week, Feingold led a Wisconsin congressional delegation effort requesting the creation of the grant system. The competitive grant program will be for communities that are financially strapped because of the high cost of drinking water compliance. It also allows states that provide support through the State Drinking Water or Clean Water Revolving Loan Funds to forgive loans given to public water systems to comply with standards.
   "I am very pleased with the delegation's successful effort to push the Committee to create a grant system for disadvantaged and small water supplies," Feingold said. "This is a good first step. This system will be able to help communities like Waukesha, Brookfield, and Algoma, which have serious problems with naturally occurring radium and arsenic, comply with federal drinking water standards." 
   Several Wisconsin communities such as Waukesha, Red Granite, and Fond du Lac have a radium problem because their drinking water systems have wells located within or near granitic rock, which contains naturally occurring radium. Hundreds of homes in Wisconsin's Brown, Outagamie, and Winnebago counties are located above a ridge of rock, which increases the level of naturally occurring arsenic in the drinking water. 
   "Wisconsinites should be able to expect safe drinking water when they turn on the faucet, regardless of where they live," Feingold said. "After setting drinking water standards to ensure the safety of Americans, the federal government should do all that it can to help financially strapped communities meet those standards."
