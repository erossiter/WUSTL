SEN. FEINGOLD HEADS TO AFRICA
  Sen. Russ Feingold, the Ranking Member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, arrived in Algeria on Sunday as part of a week-long official visit to the region.  
 In addition to Algeria, Sen. Feingold will stop in Chad and Mali. While in Africa, Sen. Feingold plans to visit with government, religious, and humanitarian leaders to discuss everything from counter-terrorism to human rights to ways the U.S. can reach out to that part of the world. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, Feingold has focused attention on the importance of Africa's role in the fight against terrorism.
   "It is vitally important that American officials make an effort to reach out and listen to Muslim communities around the world," Feingold said. "We cannot fight global terrorist networks without partners. And real partnership requires mutual understanding and respect." 
   Feingold aims to gain a deeper understanding of Algeria's experiences with counterinsurgency and to evaluate U.S. public diplomacy efforts in the Muslim countries of North Africa and the Sahel. In Chad, Feingold will meet with local officials and tour refugee camps set up for the thousands of Sudanese refugees who have fled from Darfur. 
   "I will be meeting with the Darfur mediation team in Chad and hearing directly from Sudanese refugees about their experiences," Feingold said. "While I join people around the world in welcoming an end to the brutal north-south conflict in Sudan, I have little confidence in the Government in Khartoum, and I see no reason to believe that a north-south peace agreement will awaken that government to its responsibility to protect all of its citizens. We must find more effective ways of addressing the crisis in Darfur."
