SEN. FEINGOLD'S LATEST LISTENING SESSION ATTENDED BY 50,000th WISCONSINITE
  During Sen. Russ Feingold's Kenosha County listening session today, the total attendance mark for his fifteen years of holding open meetings reached the 50,000 mark. The milestone comes on the heels of Feingold holding his 1000th listening session last November in Racine County. Since he started holding listening sessions in 1993, Feingold has logged over 140,000 miles in Wisconsin, or the equivalent of five times around the world. Feingold has traveled to virtually every corner of the state, holding listening sessions in over 400 different municipalities. 
   "I want to thank everyone who has come to one of these listening sessions over the years for helping me stay on top of the issues that matter to Wisconsinites," Feingold said. "There is no way I would be able to do my job as Senator without these listening sessions."
   When first elected in 1992, Feingold promised to visit every Wisconsin county every year and hold an open town hall meeting. Feingold has kept that promise and held a meeting in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year from 1993 on. Feingold reached the 50,000 mark after holding listening sessions with crowds both large and small over the years. The largest attendance ever for a listening session was 430 people, while the smallest attendance was three people. Coincidentally, both record attendances happened in Juneau County. The largest year for attendance to date came last year, 2006, when 4,636 people attended the town hall meetings.
   "These listening sessions go right to the heart of why I love being a Senator, and I'm so proud that 50,000 people have been a part of them" Feingold said. "Through these open meetings, I've been able to hear thousands of stories, concerns, questions, and comments that have helped me continue to connect with Wisconsinites across our great state."
   Feingold's listening session was held at the Kenosha Northside Library in Kenosha, WI. The listening session was Feingold's 28th of 2007 and 1036th since 1993.
