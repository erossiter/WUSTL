SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
  "Today, we honor the memory of those whose lives were taken so tragically on September 11, 2001. The legacy of September 11 is not about a horrific act of terror, but about the great acts of courage we saw on that day, and the great strength of this nation as we work together to ensure the security and freedom of the American people."
