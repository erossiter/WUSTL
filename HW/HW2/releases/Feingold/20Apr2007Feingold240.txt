SEN. FEINGOLD ON EARTH DAY 2007
  "This weekend the world will celebrate Earth Day, a celebration founded in 1970 by Gaylord Nelson, the great Wisconsin senator and environmental leader. On this day, by celebrating our environment, we also celebrate Senator Nelson's outstanding legacy. This year, with a new Congress, we have the chance to act on the growing consensus to curb global warming, reduce our dependency on oil, enhance our conservation efforts and enact policies to protect the earth. More and more each year, we understand how the health of our environment is central to everything from keeping our children healthy to preventing the devastating effects of natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. So on Earth Day, all of us must recommit to protecting our environment, and to working together, across the country and in Congress, to meet that challenge head on.
