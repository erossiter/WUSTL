SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON IN SUPPORT OF LEVIN-REED AMENDMENT
  "I supported the Levin-Reed amendment today because although it didn't go as far as I would like, it would have taken a significant step towards ending the President's disastrous Iraq policy. I am concerned that the amendment's exceptions were overly broad and could have been exploited to keep a significant number of troops in Iraq for an extended period of time. But I was pleased that the amendment included a binding start and end date to the redeployment of our troops from Iraq, something I first proposed over a year ago. It is disappointing that the Senate once again failed to act on the will of the American people and end the President's disastrous Iraq policy."
