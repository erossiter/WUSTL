SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2008
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  Black History Month 2008
   Black History Month is a time to honor the rich heritage, and the remarkable contributions, of African-Americans in Wisconsin and nationwide. It is also a time to rededicate ourselves to the fight for justice and equality for all Americans. In this election year, we are reminded of the long struggle made by so many to give every American the right to vote. That struggle defined the civil rights movement, and marked one of the greatest victories for democracy that our country has ever seen.
   But we know these rights don't protect themselves. We have to stand up for them, and for the legacy of the men and women who built a more just America. We can honor the greatest achievement of the civil rights movement this Black History Month by making sure that every vote counts. We ought to put an end to deceptive practices and voter intimidation that poison the democratic process and undermine the hard won gains of the civil rights movement.
   Forty-five years after the March on Washington, and 43 years after the bloody march from Selma to Montgomery and the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, we must protect the rights that so many fought so hard to secure. During February, as we celebrate Black History, let us honor the devotion and sacrifices of so many during the civil rights movement by protecting the rights they won for themselves and for generations to come.
