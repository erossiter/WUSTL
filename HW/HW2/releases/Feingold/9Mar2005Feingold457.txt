SEN. FEINGOLD URGES BUDGET COMMITTEE TO REJECT AMTRAK FUNDING CUTS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is calling on the Senate Budget Committee Leadership to reject the President's proposed elimination of Amtrak funding that could lead the national rail system to go bankrupt.  
 In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee, Feingold called the President's plan particularly unfortunate given the progress Amtrak has made in cutting costs and increasing service. Feingold wrote that cutting off funds for Amtrak would negatively impact millions of Americans who use the rail service.
   "People throughout Wisconsin - from cities like Milwaukee to smaller communities like Columbus - depend on Amtrak for their transportation needs, and these proposed cuts could derail this service," Feingold said. "At a time when Amtrak is improving its service, cutting costs and increasing ridership, we should be supporting these improvements with adequate funding, while continuing to help Amtrak with the enormous amount of work that remains."
   Wisconsin currently has 20 Amtrak stops throughout the state. Amtrak provides a vital link between Wisconsin communities with routes like the Hiawatha Service between Chicago and Milwaukee, and the Empire Builder, which stops in several communities in Wisconsin while on its way to the Pacific Northwest from Chicago. Amtrak's increasing ridership now exceeds 25 million passengers nationwide. 
   "While Amtrak has made great strides to control its operating costs, there is an enormous amount of work needed on maintenance of infrastructure, cars and equipment that cannot be deferred indefinitely," Feingold wrote in the letter. "Putting off this important work could begin to jeopardize the safety and reliability of Amtrak service for the millions of riders who depend on it."
