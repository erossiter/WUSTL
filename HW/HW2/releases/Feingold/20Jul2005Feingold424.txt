SEN. FEINGOLD OUTLINES PLAN TO EVALUATE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
  Sen. Russ Feingold today outlined his plan for evaluating Judge John Roberts Jr., the President's nominee to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Feingold will evaluate Judge Roberts based on his qualifications, judicial temperament, objectivity and integrity. Feingold also indicated that he expects the nominee to be candid and cooperative with the Senate during consideration of his nomination. In addition to intensively reviewing the nominee's record, Feingold will solicit ideas and opinions from Wisconsinites. 
   "Evaluating this nomination is a responsibility I take very seriously and one that I look forward to as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee," Feingold said. "This is the first vacancy on the Court in the past 11 years, and this nomination is likely to have a significant impact on our country for decades to come."
   Below are the steps Senator Feingold will take to evaluate this Supreme Court nominee and prepare for the Judiciary Committee's hearings: 
   * Feingold will review the nominee's qualifications, including analyzing the nominee's opinions and reading commentary about and analysis of the nominee's record. 
   * Feingold plans to meet personally with Judge Roberts prior to the Judiciary Committee hearings. 
   * During the month of August and beyond, at Listening Sessions throughout Wisconsin, people are invited to share their thoughts on this nomination. (The latest Listening Session schedule is available at http://www.feingold.senate.gov and, as always, these sessions are open to anyone from Wisconsin, not just those who reside in the county where they are held.) 
   * Wisconsinites can also make their views known at http://www.feingold.senate.gov under the "Ideas Forum" bar on the left-hand side of the page. 
   * Feingold welcomes analysis and advice from lawyers and law professors in Wisconsin. Memos on legal issues, suggested lines of questioning, and other materials should be submitted to http://www.feingold.senate.gov under the "Ideas Forum" bar on the left-hand side of the page with the words "Legal Memo" in the first line of the message.
