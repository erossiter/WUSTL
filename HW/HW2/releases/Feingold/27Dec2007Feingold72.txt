SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO
  "The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is terrible news for those who support a stabilized democracy in Pakistan, both in that country and around the world. Bhutto was a brave leader who was beloved by millions in Pakistan. The questions surrounding her assassination should have direct bearing on both the future of democracy in Pakistan and the relationship we will have with a country that is so critical in the fight against global terrorism."
   Senator Feingold is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees.
