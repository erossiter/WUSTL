SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR CENSURE OF PRESIDENT, ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS OVER IRAQ, ATTACK ON RULE OF LAW
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold announced today that he will introduce two censure resolutions condemning the President, Vice President and other administration officials for misconduct relating to the war in Iraq and for their repeated assaults on the rule of law. Feingold called the resolutions appropriate and necessary steps for Congress to rebuke an administration that is responsible for some of the worst misconduct and the worst abuses of the law in American history. 
   "Censure is about holding the administration accountable," Feingold said. "Congress needs to formally condemn the President and members of the administration for misconduct before and during the Iraq war, and for undermining the rule of law at home. Censure is not a cure for the devastating toll this administration's actions have taken on this country. But when future generations look back at the terrible misconduct of this administration, they need to see that a co-equal branch of government stood up and held to account those who violated the principles on which this nation was founded."
   Feingold will work with his colleagues, as well as seek input from his constituents and the American people, as he crafts the final language of the resolutions. The first resolution will condemn the President and others for misconduct relating to the war in Iraq including:
   * Overstating the case that Saddam Hussein had WMD, particularly nuclear weapons, and falsely implying a relationship with al Qaeda and links to 9/11.
   * Failing to plan for the civil conflict and humanitarian problems that the intelligence community predicted.
   * Over-stretching the Army, Marine Corps and Guard with prolonged deployments.
   * Justifying our military involvement in Iraq by repeatedly distorting the situation on the ground there. 
   The second resolution will focus on the administration's attack on the rule of law with respect to, among other things:
   * The illegal NSA warrantless wiretapping program.
   * Extreme policies on torture, the Geneva Conventions, and detainees at Guantanamo.
   * The refusal to recognize legitimate congressional oversight into the improper firings of U.S. Attorneys. 
   In March 2006, Feingold introduced a resolution censuring the President for authorizing and misleading Congress and the public about the illegal NSA warrantless wiretapping program. In January 2007, the administration finally brought its wiretapping program within the FISA statute.
   "At my town hall meetings, online, and everywhere I go, I hear the American people demanding that the President and his administration be held accountable for their misconduct, both with regard to the disastrous war in Iraq and their flagrant abuse of the rule of law. Censure is a relatively modest response, but one that puts Congress on record condemning their actions, both for the American people today and for future generations," Feingold said.
   Feingold is encouraging people to email suggestions of what to include in the censure resolution. People can email Senator Feingold at Russell_Feingold@feingold.senate.gov or visit his webpage at http://feingold.senate.gov.
