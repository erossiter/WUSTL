   The Honorable R. James Nicholson
  Secretary - Department of Veterans Affairs
   Dear Secretary Nicholson,
   I am writing concerning the theft of 26.5 million veterans' sensitive personal information. I appreciate your public announcement regarding this situation; however, I have many questions and concerns about the implications of this security breach.
   I understand that you briefed the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees yesterday, and that you are sending notification letters to the veterans whose information was stolen. While this is a first step in sharing information about this breach, there are many details missing in the information you have released. Both Congress and the veterans who are affected by this breach must be better informed in order to take appropriate actions to protect these veterans from identity theft and other harms. I urge you to continue to make public any appropriate details so that veterans and their families are prepared for problems they may encounter. I also request that you provide me with the following information:
   * The exact date and time of the burglary
   * The specific amount and type of information that was taken
   * The reason(s) why Congress and veterans were not notified immediately after the theft
   * VA privacy policies regarding veterans' personal information and the steps the VA takes to enforce those policies
   * Information on action that VA will be taking to prevent further security breaches
   * Information on training efforts that VA is giving staff regarding data security
   * The basis for your statement that that there is no indication that any improper use is being made of the data
   * Action that the VA will take if veterans' information is misused
   I would appreciate your immediate response to this letter. This information is important to our veterans and I want to make sure that my staff is able to assist veterans who contact my office about this issue.
