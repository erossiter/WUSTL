SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S THREAT TO VETO WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  "I welcome the administration's decision to veto this flawed version of the Water Resources Development Act. I supported the Senate version of this bill because it included strong reforms. But the conference report significantly weakened those reforms and raised the price tag to $21 billion in pet projects. This conference report has been stripped of important independent review safeguards that would ensure accountability and prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from manipulating the way projects are planned. We need meaningful Corps reform, including real independent review of corps projects and prioritization of projects, so we can make sure that Americans' tax dollars are spent on the most important priorities, not just on members' pet projects."
