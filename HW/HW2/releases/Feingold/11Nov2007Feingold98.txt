   On Veterans Day, we remember and honor those who selflessly answered the call of duty to protect this country and defend liberty around the world. A grateful nation is reminded today that generations of Americans have made tremendous sacrifices so we all could live a better life. Our veterans' unwavering resolve and bravery represents the very best America can hope for in its citizens. Today, we rededicate ourselves - within our families, within our communities, and within our government - to ensure that the service of these brave men and women is never forgotten.
