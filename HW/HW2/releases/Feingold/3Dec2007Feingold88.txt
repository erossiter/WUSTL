SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON IRAN
  "The unclassified NIE judgments released today on Iran's nuclear program offer good news as well as confirmation that we have more policy options with regard to Iran than many have suggested. The administration and members of Congress who have been pushing an overly aggressive and confrontational strategy should take a deep breath and reconsider. Iran's nuclear program remains a serious concern but it is clear from the NIE that vigorous and coordinated diplomacy is the right way to approach it."
   Senator Feingold is a member of the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees.
