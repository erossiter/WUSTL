SEN. FEINGOLD OPPOSES CUTS TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
  Sen. Russ Feingold is part of a bipartisan effort opposing the administration's budget proposal to cut funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Feingold, along with a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues, is asking the Senate Budget Committee leadership to oppose the administration's proposal as it works on the fiscal year 2007 budget resolution. The President's budget proposes a nearly $1 billion cut for the program which serves more than 4,000 low-income communities nationwide. 
   "The CDBG program has been an enormous help in rebuilding and revitalizing many Wisconsin communities," Feingold said. "CDBG has allowed businesses to expand, made homeownership a reality, and helped revitalize impoverished communities. Drastic cuts to CDBG would mean disaster for many critical community-building projects throughout Wisconsin and the country."
   In a letter to the Senate Budget Committee leadership, the Senators ask that the Budget Committee maintain the federal government's commitment to community development programs. Last year, the CDBG program helped 45 local governments and housing agencies in Wisconsin rehabilitate low- and middle-income housing units. The CDBG program also helped agencies and small businesses in Wisconsin communities such as Stevens Point, Ashland, Marinette, and Platteville Wisconsin expand operations and increase wages.
   "The communities that have benefited from CDBG will be devastated if the HUD proposal to cut funding is enacted," Feingold said. "The program funds vital homeownership, housing rehabilitation, public improvements, public services and economic development projects in communities nationwide."
