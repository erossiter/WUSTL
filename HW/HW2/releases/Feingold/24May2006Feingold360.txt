SEN. FEINGOLD-BACKED BILL SUPPORTING GREAT LAKES RESTORATION PASSES SENATE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Russ Feingold has announced that a bill he cosponsored to strengthen Great Lakes restoration efforts, has been approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Great Lakes Coordination and Oversight Act codifies the Great Lakes Executive Order issued in 2004 establishing the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force and Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The Collaboration increases coordination between the many federal, tribal, state, and local governmental interests with jurisdiction over the Great Lakes. The bill now heads to the full Senate. 
   "The Great Lakes are a national resource like no other and we can't afford to take them for granted," Feingold said. "The Great Lakes require our immediate attention and commitment if they are to remain a vibrant resource for the country."
   Feingold has long supported efforts to restore the Great Lakes and has worked with other members of Congress from the Great Lakes region to address problems like wetland loss, invasive species, and mercury pollution. The bill strengthens restoration efforts by increasing coordination between the heads of ten U.S. Cabinets and agencies. It also will enhance the partnerships of local and state governments as they work together to prioritize restoration efforts.
   "People across Wisconsin depend on the Great Lakes for everything from recreation to drinking water," Feingold said. "This bill would assist in the preservation and recovery of this vital natural resource."
