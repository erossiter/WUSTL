SEN. FEINGOLD AMENDMENT WOULD OFFER RELIEF TO MILITARY FAMILIES
  Sen. Russ Feingold has offered an amendment to the 2005 National Defense Authorization Bill to bring relief to spouses, parents, and children of military personnel who are serving, or are called to active duty, in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The amendment he authored would allow people eligible for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) benefits to use those benefits for issues directly relating to or resulting from the deployment of a spouse, parent, son or daughter. The amendment is based on the Military Families Leave Act that Feingold introduced in March 2003. 
   "While our brave men and women in uniform regularly risk their lives for their country, many of their families struggle with everyday tasks made more difficult by the absence of their loved ones, such as providing child care," Feingold said. "The relief that my amendment provides, while limited, can be vital in helping these families who are already facing difficult circumstances."
   In October of 2003, the Senate adopted Feingold's Military and Families Leave Act as an amendment to the Iraq and Afghanistan supplemental spending bill. Unfortunately, the House and Senate conferees dropped the provision from the final version of the bill. The amendment is supported by the Military Officers Association of America, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard Association of the United States, the National Military Family Association, and the National Partnership for Women and Families. 
   "As I travel across the state, I hear from families that are placed under enormous strain while their loved ones are bravely serving in places like Afghanistan and Iraq," Feingold said. "We must do what we can to help these families as their loved ones continue to serve so courageously in our Armed Forces."
