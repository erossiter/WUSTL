SEN. FEINGOLD ADDRESSES WELCOME CEREMONY FOR 32ND MILITARY POLICE COMPANY
  Sen. Russ Feingold today gave the following statement at Volk Field during the welcome home ceremony for the 32nd MP company:
   "I am so pleased to join everyone here today in welcoming the 32nd MP Company home to Wisconsin. I know it has been difficult journey, and a longer journey than any of you or your families expected. This is a day of tremendous emotion, and I will simply tell all of you how deeply proud of you we all are.  
   We are proud of you for sacrificing so much to serve your country.
   We are proud of you for the important contribution you made to training the Iraqi police force, and to providing security in the Baghdad area in the wake of the war.
   And we are proud of you for courageously doing your duty, day after day, despite being tested in so many ways.
   You endured a great deal, including when Specialist Michelle Witmer was killed. The outpouring of grief and emotion in this state after her death speaks volumes about how Wisconsin appreciates the services of the 32nd MP Company and hopes for you to return to us safe and sound. And now you have returned - with 23 Purple Hearts, and with the distinction of being a unit that has suffered more injuries from hostile action than any Wisconsin National Guard unit since World War II.
   I'd say you did more than your duty. 
   I'd say that you taught all of us what endurance, what commitment, and what bravery really mean. 
   I'd say that we couldn't be more proud of how you represented our state, and how you served our nation. 
   And most of all, on behalf of the people of this state, I'd say one last thing: Welcome home."
