SENS. KOHL, FEINGOLD URGE ADMINISTRATION TO DEFEND WISCONSIN PAPER PLANT JOBS
  Today, U.S. Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold called on President Bush to end unfair trade practices by overseas paper manufactures that hurt domestic producers, who are major employers in certain regions of Wisconsin. 
   In a letter to Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, the Senators expressed concerns over the rapid influx of suspiciously low-priced imports of lightweight thermal paper from China and Germany in the US market while American companies struggle with increasing costs. Senators Kohl and Feingold urged the Department, in their upcoming determination on March 7, 2008, to take action to halt unfairly traded LWTP imports from China and Germany.
   "In Wisconsin, people are losing their jobs and livelihoods when paper plants are forced to close. Hundreds of families and entire communities suffer," Kohl said. "This week, the Administration has an opportunity to put an end to this alarming trend by halting the free flow of unfairly low-priced lightweight paper from overseas manufacturers."
   "Domestic paper producers, like those in Wisconsin, are being put at a serious disadvantage by foreign companies that use unfair trade practices," Feingold said. "As our country experiences tough economic times, the administration should do all it can to stop these practices and protect the jobs of hard-working Americans."
   The U.S. lightweight thermal paper industry produces carbonless paper and other paper products commonly used in business transactions, including paper invoices, credit card receipts, and ATM receipts. The major U.S. LWTP manufacturer is a company called Appleton, which has major factories Appleton and Portage, Wisconsin as well as other locations across the country.
