SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTHERN UGANDA CRISIS RESPONSE ACT
  Sen. Russ Feingold today released this statement following the passage of the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act by the House of Representatives last evening: 
   "I welcome the action of the House of Representatives yesterday in passing the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act, and I urge the President to sign this bipartisan bill quickly. 
   It is in part because there is so much that is positive and promising about Uganda and about our relationship with Uganda that the situation in northern and eastern Uganda is so very shocking. For more than 17 years, a conflict has raged between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the Government of Uganda. This conflict is particularly monstrous, because the primary victims of the LRA's brutal and senseless campaign have been children. 
   The human tragedy is devastating and the implications for Uganda's stability are quite serious. My bill, which has now been approved by both houses of Congress, is an attempt to energize both the Government of Uganda and the international community to address this horrifying crisis and to protect the innocent civilians who are suffering in the region. 
   The bill also sends a crystal clear signal to the Government of Sudan - even in the midst of the crisis in Darfur and negotiations of a north-south peace, we will not forget the children of northern Uganda. The relationship between the Government of Sudan and the Government of the United States cannot improve until the Khartoum regime has effectively cut off all forms of support for the LRA. Just as I will work with my colleagues in the Congress and with the administration to keep the pressure on Khartoum to stop the unfolding tragedy in Darfur, I will remain committed to stopping the horror that has stolen the innocence of so many Ugandan children."
