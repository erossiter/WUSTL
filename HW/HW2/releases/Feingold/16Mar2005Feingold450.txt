SENS. FEINGOLD, CHAFEE TO OFFER 'PAYGO' AMENDMENT TO RESTORE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
  Sens. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) will offer their "PAYGO" or Pay-As-You-Go Amendment to the 2006 Budget Resolution today in an effort to rein in the federal deficit.  
   "The Senate once again has the chance to do its part to pass common-sense fiscal policies to rein in the federal deficit," Feingold said. "This PAYGO amendment simply makes us find ways to pay for the things we want, rather than pushing the costs of the government's fiscal recklessness onto the shoulders of our children and grandchildren. During the 1990s, we balanced the budget under the PAYGO rule and it only makes sense, especially as we face mounting debt, to go back to the system that worked for us before."
   "The pay-go provision, which requires 60 votes to be overridden, will have a powerful impact on federal fiscal policies," Chafee said. "It would establish a binding legal framework - a disciplined structure - requiring Congress to make the tough choices that must be made. I do not believe this is a Republican or Democrat issue. We have an obligation to put this nation's fiscal house in order. We should not shirk from that responsibility."
   The Feingold-Chafee amendment would force Congress to find offsets to pay for new tax cuts or new spending on entitlement programs. If offsets for spending or tax cuts were not included, the amendment would subject the proposals to a budget point of order. In the Senate, that would mean such proposals would need a 60-vote majority for them to pass. The PAYGO amendment succeeded in the Senate last Congress. Congressional leaders' decision not to include the spending rule in the final version of the proposed budget resulted in no budget being passed last year.
   FACT SHEET Senator Feingold's Pay-As-You-Go Amendment
   Current Rule
   * Under the current rule, as established in the FY2004 budget resolution (the last resolution approved by both houses of Congress), Congress can include any tax cuts or spending increases in the annual budget resolution. Pay-As-You-Go, or "PAYGO," only applies to tax cuts or spending being proposed that would exceed the limits set in that budget resolution. 
   * Under this approach, so long as the new mandatory spending or new tax cuts are included in the budget resolution, they are not subject to PAYGO, and they do not need 60 votes to pass the Senate.
   Feingold's Proposed Rule
   * Senator Feingold's Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) amendment returns mandatory spending and tax policy to the old PAYGO enforcement scheme which was in effect for the 1990s. It would force Congress to find offsets to pay for any new tax cuts or new spending on entitlement programs. 
   * If offsets for spending or tax cuts were not included, Feingold's amendment would subject the proposals to a budget point of order. In the Senate, that would mean such proposals would need a 60-vote majority for them to pass.
