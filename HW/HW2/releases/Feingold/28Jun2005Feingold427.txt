SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTS BILL CRACKING DOWN ON GANG VIOLENCE
  Sen. Russ Feingold is cosponsoring legislation that will help state and local prosecutors prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang crimes in their neighborhoods.  
 The American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative - Guarding Against Neighborhood Gangs (ANTI-GANG) Act, would also provide technology, equipment, and training to identify gang members and violent offenders while protecting witnesses and victims of gang-related violence. 
   "Gangs present different problems in different areas, but all of our communities will benefit from this federal assistance for fighting gang-related problems," Feingold said. "Whether it is ongoing gang violence in Wisconsin cities or gang violence related to the production of methamphetamine in the state's rural areas, this bill will help all state and local governments cut down on gang-related problems." 
   Under the bill, federal, state, and local prosecutors would have more tools to proactively go after street gangs. The new law would criminalize participation in criminal street gangs, recruitment and retention of gang members, and witness intimidation, while recognizing that the vast majority of gang prosecutions will continue to occur at the state and local level. The bill would also help retain experienced prosecutors and public defenders through a loan forgiveness program. 
   "Gang violence has taken a tragic toll on all types of communities in Wisconsin and across the nation," Feingold said. "Congress needs to provide local prosecutors and law enforcement officers with the vital tools to crack down on violent offenders and prevent more of our nation's children from getting involved with gangs in the first place."
