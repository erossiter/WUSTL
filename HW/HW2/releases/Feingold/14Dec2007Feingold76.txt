SENATE APPROVES SENS. KOHL-FEINGOLD BILL TO DESIGNATE GREEN BAY VA FACILITY AS 'MILO C. HUEMPFNER' CLINIC
  The U.S. Senate last night unanimously confirmed a bill sponsored by U.S. Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold to designate the Veterans Outpatient clinic in Green Bay the "Milo C. Huempfner Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic." Mr. Huempfner received the Distinguished Service Cross for his service in World War II, making him Brown County's highest decorated military veteran. 
   "Mr. Huempfner's heroic actions during World War II are legendary for their bravery, selflessness and triumph. He saved the lives of his fellow servicemen, confronted the Nazi enemy and served as protection for a village of civilians. We wish to honor his name with this designation by Congress," Kohl said.
   "I'm honored to be part of this effort to recognize Milo C. Huempfner, a true Wisconsin hero and an inspiration to us all," Feingold said. "This is a wonderful way for the Green Bay community to remember Huempfner's extraordinary and courageous service to his country, and his fellow soldiers."
   Mr. Huempfner served as a private in the 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion. According to the World War II Demonstration Team Foundation, Mr. Huempfner found himself separated from his unit and all alone near the village of Leignon, Belgium and facing a major thrust of the German Army in the Ardenne region. Private Huempfner would go on to save his fellow U.S. soldiers from ambush, fight Nazi soldiers and protect a village church and its worshippers on Christmas Eve.
   The bill to designate the Milo C. Huempfner Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic, H.R. 2408, was passed by the House of Representatives in October and can now be signed into law by the President.
