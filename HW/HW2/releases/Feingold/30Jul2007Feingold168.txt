SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON EARMARK REFORM
  "I have long been a strong supporter of earmark reform and supported Senator DeMint's amendment in January. The proposed earmark reforms included in this proposal are consistent with the reforms we passed in January, and are an enormous improvement over the way earmarks had been handled by both Democratic and Republican controlled Congresses in the past.
   "Congress must not let people who oppose reform change the subject. Right now, the simple question senators must ask themselves is whether we want to change the way Washington does business or not."
