SEN. FEINGOLD WORKS TO PROTECT ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is once again helping to lead efforts to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a wilderness area.  
 The Arctic Wilderness Act, sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT), would protect as a federal wilderness area the 1.5 million acre coastal plain of the 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska as a federal wilderness area. Feingold has cosponsored the legislation each Congress since he joined the Senate in 1993. 
   "Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would destroy one of America's true treasures, for what the what U.S. Geological Survey and oil company executives concede is only a few months' worth of oil that would not be available for a decade," Feingold said.
   The Bush Administration has continually targeted the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge as a location for oil and gas exploration and development. Under federal law, eight million acres of the Arctic Refuge adjacent to the area targeted for drilling are already protected by a federal wilderness designation. The legislation that Feingold is co-sponsoring would designate the targeted coastal plain as a wilderness area.
   "There continues to be a strong bipartisan effort to protect this cherished land," Feingold said. "While reducing our dependence on foreign oil should be a top priority in our nation's energy plan, the devastation that would be inflicted on Alaska's arctic wilderness vastly outweighs what little resources we may reap somewhere down the line."
