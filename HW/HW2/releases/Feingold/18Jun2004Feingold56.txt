SEN. FEINGOLD URGES SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION, JOB-TRAINING FOR AT-RISK YOUTH
  Sen. Russ Feingold is working to help at-risk youth gain an education and the necessary skills needed to obtain a job while helping their communities.  
 Feingold, along with a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues, sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies requesting funding for YouthBuild, a program that provides young adults with an immediately productive role in the community by building affordable housing while also providing equal measures of basic education toward a diploma.
   "There are currently 2.4 million young adults between the ages of 16-24 who have left high school without a diploma or who have a diploma but are nonetheless unable to find a job," the letter read. "The costs to society of doing nothing to prepare them for employment are enormous."
   Since YouthBuild became a federally funded program in 1994, over 40,000 at-risk youth have built over 12,000 units of housing in their neighborhoods. 81 percent of the students who complete the program either secure a job or go on to post-secondary education. YouthBuild has three Wisconsin projects located in Madison, Milwaukee and Racine.
   "YouthBuild has received strong bipartisan support over the years because of its overwhelming success," Feingold said. "Congress needs to ensure that this program has the funding necessary to keep helping at-risk youth gain the education, job skills, and leadership skills necessary to become productive citizens."
