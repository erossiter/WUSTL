SEN. FEINGOLD URGES CONFEREES TO MAINTAIN FUNDING BOOST FOR EMERGENCY MANAGERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold, along with a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues, is urging Senate conferees to maintain the $236 million for Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) included in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill.  
 In a letter to Senate conferees, the group of Senators urged them to maintain a $56 million boost in funding for the EMPG program that was accepted into the Senate DHS appropriations bill earlier this month. Conferees from the Senate and House of Representatives are currently negotiating a final DHS appropriations bill. In May, Sen. Feingold was part of a bipartisan group of Senators who asked the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security to fully fund the EMPG program. 
   "Our emergency management system needs to be strong in order to keep our citizens safe from all types of disasters," Feingold said. "This effort to increase emergency management grant funding is a great example of the strong bipartisan desire to help our emergency personnel keep our communities safe."
   The EMPG program was created to assist in developing an effective emergency response system at the state and local government level that can handle emergencies of all types. It provides the only source of federal assistance to state and local managers to help with their emergency management capabilities. The program allows each state to allocate funds to the most urgent state and local needs. 
   "Emergency Management Performance Grants provide critical support to local Wisconsin emergency managers," said Cullen Peltier, president of Wisconsin Emergency Management Association. "The additional funding for EMPGs will go a long way in helping these emergency managers plan for and respond to disasters, whether naturally occurring or man-made."
