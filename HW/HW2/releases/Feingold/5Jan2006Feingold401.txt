FACT SHEET FROM SEN. FEINGOLD ON LOBBYING, ETHICS REFORM ACT
  In July 2005, Sen. Russ Feingold introduced S. 1398, the Lobbying and Ethics Reform Act. Sen. Feingold's legislation includes the following provisions: 
   Bans Gifts to Members and Staff
   * The bill prohibits lobbyists from giving gifts to Members or staff. Includes exceptions for family members and personal friends, campaign contributions, information materials, etc. Provides for a civil penalty (fine of up to $50,000) for breaking this law.
   Prohibits Lobbyists from Financing or Attending Trips with Members of Congress
   * Requires a private entity paying for a trip to certify that the trip was not planned, organized, or financed by a lobbyist and that no registered lobbyist will attend or participate in the trip.
   Slows the Revolving Door
   * Increases cooling-off period for executive and legislative branch employees from one to two years. Former Members and very senior executive branch officials (cabinet members, heads of agencies) will be prohibited from engaging in lobbying activities as well as lobbying contacts for that period. This will prevent a former Member from supervising or designing a lobbying campaign while avoiding any direct contact with Members or staff.
   * Former congressional staff will be restricted from making lobbying contacts with the entire house of Congress they worked for, rather than just the employing office, as under current law.
   * Requires lobbyists to disclose on their lobbying registrations any previous employment with the executive or legislative branch, rather than only such employment within two years prior to acting as a lobbyist.
   * Requires Members and senior staff to publicly disclose possible conflicts of interest if they are engaged in discussions of future employment.
   * Provides that any benefit available equally and only to all former members of the Senate shall not be available to former Senators who are registered lobbyists (e.g., floor privileges, gym membership).
   Improves Lobbying Disclosure
   * Requires lobbying disclosure reports to be filed quarterly rather than semi-annually.
   * Requires disclosure in the quarterly lobbying reports of oral communications (phone calls or in-person meetings) with Members of Congress. The dates of such contacts must be disclosed, not their substance, although each contact must be identified by the issue or bill to which the contact relates.
   * Requires disclosure of grassroots lobbying expenditures.
   * Requires disclosure of substantial financial support to lobbying coalitions.
   * Improves public accessibility of lobbying disclosure by requiring electronic filing and Internet searchable databases.
   Requires Reimbursement for the Use of Corporate Jets
   * Requires Members and campaigns to reimburse for the use of corporate jets at the charter rate rather than the first class airfare rate that is now required. Also requires disclosure of itinerary, purpose, and the identity of others who were on the plane for any such trips.
