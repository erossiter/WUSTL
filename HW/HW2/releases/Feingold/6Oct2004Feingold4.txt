SEN. FEINGOLD VOTES FOR INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL
  Sen. Russ Feingold today voted for passage of the Collins-Lieberman intelligence reform legislation, which implements a number of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to strengthen national intelligence gathering and improve communication between different intelligence agencies. A conference committee will now work out the differences between the intelligence reform bill passed by the Senate and the bill that the House is expected to pass this week. 
   "I am very pleased that the Senate acted quickly to address some of the 9/11 Commission's most critical recommendations to reform and strengthen our intelligence agencies," Feingold said. "I hope that a House-Senate conference is able to quickly agree upon a final version of this bill that follows the Senate's approach and does not contain extraneous and controversial provisions."
   The legislation creates a National Intelligence Director who will manage the intelligence community and serve as the President's chief intelligence adviser. This Director will be responsible for managing the budget of the National Intelligence Program, which will be composed of all national intelligence gathering agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and others. The bill also creates a National Counter-Terrorism Center to integrate the government's counter-terrorism activities, to develop joint counter-terrorism plans and to unify counter-terrorism strategy. In addition, the bill creates a Civil Liberties Board, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission, to evaluate new policies and ensure that civil liberties concerns are considered as the President and executive agencies propose and implement policies to protect the nation against terrorism.
   "I was pleased to author or support a number of provisions to improve intelligence sharing, crack down on those doing business with terrorists, and strengthen support for first responders," Feingold said. "I will continue to fight for measures like these to protect the American people from the threat of terrorism." 
   Feingold played a role in authoring or supporting the following amendments:
   * Feingold authored an amendment, which was included in the final bill, that requires region-to-region information sharing between any newly created National Intelligence Centers that focus on different geographic areas. This provision can help bolster our efforts in areas such as fighting international crime and combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   * The bill includes an amendment to restructure homeland security grants, streamlining the application process and giving state and local officials greater flexibility in how they spend those funds. Feingold co-authored the original bill on which this amendment was based.
   * Feingold cosponsored an unsuccessful amendment, authored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, to close a loophole that allows U.S. companies to do business, through subsidiaries, with countries that sponsor terrorism.
