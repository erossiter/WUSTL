SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON WEAK IRAQ PROPOSAL PASSED BY HOUSE
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold released the following statement today as the Senate prepares to take up legislation passed by the House yesterday that would fund the war in Iraq with only a "goal" for redeploying troops by December 15, 2008. 
   "The Iraq spending bill passed by the House is too weak and doesn't require the timely redeployment of our troops from Iraq. If the Senate does not strengthen the bill, I will oppose it. The American people want more than a "goal" of redeploying troops, which is why I intend to offer the Feingold-Reid legislation requiring the safe redeployment of our troops by June 30, 2008, as an amendment. Congress needs to end this disastrous war and refocus on fighting al Qaeda and its affiliates around the globe, which are the greatest threat to our national security."
   Feingold, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, has introduced the Feingold-Reid legislation to require the vast majority of U.S. troops to be redeployed from Iraq by June 30, 2008. Feingold will seek to amend the House bill with the Feingold-Reid legislation when the Senate takes up the measure this week.
