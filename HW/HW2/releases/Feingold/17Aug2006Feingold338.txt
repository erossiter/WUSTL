SEN. FEINGOLD HELPS SECURE GRANT TO HELP PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) announced today that the Wisconsin Family Assistance Center for Education Training and Support, Inc. (WI FACETS) in Milwaukee has received a $445,084 grant to help provide support to parents of children with learning disabilities. Earlier this year, Feingold wrote to the U.S. Department of Education in support of the grant, which will help parents as they seek early intervention, educational, and transitional services for their children.  
   "I am pleased that parents of children with learning disabilities have better access to information about educational and other services that will benefit their children," Feingold said. "This will ease the burden on parents who are trying to figure out the best options to help a child with a learning disability." 
   In February of this year, Feingold wrote to the U.S. Department of Education on behalf of the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council and WI FACETS, in support of funding for the Wisconsin Parent Training and Information Center. The Center helps to educate parents of children with learning disabilities about the programs and resources available to them. Together, the groups' goal is to build a statewide infrastructure that will help equip families with the knowledge and leadership skills needed to fully participate as partners in their children's educations.
   "With the proper resources, parents and community organizations will be able to help our children receive a better education and take advantages of the resources available in Wisconsin," Feingold said.
