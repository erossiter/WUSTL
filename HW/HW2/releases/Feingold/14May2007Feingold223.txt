SEN. FEINGOLD ON FEINGOLD-REID BEING BROUGHT UP FOR VOTE
  "I appreciate the Majority Leader's work to bring up the Feingold-Reid legislation for a vote. The American people deserve to have the Senate go on record about whether or not it wants to end our misguided mission in Iraq and safely redeploy our brave troops." 
   The Feingold-Reid amendment will mirror legislation the Senators introduced last month with eight other cosponsors. The text of the original Feingold-Reid legislation read:
   To safely redeploy United States troops from Iraq.
   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
   (a) Transition of Mission- The President shall promptly transition the mission of United States forces in Iraq to the limited purposes set forth in subsection (d).
   (b) Commencement of Safe, Phased Redeployment From Iraq- The President shall commence the safe, phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq that are not essential to the limited purposes set forth in subsection (d). Such redeployment shall begin not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
   (c) Prohibition on Use of Funds- No funds appropriated or otherwise made available under any provision of law may be obligated or expended to continue the deployment in Iraq of members of the United States Armed Forces after March 31, 2008.
   (d) Exception for Limited Purposes- The prohibition under subsection (c) shall not apply to the obligation or expenditure of funds for the limited purposes as follows:
   (1) To conduct targeted operations, limited in duration and scope, against members of al Qaeda and other international terrorist organizations.
   (2) To provide security for United States infrastructure and personnel.
   (3) To train and equip Iraqi security services.
