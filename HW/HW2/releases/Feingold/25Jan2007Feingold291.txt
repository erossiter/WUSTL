SEN. FEINGOLD 'BUY AMERICAN' REPORTING REQUIREMENT TO HELP AMERICAN WORKERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold's efforts to support American workers continued yesterday, when his Buy American reporting requirement was accepted as an amendment to the minimum wage bill currently before the Senate. The amendment requires federal agencies to report on their purchase of foreign-made goods for the next five years. Feingold's goal is to make sure the government buys American-made goods in every possible circumstance, and is able to explain its reasons when it does not do so. His amendment puts more teeth into the Buy American Act of 1933, which requires the federal government to purchase American-made goods whenever possible.  
   "By purchasing American-made goods whenever possible, our federal government sends a simple message to American workers: We support you," Feingold said. 
   Under current law, the federal government is supposed to support American manufacturers and American workers by buying goods made in the U.S., but the law contains loopholes that give agencies broad discretion to waive the requirement. The amendment is the latest in Feingold's efforts over several years to require federal agencies to report to Congress about foreign purchases. An exception to this reporting requirement is provided for agencies that are members of the intelligence community. 
   "The federal government owes it to American workers to spend American taxpayer dollars on American-made goods whenever possible and be accountable in instances when it does not," Feingold said. 
   Feingold successfully passed provisions to require federal departments and agencies to report to Congress and the American people on the amount of foreign-made goods that they purchase in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006. Feingold will continue to work to ensure a permanent reporting requirement is extended to all federal agencies.
