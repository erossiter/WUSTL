SEN. FEINGOLD SEEKS TO WORK WITH NEW ENERGY SECRETARY TO FIX BROKEN ENERGY POLICY
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) has sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman congratulating him on his recent confirmation and highlighting several energy issues he hopes they can work on together in an effort to develop an effective, bipartisan national energy policy.  
   "With so many dire energy issues facing our country today, from reducing dependency on foreign oil to ensuring a supply of affordable natural gas for low-income Americans, I welcome the opportunity to work with Secretary Bodman in crafting a national energy policy that works for all Americans," Feingold said. "This country deserves a bipartisan energy bill that includes protections for both consumers and the environment and isn't riddled with pork projects." 
   In his letter, Feingold addressed the predicted summer rise in gasoline prices and urged Bodman to encourage the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase production and insure a steady flow of oil to world markets while also asking for vigilance in guarding against market manipulation and price gouging by producers and suppliers. 
   Feingold also mentioned high energy costs for consumers, especially in the winter months. He encouraged Bodman to support efforts to ensure a steady, affordable supply of natural gas to American consumers.
   Feingold pressed Bodman to support a national energy policy that is truly balanced, as well as efforts to enact much-needed noncontroversial energy legislation like stand-alone electricity reliability standards, which Feingold has worked on with Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA). 
   A copy of the letter is available upon request.
