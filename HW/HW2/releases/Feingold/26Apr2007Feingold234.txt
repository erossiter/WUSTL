SEN.RUSS FEINGOLD ON PASSAGE OF IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL CONFERENCE REPORT
  "Today the Senate took another important step toward ending our open-ended military involvement in Iraq. The President should quickly sign the supplemental bill, which passed with bipartisan support, and begin developing a more comprehensive strategy for combating terrorism. Congress has acted on its mandate from the American people, and the President should not ignore these calls for change. Redeploying our troops who are bogged down in the middle of an Iraqi civil war will enable us to refocus on our top national security: the global fight against al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
