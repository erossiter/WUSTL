SEN. FEINGOLD TO INTRODUCE RURAL OPPORTUNITIES BILL
  Sen. Russ Feingold will introduce the Rural Opportunities Act of 2007 this week to help sustain and strengthen rural economies for the future, and create more opportunities in rural communities. With the changing global economy, and tough challenges for hardworking farmers, this bill offers new and creative approaches to help rural communities continue to grow. Feingold's legislation will support rural America in four ways: supporting local bioeconomies and food markets, encouraging local renewable fuels and biobased products, expanding broadband Internet service in rural areas, and helping develop the next generation of farmers, ranchers and land managers. The bill would encourage steps toward energy independence, such as Gov. Doyle's Consortium on Biobased Industry in Wisconsin.  
   "The federal government has an important role to play in supporting America's small towns and rural areas, which contribute so much to our economy, and to our strength as a nation," Feingold said. "By passing this bill, Congress can support the rural communities that America was built on, for this generation and generations to come."
   "Senator Feingold's Rural Opportunities Act addresses several critical issues important to Wisconsin's family farmers and rural communities," Sue Beitlich, President of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, said. "The proposals' emphasis on returning and retaining more value for the farmer and rural community from local and sustainable food and renewable energy production, echoes many of the priorities suggested by Farmers Union members at our Farm Bill Listening Session and recent convention."
   This legislation is part of Feingold's Rural Communities Week, where he is introducing legislation to help address issues facing rural America. Yesterday, Feingold joined Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) in introducing the Rural Medicare Equity Act of 2007. 
   Feingold's Rural Opportunities Act of 2007 would:
   * Help schools work in conjunction with local farmers to supply their cafeterias with locally produced products.
   * Provide additional funds for existing USDA programs, which help develop local markets and help farmers develop and sell products at these markets. 
   * Boost funds to provide additional food vouchers for low-income seniors to purchase items at farmers markets.
   * Offer more technical assistance and other efforts to ensure that the benefits of turning agricultural and forest products into fuel go back into local economies. 
   * Provide flexible federal matching funds for extension, education and applied research purposes, as well as boost funding to develop the next generation of biofuels.
   * Build on energy independence initiatives, providing federal boosts to efforts that are already underway in Wisconsin and other states.
   * Call for the digital divide affecting rural households and other underserved groups to be eliminated within a decade, with the ultimate goal of providing nationwide universal access to affordable broadband.
   * Encourage improvements in existing broadband programs to increase Internet access and eventually bring rural areas universal affordable service.
   * Improve existing federal programs to better serve beginning farmers and ranchers, giving them more resources, and target those resources toward developing agricultural methods appropriate for small farmers.
   "The strength of our rural communities is a big source of pride in our state and this country, and this effort is a step toward helping their economies grow in new directions," Feingold said. 
   Feingold's bill is supported by: Wisconsin Farmers Union; Sustainable Agriculture Coalition; Stan Gruszynski, Director, Rural Leadership and Community Development Program, UW Stevens Point; and the Community Food Security Coalition.
