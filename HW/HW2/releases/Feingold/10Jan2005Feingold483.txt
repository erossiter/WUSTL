SEN. FEINGOLD APPLAUDS ENACTMENT OF TAX RELIEF FOR TSUNAMI DONATIONS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is lauding congressional passage of a measure giving a tax break for people who have made donations for victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster.  
 The President signed the bill into law on January 7th. The old law would have made people wait until 2006 to claim donations made in the first month of 2005 to tsunami relief efforts as charitable donations. The new bill would allow tsunami relief contributions made by January 31, 2005, to be treated as if they were made in 2004. The provision, which originated in the House and passed both chambers of Congress, is similar to a Senate bill that Sen. Feingold cosponsored. 
   "Since this terrible natural disaster took the lives and destroyed the homes of so many late last year, Americans have once again shown their overwhelming generosity by making private donations for tsunami relief efforts," Feingold said. "Although it is a modest step, this new bill rewards and encourages that generosity, which is a cornerstone of the American spirit."
   Under U.S. law, Americans can deduct charitable donations to charities in foreign countries on their income tax forms if a U.S. organization has full control over the funds.
