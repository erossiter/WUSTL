SEN. FEINGOLD SEEKS FUNDING TO HELP WITH CRIME PREVENTION
  Sen. Russ Feingold is calling on Senate appropriators to help make communities safer by funding several crime prevention programs.  
 In letters to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary, Feingold requested that adequate funding be maintained for the Byrne grant program, the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) program, and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, all of which are either underfunded in the President's budget or in danger of being eliminated altogether. The LLEBG and Byrne Grant programs help provide essential services for victims and witnesses of crimes, as well as establishing anti-drug task force units. The President's budget would eliminate both the LLEBG and Byrne Grant program and replace them with a Justice Assistance Grant program, which would receive significantly less funding than the Byrne grants and LLEBG program received last year combined. 
   "Both Byrne Grants and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program allow communities to be tough on crime and keep drugs out of our neighborhoods," Feingold said. "Congress must reject the administration's proposal to eliminate these essential programs, and give these programs the resources they need to help crime victims and witnesses."
   The COPS program, which has provided for more than 1,300 additional police officers and sheriffs' deputies throughout Wisconsin, has been cut by the President, reducing total COPS funding to almost half of what it was in 1999. 
   "With security at home one of the most important issues facing Americans today, we need to make sure our communities are adequately protected," Feingold said. "The COPS program has been a great tool in establishing strong relationships between local law enforcement and the people and families they protect."
