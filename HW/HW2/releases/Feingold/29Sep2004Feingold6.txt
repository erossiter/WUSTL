SENS. FEINGOLD, KOHL RESOLUTION HONORING WISCONSIN NATIVE AMERICANS PASSES SENATE
  Sens. Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl announced today that their resolution recognizing and honoring the many contributions of Wisconsin Native Americans to our country has passed the Senate.  
 The resolution, which the senators introduced last week, coincides with this month's opening of the National Museum of the American Indian.
   "I am proud to represent the members of tribes throughout Wisconsin and I am pleased to help honor them with Senator Kohl through this resolution," Feingold said. "The National Museum of the American Indian will give all Americans the opportunity to learn more about the legacy, history, and culture of Native Americans, across Wisconsin and around the nation."
   "The members of tribes throughout Wisconsin and the nation have rich and vibrant traditions and cultures that deserve to be honored. The National Museum of the American Indian is a special place to reflect on their unique heritage and invaluable contributions to our country. It's been fifteen years since I joined my colleagues in sponsoring legislation creating this museum, and I am so pleased it is now a reality," Kohl said. 
   Wisconsin is home to many Native Americans, including 11 federally recognized tribal governments: the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, the Forest County Potawatomi Indian Community, the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin, the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, the Sokaogon Chippewa (Mole Lake) Community of Wisconsin, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and the Stockbridge Munsee Community of Wisconsin.
