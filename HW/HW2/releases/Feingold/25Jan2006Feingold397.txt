SEN. FEINGOLD GIVEN 'A' BY NAACP FOR 2005
  Sen. Russ Feingold has received an "A" from the NAACP for his legislative voting record during 2005.  
 Feingold was also named as one of the Senate's 14 "Legislative Quarterbacks" for championing civil rights. 
   "I am honored to receive this high mark from an organization that is committed to improving the lives of millions of Americans by defending and advancing civil rights," Feingold said. "I will continue to work to ensure that Americans of every race and background have equal access to education and health care while defending the rights and freedoms that each of us deserves."
   The NAACP has graded members of Congress on civil rights votes since 1914. Feingold received a 95 percent rating for 2005, or the first half of the 109th Congress. The NAACP based its grades on such issues as increasing the minimum wage, supporting increased access to education, support of the Medicaid program, and restoring initiatives for community improvement.
