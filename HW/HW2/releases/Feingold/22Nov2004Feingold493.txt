SEN. FEINGOLD'S RECREATIONAL PARITY LEGISLATION UNANIMOUSLY PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) announced today that the Senate has passed a bill authored by Feingold and Sen.  
 Susan Collins (R-ME) prohibiting health insurers from denying benefits to people injured while participating in legal transportation and recreational activities. The legislation corrects the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act by closing a loophole that allows insurance companies to refuse to cover injuries suffered by a person while participating in legal activities such as snowmobiling, motorcycling, skiing, or jogging.
   "If Americans want to enjoy legal transportation and recreational activities, the thought of being refused medical coverage shouldn't stop them," Feingold said. "That's why I have been fighting to pass this bill giving people the protection they deserve while taking part in activities like motorcycling and snowmobiling. I am very pleased that the Senate finally approved this bill." 
   The loophole closed by the Feingold/Collins legislation was created by the Department of Health and Human Services' regulations implementing the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. While employers are not able to refuse health care coverage to an employee on the basis of participation in transportation or recreational activities, the employee can be denied health care benefits for an injury that occurred while participating in these legal activities.
   "I join Wisconsinites in taking pride in the many outdoor recreational activities that our great state provides," Feingold said. "This bipartisan effort will allow people to enjoy these outdoor activities without fear of being denied coverage in the unfortunate event of injury."
