SENATE PASSES SEN. FEINGOLD RESOLUTION HONORING LIVES OF AMERICAN CHURCHWOMEN SLAIN IN EL SALVADOR
  U.S. Senator Russ Feingold hailed Senate passage of his resolution to commemorate the lives of four American churchwomen who were tragically slain in El Salvador nearly 27 years ago. Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita Ford, Ursuline Sister Dorthy Kazel, and Cleveland lay missionary Jean Donovan were executed by members of the Armed Forces of El Salvador on December 2, 1980. Feingold's resolution honors the memory of these women and the dedication they showed not only to the poor but also to those displaced by El Salvador's brutal civil war. Feingold introduced a similar resolution in November 2005 to honor the nuns on the 25th anniversary of their deaths but an anonymous senator or group of senators blocked its passage. 
   "The lives of these four churchwomen continue to inspire Salvadorans, Americans, and people throughout the world to answer the call to service and pursue lives dedicated to helping the poor, vulnerable, and disadvantaged among us," Feingold said. "Remembering these women and the work they undertook is essential not only for those who knew them, but also for all those who learn about what these women stood for."
   The four churchwomen from the United States were among more than 70,000 civilians who were murdered during the course of the civil war in El Salvador. Several years after the civil war, a United Nations Commission on the Truth for El Salvador revealed that their execution was planned and subsequently covered up by the Armed Forces of El Salvador. Feingold's resolution is cosponsored by Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), John Kerry (D-MA), Robert Casey (D-PA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), and Richard Durbin (D-Il).
