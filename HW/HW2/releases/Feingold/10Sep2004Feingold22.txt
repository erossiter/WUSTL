SENS. KOHL, FEINGOLD QUESTION FDA ABOUT SEIZURES OF CANADIAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG SHIPMENTS TO WISCONSIN
  Sens. Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold today contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after dozens of complaints from Wisconsin residents that the FDA has intercepted shipments of prescription drugs purchased through Canadian pharmacies.  
 Many people in Wisconsin, particularly senior citizens, struggle with the high cost of prescription drugs in the United States and turn to Canadian pharmacies for more affordable medicines. Sens. Feingold and Kohl are cosponsors of legislation to make it legal and safe to import less expensive prescription drugs into the United States. 
   "While we recognize that the Administration continues to oppose any effort by consumers to save money by buying less expensive FDA approved prescription drugs from other countries, we are concerned that the FDA's actions could pose health risks to American consumers," the Senators wrote in a letter to the Acting Commissioner of the FDA. 
   Kohl and Feingold said that some of these people need the medicines to prevent and treat chronic disease, and to reduce the need for costlier hospitalizations and treatments. They told the FDA Acting Commissioner they are concerned that, if the FDA intercepts medicines at the border, the patients' health will be put at risk as their treatment is delayed and their conditions may worsen. 
   The Senators asked the FDA to clarify its policy of intercepting Canadian prescription drug shipments, including whether they are notifying consumers when their medicines are stopped at the border, whether the medicines will eventually be released, and whether the FDA is assisting consumers in obtaining refunds when the intercepted shipments have already been purchased.
