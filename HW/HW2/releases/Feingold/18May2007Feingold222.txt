SEN. FEINGOLD ON APPOINTMENT OF JOHN YATES TO BE SPECIAL ENVOY TO SOMALIA
  "I welcome the administration's decision to appoint Ambassador John Yates as U.S. special envoy to Somalia. For a long time, I have been calling for consistent, high-level attention to Somalia so we can help this troubled nation move past its history of chaos and lawlessness. I am concerned, however, that the new special envoy will not be adequately supported to undertake the monumental tasks needed to help bring stability to the region. Ambassador Yates should have direct access to the President and sufficient resources, and be backed by a strong team. I am equally worried that while the appointment of Ambassador Yates is a step in the right direction, the administration's policy towards Somalia does not comprehensively address the long-term stability needs of the region, which are vital to our national security. Without such a plan, our efforts -and those of the international community - will be unlikely to reverse years of instability or eliminate extremism on the Horn of Africa." 
   Senator Feingold is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs. He visited the Horn of Africa in late 2006 to monitor the situation in Somalia. More information is available at http://www.feingold.senate.gov/issues_africa.html.
