SENS. FEINGOLD, GRAHAM INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO REFORM HEALTH CARE NOW
  Sens. Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Lindsey Graham (R- SC) introduced legislation today that forces Congress to take up the issue of health care reform during the first 30 days of the next session of Congress - The Reform Health Care Now Act. The Feingold-Graham bill requires Congress to act on a bill that provides health coverage to at least 95% of Americans in ten years while not increasing the national deficit.  
   While the Feingold-Graham bill does not specify the type of health care reform measure that should be debated, Feingold favors a state-based approach to health care reform, where the federal government would be a partner with the states by providing the flexibility, resources and tools necessary for states to make sure that all of their residents have health care coverage. This approach would achieve universal health care without the federal government dictating to states exactly how to do it. 
   "As I travel around Wisconsin, one of the topics that comes up most often is the exploding cost of health care coverage for both businesses and families, and the impact those costs have on our economy and on access to care" Feingold said. "It has been over 10 years since the last serious debate over health care reform was killed by special interests and the soft money contributions they used to corrupt the legislative process. We need to help ease the burden of rising health care costs on Wisconsin business and families because the weight of the status quo is limiting businesses' ability to expand their workforce and create jobs. It is time to make health care reform a priority - businesses and families cannot afford further delay." 
   The U.S. Census estimates that there are approximately 45 million Americans without health insurance, an estimated eight million of whom are children. The Reform Health Care Now Act is being introduced ahead of Covering the Uninsured Week (the Week of May 1), a national effort to have Americans come together to make health care reform a priority for Congress. 
   "Too many Americans are uninsured, or underinsured, and are left behind in our health care system," Feingold said. "The uninsured drive already skyrocketing health care costs up for everyone. Congress must act now to address the health care crisis in this country, and the legislation I introduced today forces them to do so." 
   The Reform Health Care Now Act is supported by Families USA. A fact sheet on the Feingold-Graham legislation is attached. 
   The Feingold-Graham Reform Health Care Now Act
   Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have introduced a bill that would force Congress to take up the issue of health care reform. With an estimated 45 million Americans lacking health insurance, and the costs of health care skyrocketing, Senators Feingold and Graham believe the time for Congress to comprehensively address health care reform has come. Their bill would make the issue of health care reform a priority for Congress, and create a process that forces Congress to draft and consider legislation to substantially increase access to health insurance.
   Any bill being considered under the Feingold-Graham legislation would have to cover at least 95% of Americans in ten years while not increasing the national deficit. The bill does not state a preference for any specific type of health care reform, it simply sets forth debate and action on health care reform in the Congress. 
   Summary of Procedures: 
   * Within a month (30 calendar days) after the beginning of the session of Congress following enactment of the bill, the two chairs of the Senate Finance Committee and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the Senate Majority Leader of the Senate, and the Senate Minority Leader shall each introduce legislation to provide universal health care coverage. If the two committee chairs fail to introduce a bill within the first month, then the ranking minority party member of the respective committee may introduce a measure that qualifies for the expedited treatment described below.
   * The measures introduced by the Majority Leader and Minority Leader will be placed directly on the Senate Calendar. The measures introduced by the two Committee chairs (or ranking minority members) will be referred to their respective committees.
   * The committees have two months (60 calendar days not including recesses of 3 days or more) to review the legislation. At the end of that time, if either committee fails to report a measure, the bills will be placed directly on the legislative calendar.
   * If the Majority Leader fails to move to one of the bills, any Member may move to proceed to any qualifying measure. The motion is not debatable or amendable. In other words, it could not be filibustered.
   * If the motion to proceed is adopted, the chamber will immediately proceed to the consideration of a measure without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the measure remains the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of, or until the conclusion of an agreed upon length of time.
   * All amendments to the measure must be relevant.
   * Similar expedited procedures would also apply to consideration in the House.
