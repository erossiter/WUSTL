SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PROPOSED FISA LEGISLATION
  "We need to wiretap terrorists, and we should address the problem that has been identified with FISA with respect to foreign-to-foreign communications. But the administration's overly broad proposal goes far beyond that and would leave critical decisions related to surveillance involving Americans entirely up to the Attorney General. The proposal from the Democratic leadership is better and involves FISA court review from the start. But it does not have adequate safeguards to protect Americans' privacy. The bill should also include a 90-day sunset to ensure Congress has the chance to identify and fix any problems with this new proposal."
