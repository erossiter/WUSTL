SEN. FEINGOLD AMENDMENT CALLS FOR U.S. TROOP REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ BY DEC. 31ST
  Sen. Russ Feingold is introducing an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that requires the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by December 31st, 2006. Last August, Feingold was the first Senator to announce a target date for withdrawal when he suggested U.S. troops leave Iraq by the end of 2006. The emergency supplemental, which is currently being considered in the Senate, includes funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq. 
   "Our country desperately needs a new vision for strengthening our national security, and it starts by redeploying U.S. forces from Iraq," Feingold said. "Our military has performed valiantly in Iraq, but the indefinite presence of large numbers of U.S. forces there tends to weaken our ability to fight the global terrorist networks that threaten us today."
   In June 2005, Feingold became the first U.S. Senator to offer a resolution calling on the President to offer a flexible timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. When the President failed to provide any suggestion of when U.S. forces would redeploy, Feingold jumpstarted the issue by suggesting the end of 2006 as a target date. In November 2005, 40 Senators voted in support of an amendment including language crafted by Feingold that called for a flexible timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.
   "Our current path is unsustainable," Feingold said. "While this amendment recognizes the need for certain U.S. forces to be engaged in counter-terrorism activities, the training of Iraqi security services, and the protection of essential U.S. infrastructure, it also recognizes that the President's current strategy in Iraq is undermining our nation's national security."
