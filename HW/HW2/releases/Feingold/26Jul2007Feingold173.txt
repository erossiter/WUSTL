SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING REP. HINCHEY PROPOSING CENSURE
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold on Congressman Maurice Hinchey proposing censure: 
   "Congressman Hinchey has been a strong voice in opposition to the President's policies in Iraq and in defense of the Constitution. I thank Congressman Hinchey for his willingness to stand up to this administration for its misleading statements leading up to and during our military involvement in Iraq, as well as its attack on the rule of law. I am working with Congressman Hinchey and others in crafting these censure resolutions condemning the damaging actions of this administration. Censure is about holding the administration accountable. Congress must be on the record repudiating the administration's misconduct, both for the American people, and for history."
