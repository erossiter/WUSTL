SEN. FEINGOLD HELPS BRING ALMOST $130 MILLION TO WISCONSIN FOR TRANSPORTATION
  Sen. Russ Feingold today announced that the transportation bill finalized by a House-Senate conference will include almost $130 million for transportation projects throughout the state that Sen. Feingold helped secure with other members of the congressional delegation. The transportation bill also ensures that Wisconsin will continue to receive more in funding than it pays out. In fact, Wisconsin will see an increase from the current $1.02 to a $1.06 for every $1.00 it sends to the federal government for transportation needs. The bill will provide nearly $712 million a year to Wisconsin over the next five years, an increase of over 30% relative to the previous highway bill.  
   "With transportation costs continuing to skyrocket for states and localities, I am pleased that we were able to work together to bring these much-needed dollars to Wisconsin," Feingold said. "I especially want to thank and congratulate Congressman Tom Petri on his hard work as chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways, Transit and Pipelines on behalf of all of Wisconsin."
