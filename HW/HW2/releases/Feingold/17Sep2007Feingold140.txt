SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MICHAEL MUKASEY'S NOMINATION TO BE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL
  "The next Attorney General will take over a Justice Department plagued by scandal and low morale. As Attorney General and White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales disregarded statutes, treaties and the Constitution to help this administration consolidate more and more power in the executive branch, and he misled Congress and the American people repeatedly. As a result, Congress and the public now lack confidence in the administration's commitment to impartial justice. The new Attorney General must make it a top priority to repair the damage done by Alberto Gonzales. 
   "To that end, Judge Mukasey must demonstrate that his first loyalty will be to the rule of law, not to the President. In particular I will be interested in his views on executive power and the need to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans while fighting al Qaeda and its affiliates aggressively. I will also expect Judge Mukasey to commit to reversing the course set by Alberto Gonzales by fully cooperating with ongoing congressional oversight of this administration's misconduct, and by always telling Congress and the public the truth, starting with his confirmation hearings. Congress, the Department's many committed employees, and the American people deserve nothing less from their Attorney General."
