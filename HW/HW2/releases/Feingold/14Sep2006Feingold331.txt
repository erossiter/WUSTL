SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR HOUSE ACTION ON BILL TO COMBAT AUTISM
  Sen. Russ Feingold is urging the House of Representatives to take up and pass the Combating Autism Act. In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Feingold urged them to quickly take up the bill before the end of the 109th Congress. The bill would, for the first time, authorize federal funding for research on autism and provide help and hope for the families of the more than 1.5 million American children with autism. 
   "Autism has affected far too many families in Wisconsin, and I have heard wide support from Wisconsinites for this bill," Feingold said. "We should not delay our efforts to aggressively develop new treatments and eventually find a cure for this devastating disorder."
   The bipartisan Combating Autism Act passed unanimously in the Senate on August 3, 2006. Feingold wrote the letter in an effort to push the House to pass the legislation before the 109th Congress is scheduled to adjourn at the end of 2006.
   "In these times of skyrocketing health care costs, and with increases in the rate of autism, it is vital to support biomedical research as part of a comprehensive approach to attacking this disorder," Feingold wrote. "I strongly believe that research, such as that supported by this bill, could hold the keys to early detection, effective treatment of, and perhaps cures for, autism."
