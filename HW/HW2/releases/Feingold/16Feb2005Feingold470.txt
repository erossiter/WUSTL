SEN. FEINGOLD INTRODUCES 'BUY AMERICAN' BILL SUPPORTING AMERICAN WORKERS
  Sen. Russ Feingold continued his week of highlighting support and protection of American jobs today with introduction of his Buy American Improvement Act.  
 The legislation would strengthen the Buy American Act of 1933, which requires the federal government to purchase American-made goods whenever possible. 
   "Over the last five years, Wisconsinites have lost nearly 80,000 manufacturing jobs, largely because of unfair trade agreements and questionable administration policies," Feingold said. "By purchasing American-made goods whenever possible, our federal government will send a simple message to American workers: We support you."
   Under current law, the federal government is supposed to support American manufacturers and American workers by buying goods made in the U.S., but the law is full of loopholes that offer the heads of agencies broad discretion to waive the requirement. The Buy American Improvement Act will strengthen American manufacturing by making it harder to waive the Buy American requirement. The bill also for the first time makes the Senate, House of Representatives, and Architect of the Capitol subject to the Buy American Act.
   The bill builds on Feingold's efforts to require federal agencies to report to Congress about foreign purchases. Feingold successfully pushed provisions that were enacted to require all federal departments and agencies to report to Congress and the American people on the amount of foreign-made goods that they purchase in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. This bill would make that reporting requirement permanent.
   "The federal government needs to take a step back and ask if it is really doing enough to support the interests of its citizens," Feingold said. "I can think of no simpler message of support to the American worker than to use his or her taxpayer dollars to support American jobs."
