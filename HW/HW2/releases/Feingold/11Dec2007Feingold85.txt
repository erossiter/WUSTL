SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ALGERIAN BOMBINGS
  "The tragic bombings in Algeria today, which the Algerians have blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, offer a harsh reminder of the threat of international terrorism and underscore the need for a global strategy to go after al Qaeda and its affiliates. Earlier this year, the same al Qaeda affiliate claimed responsibility for bombs in Algeria that killed over thirty people and wounded over 200. The administration barely mentioned that April attack, and instead maintained its myopic focus on Iraq. The president's Iraq-centric foreign policy is taking away attention and resources that should be spent combating the terrorist threats that exist around the world, from North Africa to Southeast Asia. It is time for the administration to recognize the true global nature of the threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates." 
   In his reaction to the April 2007 bombings in Algeria and Morocco, Senator Feingold, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, said, "The bombings should also remind us of the need to be more globally focused in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates, which must be our national security priority."
