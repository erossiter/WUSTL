SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON REACTING TO PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS ON IRAQ
  "The President wants to keep the same pre-surge level of troops bogged down in an open-ended mission in Iraq, while Al Qaeda continues to strengthen and regenerate itself in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The President can pretend that drawing down the surge is a redeployment strategy, but the American people aren't fooled. Next week, I intend to push for a vote on my proposal to safely redeploy our troops from Iraq so that we can focus on the global fight against Al Qaeda."
