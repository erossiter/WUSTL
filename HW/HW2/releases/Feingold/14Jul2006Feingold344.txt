SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR GAO STUDY OF CHEESE TRADING ON CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE
  Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is calling on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study if cheese trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is susceptible to price manipulation and suggest improvements that may be needed. Feingold, along with Sens. Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), took the lead in writing GAO Comptroller General David Walker requesting the study nearly ten years after price manipulation was uncovered in cheese trading on the old National Cheese Exchange based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. 
   "Ten years ago a study found that the cheese trading in Green Bay was susceptible to price manipulation causing dairy farmers in Wisconsin and across the country to question the validity of the prices that are linked to what they receive for their milk," Feingold said. "We need to determine whether in the past decade since cheese trading moved to Chicago, improvements have been made or if our dairy farmers continue to have a reason to be concerned."
   In 1996, a report commissioned by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection showed that the National Cheese Exchange, which was then based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was susceptible to price manipulation. Feingold has long called for better federal oversight and in 1997 he offered legislation to reduce the reliance of milk pricing on the questionable trading at the National Cheese Exchange. In 1997, that exchange was closed and trading moved to the CME.
   In the letter, the Senators ask for the GAO to explore several issues including:
   * How the CME market is currently structured to facilitate price discovery, fairness and deter manipulation and other abuses
   * What the risks are of price manipulation at the current CME cheese market and whether there is any evidence of questionable trading such as that found in the 1996 report
   * To what extent the CME has considered to improve its cheese market based on its own internal analysis or from outside parties
   * What role, if any, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or other federal agencies play in overseeing the CME's cheese market
   * What changes could be made at the CME or in federal oversight to improve the market's price discovery, fairness and integrity.
