SEN. FEINGOLD BACKS EFFORT TO HELP STATES PROTECT FAMILIES
  Sen. Russ Feingold is supporting legislation to reinstate funding for a program to help states protect families. The Child Support Enforcement program is a successful program that helps states protect families through the collection of child support payments and by establishing paternity. In a letter to the Senate Finance Committee, Feingold urged that the committee take up and pass the Child Support Protection Act, which would reinstate funding that was cut in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. 
   "The Child Support Enforcement program helps to make sure that child support payments make it to the children and families who are counting on that financial support," Feingold said. "The funding for this program should never have been cut in the first place, and by reinstating funding we can act in the best interests of Wisconsin families."
   The Child Support Enforcement program has been exceptionally successful, providing support in 2005 to nearly 16 million families and collecting more than $23 billion across the country. However, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 included drastic cuts to funding for states to use for child support enforcement. Reinstating these funds can help deliver economic relief to families so they are able to leave welfare rolls or other means of assistance and regain their independence.
