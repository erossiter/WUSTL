SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPUBLICANS BLOCKING RESTORATION OF HABEAS CORPUS
  "It is deeply disappointing that a minority of the Senate once again blocked efforts to restore the writ of Habeas Corpus. The Military Commissions Act, which Congress passed last year, contradicted the fundamental principle that in America, the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily. We can and should bring terrorists to justice but we can do it without sacrificing the values upon which our nation was built."
