SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR INCLUDING DEFENSE COSTS IN BUDGET
  Sen. Russ Feingold is offering an amendment to the 2006 Budget Resolution that would include funds for the known cost of military end strength and Army modularity changes that the President chose to omit from his budget plan.  
 The amendment would create reserve funds to pay for theses programs in the budget rather than depending on future supplementals, which are only meant for unforeseen and unanticipated costs, to pay for them. 
   "The administration has a disturbing pattern of behavior when it comes to budgeting not only for the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but also for military requirements not directly related to these conflicts," Feingold said. "My amendment would encourage responsible budgeting for important ongoing initiatives like the Army's modularity program by including them in the budget resolution."
   The end strength reserve fund would help pay for the 33,000 military personnel the administration knows we will have but did not pay for. The modularity reserve fund would help pay for the Army's ongoing transformation plan to create more deployable brigades. 
   "By using supplemental bills to pay for initiatives and bypassing the regular budget process, the administration is being less than forthcoming with their actual costs," Feingold said. "I will continue to fight to restore some fiscal discipline to the budget process which, in the last few years, has been less than responsible with American taxpayer dollars."
