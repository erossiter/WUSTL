SEN. FEINGOLD PUSHES SENATE TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE FOR NATIVE AMERICANS
  Sen. Russ Feingold, along with a group of his Senate colleagues, is pushing for immediate passage of legislation to strengthen Native American health care.  
 Since its enactment in 1976, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) has been instrumental in improving the health and well-being of Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The reauthorization of IHCIA, which is currently awaiting Senate floor action, would reauthorize the program for the first time since 1992. In a letter to the Majority Leader, the senators called statistics detailing the poor state of Native American health care as "shocking" and "unacceptable."
   "The disparities in health care between Native Americans and other Americans are simply appalling," Feingold said. "We need to immediately address the health care crisis that the Native American population faces to help curb these disturbing trends."
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) cites estimates by the Department of Health and Human Services that per capita health spending for all Americans is $5,065, while the amount spent on Native American health is about $1,914 per person. USCCR adds that the federal government spends nearly twice as much money for a federal prisoner's health care than it does for a Native American or Alaska Native. The disparity in funding is matched by disparities in health for Native Americans, including shorter life spans, higher tuberculosis and diabetes rates, and higher infant mortality rates.
   "It is our responsibility to help honor the federal government's commitment to Native Americans by working to improve their health and well-being," Feingold said.
