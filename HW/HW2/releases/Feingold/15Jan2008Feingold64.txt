SENS. FEINGOLD, KOHL MAKE EVERY SENATE VOTE IN 2007
  U.S. Senators Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl made every one of the U.S. Senate's 442 votes in 2007, making Wisconsin only one of two states where both senators had perfect voting attendance records. Feingold and Kohl were two of only ten U.S. Senators not to miss a single vote during the first session of the 110th Congress. The average U.S. Senator made about 420 of the 442 votes cast in 2007. 
   "Wisconsinites depend on the people they elect to show up and represent Wisconsin in the Senate to the best of their ability," said Feingold, who has only missed ten votes in his fifteen years as a U.S. Senator, earning him a lifetime attendance record of 99.81 percent. "I am honored that Wisconsinites have entrusted me with representing them and I take that responsibility very seriously. I will continue to do everything I can to ensure the people of Wisconsin are heard in the U.S. Senate."
   "It continues to be my great honor and privilege to represent the people of Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate," Kohl said. "I take my responsibilities as a Senator seriously and know Wisconsinites expect me to ensure their voice be consistently heard in our nation's capital."
   Along with Wisconsin, Maine was the only other state whose two senators were present for every vote. The other eight senators who were present for all 442 votes were Max Baucus (D-MT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Harry Reid (D-NV), Ken Salazar (D-CO), and Olympia Snowe (R-ME).
