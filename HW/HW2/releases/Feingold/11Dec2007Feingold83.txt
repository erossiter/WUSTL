WISCONSIN CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS OUTRAGED BY ABRUPT CLOSURE OF NORTHWOODS VA CLINICS
  Seventh District Congressman Dave Obey (D-WI) and Senators Herb Kohl (D-WI) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) today expressed outrage at the abrupt closure of the veterans' outpatient clinics in Rice Lake and Hayward this week. Corporate Health and Wellness Inc., the contractor that runs the clinics for the Veterans' Administration, shut down the clinics yesterday, which provided care for more than 900 veterans, with no advanced warning.  
   "We worked for years to get these two clinics opened, and now, just a few months after they opened their doors, they're gone and our veterans have been left holding the bag," said Obey. "It's behavior like this that shows why contracting out government services is a real risk to the taxpayer and the American public."
   "This is a disgrace, to strand these veterans without access to the quality health care they have earned and deserve. We know that the VA shares our concern and is scrambling to find a way to keep these clinics operational," Kohl said.
   "I was appalled to learn about the closure of the Hayward and Rice Lake clinics," said Feingold. "The VA has informed me that it is working to re-open the clinics as soon as possible. I will be demanding that the VA does everything necessary to ensure that, in the interim, our veterans, who have already sacrificed on behalf of their country, continue to have access to the best care."
   The VA has assured the delegation that all affected veterans will be informed and provided care at alternative locations. The delegation has called on the VA to re-open the clinics as soon as possible.
   Veterans seeking information on what alternative care is available are encouraged to call the VA at 1-866-414-5058, extension 1100.
