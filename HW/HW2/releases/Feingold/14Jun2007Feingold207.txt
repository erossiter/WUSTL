SEN. FEINGOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FLAG DAY
  Today we all take the time to honor one of the most recognized symbols of freedom anywhere in the world - the American flag. The stars and stripes fill every American with pride. Whenever we see the flag, we are reminded of our freedom to speak, to worship, and to believe. As communities across America celebrate National Flag Day, we all recognize how fortunate we are to be citizens of the country the Star Spangled Banner represents.
