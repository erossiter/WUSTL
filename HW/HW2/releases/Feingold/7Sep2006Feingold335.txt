SEN. FEINGOLD ANNOUNCES COLUMBIA COUNTY CONNECTS TO RECEIVE FUNDS TO FIGHT DRUG ABUSE
  Sen. Russ Feingold has announced that Columbia County Connects Coalition has been awarded a $100,000 grant to help keep kids off drugs. The grant was awarded through the Drug-Free Communities Support Program, which is administered by the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy. Earlier this year, Feingold wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice in support of an application by Columbia County Connects for funding. 
   "I am very pleased I was able to help Columbia County Connects receive this important funding to help fight drug abuse through education and community collaboration," Feingold said. "These resources will help the dedicated community members and organizations throughout Columbia County educate kids about the dangers of drugs and teach them how to be leaders and make smart choices."
   "We understand how fortunate we are to have received this funding. It is a reflection of the hard work and determination of our many volunteer members and organizations. It also represents the collaboration between the many community organizations in our county who believe in what we are doing. This grant will allow us to continue our work on creating the best environment for our youth to live and grow in," said Tim Belleau, Coalition Coordinator for Columbia County Connects.
   Columbia County Connects is one of only 107 new community coalitions nationwide to receive this funding. Columbia County Connects is a coalition that focuses on reducing substance abuse among youth and strengthening community collaboration. The coalition is made up of members of local school districts, the county health and human services department, law enforcement agencies, the media, anti-tobacco groups, and faith-based organizations.
