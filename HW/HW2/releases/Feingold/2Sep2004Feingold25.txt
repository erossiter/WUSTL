SEN. FEINGOLD WELCOMES ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT FOR WILDERNESS DESIGNATION FOR APOSTLES
  Sen. Russ Feingold today welcomed the administration's decision to recommend federal wilderness protection for the Apostle Islands. Sen. Feingold has led a six-year bipartisan effort to give the Apostle Islands wilderness protection, including securing funding for the Wilderness Suitability Study that the administration completed today. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore includes 21 forested islands and 12 miles of pristine shoreline that are among the Great Lakes' most spectacular scenery. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore also includes more lighthouses than any other coastline of similar size in the United States, and is home to diverse wildlife including black bears, bald eagles and deer. Its campgrounds and acres of forest make the Apostles a favorite destination for hikers, sailors, kayakers, and bikers. 
   "The Apostle Islands, which are so near and dear to my heart and the hearts of many Wisconsinites, clearly deserve this protection," Feingold said. "On the day before the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act, it is only appropriate that we recognize what our nation's leaders recognized 40 years ago -- we must preserve our wild places. I look forward to working with my congressional colleagues to provide wilderness protection for this pristine area." 
   "I hope that the administration will show its support for wilderness and public lands in Wisconsin and the nation by committing to provide more funding for the national park system, for the land and water conservation fund, and for wilderness areas across the country," Feingold added.
   In working to protect the Apostle Islands, Feingold accomplished the following:
   * Authored the Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1998, which called for a wilderness study for the Apostles and restoration of Apostle Island lighthouses;
   * Reintroduced the bill in 1999 and successfully obtained a Senate hearing on the Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1999, 
   * Secured Senate passage of the bill twice, and House passage as part of a larger public lands bill;
   * Amended the fiscal year 2001 Department of Interior appropriations bill to include $200,000 to conduct a wilderness suitability study for the Apostles and $1.96 million for repair and restoration of the Raspberry Island and Outer Island Lighthouses;
   * Successfully included language in the fiscal year 2002 Department of Interior appropriations bill to ensure that the allocated funds for the Apostle Islands wilderness study would remain available until expended.
