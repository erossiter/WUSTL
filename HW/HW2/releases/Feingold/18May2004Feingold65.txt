SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTS RESOLUTION CALLING FOR ACTION ON HIGH GAS PRICES
  Sen. Russ Feingold is cosponsoring a resolution calling on the administration to address skyrocketing gas prices by pressing OPEC to increase production and by protecting the American people from price gouging.  
 The resolution also asks the administration to suspend deliveries of oil to the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) and release from the SPR one million barrels of oil per day for at least 30 days to circumvent OPEC's stranglehold on the world oil supply. The law allows these reserves to be used to provide relief when oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic hardship.
   "This administration needs to address gas prices, which have reached record highs across the country through unfair practices by both OPEC and oil corporations," Feingold said. "By challenging OPEC to increase production, cracking down on unfair practices at the gas pump, and releasing stored oil as the law says we can, we can protect the American consumer from these out-of-control prices."
   The SPR is currently 94 percent full but the administration continues to fill it with hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. By continuing to purchase oil for the reserve, the government is taking oil off the market that would be otherwise available for the American consumer. During the summer and fall of 2000, President Clinton released 30 million barrels of oil to combat and stabilize rising gas prices.
   "As these gas prices shoot through the roof, OPEC countries are benefitting while American families are the ones to suffer," Feingold said. "Our country has the means with which to reverse these trends but the Administration has failed to bring much-needed relief to our working families."
