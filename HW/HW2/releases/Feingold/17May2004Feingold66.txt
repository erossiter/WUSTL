SEN. FEINGOLD LEGISLATION WILL HELP IMPROVE TRANSITION SERVICES FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL
  Sen. Russ Feingold today introduced the Veterans Enhanced Transition Services (VETS) bill, which will enhance and strengthen transition services that are provided for our military personnel. Feingold has previously introduced legislation to make sure that veterans are aware of the benefits they have earned. The comprehensive legislation he introduced today will help to ensure that military personnel learn about the benefits they have earned while serving our country. The VETS bill will, among other things, expand services available at the time of discharge, require demobilization physicals, including mental health screenings, and authorize the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to help military personnel get college credit for applicable military training. A summary of Feingold's VETS legislation is attached. 
   "Our military men and women risk their lives on our behalf. They spend time away from their homes and families in different parts of the country and the world, and often are placed into harm's way. Our servicemen and women deserve to know about the benefits they most certainly have earned," Feingold said. "I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites and military and veterans service organizations that our men and women in uniform do not all have access to the same transition counseling and medical services when they return from deployments around the world. All of our men and women in uniform have pledged to serve our country, and all of them, at the very least, deserve to have access to the same, high-quality services in return."
   Feingold's VETS legislation is supported by a wide range of groups that are dedicated to serving our men and women in uniform, veterans and their families. These groups include: the American Legion; the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States; the Paralyzed Veterans of America; the Reserve Officers Association; the Veterans of Foreign Wars; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin National Guard; the American Legion, Department of Wisconsin; Disabled American Veterans, Department of Wisconsin; the Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans of America; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Wisconsin; and the Wisconsin State Council, Vietnam Veterans of America.
   "We must ensure that the men and women who are currently serving in our Armed Forces receive adequate pay and benefits, as well as services that help them to make the transition from active duty to civilian life," Feingold said. "My bill will help to ensure that all military personnel have access to the same transition services as they prepare to leave the military to reenter civilian life, or, in the case of members of the National Guard and Reserve, as they prepare to demobilize from active duty assignments and return to their civilian lives and jobs or education while remaining in the military. We must ensure that their service and sacrifice, which is much lauded during times of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles have ended and our troops have come home."
   The Veterans' Enhanced Transition Services Act (VETS Act)
   Senator Russ Feingold introduced the VETS Act on May 17, 2004. This bill will enhance and strengthen transition services that are provided to our military personnel in five areas.
   Improved Administration of Transition Assistance Programs 
   * Requires that all discharging military personnel, as well as all demobilizing National Guard and Reserve personnel, participate in the Transition Assistance Program or Disabled Transition Assistance Program (TAP/DTAP).
   * Directs that TAP/DTAP briefings be provided uniformly by all of the services and at all demobilization/discharge locations, and that the briefings include information specific to the needs of active duty, National Guard and Reserve personnel.
   * Requires that TAP/DTAP counseling include information on certification and licensing requirements in civilian occupations and on identifying military occupations that have civilian counterparts. Also directs the Secretaries of Defense and Labor to jointly study ways in which DoD job training and certification standards could be coordinated with state laws.
   * Requires that a copy of medical records for all personnel who are separating from active duty be transmitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
   * Requires participation in the Labor Department's transition services program, with limited exceptions.
   Improved Access to Benefits Delivery at Discharge Program
   * Expands the joint DoD-VA Benefits Delivery at Discharge program, which helps personnel in applying for VA disability benefits before they are discharged from the military, to all discharging military installations and hospitals.
   Improvements to Post-Deployment Medical Assessment and Services
   * Requires demobilization physicals, including mental health screenings and assessments, for all personnel.
   * Requires minimum content and standards for demobilization physicals and mental health screenings and assessments, to be applied uniformly at all Armed Forces medical facilities.
   * Requires that mental health screenings and assessments include screening for acute and delayed onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including questions to identify all stressors experienced by military personnel that have the potential to lead to PTSD.
   * Specifies that a physical consisting solely or primarily of a questionnaire will not satisfy this requirement and that medical examinations may not be waived.
   * Ensures that personnel receive follow-up care for any conditions (including mental health conditions) that are found, or suspected, as a result of the physical.
   * Requires a joint DoD-VA study on how to improve coordination and cooperation between the two Departments to support the provision of benefits to members and veterans.
   * Ensures that personnel with symptoms of PTSD and related illnesses have access to appropriate clinical services. Requires the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to report on planning and training for identification and treatment of personnel with PTSD and related conditions.
   * Requires that assistance be provided to eligible members to enroll in the VA health care system.
   Improved Access for Military and Veterans Service Agencies and Organizations
   * Authorizes a "veteran to veteran" pre-separation counseling program that will allow MSOs and VSOs to counsel demobilizing or discharging military personnel on their options before they sign any paperwork. Would include hospital visits and access to demobilization sites and would require military installations and hospitals and VA hospitals to grant access to MSOs and VSOs to visit and/or counsel military personnel and veterans regarding benefits.
   * Requires that VSOs, MSOs, and state departments of veterans affairs be invited to participate in all TAP/DTAP and BDD briefings.
   College Credit for Service in the Armed Forces
   * Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program to help military personnel get college credit for applicable military training.
