SEN. FEINGOLD SUPPORTS BILL REFORMING NATIONAL IMMIGRATION POLICY
  Sen. Russ Feingold is cosponsoring legislation reforming the nation's immigration laws to provide an earned legalization program for undocumented workers already in the country.  
 The Safe, Orderly Legal Visas and Enforcement (SOLVE) Act also creates a new temporary worker program and keeps families intact. Under this legislation, to apply for legal permanent residency, undocumented workers would have to show that they have resided in the United States for at least five years and have worked for at least two of those five years. The bill comes after President Bush outlined, in January of this year, a temporary worker plan for undocumented workers already in the U.S. and foreign workers who wish to come to the U.S.
   "Our nation needs sensible immigration reform that addresses the reality that millions of undocumented workers are already here and contribute to our economy and communities each and every day," Feingold said. "For our nation's security and to be true to our nation's values of fairness and justice, we should bring these workers out of the shadows."
   The bill also has family reunification provisions so that people who have filed petitions for adjustment status to legal permanent residency can remain in the country with their families while their applications are being processed. The bill is supported by the Latino, Asian, immigrant rights, and religious communities and by the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and UFCW.
   "There is bipartisan agreement in the country that our immigration policies need to be updated," Feingold said. "Our laws need to reflect the fact that American businesses need access to foreign workers for jobs they cannot fill with American workers. Foreign workers who have paid their dues should be treated fairly and deserve the protections of all working Americans."
