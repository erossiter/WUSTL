SEN. FEINGOLD CALLS FOR ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME AMERICANS
  Sen. Russ Feingold is calling on Senate appropriators to include low income energy assistance in the next Hurricane Katrina supplemental bill.  
 In a letter to the Senate Appropriations committee leadership, Feingold and a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues asked that the funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) be included in the supplemental in order to avoid a looming home heating crisis due to soaring energy costs as winter approaches. Another emergency supplemental spending bill is expected to be considered in October.
   \"Because of the tragic effects of Hurricane Katrina, energy costs across the board are becoming less and less affordable for more and more Americans,\" Feingold said. \"This assistance is critical in helping people in need stay safe and warm this winter.\"
   Even before Hurricane Katrina struck, the Energy Information Administration predicted a 16 percent rise in heating oil costs. But now natural gas prices are 140 percent more than they were at this time last year. Many American families paying for heating oil may be paying over $400 more than they did last winter. Families paying for natural gas could be paying over $600 more than they did last year. 
   \"Residents and businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina deserve the nation\'s full support and financial assistance, and we stand ready and willing to do everything we can to help,\" the letter stated. \"We feel that preventing hardship for millions of Americans by acting to provide LIHEAP emergency funds before we have another crisis on our hands is an important priority.
