SEN. FEINGOLD CONTINUES EFFORT TO STOP BACK-DOOR PAY RAISE SYSTEM
  Sen. Russ Feingold is continuing his efforts to require Senators to vote on any pay increase they receive. The current pay raise system increases the salary of members of Congress unless they take action to stop it. Last year, the Senate passed a provision, co-sponsored by Feingold, to stop the automatic pay raise but it was stripped out of the Treasury-Transportation spending bill during negotiations with the House of Representatives. Feingold plans to offer an amendment as early as the Department of Defense Authorization bill currently being considered on the Senate floor. 
   "Most Americans don't have the luxury of receiving automatic pay raises," Feingold said. "At a time of record-setting deficits and the ballooning cost of the war in Iraq, raising our own pay sets a terrible example. I am optimistic that this year, many of my Senate colleagues will agree with this common sense amendment, and work to stop this back-door pay raise."
   Feingold accepts no pay increase throughout his six-year term, accepting only the rate of pay that Senators were eligible to receive on the date on which he was last sworn in as a Senator. He returns to the National Treasury any additional income senators get during their six-year term.
