SENATE APPROVES SEN. FEINGOLD MEASURE REQUIRING REPORT ON GOVERNMENT DATA-MINING
  Sen. Russ Feingold announced today that the Senate has passed an amendment he authored to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) fiscal year 2005 appropriations bill requiring the DHS Secretary to report to Congress on any data-mining programs that DHS is currently developing or using.  
 The amendment mandates that the DHS Secretary explain why the Department is using data-mining technology. The amendment would also make sure that DHS has considered and developed policies to protect the privacy and due process rights of individuals, and ensure that only accurate information is collected and used. The amendment is modeled after the Data-Mining Reporting Act that Sen. Feingold introduced last year.
   "The American people deserve to know how their government uses data-mining technology and how it obtains and uses the highly personal information being gathered about law-abiding American citizens," Feingold said. "It should be the responsibility of the administration to report to Congress what it has learned about data-mining programs, and how the civil liberties and privacy of this nation's citizens are affected by these programs."
   Data-mining is an untested and controversial intelligence procedure that is capable of maintaining extensive files containing both public and private records on each and every American. Rather than preventing data-mining, Feingold's amendment simply ensures that Congress and the public know about the data-mining activities of federal agencies.
   "Most Americans view their civil liberties and right to privacy as vital to living in a free society," Feingold said. "By requiring the Department of Homeland Security to report on data-mining programs, Congress can weigh the proposed benefits of these programs against the effects they may have on our privacy and personal liberties without preventing the Department from fulfilling its important mission."
