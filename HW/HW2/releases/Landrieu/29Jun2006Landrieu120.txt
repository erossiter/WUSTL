Landrieu Proposes Estate Tax Relief and Reform Act         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 29 2006    Landrieu Proposes Estate Tax Relief and Reform Act Bill would raise exemption  lower tax rate to provide significant relief and greater certainty for American taxpayers     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary Landrieu  D La   today announced that she is introducing a bill to bring relief and reform to the federal estate tax system  Under Sen  Landrieu s proposal  99 99 percent of Louisiana residents would no longer be subject to any federal estate tax whatsoever and there would be a rate cut for those who would still have a tax liability   This is a plan that has a chance to pass Congress   said Sen  Landrieu  who added that she hopes the plan will serve as the blueprint for future Congressional debate and compromise on the issue    Unlike the current law  my plan is clear  simple and fair   she said    It gives most opponents of the estate tax what they want  a significant tax cut  It gives most reformers what they want  a stable and predictable system that enables long term estate planning  It gives most small business people and farmers what they want  a chance to keep what they have built up in their families over a lifetime of hard work  And it does all of this in a way that is fiscally responsible    How can people do wise and informed estate planning under the current system  which is unstable  uncertain and unfair   Sen  Landrieu asked    We need certainty   We need reform   And we need relief   I think my proposal lays a clear  balanced path to each   Under Sen  Landrieu s Estate Tax Relief and Reform Act of 2006  the federal estate tax exemption level would be set at  5 million per person and  10 million per couple  The current exemption is  2 million per person but falls to  1 million in 2011   By dramatically raising the exemption  we will effectively get most people of Louisiana out of the tax altogether and forever   Sen  Landrieu said   This is especially beneficial for many small business owners and family farmers   The Landrieu bill would also cut to 35 percent the federal estate tax rate  which is currently set to a top rate of 46 percent and is scheduled to rise to 55 percent in 2011   This proposed rate cut goes a long way to ending the onerous burden that opponents of the federal estate tax have legitimately argued against for years   said Sen  Landrieu  whose plan would also impose a five percent surtax on estates worth over  100 million   Additionally  the proposal would provide significant benefits for estates that include inheritances of active businesses  farms and ranches by allowing them to value these assets at  current value  as opposed to the higher valuation tied to  best and highest use     Sen  Landrieu said she opposed a full repeal of the tax because it would have cost too much in light of the large federal deficit  the War on Terror and ongoing Gulf Coast hurricane recovery costs    I did not believe a full repeal would have been the fiscally responsible thing to do at a time like this   she said  adding that her plan would cost the federal treasury about  245 billion over the next 10 years  according to current estimates    That is considerably less than even the most modest estimates of what a full repeal would cost   It is a highly reasonable and fair alternative    Sen  Landrieu stressed the paramount need for certainty and stability in reforming the estate tax system  noting that if nothing is done  the estate tax rate will shift three times over the next five years and the exemption level will shift three times
