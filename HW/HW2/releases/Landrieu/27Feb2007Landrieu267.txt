Landrieu Introduces Bill to Solve Road Home SBA Disaster Loan Issue         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 27 2007    Landrieu Introduces Bill to Solve Road Home SBA Disaster Loan Issue Legislation removes bureaucracy in hurricane recovery     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced the Catastrophic Disaster Recovery Improvements Act  which will allow the Small Business Administration  SBA  Administrator to waive the duplication of benefits requirement under the Small Business Act for catastrophic disasters   The Small Business Act requires those who receive both an SBA Disaster Loan and a Louisiana Road Home grant to use the Road Home grant to pay the balance of the SBA loan if there is a duplication of benefits    Hurricane victims will be unable to rebuild if they are forced to use their federal grants to pay off their federal loans   Sen  Landrieu said    We cannot let bureaucratic requirements stand in the way of Louisiana s recovery   To recover and rebuild after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  recovery money must be kept in Louisiana  not sent back to a different agency in Washington   Currently  the SBA interprets the  duplication of benefits  rule in the Small Business Act to require Louisiana SBA disaster loan borrowers to use State administered  Supplemental CDBG funded housing grants to repay SBA Disaster Loan proceeds   The Catastrophic Disaster Recovery Improvements Act provides the SBA Administrator the flexibility to fully or partially waive this rule for future major disasters and makes the changes retroactive for victims of Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma   This provides borrowers with additional funds for rebuilding while still retaining the Federal government s role to ensure financial responsibility to taxpayers   Representative Charlie Melancon  D La   will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives   While I appreciate the need to ensure there is no misuse of federal recovery money  these Federal regulations are impeding Louisiana s recovery   Hurricane victims  loss is often greater than the maximum SBA loan limits  and they need help to deal with increases in building and labor costs while they wait for insurance payouts   For major disasters  SBA needs more flexibility in dealing with these State recovery programs   This commonsense solution will remove some of the red tape that is currently hampering our recovery
