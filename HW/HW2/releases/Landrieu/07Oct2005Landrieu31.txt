Landrieu Works Through Night to Protect Louisiana Local Governments         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 07 05    Landrieu Works Through Night to Protect Louisiana Local Governments Met by Republican opposition intent on setting unprecedented double standard for hurricane disaster loans     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   having not left the U S  Capitol complex since very early Thursday morning  returned to the Senate floor today to again urge Senate Republicans to provide local governments affected by Hurricane Katrina with the immediate assistance they need    without unprecedented strings attached    Fulfilling her commitment to employ all options available to ensure that the Senate took action on immediate Hurricane Katrina relief and recovery needs before breaking for a one week Columbus Day recess  Sen  Landrieu spoke on the Senate floor for much of the day yesterday  delaying a vote on the Defense Appropriations bill  By late Thursday  the Senate was debating a White House proposal advanced by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   and Senator David Vitter  R La   which would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to apply  750 million toward providing community disaster loans for areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The money would come out of  43 billion the agency has left unspent of the nearly  62 billion appropriated to it by Congress last month  and was an increase over the White House s  last and best  offer of  300 million on Wednesday    before Sen  Landrieu took to the floor for much of Wednesday evening into all day Thursday    The loans are intended to help local governments cover payroll and operation costs  despite having lost significant tax revenue following the displacement of their residents   Three months  just three months   Sen  Landrieu said    While we go on vacation again  just give them three months   Lend them some money to keep their lights on  to give their cities and their communities and the hospitals hope until we can figure out a long range plan   Holding the floor until 2 a m  in a procedural stalemate where Republican leaders would not allow her to speak  Sen  Landrieu allowed the Senate to adjourn for six hours to allow staff to rest   During this time  she continued negotiations regarding the disaster loan program before retiring for a brief rest of her own on a Senate couch    Returning to the floor with a one hour speech early this morning  the senator highlighted several areas of serious concern regarding the Vitter Frist bill   In particular  the bill specifically prohibits the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities are unable to pay them back   The U S  Conference of Mayors today said that the group was  outraged  by the prohibition  which has never been enacted for any previous federal disaster loan  nor does it affect any future loans outside the hurricane affected area     We now have a third rate FEMA operating  a second class levee system  and now to pour salt on the wound  a tightfisted lending policy applied only to us   Sen  Landrieu said  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports that between 1974 and 1995  20 of 52 community disaster loans given had been partially or completely forgiven  with only 13 loans having been fully repaid  The Vitter Frist bill also does not ensure that Louisiana sheriffs will be eligible for the loans   Unlike many states  Louisiana sheriffs are elected independently of local governments in the areas where they serve  and have their own independent tax authority   As a result  they do not fit within the definition of a  local government  by the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  the governing law which establishes the Community Disaster Loans program   Similarly  the bill does not ensure that three private  not for profit hospitals    Ochsner  West Jefferson and East Jefferson    will be eligible for loans  as they too fail to meet the Stafford Act requirements   An historian once described New Orleans as an inevitable city in an impossible location   Sen  Landrieu said    I think that pretty much captures where we are today   We re having an inevitable debate that places the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast in an impossible situation   We ask for a loan  but get nothing but empty promises and tightfisted lending policies   Despite repeated requests by Sen  Landrieu for guarantees that the sheriffs and hospitals would be included in the final legislation  Republican leaders refused to add any such guarantee to the bill   Sen  Landrieu also offered multiple compromise proposals to allow for the forgiveness of loans in dire circumstances  but each was rejected   Sens  Frist and Vitter said the forgiveness prohibition would be necessary in order to gain support for the measure from the U S  House of Representatives  and that no compromise would be possible as a result   However  House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis  R Calif   did agree to one compromise offering Thursday night to which Sen  Frist objected this morning   A compromise is an effort to do the best you can for people while preserving some important principles   Sen  Landrieu said    This is no compromise   This is an agreement between the right wing and the far right wing   People who are holding the power and not willing to use it on behalf of people that need help in this nation   The bill eventually passed in a unanimous consent vote today  with Sen  Landrieu providing her consent in order to assure the loan funds would be available to Louisiana communities  albeit with unfair strings attached  Sen  Landrieu said   I hope the people of Louisiana and the people that I ve represented proudly for so long can understand why I spent the evening here and why I m going to continue to stay at this desk as often as I can in between trips at home Visiting with local elected leaders  trying to help organize meetings  supporting all the local officials    Democrats and Republicans  black and white  urban and suburban  rich and poor    to try to help us rebuild the state that s not only a state that we love  but a region that the country needs even though the country refuses to understand how valuable we are to them   The Senate returns from its recess on Monday  October 17th     30
