Louisiana Senators on the Second Emergency Relief Funding         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 08 05    Louisiana Senators on the Second Emergency Relief Funding Senate passes second emergency appropriations for hurricane relief     WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and David Vitter  R La   tonight issued the following statements after the Senate s passage of H R  3673 by a unanimous vote for  50 billion in relief funding for the areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina   We appreciate the release of an additional  50 billion to the people of Louisiana   said Sen  Landrieu    The assistance is desperately required   However  I remain concerned that FEMA s efforts thus far have been unable to bring the needed immediate and direct assistance to the people of my state   More funding will clearly be needed to rebuild and revitalize the Gulf Coast region  and as the Administration considers the best avenue to provide this funding  I encourage them to provide direct financial support for our first responders that have shown much of the leadership FEMA has lacked    Louisiana suffered catastrophic devastation from Hurricane Katrina  and it is continuing to this day   This  50 billion will keep our short term rescue and recovery efforts going   said Sen  Vitter    We will need more  targeted funding from the federal government for affected areas as we move to the next phase of recovery from one of the worst natural disasters in our nation s history   We will do what it takes to rebuild southeast Louisiana     30
