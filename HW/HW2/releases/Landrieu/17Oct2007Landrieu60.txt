Senate Passes CJS Bill with Key Landrieu Amendments         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 17 2007    Senate Passes CJS Bill with Key Landrieu Amendments Includes  3 5 million for La  Projects  Landrieu amendments for NOPD  Michoud  Jena and shrimpers     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate last night passed 75 19 the Commerce Justice Science  CJS  appropriations bill  HR 3093  that included a number of provisions for Louisiana authored by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   including a waiver for hurricane affected communities of matching payments required to receive federal COPS grants    The City of New Orleans has the highest per capita murder rate in the country  and Congress must step in to help combat this crime surge   Sen  Landrieu said   With much of the New Orleans Police Department and other Louisiana law enforcement agencies still operating out of temporary facilities  budgets are stretched thin  This amendment helps our communities buy the equipment they need and put more officers on the street to drive crime from our city    The Community Oriented Policing  COPS  program provides grants for local police departments to hire more officers  provide overtime pay  and obtain equipment and support systems  It normally requires localities to pay at least 25 percent of the expense  Under Sen  Landrieu s amendment  that requirement would be waived  and the federal government would bear the full cost of new grants to the region   Jena Community Reconciliation Amendment The CJS bill also included a Landrieu amendment requiring the hiring of at least three new community conciliators for the Louisiana region  The Department of Justice s Community Relations Service works with local leaders and community groups to facilitate reconciliation during periods of racial or ethnic tension  The Service will now be directed to spend  2 million on the expansion of this and other regional offices   The Service did not arrive in Jena until nine months after the hanging of a noose in a tree on the grounds of Jena High School and six months after the charging of six African American students  Region 6    which includes Louisiana  Texas  Oklahoma  New Mexico and Arkansas    currently employs only three people  but the Landrieu amendment doubles their manpower   By the time the Service came to Jena  Louisiana  people s minds were already made up about what had happened and racial tensions had spiraled out of control  The community as a whole has suffered  This increase in Service staffing will work to ease the situation in Jena and prevent future incidents like this    NASA Amendment Sen  Landrieu also cosponsored an amendment in the CJS bill that will provide  1 billion in emergency funding to NASA to make up for the costs incurred to put the space shuttle back in flight after the Columbia disaster    Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans East and the 4 000 employees who work there desperately need this funding   Sen  Landrieu said   Since  1961  Michoud has been supporting the U S  space program   Shrimping Amendment Another included Landrieu amendment will provide up to  275 000 to shrimpers in storm impacted areas to help them comply with impending regulations that would affect fishing in the Gulf      Our Louisiana shrimpers suffered greatly from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Sen  Landrieu said   This amendment will prevent our shrimpers from having to come up with additional out of pocket expenses to comply with new NOAA rules   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  recently announced a potential regulation that would require devices to be placed on shrimp nets to reduce inadvertent red snapper bycatch  Each device costs about  275  and the Landrieu amendment could provide about 1 000 devices to Gulf shrimpers for free  with NOAA providing an additional 1 000 free devices  Louisiana Projects The CJS bill included  3 5 million for nine Louisiana projects  including  1 7 million for the Louisiana State University Coastal Restoration and Enhancement through Science and Technology project  These funds will be used to advance the science and technology of coastal habitat restoration programs    Louisiana s coastal wetlands provide a critical buffer from storm surges  but they have been disappearing at an alarming rate   Sen  Landrieu said   LSU s innovative research will help us restore our coastal habitats efficiently and effectively    Sen  Landrieu also secured  100 000 for the Forensic Chemistry Field at Grambling State University  The new facility will replace an outdated one and provide new focus on producing more graduates in science  engineering and mathematics   The legislation includes a Landrieu rider to extend the International Trade Administration full cost recovery waiver until 2008 to help Louisiana s exporters  The waiver was first included in the fiscal year 2006 CJS appropriations bill  but was set to expire Sept  30  2007  Sen  Landrieu also secured language to provide additional New Orleans U S  Export Assistance Center staff   Before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  tourism was a  9 9 billion industry  the second largest in Louisiana  and employed 175 000 workers  Sen  Landrieu secured rider language in CJS authorizing the Department of Commerce to play an active role in analyzing the ongoing tourism impact from the storms and to assist state and local tourism entities   Other Louisiana projects Sen  Landrieu secured in the bill include   LA Fisheries Recovery Resource Center  Plaquemines Parish     550 000   Orleans Parish Court Team for Maltreated Infants and Toddlers  Orleans Parish     150 000   East Baton Rouge Parish Law Enforcement Technology  East BR Parish     150 000   The Lafayette Outreach for Civil Justice Campaign  Lafayette Parish     100 000   Orleans Parish Information Sharing   Integrated System Project  Orleans Parish     250 000   Tulane Institute for Macromolecular Engineering   Science  Orleans Parish     500 000  and  Shreveport Bossier Community Renewal  Inc    Shreveport Bossier Community Renewal Model Development and Field Testing  Shreveport  LA     100 000   The CJS bill is now headed to conference with the House  President Bush has threatened a veto because of the bill s spending level
