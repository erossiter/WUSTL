Landrieu Negotiates Deal on Offshore Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 29 2006    Landrieu Negotiates Deal on Offshore Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced that she and other Gulf Coast senators have reached an agreement with Senate leaders to bring to the floor legislation that shares with Gulf Coast states a portion of the federal revenues generated by oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico      This agreement marks a significant victory in our delegation s decade long fight to secure our fair share of the substantial revenue we generate each year   said Sen  Landrieu  who represented the Gulf Coast states in final negotiations this week with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   Majority Whip Mitch McConnell  R Ky   and Senator Pete Domenici  R N M   The final measure will be formally introduced by Sen  Domenici  the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee on which Sen  Landrieu sits    Paired with Senator Domenici s leadership on energy issues  the Gulf Coast s hard work and spirit of cooperation has paid off for all our states   Sen  Landrieu said    Senator Lott has been a particularly strong partner in the negotiations  and I thank Senators Vitter  Cochran  Shelby  Sessions  Cornyn and Hutchison for all their hard work on behalf of their constituents   We have also made affirmative progress in the House of Representatives through the work of Congressmen Jindal and Melancon  whose effectiveness in bringing other Democrats on board played a key role in securing the passage of their revenue sharing bill   The plan as currently drafted would open about eight million acres of the Gulf of Mexico to energy production   A 37 5 percent share of the federal revenues generated by this lease sale and subsequent production would flow to the four Gulf Coast energy producing states  Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama    In the first ten years  Louisiana would stand to receive about a third of these funds  based on a formula that allocates shares based on each state s distance to production  with no state receiving less than ten percent   In combination with the coastal impact assistance funding secured in last year s Energy Bill  Louisiana stands to receive more than three quarters of a billion dollars over the next ten years   Beginning in 2017  coastal energy producing states would receive 37 5 percent of oil and gas revenues generated from any Gulf lease issued after the enactment of this legislation   The distribution among the Gulf Coast states would continue to be based on proximity to production  with historical production levels also taken into account   Louisiana s share would be approximately 40 to 50 percent  but the formula would be recalculated each year  Current OCS revenues are approximately  6 to  8 billion  and are expected to top  12 billion within 20 years   Conservative estimates based on forecasts from the Congressional Budget office and Minerals Management Service predict that Louisiana would under this plan receive more than  650 million per year  beginning in fiscal year 2017    The area of new production includes a 1 7 million acre section of the Gulf of Mexico known as Area 181  as well as an additional 6 3 million acres to its south      It is expected to produce more than 1 3 billion barrels of oil    more than the proven reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma combined    and at least six trillion cubic feet of natural gas  or six times current U S  imports of liquefied natural gas each year   This fight has always been one about fairness   Sen  Landrieu said    This is a fair bill that will give all the coastal states an effective tool for building levees  battling coastal erosion  securing our national economy and protecting our coastal communities   The federal government would retain 50 percent of the new revenues  and up to  450 million per year of the remaining 12 5 percent would be allocated to the state side of the Land and Water Conservation fund   Today s agreement marks the most significant advance in the state delegation s fight for its fair share since the 1998 Conservation and Reinvestment Act  CARA  and 2002 Energy Bill   Led by Sens  Landrieu and John Breaux  D La   63 senators signed a letter to the Republican and Democratic leadership demanding that CARA be brought to the floor  but no further Senate action was taken before Congress adjourned  Last year  Sens  Landrieu and David Vitter  R La   secured with Sen  Domenici a  1 billion coastal impact assistance amendment to the 2005 Energy Bill that will result in Louisiana receiving  135 million per year for the next four years   Also last year  as part of the negotiations for her pivotal vote in passing the President s Budget Resolution  Sen  Landrieu was able to secure a reserve fund of up to  10 billion for coastal protection and restoration in the Senate version of the bill  Today s agreement is expected to be brought to the floor for full Senate consideration following the Fourth of July holiday recess   The agreement does not specify definitive resolution to coastal issues raised by the Florida delegation  but the leadership is expected to address those concerns before bringing the agreement to the floor
