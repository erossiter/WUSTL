Landrieu Comments on FEMA s Decision to Keep Promise to Students         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 08 2007    Landrieu Comments on FEMA s Decision to Keep Promise to Students FEMA responds to Landrieu s letter by reversing previous decision to take back recovery grants from students     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on the Federal Emergency Management Agency s  FEMA  decision to change its policy regarding disaster assistance grants given to students living in dormitories affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Following reports that FEMA was demanding the grants be repaid  Sen  Landrieu sent a letter to FEMA Director R  David Paulison in early March requesting that the agency reverse its policy  Many dormitories at Louisiana colleges were flooded or destroyed by fire following the 2005 hurricanes   Students lost books  clothing  computers and other personal necessities and many had to transfer to out of state colleges after the storms closed their schools   Like other hurricane victims  students applied for and received expedited assistance to cover housing costs and other needs   FEMA dispersed the aid  but the agency later sent intimidating letters to students demanding that the assistance be returned   The agency today reversed its decision and is letting the students keep their grants  Sen  Landrieu said   FEMA s decision to take back money from students it had helped after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was reprehensible  Students were forced to pay for lost books  clothes and tuition at other universities  and these grants provided much needed relief so that they could get through those very difficult times   That is why I asked Director Paulison not to take back our students  money  and I am pleased that FEMA made the right decision today  Their reversal of that decision will give Louisiana students the hope and resources they need to continue to recover from the deadly storms   In her March 6 letter to Director Paulison  Sen  Landrieu wrote   It seems incomprehensible that more than a year after the hurricanes  FEMA would send out intimidating letters  with little explanation  demanding that the money be repaid or face fines and penalties   To ensure every proper consideration is being provided to impacted Louisiana students and to ease their own burdens of recovery  I respectfully request that any debt owed to you by a student from an impacted university be forgiven  except in circumstances of intentional fraud   The full text of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
