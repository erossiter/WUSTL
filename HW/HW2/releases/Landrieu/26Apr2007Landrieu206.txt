Landrieu Statement Regarding Emergency Supplemental Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 26 2007    Landrieu Statement Regarding Emergency Supplemental Bill     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today after voting in favor of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act Conference Report  which the Senate passed this afternoon 51 to 46    President George W  Bush has threatened to veto the bill in part due to hurricane recovery funding which the White House has labeled as  excessive  and  extraneous    These funds include  2 26 billion for levee reconstruction  flood control  crime prevention  historic preservation and small business  education and other economic assistance  as well as a waiver of an onerous local match requirement typically waived by Presidential order following major catastrophes    The bill also sets clear benchmarks for success in the war in Iraq  and specifies non binding goals for when Congress hopes those objectives are met  Sen  Landrieu said   A vote for this bill is a vote for the sustained recovery of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast   The funds in this legislation will fuel the recovery of our schools and businesses  help stem the crime wave that is gripping many of our communities and fully fund the repair of levees and flood control systems without borrowing against the protection of others   This funding is neither excessive nor extraneous  but the present web of red tape most certainly is   The President s opposition to extending the same fairness to our recovery as was given Florida and New York is slowing our progress as we work to rebuild   The bill also ensures that our troops on the ground will have the resources to continue their mission in Iraq  while setting clear benchmarks for how the success of that mission should be measured   It sets specific goals for when these objectives should be met  and if they are not  I believe the proper response will be to revisit these benchmarks and reassess the strategy moving forward   Let me be clear    I remain strongly opposed to any measure that denies funding for our troops or mandates an arbitrary timetable for withdrawal   I strongly urge the President to cast aside his veto threat and sign this bill   The people of Louisiana need the funding for hurricane recovery and our troops in the field need the funding for their protection and mission success
