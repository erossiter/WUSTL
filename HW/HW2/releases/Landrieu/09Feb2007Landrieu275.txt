Senators Request Presidential Waiver of 10 Percent Match for Gulf Coast Recovery         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 09 2007    Senators Request Presidential Waiver of 10 Percent Match for Gulf Coast Recovery Ask President to allow use of funds for other pressing needs     WASHINGTON    United States Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   U S  Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  D Conn   and Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery Chairman Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to President George W  Bush requesting a waiver of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  10 percent state match requirement   The State of Louisiana has been required to provide a 10 percent match for every dollar made available through FEMA s public assistance program spent in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastating failure of the Federal levee system   As you are aware  the State of Louisiana has been called upon to provide a ten percent match for every dollar made available through FEMA s public assistance program in connection with the effort to recover from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   the senators wrote    The rationale for this match may be sound in the case of an ordinary disaster   However  given the unique magnitude of this disaster  and the extremely difficult circumstances that Louisiana now faces  we believe that the most appropriate step for the Federal government is to waive the match requirement in this case   While the people of Louisiana are grateful to the nation for the help that they have received  the state still confronts a massive shortfall between the dollars that have come in from all sources and the real costs of recovery  a shortfall that the state estimates to be  40 billion   The  1 billion in matching funds that Louisiana could be required to send to the Federal government could be better spent on rental assistance  mental health  school infrastructure and a variety of other needs that have fallen through the cracks of the Stafford Act   FEMA has waived the 10 percent match requirement after several recent disasters  including the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Andrew    Since 1985  FEMA has granted waivers of the state match for public assistance in 32 different disasters   Yet having been battered by the first and third worst hurricanes in United States history  Louisiana must still meet the match requirement   the Senators wrote  The full text of the Senators  letter is available
