House Stalling Chances for Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 26 2006    House Stalling Chances for Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing Landrieu urges Gulf Coast members to  fulfill their responsibility to our states and constituents   Says  let s stop quibbling and pass what we agree on      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding the status of negotiations to open new acreage in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling and share the revenues with Gulf Coast states for hurricane protection  flood control and coastal restoration  Sen  Landrieu said   The good news is that for the first time in history  the Senate  House and President all support oil and gas revenue sharing for the Gulf Coast energy producing states   After considerable and continuing negotiations between the House and Senate  only one significant issue stands in the way of enacting this historic legislation    and that s the demand by some House members that one or more East and West Coast states open their coasts to drilling as a condition for sharing Gulf Coast revenue with the Gulf Coast states    This insistence is holding back our chances for a fair compromise  and until the House moves off this position  the deal is dead   As soon as they give up this unmovable cause  all things are possible    including substantial additional funding in the first ten years for coastal restoration and conservation programs   I urge every Gulf Coast member of Congress    Republican and Democrat    to cast aside other allegiances  and instead fulfill their responsibility to our states and constituents   The majority of the House and Senate favor opening new acreage for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico   We also all favor sharing the revenues   Let s stop quibbling and pass what we agree on
