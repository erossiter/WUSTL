Landrieu Amendments Included in Supplemental Appropriations Passed by House         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 05 2005    Landrieu Amendments Included in Supplemental Appropriations Passed by House Measures support Ports of Iberia and Morgan City  the Army Reserve  and children of the tsunami disaster     WASHINGTON    Three key measures introduced by U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   are included in the conference report to accompany H R  1268  the Supplemental Appropriations Act  passed today by the U S  House of Representatives   The amendments will help give fabrication ports in Louisiana a fairer chance at being approved for navigation projects  reduce a shortfall in tuition assistance for Reservists  and ensure that a portion of the funds set aside for tsunami relief efforts will be dedicated to helping children affected by the December 26th disaster   I am very pleased that in addition to addressing some of the immediate needs of our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as relief operations in south Asia  we were able to include these measures to help our ports  reservists  and children of the tsunami   said Sen  Landrieu  a member of the conference committee reconciling the Senate and House versions of the bill   The conference report  expected to be agreed to by the Senate next week  updates the guidelines used by the Army Corps of Engineers to determine the feasibility of navigation channel enlargement projects   Traditionally  the Corps has evaluated the benefits of such proposals based on the extent to which they reduce the cost of transporting cargo   However  this method prevents an accurate assessment of proposed projects at ports such as those in Iberia and Morgan City  whose primary mission is not cargo movement   Rather  they serve as the host site for the fabrication of offshore oil and gas platforms    As a result  the true value of channel enlargement projects at these ports is best measured by the additional contracts the fabricators could secure with a larger delivery channel  as it would allow them to build and deliver larger platforms   The new guidelines would allow the Corps to consider the value of these additional fabrication contracts in evaluating whether a channel enlargement project goes forward   This is great news for the Ports of Iberia and Morgan City  whose channel improvement needs will now get the fair consideration they deserve   Sen  Landrieu said    By widening and deepening their channels  the ports will be in a position to build larger energy platforms right here at home and not have to watch these projects be sent overseas   The Army Reserve Tuition Assistance amendment  also introduced by Sen  Landrieu  would provide  5 million to help fill a funding shortfall in the Army Reserve s Montgomery G I  Bill tuition assistance program   The program provides financial aid to service members pursuing voluntary education outside of their military training   With the help of this funding  the Army Reserve will be able to continue providing this important assistance to the brave men and women who have given so much to defend our freedom   said Sen  Landrieu  who was recently awarded the Montgomery Eagle Award for congressional leadership by the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  EANGUS   The award and Montgomery G I  Bill are both named after retired Mississippi Congressman G V   Sonny  Montgomery   The Orphans Relief Funding Amendment requires that  12 5 million of the tsunami relief included in the bill be directed to programs addressing the needs of children affected by the disaster   Funded activities would include the registration of unaccompanied children  the reunification of children with their biological or extended families  the protection of women and children from violence and exploitation  and the prevention of the recruitment of children by armed forces   The need of children to belong to a loving  permanent family can never be washed away by even the biggest of waves   said Sen  Landrieu  a co chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption who visited the tsunami affected region with Senate Majority Leader Dr  Bill Frist  R Tenn   shortly after the disaster    Their need for the love and protection of a family is now greater than ever  and this funding will help meet that vital need   A reported 1 2 million children were directly impacted by the tsunami  and data from the Indonesian Ministry of Social Affairs reports that 10 103 children are currently living in humanitarian camps there   Seven percent of these children have no surviving relatives
