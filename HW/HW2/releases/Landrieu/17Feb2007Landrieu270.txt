Landrieu Votes to Support Troops  Opposes Escalation Without Benchmarks         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 17 2007    Landrieu Votes to Support Troops  Opposes Escalation Without Benchmarks Says Bush plan lacks mileposts for success     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement after the Senate in a 56 to 34 vote failed to proceed to debate an Iraq resolution that opposes President Bush s troop surge plan and also expresses support for the troops  Sen  Landrieu had cosponsored a similar resolution authored by Sen  John Warner  R Va   I voted with the majority of my colleagues today to support our troops and to oppose the President s plan to augment forces in Iraq by 21 500  Unfortunately  we lacked the 60 vote minimum under Senate rules to proceed to debate    The administration s escalation plan lacks clear benchmarks for our commitment in Iraq and is devoid of specific mileposts by which to measure success  In addition to expressing opposition to this plan  the bipartisan resolution I endorse takes a strong stand in support of our troops  It offers full supports of our military service men and women in the field to make sure they have the necessary equipment and resources needed for their protection and safety   I want American success in Iraq and am open to any responsible strategy to get us there  We do not have a consensus of the U S  military leadership that a surge is the right strategy  and we do not have a clear action plan from the administration that includes specific mission objectives  As such  I do not support the open ended escalation proposed by the President
