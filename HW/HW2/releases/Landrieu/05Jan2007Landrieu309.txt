Landrieu Comments Following Iraq Meeting with President         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 05 2007    Landrieu Comments Following Iraq Meeting with President     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today after meeting with President Bush  Vice President Cheney  Secretary of State Rice and a bipartisan group of senators to discuss U S  military strategy in Iraq  Sen  Landrieu said   Let me be clear  I support giving our commanders in the field whatever reasonable tools and resources needed to effectively complete their mission and bring our troops home as quickly and safely as possible   But I cannot support adding troops to Iraq unless and until the President makes a compelling case as to why they are needed and as to the clear mission objectives for their presence  So far  that case has not been made   Establishing a stable democracy in Iraq is a worthy goal  but such a democracy must grow from within  and be both debated and supported by the Iraqi people if it is going to take root and last  By definition  a democracy is a government for the people  led by the people   Our own American experiment took strong public will over many decades to reach united consensus   We can help clear the path and plant the seeds  but ultimately the people of Iraq must take responsibility for the future of their country   In today s meeting  I also respectfully reminded the President of his own words    we are engaged in a global war on terror fueled by radical Islamic fundamentalism  But Iraq is but one of many important fronts  There is growing urgency to refocus our attention on Afghanistan  the Israeli Palestinian conflict  global nuclear nonproliferation and other fronts which  in many ways  the Iraq war has eclipsed
