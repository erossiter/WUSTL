SBA Releases Disaster Response Plan at Sen  Landrieu s Request          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 05 2007    SBA Releases Disaster Response Plan at Sen  Landrieu s Request      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on the Small Business Administration s  SBA  Disaster Response Plan  which was released to Congress on Friday in response to a letter she sent last month to SBA Administrator Steven C  Preston   Sen  Landrieu  a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business   Entrepreneurship as well as the Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee  which funds the SBA  requested that the plan be completed in time for hurricane season  which began last week  Following the 2005 hurricanes Katrina and Rita  SBA did not have a comprehensive disaster response plan  which contributed to the agency s slow response to the storms  Loan approvals in Louisiana took between six to eight months to process while closings took an additional two months    The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007  S  163  included a Landrieu provision to require the SBA to implement a comprehensive Disaster Response Plan   The bill was approved unanimously by the Small Business Committee and is headed for the Senate floor   In the 109th Congress  Sen  Landrieu introduced a bill  S  2482  with the same request of the SBA   Sen  Landrieu said today   I commend Administrator Preston and his team for completing the Disaster Response Plan in time for hurricane season   It includes many important components that I have called for and been working with the SBA to implement for nearly two years   For homeowners and businesses  implementation of this plan will result in a more responsive SBA loan application process  additional resources for community outreach and better forecasting of loan volumes in advance of disasters   The SBA s response to the 2005 hurricanes was sluggish and harmful to the economic vitality of the region  Although this disaster plan is clearly a good step forward in SBA preparedness  more must be done to ensure that the response to the next disaster is quick  effective and successful  The plan still does not create a Disaster Planner position at the agency to oversee the plan and its maintenance   It also lacks the ability for SBA to provide short term bridge financing for businesses   I will continue to work with the SBA and my colleagues on the Senate Small Business Committee to add these improvements to SBA s disaster preparedness capability
