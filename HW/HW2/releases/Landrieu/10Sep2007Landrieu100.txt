Landrieu Comments on Petraeus Crocker Testimony         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 10 2007    Landrieu Comments on Petraeus Crocker Testimony     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on testimony given by General David H  Petraeus  Commander of the Multi National Force Iraq  and Ryan C  Crocker  U S  Ambassador to Iraq  before the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees  They will testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow  Sen  Landrieu said    When taken in concert with the analysis of other officials and independent observers  today s testimony does little to assuage my conviction that a change of strategy is needed in Iraq  The Iraqis must meet every necessary benchmark to stand up their government  and the Government Accountability Office says they have met only three of 18 benchmarks so far  We are expending precious soldiers  lives and resources policing a civil war  and it is clear that our nation s priorities continue to be misdirected   While I may not share the General s optimism regarding the surge s success  I do believe that he is an admirable soldier who has served our nation with distinction throughout his career   Suggestions to the contrary serve simply as political distractions from the real issues at hand   If we learned anything from Vietnam  it is that we should not blame our brave troops for the strategic failings of the political command structure   Let me also be absolutely clear  so long as there are U S  forces in Iraq  I will continue to oppose any attempt to cut funds essential to their protection   If anything  more needs to be invested in protecting our troops in this unconventional theater to which we deployed with largely conventional equipment   Finally  I intend to continue my fight to refocus our nation s attention back on capturing or killing the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks    Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri and their al Qaeda terrorist network  Bin Laden s newly released video indicates he s alive and well  busy plotting new attacks against us
