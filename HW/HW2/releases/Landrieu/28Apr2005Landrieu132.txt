Congress Passes BudgetLandrieu Shipbuilding Measure In  Our Guard and Reserve Left Out         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 28 2005    Congress Passes BudgetLandrieu Shipbuilding Measure In  Our Guard and Reserve Left Out     WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate and House of Representatives tonight passed the conference report to accompany H  Con  Res  95  the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution    The budget as now agreed to includes an advance funding measure for shipbuilding crafted by Sens  Landrieu and Trent Lott  R Miss     but the conferees also struck an amendment that would have reserved funds in the budget for Sen  Landrieu s HOPE at HOME Act  The Helping Our Patriotic Employers at Helping Our Military Employees Act would provide businesses with a 50  tax credit to help cover the cost of continuing to pay the salaries of employees who are activated for Guard or Reserve duty     I m very pleased that Sen  Lott and I were able to secure this amendment to the budget bill that will significantly restructure how our Navy pays for ship construction   Sen  Landrieu said    I am disappointed  however  that the House Republican leadership chose to strip from the bill money that the Senate had voted unanimously to set aside for our activated Guard and Reserve   The shipbuilding amendment allows the government to fund a ship construction project over a period of several years rather than being required to front the entire procurement cost in a single year budget      By being able to appropriate money for these projects across several years and not have to foot the entire bill at once  it means we will be able to build more ships simultaneously   Sen  Landrieu said    This great news means more work for our skilled shipbuilders at Avondale  and it will help ensure we continue to have a well equipped modern Navy   Sen  Landrieu also noted that with each ship representing a smaller share of the annual budget  shipbuilding projects may be less likely to be cut from future budgets   The president s proposed FY 2006 budget  for example  cuts the number of LPD amphibious landing craft to be built at the Avondale yard from 12 to nine   Although the U S  Navy had a fleet of 341 surface ships when President Bush took office in 2001  that number has dwindled to only 295 since and is expected to fall to 159 in six years under the president s proposed build rate  The amendment to reserve  1 9 billion in the budget to fund HOPE at HOME was passed by the Senate 100 0 on March 17   HOPE at HOME would also give a credit to businesses needing to hire temporary replacements for deployed Guardsmen or Reservists   More than 40 percent of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are members of the Guard and Reserve  and according to the Government Accountability Office  41 percent of them take a pay cut to serve   These men and women put their lives on the line to fight for each of us  our freedoms and our livelihood   Sen  Landrieu said    The least we can do is help keep their paychecks whole when they step onto the battlefield   Instead  House Republicans have cut them out yet again   In October  the Senate passed a similar measure following a three day filibuster by Sen  Landrieu during debate over a corporate tax relief bill   Unfortunately  time ran out on the 108th Congress before the measure could be brought up in the House of Representatives    Sen  Landrieu has recently been awarded by the Military Coalition  Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  EANGUS  and Military Officers Association of America  MOAA  for her work on issues facing the Guard and Reserve and their families    She is also featured on the cover of this month s The Mariner magazine  a publication of the Naval Enlisted Reserve Association  NERA    The article describes Sen  Landrieu as  a champion for the military  and  a friend of the Guard and Reserve
