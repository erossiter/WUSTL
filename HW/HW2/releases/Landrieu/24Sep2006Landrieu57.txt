last night posted to her travel diary reflections on her visits yesterday to Cameron Parish and Lake Charles as part of the last leg of her month long  Hope and Recovery Tour    In Cameron  she participated in a cattle drive to mark the regions recovery a year after the hurricane killed nearly 23 000 head of cattle  dairy cows and poultry    All of her travel diary entries appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  http   www bayoubuzz com   a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  The  Hope and Recovery Tour  concludes today in southwest Louisiana with a multi state coastal issues summit in Lake Charles    Sen  Landrieu wrote from Lake Charles                                                                                                                                               On the eve of the first anniversary of one of the worst natural disasters in American history  Hurricane Rita  I traveled to the area hardest hit    Cameron Parish  where I participated in the  Riding the Trail to Recovery  cattle ride sponsored by the Americas WETLAND campaign   Hurricane Rita killed more than 23 000 head of cattle  dairy cows and poultry  and destroyed vast crops of sugarcane  cotton  rice and soybean   But todays event symbolized Cameron Parishs determination to return   As we drove the cattle home  we showed that southwest Louisiana is resilient and will return better and stronger than ever before    a moving example of hope and recovery   Governor Kathleen Blanco  Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu  Senator David Vitter  Lake Charles Mayor Randy Roach  Federal Recovery Chairman Don Powell and Lieutenant General Russell Honore all joined us for the cattle drive to show America that we must not forget the areas affected by Hurricane Rita and must keep in mind the real needs that remain for a full recovery    People I talked to from Cameron  Calcasieu and Vermillion Parishes    three of the hardest hit areas    are working and fighting for their recovery  We must make certain that they have the resources and support necessary to see the recovery through   Rest assured  their fights are my fights   The people here will never forget Hurricane Rita  and I will never let Congress  the President or the American people forget it either   After the cattle drive  I attended a barbeque and spoke with many of the Cameron Parish residents who were forced to leave due to Hurricane Rita   I met George Wolf  who survived Hurricane Audrey in 1957 only to suffer through Hurricane Rita nearly a half century later   Despite having twice faced destructive storms  he is again returning the home that he loves so much  and his story is not a unique one   The people of southwest Louisiana are proud of their home  and there is nothing that will stop them from coming back   Their determination and spirit  combined with the needed help and cooperation from the government  will make sure that southwest Louisiana rebuilds and renews itself   That is why it is so important that we work to restore and protect our coastline and the fragile wetlands that guard the region from devastating storm surges like that brought by Rita     I later traveled to Lake Charles for a  Taste of Southwest Louisiana   where we enjoyed some of the areas best food  including shrimp pasta  boudin balls and bread pudding  one of my favorites   After dinner  I joined Lake Charles Mayor Randy Roach and many other local residents for a screening of  All the Kings Men   the chronicle of a fictional politician based on Huey Long    Tomorrow  I will attend a celebratory interfaith service marking the first anniversary of Hurricane Rita  and will tour some of the areas devastated one year ago   I will conclude the day with some of my colleagues on a Coastal Summit Congressional Forum to discuss the future of the Gulf Coast and how we can best meet the challenges we face   With this anniversary commemoration in southwest Louisiana will also come the conclusion of my month long  Hope and Recovery Tour  which started August 24  But while this hurricane anniversary tour may be concluding  the spirit of hope and recovery endures    and what I ve learned from the Louisianians I ve met on this tour will live with me forever  One year later  after the two most powerful storms in American history devastated so much of our state  we must band together like never before    Louisiana will stand the strongest when we stand as one  setting aside political and partisan differences  taking a wider view  and acting in the larger interest of all our people  The cleanup and recovery continues  The rebuilding is underway in some places and just starting in others  There is much more to be done  many lessons learned to apply and many fights yet to win    Our Hope and Recovery Tour marked not just a poignant anniversary  the turning of a page  but the beginning of the next chapter of Louisiana s renewal  It is our solemn and historic responsibility to make sure this next chapter leads to a better future for all our people
