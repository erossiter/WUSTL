Landrieu Responds to GOP Attacks         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 30 2007    Landrieu Responds to GOP Attacks Says politics should not get in way of legitimate questionsregarding federal Katrina and Rita response     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today in response to criticism by Louisiana GOP Chairman Roger Villere regarding comments she made in an interview Sunday with WWL TV in New Orleans  Sen  Landrieu said   I call upon Mr  Villere to stop turning into a partisan fight legitimate questions regarding the ineffective federal response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the catastrophic failure of federal levees that followed   I have praised the President and members of his Administration when they have made sincere efforts to help  and I will continue to do so when they stand up for south Louisiana   But questioning the federal government s failures is our shared duty    politicizing them is not   Mr  Villere is doing a disservice to our state if he believes we should defend every aspect of a failed federal response simply because the one leading it happens to be a member of his own political party    Like many of my constituents  I often wrestle with the question of how to help make the Gulf Coast s recovery a greater national priority   The President made clear his own priorities for the nation in his State of the Union Address last week   For nearly a quarter of the speech  he spoke about the war on terror    an important priority indeed    but said not one word about the continuing recovery challenges along the Gulf Coast   One is left to wonder what it takes to get    and stay    on the radar screen   The Administration and its allies also continue to dispute Louisiana s legitimate right to parity in recovery funding by dredging up charges of corruption and incompetence   I and many other leaders in Louisiana  Mississippi and elsewhere    Democrats and Republicans alike    have fought hard to overcome this harmful reputation that we share   But I will not be silent as these tired  worn stereotypes are used to effectively deny the people of my state the parity in resources necessary to rebuild
