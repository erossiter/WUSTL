Landrieu Brings Fight for Offshore Revenue Sharing to Financial Leaders         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 27 2006    Landrieu Brings Fight for Offshore Revenue Sharing to Financial Leaders Emphasizes positive economic impact of revenue sharing bill     NEW YORK CITY    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   is today meeting with the Wall Street Journal editorial board to make the case for the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  which creates a dedicated revenue stream for hurricane protection  flood control and wetlands restoration projects in Louisiana  Sen  Landrieu also will discuss the economic impact of the bill live from the New York Stock Exchange on CNBC s  Power Lunch   and on Bloomberg Television s  Money and Politics   She began the day with an appearance on Fox News Channel    Protecting Louisiana s coastline is vital to our communities and to the nation s energy infrastructure   Sen  Landrieu said   I have been making the case for the Domenici Landrieu revenue sharing bill across our nation to build bipartisan support in Congress  Today I am proud to take our fight to our country s financial capital  to the heart of American business    The Wall Street Journal and the New York Stock Exchange  I am hopeful that these meetings will help move Congress to pass this bill  which will give Louisiana a significant share of the oil and gas revenues produced off our shores   The Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  which the Senate passed 71 to 25 in August  would open 8 3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to new oil and gas production and share 37 5 percent of new royalties with four Gulf Coast states  Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama  The House also passed a bill containing new drilling and revenue sharing provisions  That bill also would open up drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts  a provision that has run into considerable opposition from coastal lawmakers and governors  Sen  Landrieu is pushing to pass the Senate bill before Congress adjourns for the year     The bill will reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources and increase domestic jobs   Sen  Landrieu said   It will secure the energy infrastructure along America s only Energy Coast  It just makes good economic sense   The price of natural gas has shot up in the last decade  which has impacted manufacturing jobs  Since 2000  more than 3 million manufacturing jobs have been driven from the U S  market  according to the National Association of Manufacturers  The Domenici Landrieu bill will allow for increased domestic energy for the first time in 25 years  and the new area in the Gulf has enough natural gas to heat six million homes for 15 years  Natural gas is also necessary for development of alternative sources of energy  For instance  it is used to make fertilizer to grown corn  which can then be turned into ethanol    In October  Sen  Landrieu discussed revenue sharing with the New York Times editorial board  Shortly thereafter  the paper reversed its stance on the Domenici Landrieu bill and endorsed it   The House should adopt this measure in its present form during the coming lame duck session  and President Bush should sign it   the paper wrote in an October 23 editorial called  A Reason to Drill in the Gulf   That was a change from an August 2 New York Times editorial   Delusional Thinking in the Senate   which called the bill  bad fiscal policy  since one third of the royalties that would normally accrue to all Americans from drilling in federal waters would flow to just four Gulf states
