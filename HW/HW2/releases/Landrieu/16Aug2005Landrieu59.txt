Sen  Landrieu Statement on Avondale Shipbuilding Job Losses         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 16 2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement on Avondale Shipbuilding Job Losses     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding the announcement by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems of pending job losses at its Avondale shipyard  Sen  Landrieu said    I am saddened to learn of the job losses that lie ahead for the Avondale shipyard   Louisiana s shipbuilders are among the best in the world  and I am so very proud of their skills and contributions to our national security   They are important members of our community  and we will do all we can to help them as they seek new opportunities   It is especially unfortunate to note that this layoff could likely have been avoided had the President heeded our warnings and considered shipbuilding to be the national priority it should be   Instead  the President has slashed the shipbuilding budget by nearly a quarter over the past two years alone  and in the process has turned his back on past commitments and the needs of our Navy     Not since before World War I has the United States had this few ships on the sea  and our fleet has been cut nearly in half over the past two decades    While a budget measure I introduced will help make it easier for our government to afford the new ships it needs  more must be done and I will not relent in the fight for full funding of a full fleet   The President s fiscal year 2006 budget proposal  released in February  reduced the number of LPD 17 amphibious ships to be built at Avondale from 12 to 9    a cut of nearly  2 billion   While total Navy shipbuilding was appropriated at  11 4 billion and  10 4 billion for fiscal years 2004 and 2005  respectively  the President only requested  8 7 billion for 2006  The Senate passed a budget amendment this April by Sens  Landrieu and Trent Lott  R Miss   that allows the government to fund ship construction projects over a period of several years rather than fronting the entire procurement cost in a single year budget   In April 2003  Sen  Landrieu also introduced the National Naval Force Structure Policy Act  which called for no fewer than 375 vessels to be in active service at any time   The U S  Navy currently has less than 300 ships in service  down from 594 in 1987 and 341 when President Bush took office   At the President s proposed build rate  this number would fall to 159 in less than six years  According to the Naval Historical Society  which has ship counts going back to 1917  the previous record low was 308 ships in 1931
