Sens  Landrieu  Durbin and Bayh Introduce Bankruptcy Amendment to Protect Military Families from Financial Ruin         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 01 2005    Sens  Landrieu  Durbin and Bayh Introduce Bankruptcy Amendment to Protect Military Families from Financial Ruin     WASHINGTON     As the Senate begins debate on legislation to change federal bankruptcy rules  U S  Sens  Mary Landrieu  D La    Dick Durbin  D Ill   and Evan Bayh  D Ind   today introduced an amendment to protect military families from elements of the proposed standards     We ask our military service members to put their lives on the line to protect our homes and way of life   Sen  Landrieu said   Certainly  we in Congress should do all we can to protect their homes as they protect our freedoms   The Senators said the financial casualties of war include Guardsmen and Reservists whose salaries dropped when they were deployed and who were forced to take out high interest loans to fill the gap  Other victims are soldiers whose small businesses failed after they were called up for duty  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that approximately 16 000 active duty members of the U S  military file for bankruptcy each year    a number likely to increase as more citizen soldiers are deployed for additional tours of active duty   We can t repay the debt we owe our soldiers and their families   Sen  Durbin said    But we can protect them from having to spend the rest of their lives buried in debt   The G I  Protection Amendment has four main provisions  First  it would protect service members from being dragged into destitution by the predatory practices of extremely high interest rate lenders  It prevents a creditor from recovering in bankruptcy amounts owed on so called  pay day  loans secured by a personal check for future deposit or electronic access to a bank account   It would also disallow claims on a debt exceeding an effective annual percentage rate of 36 percent or based upon assignment of military retirement or disability payments  and would make such debts dischargeable in bankruptcy   Second  because service members must live wherever duty posts them  the amendment would allow them to choose to have federal bankruptcy exemptions or those of their home state of record apply to their case  While many states do not make the federal exemptions available to their residents  such restrictions should not apply to troops posted there temporarily and with no choice in where they live   Third  it would exempt members of the armed services  veterans  and spouses of service members who die in military service from application of the  means test  provisions of the bill   Military families and veterans are facing tough times   They should not have to endure a new right of creditors to harass them in court and subject them to an arbitrary means test  The amendment would allow them the application of current law  which gives the bankruptcy courts the flexibility to handle each case independently   Fourth  it would save the homes of military personnel from being lost in the event of a bankruptcy   The amendment would allow members of the military  veterans  and surviving spouses of those killed in military service to claim a minimum homestead exemption of  75 000  no matter in which state they own their home  Under current law  retirement nest eggs invested in 401 k s are protected in bankruptcy proceedings   For many military families  their homes are their retirement nest eggs and they ought to be protected as well   Sen  Landrieu has been a leader in the Senate on issues of concern to our nation s military families   She will soon introduce the Helping Our Patriotic Employers at Helping Our Military Employees  HOPE at HOME  Act  which offers a tax credit to employers who continue to pay the difference in salary when a Guard or Reserve employee is activated  The G I  Protection Amendment has the support of the Military Officers Association of America  the Air Force Sergeants Association  the National Consumer Law Center  the National Association for the Uniformed Services  and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States
