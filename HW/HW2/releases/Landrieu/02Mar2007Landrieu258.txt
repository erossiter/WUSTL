Landrieu Introduces Legislation to Help Small Businesses Compete         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 02 2007    Landrieu Introduces Legislation to Help Small Businesses Compete Bills improve SBA Office of International Trade  promote export opportunities for Gulf Coast small businesses     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   yesterday introduced two bills to improve Small Business Administration  SBA  International Trade programs and help Gulf Coast small businesses export products overseas  The Small Business International Trade Enhancements Act of 2007  S  738  was cosponsored by Senate Committee on Small Business   Entrepreneurship ranking member Sen  Olympia Snowe  R Maine  Committee Chairman John Kerry  D Mass   and committee member Sen  Norm Coleman  R Minn    This bipartisan legislation will give small businesses nationwide more options when seeking export financing   Sen  Landrieu said    It is an important step for exporters in Louisiana and for small businesses nationwide looking to open markets overseas for American products   During the last Congress  I worked closely on this legislation with Senators Snowe and Kerry  and I am pleased to continue our work this Congress to reform the SBA s International Trade programs    In an increasingly global economy  the future prosperity of American small business will depend largely on their ability to efficiently provide goods and services internationally   Sen  Snowe said    The SBA should be given the resources necessary to meet the needs of small businesses throughout the country  and support their continued growth into foreign markets    The Gulf Coast needs a small business trade specialist working now to help return the region to its role as an international economic hub that boosts America s economy   Sen  Kerry said   The region needs specialized local export and financing assistance  and that can t be accomplished from three states away  Small businesses account for 97 percent of all exporters and  in light of continuing record deficits  it is important that we do more to support small business exporting around the country    As the Administration works to open up markets around the world  the SBA needs to better help America s small businesses take advantage of these new foreign market opportunities   Sen  Coleman said   This bill is a step in the right direction by ensuring that SBA can better serve as the government s top trade advocate for small businesses     The bipartisan legislation would create an SBA Associate Administrator for International Trade  improve overall efficiency and coordination in the Office of International Trade  and create a Trade Finance Specialist to oversee International Loan Programs   The legislation also helps small businesses nationwide with their export and trade operations by setting a minimum number of International Finance Specialists to stop continued downsizing of this vital program   At a cost of less than  2 million per year  this small group of specialists has obtained bank financing for more than  10 billion in U S  exports since 1999   Yet  the current number of specialists currently sits at only 15  the lowest level ever for the program   The bill also makes the SBA International Trade Loan program more user friendly for lenders and borrowers by raising the loan cap to  3 67 million and the guarantee amount to  2 75 million  while also bringing collateral and refinancing requirements in line with the regular SBA 7 a  program  The bill contains bipartisan provisions from the Small Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006  which was reported out of the Senate Small Business Committee but blocked by an Administration hold   Sen  Landrieu is working to include the measure in this year s SBA reauthorization bill   The Gulf Coast Export Recovery Act of 2007  S  745  fills a void by hiring a Gulf Coast International Finance Specialist to help small businesses impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama with export financing   This position has been vacant since 2003 due to retirement of staff and ongoing budget cuts  An additional International Trade Specialist will also be hired and will be responsible for East Baton Rouge  West Baton Rouge  Iberville  Pointe Coupee  St  Martin  St  Landry and Iberia parishes   Many New Orleans area businesses have relocated to these parishes since Hurricane Katrina  and additional staff is needed to keep up with the increasing export needs in the area   Our Louisiana and Gulf Coast ports  from the Port of Lake Charles in Louisiana to the Port of Mobile in Alabama  make our region a major player in international trade   Sen  Landrieu said   This bill will provide the Department of Commerce and the SBA with vital staff in the region to help our businesses recover and take advantage of opportunities overseas     Sen  Landrieu  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  also intends to include the provisions of this bill in the FY08 Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations bill
