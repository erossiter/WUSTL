Senate Apologizes to Lynching Victims  Families for Failure to Act         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 13 2005    Senate Apologizes to Lynching Victims  Families for Failure to Act Senators Landrieu and Allen Joined By Lynching Survivor and Descendents for Historic Vote    WASHINGTON    In more than 200 years  the United States Senate has rarely found an occasion to apologize   But today the body is expected to apologize to lynching victims and their families for the Senate s failure to enact federal anti lynching legislation during the first part of the 20th century    From 1890 to 1960  4 742 Americans were documented as having been lynched  with actual numbers believed to be much higher    During that time  nearly 200 anti lynching bills were introduced to the United States Congress   The United States House of Representatives even passed three anti lynching bills  but all failed on the floor of the Senate despite the lobbying of seven U S  Presidents   Because of the Senate s refusal to pass the legislation  the federal government was left powerless to intervene and protect Americans from these heinous acts of mob violence    The historic apology  S  Res  39  was first proposed by Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and George Allen  R Va   who were motivated after reading the book  Without Sanctuary  Lynching Photography in America   a pictorial history of lynching in America by James Allen   The impact of the pictures was overwhelming and proved to be a very educational and emotional experience for me   Senator Landrieu said    The more I learned about this terrorism in America  the more committed I became to doing something positive and passing this resolution   The Senate failed these Americans   If we truly want to move forward  we must admit that failure and learn from it    Thankfully  justice in our Nation has moved forward and left such despicable acts to history   said Senator Allen    But  this story can never be complete without an acknowledgement from this body that it failed to protect individual freedoms and rights  This apology is long overdue and I m pleased the Senate will finally extend one to thousands of victims  their families  and ancestors    The tolerance so long shown to the lynching rope shames America s commitment to justice and equality   said James H  Madison  the Thomas and Kathryn Miller Professor of History at Indiana University who has long studied lynching and its impact on America    By acknowledging its failure to act in the past the Senate today is embracing our highest ideals   Several official guests have traveled to Washington today to be honored by the Senate before the vote  including nearly 200 victims  descendants and the only known lynching survivor in America  Mr  James Cameron  91   In August of 1930  Cameron was arrested in Marion  Ind   and taken to the local jail along with two friends  Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith   A mob soon broke into the jail and drug out all three young men   Shipp and Smith were hanged in the public square by the mob  following which another rope was thrown over Cameron s head   As the noose was tightened in front of a crowd of 2 000 citizens  a voice shouted out that Cameron was not guilty and should not be killed   Miraculously  Cameron was cut down and carried back to the jail to face charges of robbery    He was later pardoned in 1993 by then Governor  now Senator  Evan Bayh  D Ind   The apology is a good idea  but it still won t bring anyone back    Cameron said in response to Monday s event    And I hope that the next time it won t take so long to admit our mistakes     This is a great day for Grandpa Crawford   remarked Ms  Doria Dee Johnson  referring to her great grandfather  Andrew Crawford   Crawford was a wealthy farmer  businessman and community leader in Abbeville  S C   when he was lynched by a crowd of about 300 citizens and local government officials in 1916    For African Americans  it is also very significant   Johnson continued    While it is late  it is necessary   In addition to the 4 742 victims identified in the apology  we are mindful that there are many more victims and families who have not been included   We uplift their memories and honor them today as well   Both Ms  Johnson and Mr  Crawford are expected to be in the Senate gallery today to witness the unanimous passage of the historic apology to them and the thousands of other Americans affected by the tragic legacy of lynching   An apology won t change Senate history   Senator Landrieu concluded    But I sincerely hope that it will give us all an opportunity to re examine our own mistakes  and the mistakes of other institutions  so together we can make our country a better place for all our children   The Louisiana State Legislature is expected to pass a similar resolution today
