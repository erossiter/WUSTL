Statement by Sen  Landrieu RegardingSec  of Energy s Energy Bill Comments          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 18 2005    Statement by Sen  Landrieu RegardingSec  of Energy s Energy Bill Comments  Disappointed by Administration s Opposition to Coastal Restoration and Fuel Consumption Reduction    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   issued the following statement today in response to Energy Secretary Samuel W  Bodman s letter to House and Senate conferees for H R  6  the Energy Bill   In the letter  he expressed the Bush Administration s opposition to coastal impact assistance and revenue sharing provisions  as well as a measure introduced by Sen  Landrieu to reduce U S  oil demand by one million barrels per day  from 20 million per day  Sen  Landrieu said   Once again  the Secretary s statement indicates a failure by this Administration to appreciate or even acknowledge the significant national security contributions made by the people of Louisiana  other coastal oil  and gas producing states and the vital energy industries they host   What is perhaps more disappointing is the hypocrisy of the arguments     In his State of the Union Address  President Bush said his objective for this bill would be to make America  more secure and less dependent on foreign energy    Yet  six months later  the Administration s new policy is to undercut the coastal states that provide and protect 25 percent of the natural gas and 30 percent of the oil consumed in the United States each year     While citing the mounting federal deficit as an excuse  the Secretary doesn t note that this deficit stems not from helping these states continue to strengthen our national security  but rather  it results from this Administration s own fiscal recklessness   Since Louisiana s coast contributed more than  5 billion to the federal treasury last year alone  we have certainly done our fair share to support the needs of the treasury   President Bush also said in January that he would support a plan that  encourages conservation    The Senate has voted unanimously for a measure to reduce oil consumption by one million barrels per day  recognizing it as a reasonable and flexible approach to conservation   But today  with the lights dimmed and the cameras off  Secretary Bodman wrote that  the Administration strongly opposes  this call for the President to make good on his pledge     Despite the Secretary s assertions to the contrary  there are many ways to achieve this goal    from air traffic improvements to home weatherization and dozens of other steps that can have an impact   To deny these opportunities is to deny the American people less expensive  more reliable energy  and it reflects the shortsightedness of this Administration s energy policy   Fortunately  many members of the House and Senate do understand the important contributions our coastal producing states make to our economy and energy security   They also recognize that reducing our reliance on foreign sources of energy will require creative thinking  not quick dismissals of proposals not emanating from the White House
