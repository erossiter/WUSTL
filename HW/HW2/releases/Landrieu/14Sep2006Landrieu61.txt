Landrieu Remembers Governor Ann Richards         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 14 2006    Landrieu Remembers Governor Ann Richards Speaks of her life on Senate floor   WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following remarks in tribute to former Texas Governor Ann Richards  who died yesterday    Many of us woke up this morning to read the newspaper and were stunned by the news that governor Richards had passed away  Many of us  of course  knew of her illness and that she struggled with it and fought it bravely  but I am not sure how many understood how close she was to death s door    As a neighbor of hers who grew up right over the border from Texas and as a young woman in the legislature  Ann Richards was at the top of the list of women I looked to early in my career  I did not have too many women to look to because there were just not that many women in public office in the country in 1976  the year when Governor Richards started her political career as Travis County Commissioner  There were 604 women in state legislatures nationwide    Not only was she an outstanding leader  but she was an extraordinary administrator  I remember her days as state treasurer of Texas and followed many of her guidelines to leadership in trying to manage the budgets of Texas  I followed that lead in trying to manage the budget of Louisiana  She showed that women could not only hold county commissioner seats  but high level executive offices  managing finances and money  She became governor of one of the largest states in America and served with extraordinary ability    But more than just her service to the public at large  which was tremendous to the state of Texas and the country  Ann Richards encouraged women to think of things that had never been thought of before  that women could serve in corporate boardrooms and as governors and  hopefully  one day as president of the United States  And today  thanks to women like her  1 686 women serve in state legislatures across the country  Without women such as Ann Richards  those dreams would never materialize or would be decades away    There was a quote in the paper that I chuckled at because Governor Richards said once she didn t want to be remembered for keeping a clean house  She thought that women should be remembered for things greater than just how well they could vacuum or how well they could cook or how well they could do things associated with the home  While I do not in any way diminish the contribution that we make as wives and as mothers or diminish any of the things that we do inside of our homes that keep our families happy and keep our society going  I want to say emphatically that I agree with her    I hope that women who are born and grow up today really think about what they want their tombstone to say  Ann was always that kind of woman  She was born not only to be all a woman could be  but all a person could be  all a leader could be  Very few women in the generations that I am familiar with have accomplished that as well as she did  It is with great sadness that we recognize her passing  and I am sure there will be a more formal recognition in the Senate chamber among men and women remembering the contributions this extraordinary American has made to our country  to the world  to women and girls everywhere
