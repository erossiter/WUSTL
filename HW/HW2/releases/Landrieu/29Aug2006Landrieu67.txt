Landrieu Reflects on Katrina Anniversary in Travel Diary         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 29 2006    Landrieu Reflects on Katrina Anniversary in Travel Diary     SLIDELL    On the sixth day of her  Hope and Recovery Tour  of coastal Louisiana  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today posted an entry to her travel diary reflecting on her day  which she spent commemorating the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  All of her entries appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  http   www bayoubuzz com   a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  On the road to New Orleans  Sen  Landrieu wrote   Today is the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  which marks a somber day in our state s history  a time to take stock and to commit ourselves to work for a better future  Remembering all those who lost their lives in the storm and its aftermath was a poignant reminder of the meaning of life and the binding spirit of our faith   Last night  I went to Houma where I attended an event celebrating the progress made in the year since Hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana   I felt so honored when the Chamber of Lafourche and the Bayou Region presented me with an award for fighting to get Louisiana a significant share of oil and gas revenues from offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico   When I return to Congress next week  I will not let Louisiana leave empty handed   For too long  our state has provided energy for the rest of the country  yet we get left out of the revenues oil and gas production generates offshore  These revenues are crucial to funding strong levees  building safe communities and restoring a healthy coastline   This morning I went to Nelson Elementary School  a charter school much like others being opened in New Orleans  that will help make Louisiana s school system one of the best in the country   It was truly a day of hope  as students reflected on how Hurricane Katrina affected their lives as they celebrated the start of a new school year     Hilary Duff  the young musician and actress  also came to the school  and she read the daily announcements to the students  She gave the students a great early morning surprise  The students I met this morning show that our schools in Louisiana are making real progress   After visiting with students and New Orleans education leaders  I went to a prayer breakfast at Chalmette High School in St  Bernard Parish with several members of the U S  House of Representatives  including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi   This was truly an emotional event commemorating the anniversary of Katrina  The school board and Chalmette High worked together in the immediate aftermath of Katrina to reopen the school as quickly as possible so that they could accommodate residents and businesses that wanted to return   This is one of the heartwarming stories of Katrina    Chalmette High and the school system got a local contractor  brought in portable classroom buildings  and sent FEMA the bill   By the end of Christmas break  1 200 students were enrolled in classes  and this year  1 500 are enrolled   President Bush came to New Orleans today and delivered a speech at Warren Easton High School that gave me new hope for our recovery   He declared his support for legislation to share oil and gas revenues with Louisiana  and with his support  I am confident that we will pass the Domenici Landrieu bill and get him to sign it   I have been critical of the President and his administration at times    criticism I think was well warranted   I m always prepared to support any President when they re right and oppose them when they re wrong   I hope today s speech will mark a turning point for him and us   He took responsibility for the failures of our federal bureaucracy  and also spoke about our charter school initiatives   Through innovative approaches to our school system  we will provide the educational foundation for not only New Orleans  future  but for our state and the nation   Now I am on the road back to New Orleans from a remembrance event in Slidell s Heritage Park   Only a mile or so from the camp I evacuated in the days before the hurricane  it was truly a fitting culmination to the Katrina leg of my Hope and Recovery Tour   A group of local teens dedicated to educating their peers and preventing alcohol and substance abuse  Pride of St  Tammany  performed several songs    some of which they wrote themselves   We also heard patriotic marches performed by the New Orleans members of the United States Marine Band  I was so glad to be with Slidell Mayor Ben Morris  other local officials  community leaders and the residents of Slidell for what was both a reflection on the past year and a celebration of our future   I was followed out to St  Tammany by a crew from CNN so I could remind all Americans that the hurricanes and levee break struck not only New Orleans  but that last year s catastrophe extends across our entire Gulf Coast  It was a great opportunity to tell the nation the Louisiana story  I tried my best to do it as clearly and strongly as possible   This leg of the Hope and Recovery Tour may be coming to an end  but our recovery is only beginning   It was encouraging to see the progress that is being made throughout south Louisiana  but it is also evident that we have much work left to do   Thank you to each and every one of you who came up to me at the events along the tour  or who emailed me through Bayou Buzz  to share your hopes and plans for the future  There are indeed hard struggles ahead  but guided by our vibrant Louisiana spirit  I know that we will together make our state stronger and better than it ever was before   My month long  hope and recovery  commemoration continues in southwest Louisiana as the Rita one year anniversary approaches  and the diary will return then as well   We will also work with Bayou Buzz to explore ways to keep this line of communication open at other times    not just on special state trips   I am grateful to Bayou Buzz for hosting my thoughts on this trip  and thank Steve for his hard work managing the site
