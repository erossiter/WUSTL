Sen  Landrieu Statement on the Marriage Amendment         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 07 2006    Sen  Landrieu Statement on the Marriage Amendment     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement after voting today to continue debate on S  J  Res 1  the Marriage Amendment  Sen  Landrieu said   While I strongly support the definition of marriage as a sacred union between one man and one woman  the Constitution has given authority over these matters to state legislatures  not to Congress  The people of Louisiana have enacted a clear definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman   Our state s constitutional amendment has already been upheld by the courts   So long as this is true  I believe amending the federal Constitution would be premature and unwise   So long as there is no federal court interference with Louisiana s Constitution  we should leave marriage to the states  as our founders intended
