New York Times Backs Landrieu Plan for Affordable Housing         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 25 2007    New York Times Backs Landrieu Plan for Affordable Housing Cites need for affordable  mixed income communities to support new workforce  Calls opposition  unfair      WASHINGTON    In an editorial citing the need for an  aggressive  farsighted plan  for rebuilding New Orleans area affordable housing  the New York Times today endorsed the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act  S  1668  sponsored by U S  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd  D Conn   and Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   The paper called frequent attacks by the bill s opponents as  unfair   noting that the legislation encourages the development of smartly designed  mixed income communities and a move away from the dilapidated  barracks style public housing of the past   Last week  the New Orleans City Council voted unanimously to approve the demolition of the city s four largest public housing developments while reaffirming the Council s support for the rebuilding model laid out in the Dodd Landrieu bill   Sen  Landrieu welcomed the decision  saying it  smartly recognizes that demolition and renewal must be considered hand in hand in order to move forward This effort was never about demolition  but about what happens next   The full text of today s New York Times editorial appears below  The Right Answer in New Orleans New Orleans will never recover economically unless it attracts a work force large enough to drive the industries upon which the city has historically depended for its livelihood  Low wage workers  in particular  are unlikely to return until the tens of thousands of rental houses and apartments that were destroyed by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina are replaced  To secure its economic future  the region needs an aggressive  farsighted plan for rebuilding the rental housing stock and creating more affordable housing  Housing advocates  business leaders and elected officials at all levels will need to come together on this issue  At the moment  the factions are bitterly split over the federal government s plan that calls for demolishing some of the city s notorious public housing projects and replacing them with mixed income communities  The warring sides need to understand that it s possible to build vibrant mixed communities and to expand the supply of affordable housing at the same time  Senator Mary Landrieu  Democrat of Louisiana  is sponsoring a bill that would essentially require the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to replace every public housing apartment it demolishes by either building another apartment on the same site or by creating an affordable unit elsewhere  Many housing advocates have embraced the bill  as has the Louisiana Recovery Authority  whose board consists mainly of business and civic leaders  HUD  however  has denounced the one for one provision as anathema to the mixed income concept  And Louisiana s Republican senator  David Vitter  seems determined to kill the bill by any means necessary  perhaps simply to prevent Ms  Landrieu from winning a legislative victory in advance of the 2008 elections  Mr  Vitter has unfairly described the bill and the one for one replacement provision as a stealth plan for rebuilding the scary and often violent housing projects exactly as they were  The facts suggest otherwise  The two most prominent developers retained by HUD to help rebuild the city s public housing system have embraced the replacement paradigm  The developers  Providence Community Housing and Enterprise Community Partners  are scheduled to build on 27 5 acres now occupied by the Lafitte project  They have a plan that calls for building 900 rental units to replace the current development and to build 600 new affordable homes for working families and first time homeowners  By working in partnership with community organizations and acquiring land in adjacent communities  Providence and Enterprise hope to create a healthy  economically integrated community where the public housing stigma no longer applies and low income and working class residents live side by side in identical housing units  The plan also calls for schools  health care  youth programs  job opportunities and job training  The developers have committed some of their own money  but the project is largely financed by federal tax credits and block grants  The public housing issue is only part of the overall housing picture  Louisiana must also get cracking on a long overdue program to restore more than 80 000 rental apartments destroyed by the storms  The recovery authority says it has committed funds for rebuilding about 33 000 those  but much more needs to be done  The Lafitte design shows that it is possible to satisfy the need to replace destroyed public housing and to create vibrant new communities of mixed incomes  State  federal and local officials need to take that lesson and run with it
