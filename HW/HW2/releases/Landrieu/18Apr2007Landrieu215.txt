Landrieu  Baker  Melancon Urge President to Support Morganza Levee Projects         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 18 2007    Landrieu  Baker  Melancon Urge President to Support Morganza Levee Projects     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   Congressman Richard Baker  R La   and Congressman Charlie Melancon  D La   today sent a letter to President George W  Bush asking him to withdraw his  concerns  about the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project   The White House earlier today released a Statement of Administration Policy expressing  concerns  over the provision in the Water Resources Development Act that authorized the key hurricane protection projects   The Statement of Administration Policy  SAP  for the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  issued today is extremely disconcerting and appears to be inconsistent with your previous comments  as recent as August 29  2006  Particularly troubling  the SAP expresses  concerns  about the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project and suggests the project requires reformulation   On August 29  2006  the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina s landfall on the Gulf Coast  President Bush spoke in New Orleans and underscored the need for an effective levee system to protect coastal Louisiana    In order to make sure that people understand there s hope and renewal in this area  they ve got to have confidence in a stronger levee system   he said   Most important for you to consider is that the Morganza to the Gulf project will provide hurricane and flood protection to more than 120 000 residents of South Louisiana in an environmentally sensitive manner   the Members continued in their letter   Additionally  this project protects significant energy infrastructure  critical to our national security and economy   Because of our strong support for this vitally important project  we worked late into the waning hours of the 109th Congress to authorize this project  and have continued our efforts in the current session by introducing appropriate authorizing legislation    We respectfully request that you express clear support for this project and work with Congress to provide essential hurricane and flood protection to the people of South Louisiana and to secure a key component of our nation s energy supply   The Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project is a series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes that will  when complete  serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina  Sen  Landrieu and Congressmen Baker and Melancon worked unsuccessfully though the final hours of the 109th Congress to authorize the project  which was originally contingently authorized in the 2000 WRDA bill   The bill directed the Army Corps of Engineers to deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31st of that year  but while the recommendation was favorable  it was submitted more than a year late and the authorization expired   Congress has not delivered a new WRDA bill since   The Morganza project is essential to protecting the lives of thousands of people in south Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said today    Congressman Baker and Melancon and I worked late into the 109th Congress to get Morganza authorized  and we will continue to work with the Senate and House leadership to ensure that the project remains in the final WRDA bill   I have received EPW Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer s commitment to authorize the completion of this project  and I will work tirelessly to make sure that the Lafourche and Terrebonne area is protected   It is unfortunate that the Bush Administration continues to express  concerns  about this vital provision   The President made a promise to Louisiana on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina of a strong levee system  but his continued failure to clearly support vital levee projects hampers our efforts and leaves many parts of Louisiana unready for a future catastrophe   I hope that the Administration will remove its reservations to this provision and clearly support Louisiana as we build an effective hurricane protection infrastructure   With or without the President s support  Congressman Baker and Melancon and I will keep pushing until Morganza is passed   Louisiana has waited long enough  and these projects are too important to let the White House force the Congress into removing the essential Morganza provision   Congressman Melancon said   Going into another hurricane season  I am disappointed the Administration is still concerned about moving forward with building the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane and storm protection system   Morganza will provide hurricane and flood protection to 120 000 people in south Louisiana that are currently left exposed and vulnerable to deadly storms coming off the Gulf   It is one of the most worthy and carefully studied projects in the WRDA bill  and we can t afford to delay it any longer   However  regardless of the White House s official opinion on Morganza to the Gulf  it is still just that    an opinion    and the President has given no indication that he would veto a bill that includes authorization for Morganza  Despite the Administration s concerns  Congress has not wavered in its commitment to Morganza and  even before today s announcement from the White House  I had secured a commitment from House leadership that authorization for Morganza would stay in WRDA   Senator Landrieu had also received similar assurances from leadership on the Senate side   I look forward to sending this bill to the President for his signature shortly so we can get moving on building comprehensive hurricane protection for the people of south Louisiana   The full text of the letter is available
