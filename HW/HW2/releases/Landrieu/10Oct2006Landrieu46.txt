Landrieu Urges International Community to Support Ugandan Peace Talks         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 10 2006    Landrieu Urges International Community to Support Ugandan Peace Talks     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement on the crisis in northern Uganda   as an expected 700 members of the Africa Faith and Justice Network marched on Washington to urge peace in the war torn nation   Current peace talks in Juba  Sudan  are at a crucial stage and represent the best chance to end a brutal war  yet they may not succeed without U S  and international support   The activists meeting on Capitol Hill demanded that the United States break its silence and publicly support the current peace talks     There is a grave human crisis in northern Uganda    a 20 year war between the Lord s Resistance Army and the Ugandan government that has left 200 000 dead and caused the abduction of 30 000 children  The victimized children are often forced to become soldiers or sex slaves  Thousands of children who have been fortunate enough to avoid capture must sleep nightly in town centers to prevent abduction or violence  The international community cannot turn a blind eye to this extreme human suffering   There is now a glimmer of hope for the people of Uganda  as the current talks between the LRA and the Ugandan government have the potential to bring peace to the region   To buttress the peace negotiations  I urge the U S  State Department and the United Nations to pressure both parties to maintain the current ceasefire and make peace a permanent reality
