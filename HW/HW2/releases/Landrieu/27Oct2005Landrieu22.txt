Sen  Landrieu Statement on Miers  Withdrawal         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 27 05    Sen  Landrieu Statement on Miers  Withdrawal     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today regarding the withdrawal of Harriet Miers as a nominee for the United States Supreme Court  Sen  Landrieu said   The Senate did not yet know enough about Harriet Miers to make a final judgment as to her qualifications to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court   But I had been looking forward to the hearing and confirmation process through which we would have learned more     We did know that she came before the Senate with significant credentials as a lawyer and trusted confidante of the President   Those qualifications certainly should have afforded her the opportunity to have her voice heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the American people   Unfortunately  extreme partisan pressure denied her    and us    that opportunity   In selecting a new nominee  I hope the President will not allow this pressure to dissuade him from choosing someone who will continue to reflect Justice Sandra Day O Connor s commitment to the rule of law over partisan ideology     30
