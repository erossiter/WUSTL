Senate Calls for New Priorities in War on Terror         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 28 2007    Senate Calls for New Priorities in War on Terror Unanimously passes Landrieu amendment to reset focus on capture or killing of Osama bin Laden     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate last night unanimously approved a measure by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to reprioritize U S  efforts in the Global War on Terror   The approach was cosponsored by Senators Byron L  Dorgan  D N D   and Kent Conrad  D N D  The Landrieu amendment to H R  1585  the Defense Authorization Bill  states that  it should be the policy of the United States Government that the foremost objective of United States counterterrorist operations is to protect United States persons and property from terrorist attacks by capturing or killing Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri and other leaders of al Qaeda and destroying the al Qaeda network    The unanimous passage of this amendment represents an important new policy direction for the Senate s continued debate over how to protect our homeland and fight international terrorism   Sen  Landrieu said    The Senate has for the first time recognized that the primary front in the War on Terror is wherever Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants are operating and hiding    and they are not holed up in downtown Baghdad   When al Qaeda attacks U S  personnel in Iraq  we must strike back and strike hard   But a fish rots from the head  and we ve spent too much time chasing the tail    Now we must be prepared to win this battle   she added   We must commit to providing our skilled men and women in combat the clear mission and full resources they need to focus their fight at the top  where it belongs   According to the July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate prepared by U S  intelligence agencies   Al Qa ida is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the Homeland  as its central leadership continues to plan high impact plots    This finding was reinforced by a strategic survey released on September 12 by the nonpartisan International Institute for Strategic Studies  IISS     The United States and its allies have failed to deal a deathblow to al Qaeda   the report said  noting that  there is increasing evidence that  core  al Qaeda is proving adaptable and resilient  and has retained an ability to plan and coordinate large scale attacks in the Western world     The main orchestrators of the horrific 9 11 attacks remain at large  alive and well  plotting their next major attack   Sen  Landrieu said today    This amendment is a key step toward focusing our fight where it needs to be    less on policing a civil war and more on destroying those who continue to pose the greatest threat to the United States   The media propaganda arm of the al Qaeda terrorist network  as Sahab  released in the last few weeks a series of recent video and audio recordings of bin Laden   Intelligence officials believe the messages  released to coincide with the anniversary of the September 11th attacks  are authentic and that bin Laden remains in hiding near the Afghanistan Pakistan border    Earlier this month  Sen  Landrieu requested a detailed briefing from the National Counterterrorism Center  NCTC  regarding the latest bin Laden related intelligence and U S  operations to capture or kill him   The briefing is in the process of being coordinated and scheduled
