FACT CHECK  Contrary to Reports  Okla  Senator s Opposition to La  Hurricane Protection Unchanged         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 18 2007    FACT CHECK  Contrary to Reports  Okla  Senator s Opposition to La  Hurricane Protection Unchanged Continues to oppose immediate approval of vital project     WASHINGTON    Despite press and other accounts to the contrary today  the stated position of Senator Tom Coburn  R Okla   remains unchanged in opposing the immediate authorization of the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project   He instead reiterated that the project s authorization be tied to a bill already delayed by more than six years of debate  The series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes will  when complete  serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina   Originally approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2000  the project s authorization lapsed due to bureaucratic delays at the Army Corps of Engineers    Recent efforts by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and other members of the Louisiana Congressional delegation to authorize the project anew were stymied by a procedural  hold  placed by Sen  Coburn  who today announced  I support this project being a component of the comprehensive WRDA bill  which is the right way to do it      Vitter Says  Oklahoma Senator Okay on Morganza   1 18 07     The Louisiana Congressional delegation has been united on this issue   Sen  Landrieu said today   We want the Morganza project passed now  without further delay   Insisting that the project be tied to the prospects of a long overdue WRDA bill  which may or may not be passed this year  simply kicks the matter down the road one more time while a speedier alternative is available   Senator Coburn continues to stand by his previous position  and we urge him to withdraw his opposition to the legislation we ve introduced   Fact  Today s announcement does not represent a change of position by Sen  Coburn  who did not object to passing a WRDA bill with Morganza included in July 2006 and who two weeks ago endorsed the project s inclusion    There is no question that levee system needs to be authorized  and it will be authorized this year   Sen  Coburn said    There is no question    The Congressional Record    Senate  1 4 07  pg  S202 col  2  The authorization of the Morganza to the Gulf project has been included in new WRDA bills considered by the House and Senate over the past six years  and Sen  Coburn has not specifically challenged the project s inclusion in these WRDA bills   In fact  the Senate passed a WRDA bill including full Morganza authorization  S  728  on July 19  2006  without Sen  Coburn s objection  However  while the project stands alone as having been fully authorized by a previous WRDA  Sen  Coburn has objected to removing the project from the WRDA morass and authorizing it through independent legislation  Fact  Sen  Coburn s opposition to the Morganza to the Gulf project as a separate bill has not changed  Upon blocking a bill by Congressmen Charlie Melancon  D La   and Richard Baker  R La   that would have authorized substantial parts of the project  a spokesman for Sen  Coburn said he opposed the measure because it  included work that hadn t been previously authorized and that Coburn couldn t get cost estimates for it   referring to navigation improvements included by the House of Representatives     Coburn takes heat for blocking hurricane protection bill   Tulsa World  12 16 2006  pg  A1    Sen  Coburn reiterated this explanation on the Senate floor  commenting that  there was a drudging  sic  component that was added to that bill That portion had not cleared the committee  The Congressional Record    Senate  1 4 07  pg  S202 col  3  However  despite these stated reasons  Sen  Coburn refused to support legislation would have limited the scope of the authorization only to those project elements previously approved by Congress and for which a precise cost estimate has been provided by the Corps   This legislation was most recently introduced by Sen  Landrieu the first day of the 110th Congress  and was met again by opposition from Sen  Coburn  Fact  The issue remains whether Sen  Coburn will withdraw his objection to immediately passing a separate bill authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf project   The Louisiana delegation continues to urge his support for such a separate bill  and not to wait for the eventual passage of WRDA  which has languished in Congress for nearly seven years
