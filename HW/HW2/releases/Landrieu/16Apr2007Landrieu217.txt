Landrieu Stevens Bill to Recognize Local Broadcasters  First Response Role Following Major Disasters         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 16 2007    Landrieu Stevens Bill to Recognize Local Broadcasters  First Response Role Following Major Disasters     LAS VEGAS    In her opening keynote address to the 2007 National Association of Broadcasters  NAB  convention in Las Vegas today  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   announced new legislation that would  for the first time  federally recognize the vital role of local broadcasters in responding to major disasters   Co sponsored by U S  Senator Ted Stevens  R Alaska  the First Response Broadcasters Act of 2007 would take steps to help ensure that local television and radio stations are able to broadcast essential public information to the disaster area uninterrupted   Our local television and radio broadcasters were a lifeline to the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita rolled ashore in 2005   said Sen  Landrieu  Chairman of the Disaster Recovery Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee    They provided vital public safety information and comfort to thousands of people when both were needed the most     By serving at the front lines of disaster response  it is important to know that local broadcasters are  in fact  first responders    Broadcasters provide an invaluable public service to Americans  especially in times of crisis   said Sen  Stevens  the Subcommittee s Ranking Member   Many people in my state know this first hand   Alaskans  particularly those in the most remote areas of the state  have endured devastating earthquakes  tsunamis and typhoons     As we strive to improve disaster preparedness in Alaska and the nation  Congress must ensure that broadcasters have the tools to effectively communicate with people when time is of the essence   History has proven that the critical information provided by television and radio broadcasters can save lives   The bill  to be introduced later this week in both the Senate and House of Representatives  would designate local radio and television stations providing essential disaster related programming as  first response broadcasters  and open access to federal supplies of fuel  water and food   While highest priority would remain reserved for emergency services  health care facilities and public utilities  the bill would protect broadcasters  independently secured supplies from federal government seizure except in the most dire cases of emergency need    Confiscations of fuel procured by Mississippi broadcasters following Hurricane Katrina inhibited efforts by local radio and television stations  dependent on generators for electricity  to stay on the air   The Landrieu Stevens legislation also directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to expedite access to the disaster area by broadcast engineers to restore transmitters and other key broadcast facilities and infrastructure   To better protect these critical to air facilities  the bill establishes a Broadcast Disaster Preparedness Matching Grant Program   The grants could be used to protect  upgrade or enhance facilities and infrastructure to better position stations to continue providing vital public information during a disaster  Senator Landrieu noted that WWL TV  the only New Orleans television station to remain on the air uninterrupted through Hurricane Katrina and the levee breaks  did so as a direct result of steps it had taken years earlier to move its transmitter to higher ground and arrange for redundant  alternate production facilities   An effective response to future disasters will require better coordination at all levels of government and the private sector  and broadcasters across the Gulf Coast and the nation have demonstrated leadership in this effort   Sen  Landrieu said    But broadcasters cannot get what is often life saving information out to the people that need it most if they cannot stay on the air    Local broadcasters are uniquely positioned to provide the vital  often lifesaving  information that Americans rely on during times of crisis   said NAB President and CEO David K  Rehr   We salute Senators Landrieu and Stevens for introducing this legislation recognizing the important role played by broadcasters and look forward to working with them to ensure Americans continue to benefit from our lifeline service   The NAB has been joined in its support for the First Response Broadcasters Act by the Radio Television News Directors Association  whose Board of Directors voted unanimously to endorse the bill on Saturday   While the legislation does not guarantee expedited access to the disaster area by newsgathering personnel  such as print and broadcast reporters  photographers and writers  it does determine that press access guidelines after the disaster shall continue to be determined by the local agencies that had been so responsible before the disaster occurred   This creates a consistent model for journalist accreditation and eliminates the bureaucratic confusion created by multiple local and Federal agencies attempting to enforce conflicting access rules  The Landrieu Stevens bill has also been endorsed by 45 state broadcasting associations  representing  Alabama  Alaska  Arizona  Arkansas  California  Colorado  Connecticut  Delaware  Florida  Georgia  Idaho  Illinois  Indiana  Iowa  Kansas  Louisiana  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  Minnesota  Mississippi  Missouri  Montana  Nebraska  Nevada  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New Mexico  North Carolina  North Dakota  Ohio  Oklahoma  Oregon  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island  South Carolina  Tennessee  Texas  Utah  Vermont  Virginia  Washington  Wisconsin  Wyoming and Washington  D C   This bill recognizes an important public private partnership that will aid our response to future disasters  natural or man made   Sen  Landrieu said    As local radio and television stations stand up  as so many did after 9 11 and the hurricanes  to put commercial interests aside to serve the public interest  the federal government should be ready to stand with them   More information regarding the First Response Broadcasters Act  including full bill text and profiles of broadcaster efforts following recent major disasters  is available online at
