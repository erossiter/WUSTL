today passed 91 to 4 the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  with nearly  3 6 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects for Louisiana  which United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   worked to secure  Included in the bill is an amendment Sen  Landrieu successfully added to expedite Category 5 hurricane protection projects and to close the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet  MRGO     The WRDA bill is critical to the future hurricane protection needs of Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said   It authorizes key Corps projects that will restore our eroding coastline and make our communities from Calcasieu to Plaquemines parishes safer from storm surges    After continued negotiations throughout the day  we were able to include in the bill language to expedite Category 5 protection projects through Congress without having to wait for another WRDA bill    The WRDA bill also includes Sen  Landrieu s amendment to expedite the closure of MRGO  The canal  having widened as a result of decades of coastal erosion  is considered by many engineers and analysts to have been a significant contributing factor to the strength of the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain following Hurricane Katrina  The underlying bill included Sen  Landrieu s language that requires the Corps to develop a closure plan for MRGO  which is due 180 days from WRDA s passage   MRGO is a hazard to the people of St  Bernard Parish and the New Orleans region   Sen  Landrieu said   This amendment is a long awaited step toward expediting is closing and is critical for our protection   I want to compliment the Environment and Public Works Committee  its Chairman Barbara Boxer of California and my Louisiana colleague  Senator David Vitter  for quickly sending to the Senate floor a very strong WRDA bill         Let me just say   Sen  Landrieu  has been such a fighter for her state in all of this   said Sen  Boxer immediately before the final roll call vote   There wasn t a day that has gone by that she hasn t come and    since the very day of the disaster that struck    that she hasn t told me   Senator  you need to come  you need to see  you need to help   I am so fortunate that I am in a position to help  This is a bill that s so important for her state  Mary Landrieu  I just want to thank you for all your contributions you have made   Also included in the WRDA bill are other Landrieu amendments that  Require a final environmental impact statement for the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal Lock by July 1  2008  Provide credit for work performed at the Leon Theriot Lock  The WRDA bill  which is the first since 2000  authorizes several key hurricane protection projects in Louisiana  including  886 million for Morganza to the Gulf  which is a series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes that will  when complete  serve to protect more than 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina  The legislation authorizes Louisiana Coastal Area  LCA  Ecosystem Restoration  which authorizes the Corps of Engineers to implement 16 coastal restoration projects totaling nearly  1 9 billion  These include 10 projects that had not been authorized in previous Senate WRDA attempts since 2000  WRDA also authorizes consolidation of Lafitte levee projects  Port of Iberia navigation storm surge protection projects  a Mississippi River Gulf Outlet  MRGO  Revolving Loan Fund for private facilities  MRGO Relocation Assistance for public facilities  first steps toward the 100 year protection in the Larose to Golden Meadow project  Calcasieu River and Pass Rock Bank protection and the Bayou Sorrel Lock  Emphasizing the impact that Hurricane Rita had on southeast Louisiana  Sen  Landrieu ensured that WRDA directives to the Corps in relation to Hurricane Katrina were also applied equally to projects in Hurricane Rita affected parishes    Water projects in Louisiana benefit the entire nation because our port system affects commerce all over the country and the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico serves energy needs nationwide   Sen  Landrieu said   The amendments I pushed to be added to the WRDA bill strengthened the legislation for Louisiana and benefit all Americans   Under the expedited process for Category 5 projects  the President may submit for Congress  consideration critical projects identified in a Category 5 design and analysis plan being prepared by the Corps  At the direction of a Sen  Landrieu sponsored amendment in the 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill  that plan is due to Congress by the end of the year  The Senate EPW Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in the House of Representatives would be directed to act on the project authorization within 45 days  and debate on the Senate floor would be limited to 20 hours with significant restrictions on what amendments may be offered  The amendment effectively moved Category 5 projects out of the WRDA process and into a significantly faster process for considering legislation   Earlier drafts of Sen  Landrieu s amendment had faced opposition from Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  EPW  Ranking Member James Inhofe  R Okla   because they either added cost to the bill or granted ultimate authority for selecting projects to the Corps Chief of Engineers  To overcome his and other partisan objections  the final bill does not automatically authorize projects  and instead of the Chief of Engineers  the bill gives the President the authority to determine which of the projects in should be considered in the expedited manner    The Louisiana delegation also secured the following amendments  Authorize a 100 year standard for hurricane protection  Authorize a Louisiana Coastal Authority Task Force to advise the corps on implementation of projects   Louisiana more than 25 percent of the projects in the entire WRDA bill   Sen  Landrieu said   It is a huge step forward for Louisiana s hurricane protection  flood control and coastal restoration efforts and represents a significant victory for our congressional delegation  Coupled with the dedicated revenue stream generated from the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act passed last year  we can soon move forward with these vital projects that will secure our coast   The House of Representatives passed its version of the WRDA bill on April 19  The two chambers will work out the differences in their bills in a conference
