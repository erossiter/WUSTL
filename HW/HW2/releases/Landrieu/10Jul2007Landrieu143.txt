Landrieu Highlights Project Worksheet Problem         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 10 2007    Landrieu Highlights Project Worksheet Problem Disaster Recovery Subcommittee examines FEMA red tape inhibiting recovery     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today chaired a hearing on the process localities must go through to complete Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  project worksheets  PWs   a requirement for receiving federal funds  As a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  there are 23 000 public works projects in Louisiana  and each one requires complicated  time consuming steps in order to receive FEMA funds   The project worksheet system is inefficient  slow and contradictory   Sen  Landrieu said   Anyone who comes in contact with it quickly understands it is one of the major roadblocks to our recovery from Katrina and Rita  Destroyed localities with no tax base are required to put up money in advance  Work is reviewed not just building by building but segment by segment  Tens of thousands of documents must be completed for a single project  Communities are prevented from building better and smarter  Our locals must re justify their projects because of FEMA s high employee turnover  And FEMA inspectors systematically low ball damage estimates  in some cases by four or five times   The first panel of witnesses that testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee included locally elected officials who each testified that FEMA is tied up in bureaucracy and undermines the recovery by continually underestimating project costs and hiring inexperienced personnel  The officials included  C  Ray Nagin  Mayor of New Orleans  Kevin Davis  President of St  Tammany Parish  and Henry  Junior  Rodriguez  President of St  Bernard Parish  St  Bernard Parish was completely destroyed by Hurricane Katrina  displacing 67 500 people  and President Rodriguez said FEMA was primarily responsible for the slow pace of recovery  In one example  he explained that the parish sought to consolidate its sewer system into one wastewater plant  a less costly approach than repairing or replacing the pre storm system   FEMA has told the parish to pursue the project in three different ways but because of FEMA s red tape  the parish still lacks a working sewer system and instead pumps out waste by the truckload     We got by Katrina and Rita   President Rodriguez said   I don t know if we can get through FEMA  This is one hell of a catastrophe  We re still working out of trailers  We re in no better shape now than we were two years ago   Mayor Nagin added that the constant FEMA staff turnover requires New Orleans to repeatedly justify the need for public works projects    Every couple of months we seem to have dealt with a different FEMA representative   Mayor Nagin said   And we almost had to start from scratch every time a new person came in   Witnesses who testified on the second panel included  Colonel Jeff Smith  Executive Director  Louisiana Governor s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness  Bryan McDonald  Executive Director  Mississippi Governor s Office of Recovery and Renewal  Mark Merritt  Senior Vice President of Response and Recovery  James Lee Witt Associates  Merritt  who worked for FEMA under Director James Lee Witt from 1993 until 2001  testified that FEMA is measuring its progress by the number of project worksheets written    We should be counting the number of schools  hospitals and miles of roads repaired and replaced  not the number of PWs written   he said  Merritt added that FEMA is a much different agency than when he worked there  He said the agency no longer employs the necessary staff to deal with catastrophic disasters and that 80 percent of FEMA employees sent to Louisiana following the hurricanes had just nine days of experience  FEMA staff tasked with Gulf Coast recovery lack the experience to recognize flexibility in the Stafford Act  which is the  core of what is inhibiting the PW process   he said  The final witness to testify was James Walke  Director of FEMA s Public Assistance Division   This hearing made perfectly clear that what is stymieing our recovery is not the will of the people   Sen  Landrieu said   It is the bureaucracy of the government    This agency needs to do a much better job of listening and working with local officials who have a better sense of what it takes to rebuild their localities  Moving forward  FEMA must judge the recovery progress following a disaster on infrastructure rebuilt  not project worksheets completed   I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Disaster Recovery Committee to ensure when the next disaster strikes the United States  be it natural or manmade  a reformed FEMA responds quickly  efficiently and smartly
