Senator Landrieu Fights For Approval of Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 08 2006    Senator Landrieu Fights For Approval of Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project Introduces legislation to get the job done while broader Water Resources bill stalls in Congress     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced that she has introduced S  4105  a bill to fully authorize the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane and storm protection project   The series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes will  when complete  serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina  The project was originally authorized in the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2000  with the requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31 of that year   The Corps eventually submitted its report more than a year late  causing the authorization to expire despite the Corps  favorable recommendation   Though repeated attempts have been made  Congress has been unable to deliver a new WRDA bill since   It has become abundantly clear that  yet again  Congress intends to go home without passing a WRDA bill   Sen  Landrieu said today    Six years after Congress gave Morganza to the Gulf its first green light  it is simply not fair to delay it further simply because the Corps  bureaucracy couldn t deliver a report on time and because Congress couldn t pass a new bill in several years   There is no other item in WRDA that has been kicked down the road as many times as this   The Senate passed a 2006 WRDA bill on July 19  but negotiations with the House of Representatives broke down in recent days  meaning the process will have to begin anew when the 110th Congress convenes in January   The Morganza to the Gulf project had been included in the most recent WRDA bills passed by both the House and Senate  with the Senate passed version also including a variety of key Corps reform measures  Sen  Landrieu s bill today fully authorizes all Morganza to the Gulf project elements without the need for a new WRDA bill   Totaling  841 1 million with 65 percent of that  or  546 3 million  intended to be funded by the federal government  these authorizations include a lock complex on the Houma Navigation Canal  approximately 72 miles of earthen levees  12 navigable floodgates and 12 multi barrel water control structures   The people of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes are sitting ducks in the face of hurricanes  unprotected from disastrous storm surges and flooding  said Rep  Charlie Melancon  D La   who is cosponsoring similar legislation in the House of Representatives    We have been fighting for years to get the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane and storm protection project authorized and Senator Landrieu and I are trying every avenue available to clear this hurdle before Congress adjourns   The people of south Louisiana have been patient for long enough   I urge my colleagues to authorize Morganza to the Gulf before they leave town so we can move forward with protecting ourselves from future hurricanes     Sen  Landrieu added   I have strongly urged my colleagues to pass this measure in the closing hours of the 109th Congress so that we may finally fulfill the promise we first made to the people of South Louisiana more than six years ago
