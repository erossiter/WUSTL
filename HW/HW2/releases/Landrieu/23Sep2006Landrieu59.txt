Landrieu Reflects on La  Recovery in Trip Diary         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 23 2006    Landrieu Reflects on La  Recovery in Trip Diary Florida Senator Posts Guest Comment after New Orleans Visit  WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today posted to her travel diary reflections on her visits yesterday to New Orleans and Shreveport as part of the last leg of her month long  Hope and Recovery Tour    She was joined at Southern University at New Orleans and for tours of the Pontchartrain Park community and 17th Street Canal levee reconstruction by U S  Senator Bill Nelson  D Fla   who also posted to the travel diary    The senators entries appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  http   www bayoubuzz com   a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  The  Hope and Recovery Tour  continues through this weekend in southwest Louisiana to commemorate the first anniversary of Hurricane Rita  and concludes with a multi state coastal issues summit in Lake Charles on Sunday    Sen  Landrieu wrote    Today I kicked off the final leg of my  Hope and Recovery Tour  in remembrance of the 2005 hurricanes with U S  Senator Bill Nelson from Florida in New Orleans  The culmination of this part of the tour will be Southwest Louisiana this weekend  the area hard hit last September by Hurricane Rita   We began this morning with a trip to Southern University of New Orleans  which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina   Damage to SUNOs campus was a heartbreaker  the current situation is a story that highlights both success and frustrating failure   The Army Corps of Engineers replaced the universitys buildings with temporary structures so that the school could still function  which is good  but unfortunately the result was creation of the equivalent of a trailer park  far from a suitable long range solution    As we toured the university  we saw the gym  which has remained untouched since flooding more than a year ago  much like the rest of the schools buildings   Senator Nelson and I walked past the library where the windows were broken and the books had fallen to the ground  Destroyed by the water  the library is still waiting to be cleaned up   It was truly a sad sight nearly 13 months after the hurricane   After we left SUNO  Senator Nelson and I traveled to the Pontchartrain Park community in New Orleans to visit with local homeowners Jerald and Barbara Dupr     The Dupr  s are living in a trailer while they rebuild their home  which had to be gutted after the flooding   They received not one dime from their insurance company  as their homeowners insurance didnt cover the flood damage   They now live in a tiny trailer    a living reminder of why we must keep fighting for the hurricane protection that will help prevent more people from being forced into the same situation    The Dupr  s told Senator Nelson and me that  just yesterday  they watched as two men broke into their neighbors trailer and walked away with many of the belongings   Astoundingly  they said a National Guard vehicle even drove by during the theft  but waved to the criminals  having no way of knowing that the thieves didnt live there   The crime threat is a serious one  with terrible examples of violence coming out of hurricane ravaged areas in recent months  Thats why I have asked the Attorney General of the United States to work with local law enforcement authorities and the court system on an emergency basis to help rebuild the criminal justice infrastructure that was so badly damaged  We need functioning courts  an efficient prosecutorial system  prisons and incarceration facilities  and adequate law enforcement personnel  training and equipment  to curb crime and make neighborhoods  many of which are badly damaged with countless vacant buildings  safe and secure  This is crucial to the rebuilding effort in the New Orleans area   The insurance coverage issue has become an integral part of recovery and rebuilding in so many different ways  The federal flood insurance program  for one  must be stable and reliable  and thats something we in Congress are now working on to assure  Homeowners insurance  on the other hand  is largely regulated by state agencies  Availability and affordability of homeowners insurance is an immense economic issue for Louisianas future as well as the future of all the coastal states   Senator Nelson and I discussed a bill that we have co sponsored to create an emergency commission that will work to stabilize insurance markets against skyrocketing premiums and will determine a federal role to assist states and coastal regions in this effort  An inability to get affordable insurance coverage stands as a major threat to Louisianas rebuilding  Senator Nelson shared stories with us about the problems Florida is having as well  making it clear this is a multi state problem that needs to be confronted by the private and public sectors working together   Before Senator Nelson flew back to Florida  he and I received a progress report from the Army Corps of Engineers on the levee rebuilding at the 17th Street Canal   They explained that the rising waters caused by Hurricane Katrina forced the flow of the canal to change directions  putting undue force on the levee wall  causing it to break   They have installed a temporary gate system    eventually to be replaced by a more advanced one    to prevent such a catastrophic failure from happening in the event of future storm surges  This is something that we will have to monitor very carefully  The destruction caused by the failure of the federally designed levee system cannot be allowed to happen again   In the afternoon  I traveled to Shreveport  where I met with Millard and Linda Fuller and Mack McCarter  who are working together to build homes in the Allendale area   Just this past week  they built ten homes  five of which were built for families who were forced to evacuate New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina   Many months ago  I encouraged Mack and the Fullers to begin working together  and they have made a great team  bringing several groups of people together from around the world to build homes in record time   Nearly 300 volunteers from as far as Nairobi helped in the project  which is truly a sign of hope and inspiration for the rebuilding of hurricane affected parishes in coastal Louisiana    I participated in the dedication of a new home for Henry and Geraldine Smith  a Katrina evacuee family from New Orleans  and met the owners of each of the other homes as well   The air was filled with mixed emotions of loss and remembrance  hope and recovery  as each family received the keys to their brand new houses    Tomorrow morning  I will fly to Lake Charles to survey the recovery there  one year after Hurricane Rita  and participate in a cattle drive commemorating the first anniversary of this destructive storm that has far too often been forgotten by the national media and  many politicians in Washington   In addition to human and property loss caused by Rita last year  approximately 25 000 head of cattle were lost in the storm  with the estimated damage to livestock and forage topping  50 million   The people and communities in southwestern Louisiana will never forget Hurricane Rita  one of the most powerful storms in American history  As a U S  Senator  I will never let Congress or the White House forget Rita either  Thats why this weekends commemoration of Ritas anniversary is so important    Sen  Nelson wrote    More than a year after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast  my visit to New Orleans today reminded me that our work to help rebuild the Gulf Coast is still unfinished  and Congress and the Administration must do more to help the victims of this national disaster    Traveling with Sen  Mary Landrieu  I saw the levee breech at the 17th Street Canal  and received a progress report from the Army Corps of Engineers   We saw the slow progress of rebuilding Southern University at New Orleans    a school that is still struggling to reopen   We also visited with Jerald and Barbara Dupre whose home was destroyed   Like thousands of other homeowners in coastal states  their property insurance didnt cover the flooding caused by Katrina   And now  as they work to rebuild their home  the Dupres are dealing with drastic property insurance hikes that are making coverage unaffordable   As I talked with the Dupres  I was once again reminded how important it is that we address this growing problem   Both Florida and Louisiana have seen rate increases hurting families  and its time to find a solution   Along with Sen  Landrieu  Ive introduced legislation that would create an emergency commission to find ways to stabilize the insurance market and keep property insurance affordable and available     Ability for us to rebuild and financially recover following major disasters depends on taking action  and we cant turn our backs on this issue
