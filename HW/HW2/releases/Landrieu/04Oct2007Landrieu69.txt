Landrieu Secures Key Savings to Help Hire More Police         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 04 2007    Landrieu Secures Key Savings to Help Hire More Police Senate passes measure to waive local match requirement on federal COPS grants     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate today passed unanimously an amendment by U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   which would waive for hurricane affected communities the funds they would otherwise be required to pay to receive federal COPS grants    The Community Oriented Policing  COPS  program provides grants for local police departments to hire more officers  provide overtime pay  and obtain equipment and support systems   It normally requires localities to pay at least 25 percent of the expense   Under Sen  Landrieu s amendment to the Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations Act  H R  3093  that requirement would be waived and the federal government would bear the full cost of new grants to the region   With much of the New Orleans Police Department and other Louisiana law enforcement agencies still operating out of temporary facilities  budgets are stretched thin   said Sen  Landrieu    This amendment will help these cash strapped communities buy the equipment they need and put more officers on the street by making sure they are not shut out of the COPS application process   The City of New Orleans currently has the highest per capita murder rate in the country  with more than 160 slayings in 2006 and more than 150 so far this year   The New Orleans Police Department  having lost more than 500 officers    roughly 30 percent of the force    in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  has recently moved to 60 hour workweeks to put more officers on the street to combat the crime surge   This amendment  if enacted into law  would make it possible for the city to receive federal COPS grants without dipping into its limited financial resources   I want to comment on Senator Landrieu s amendment It s a smart thing we re doing   said Senator Tom Coburn  R Okla   who had spent much of the day on the floor objecting to amendments he deemed too costly    It s right  It will come to an end at some time  but until they get back on their feet  we ll do it   Sen  Landrieu also introduced an amendment today that would require the Justice Department to use pre Katrina and Rita population figures in calculating other law enforcement grants  known as Byrne grants  which use population as a factor in determining grant size   This amendment will be considered by the Senate when it returns from the Columbus Day recess on October 15   As we continue to recover and rebuild from the 2005 hurricanes  I am hopeful that these amendments will help stem the tide of violent crime that is gripping New Orleans and some of the surrounding parishes   Sen  Landrieu said
