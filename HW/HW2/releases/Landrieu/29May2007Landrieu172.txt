Landrieu on Faulty NOLA Water Pumps  Work Remains to Secure Coastal Communities         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 29 2007    Landrieu on Faulty NOLA Water Pumps  Work Remains to Secure Coastal Communities GAO investigation reveals that Corps rushed process  lacked comprehensive testing plan when it installed pumps     WASHINGTON    In a report released today  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that the Corps was hasty in installing pumps in New Orleans drainage canals before the 2006 hurricane season despite warnings of factory tested problems and having no comprehensive test plan  The agency completed the report in advance of the 2007 hurricane season  which begins June 1  at the request of United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and it gave her a preliminary briefing on May 17    The Corps made a big mistake when it was not up front with the public about the ineffective pumping operation in the New Orleans region   Sen  Landrieu said   The Corps had no comprehensive testing plan and faulty pumps were installed  Thankfully  a light 2006 hurricane season never put these pumps to the test   A new hurricane season starts this week  and the good news is that the Corps will have replaced all of the faulty pumps  But the pumping system still lacks the pumping capacity we need to keep our communities safe    The GAO report states   Factory testing of the pumps occurred from March through May 2006  and revealed several problems with specific components of the pumping systems  As a result of the concerns identified during factory testing  the Corps had no assurance that the pumping systems would operate to capacity when needed   By the end of this week  according to the GAO  the Corps will have completed reinstallation of 40 pump systems that have each been tested for 45 minutes to two hours  By mid August  the Corps will expand temporary pumping capacity at the 17th Street and London Avenue canals with an additional 19 pumps   But according to the GAO report   The total planned pumping capacity will still not meet the Sewage and Water Board s drainage needs to keep the city from flooding during a hurricane when the canal gates are closed    Due to weaknesses in some canal walls  the GAO said  the city s pumping system will pump about 69 percent of maximum capacity  Even if the canal walls are shored up  the Corps will only be able to pump 82 percent of maximum capacity    We are in a better place than last year for the start of hurricane season   said Sen  Landrieu  chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee   But the Corps still needs to do better  My committee will continue working with the Corps to ensure we have an integrated water management system in South Louisiana capable of keeping us safe from Category 5 hurricanes  The committee also will continue its oversight role  including using the GAO s expertise  over the government agencies responsible for Katrina and Rita recovery so they are held accountable for their work   A full copy of the GAO s report is available here
