Landrieu Asks FEMA for Response on Health Hazard in Trailers         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 18 2007    Landrieu Asks FEMA for Response on Health Hazard in Trailers Formaldehyde is commonplace in trailer materials     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today asked Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Administrator David Paulison for a response by June 15 regarding harmful levels of formaldehyde  a known carcinogen  that have been discovered in FEMA trailers  Sen  Landrieu  chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  said a quick response was necessary so that her subcommittee can investigate the situation    The primary source of the emissions in travel trailers seems to have been the pressed wood products used as flooring  cabinetry  and wallboard   wrote Sen  Landrieu in a letter sent to Paulison today   The use of cheap  unsafe materials  and the agency s failure to require adequate ventilation periods prior to deployment of these units  played a major role in exposing occupants to these toxic fumes   In FEMA s internal investigation  which began in 2006  the agency found that trailers    which were recently offered for sale to the occupants    left unventilated had an average formaldehyde concentration 12 times the level considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency  Formaldehyde fumes can cause coughing  a burning sensation in the eyes  nosebleeds  asthma attacks  sinus infections  and even cancer  Children and seniors are particularly vulnerable  A CBS News investigation  broadcast Wednesday  profiled children who have reportedly fallen ill due to formaldehyde exposure in their trailers    It is unacceptable for the federal government to deploy hazardous units that expose occupants to toxic substances   wrote Sen  Landrieu   Quality control must be emphasized and federal standards for formaldehyde must be applied  It has also been reported that workers at the manufacturing facilities have reported illness and severe symptoms such as coughing up blood and bleeding from the ears after they had ruptured   FEMA recommended that occupants keep the humidity and temperature down in the units  increase ventilation and refrain from smoking    FEMA s recommendation is laughable and divorced from reality   Sen  Landrieu said   How are we supposed to keep heat and humidity out of a trailer in Louisiana   While the Department of Housing and Urban Development uses federal formaldehyde standards on materials used in manufactured and mobile homes  travel trailers and recreational vehicles are not required to meet federal standards  FEMA also did not require emergency trailer manufacturers to meet the existing standards  While the agency has issued warnings to its own employees citing a potential cancer risk to working in FEMA travel trailers  no similar warning has been issued to the thousands of Gulf Coast residents still living in them    FEMA has been aware of this problem for at least a year  and I am deeply concerned that the agency has tested so few trailers and likely only removed a small fraction of those that post a health risk to Gulf Coast residents   Sen  Landrieu wrote   I implore you to expand and accelerate FEMA s efforts to address the formaldehyde hazard that exists in the federal government s disaster housing units and to modify acquisition standards to ensure that FEMA does not deploy additional units that pose such a risk during the upcoming hurricane season
