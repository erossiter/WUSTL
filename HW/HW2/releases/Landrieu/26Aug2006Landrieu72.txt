Landrieu Posts Entry in  Hope and Recovery Tour  Travel Diary From Morgan City         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 26 2006    Landrieu Posts Entry in  Hope and Recovery Tour  Travel Diary From Morgan City     MORGAN CITY    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today posted her fifth entry to her travel diary on the third day of her  Hope and Recovery Tour  of coastal Louisiana   All of her entries appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  http   www bayoubuzz com   a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  From Morgan City  Sen  Landrieu wrote   We ve heard a lot of horror stories about FEMA mismanagement in Louisiana   Today  we saw two examples of where things went right    but it wasn t easy   In New Iberia  we visited the Peebles School   Sitting within eyeshot of the Gulf of Mexico    across a field of sugarcane    the school was destroyed by Hurricane Rita   Repairs would have been massive and costly    more so  in fact  than building a new building  so a new location was sought   But FEMA policies said the agency couldn t fund anything beyond repairing the aging structure in its existing location   There had to be a better way   I challenged FEMA to use some more common sense  and not let bureaucratic red tape stand in the way of the right decision   Bubba Gesser  a New Iberia native on my staff  worked day and night to find a solution    and the agency came around   Iberia Parish will now get to build a new school  safely on the other side of Highway 90  and FEMA will be pitching in   This is the vision that should be guiding our recovery   In many cases  we shouldn t settle for replacing only what existed   We should reach higher and build stronger and better than ever before   In Morgan City  I walked down Front Street with Mayor Tim Matte   We bought coffee and books at Cover to Cover  where Rob and Allison Radtke have built so much more than a store   It s a hub for the new Main Street of Morgan City    the modern equivalent of the town squares of old  where members of the community meet and share their days  their lives  and their hopes for the future   Dominique s School of Dance was wrapping up a rehearsal   The Wildflower Boutique was serving a handful of satisfied customers when we walked in   We also visited Oceaneering International  where they manufacture the world s leading deep sea exploration craft and robots   It was a fascinating visit  and I couldn t be more proud to have such a center of innovation right here in Louisiana   But back to FEMA Mayor Matte is working with the agency to build a group site for trailers along the waterfront   But when the trailers are gone  a beautiful new public space    Lake End Park    will remain for future generations of Morgan City residents to enjoy   In fact  already next year  the park s waterfront will host the Eastern Division inboard motorboat championships   With good planning and design  temporary disaster response measures like trailer parks can transition into something better  something lasting   When the federal funding is matched with smart local vision  a stronger and better legacy can be created for the future    and Mayor Matte has done just that   He is just one of the local leaders    from civic leaders  to elected officials to proud volunteers    who give me so much hope for our recovery   As I have written here before  it is that unbeatable spirit of Louisiana that will carry us through   Our day began in Abbeville  with a breakfast for several dozen local residents  hosted by Gene Sellers   In Jeanerette  we had a fantastic lunch at the home of Mary and Leonard Bourgeois as we celebrated the progress in establishing Eagle Point Park    a project I was proud to secure in the Water Resources Development Act the Senate passed just before the recess    Simone Champagne led this effort  and is another beacon of hope for those in her community  fighting for a better future   Finally  I d like to take a moment to thank you for reading this travel diary   At our Abbeville breakfast  one woman asked me if I intend to keep writing it    and I promised I would   It was tremendously rewarding to hear these notes were being read  and they inspire me to use this space to better communicate with you    to let you know what we ve doing and to find out what s on your mind   Tomorrow  on to Plaquemines Parish  Please be sure to watch my visit to St  Bernard with George Stephanopoulos tomorrow morning on ABC
