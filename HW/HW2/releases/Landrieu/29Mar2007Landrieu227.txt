Landrieu Bill Reforms SBA Disaster Response         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 29 2007    Landrieu Bill Reforms SBA Disaster Response Legislation headed to Senate floor     WASHINGTON    Today the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship today unanimously passed comprehensive  bipartisan legislation to improve the government s Disaster Loan Program and ensure disaster victims receive timely assistance  United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   cosponsor of the legislation  has been working to push the reforms through Congress since the 2005 hurricanes   Hurricanes Katrina and Rita impacted 125 000 small and medium sized businesses Gulfwide  and in Louisiana alone  more than 18 000 businesses were totally destroyed   Sen  Landrieu said   The federal government has an important role in helping businesses get back on their feet  This bill provides significant reforms and gives the SBA additional tools to ensure the agency is better prepared to deal with future disasters  be they natural or manmade   The legislation was also cosponsored by Sens  John Kerry  D Mass   Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine  and David Vitter  R La  The House Small Business Committee passed legislation earlier this month to improve the Disaster Loan Program  Now both bills are headed to consideration by the full Senate and House  The Senate unanimously passed a similar version of this legislation last year   This legislation is critical to providing our small businesses with a swift  comprehensive federal response in the aftermath of a large scale disaster   said Sen  Kerry  Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship   The SBA needs to have the tools made available in this bill in order to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of disaster victims     All of the improvements to the SBA s Disaster program are targeted to allow the agency to be more nimble and effective in the vital role of long term economic recovery   Sen  Snowe said    Such changes are clearly needed and I am hopeful that with these new resources  the Agency will be better equipped to respond to future disasters    Small businesses are the backbone of Louisiana s economy and this legislation provides critical improvements in the SBA s ability to provide timely assistance   Sen  Vitter said    Specifically  I believe the Private Disaster Loan program  which allows banks to make SBA guaranteed loans directly to victims  is needed to streamline the recovery process and quickly get our small businesses back on their feet   The bill would   Create a new presidential declaration of  Catastrophic National Disaster   which will allow the SBA to issue nationwide economic injury disaster loans to small businesses affected by a large scale disaster  Establish a Private Disaster Loan  PDL  program that allows banks to make loans directly to victims after meeting SBA criteria  The SBA will provide an 85 percent guarantee for these loans  Require the SBA to draft rules within one year that would create a new  expedited disaster assistance business loan program   These short term loans would have low interest rates similar to regular disaster loans  This would provide businesses with short term assistance while they await other forms of federal assistance or insurance payouts following future disasters  It specifically addresses one of the major issues following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita    a lack of access to immediate capital to keep businesses afloat  Allow the SBA to provide relief to fuel dependent small businesses when energy prices increase at extraordinarily high rates  Provide key tools for processing disaster loan applications more quickly by authorizing the SBA to enter into agreements with qualified private contractors to process disaster loans and requiring the SBA to analyze and report to Congress on how the disaster loan application process can be improved  and Increase the role of SBA district offices in processing and disbursing disaster loans during large scale disasters  as well as in providing technical assistance to disaster victims during the loan application process
