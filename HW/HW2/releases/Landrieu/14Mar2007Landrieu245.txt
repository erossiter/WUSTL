Landrieu Comments on Corps Defective Flood Control Pumps         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 14 2007    Landrieu Comments on Corps Defective Flood Control Pumps     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on recent reports that the U S  Army Corps of Engineers knowingly installed defective flood control pumps in Louisiana s drainage canals  Sen  Landrieu said   That the Corps would knowingly utilize pumps their own experts deemed defective is gravely troubling   The implication that the political connections of the manufacturer may have played a role in the decision is equally troubling   In designing pumps that are essential to protecting New Orleans and the region  it seems the Corps made one bad decision after another   I will call for a full investigation into whether the Corps installed pumps that either failed during testing or were never tested at all   We must find out if the Corps used taxpayer dollars to buy a product that they knew didn t work and hold the decision makers accountable   The Corps had an opportunity to provide safety and security for the people of New Orleans  but it appears as though they sacrificed smart planning for speed   When Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works John Woodley and the Corps Chief of Engineers  Lt  Gen  Carl Strock  come to the Senate to testify tomorrow  I will expect a full explanation for the Corps  decision making and ensure that they take the necessary steps to protect Louisiana during the upcoming hurricane season and all future storms
