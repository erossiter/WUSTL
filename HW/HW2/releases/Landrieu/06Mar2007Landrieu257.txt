Landrieu Urges FEMA to Keep Promise to College Students         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 06 2007    Landrieu Urges FEMA to Keep Promise to College Students Asks FEMA director not to take back assistance granted to students displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison to express her disappointment over FEMA s recent decision to recoup funding that had been granted to college students in Louisiana after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  Many dormitories at Louisiana colleges were flooded and some of them burned down   Students lost books  clothing  computers and other personal necessities and some had to go to colleges out of state after the storms closed their schools   Like other hurricane victims  students applied for and received expedited assistance to cover housing and other needs   FEMA dispersed the aid  but the agency has recently begun sending intimidating letters to students demanding that the assistance be returned   When FEMA granted expedited assistance to college students  it was an example of a federal agency stepping up appropriately to provide for the victims in the aftermath of a major disaster   Sen  Landrieu said    But now FEMA has broken yet another promise  taking money away from college students that are in no financial position to repay grants that they received more than a year ago   There is no fair justification for taking money away from those who need it most  and I hope FEMA changes course and stops bullying Louisiana s students with intimidating letters demanding repayment   Aid to students after disasters is not unprecedented   After the 9 11 terrorist attacks  FEMA came to the aid of students attending New York University by reimbursing students who were unable to access their dormitories for clothing  textbooks and computers   But  despite the permanent damage that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused  students who were victims of the storms and received assistance are now being required to give it back   It is inexplicable why FEMA would not offer such assistance and courtesies to Louisiana students after the most horrendous natural disaster in the history of our country   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter to Paulison    It is further beyond my comprehension how FEMA could rule that the physical place where these students were spending much of their time living and sleeping was not a primary residence without actually evaluating each circumstance  It seems incomprehensible that more than a year after the hurricanes  FEMA would send out intimidating letters  with little explanation  demanding that the money be repaid or face fines and penalties   To ensure every proper consideration is being provided to impacted Louisiana students and to ease their own burdens of recovery  I respectfully request that any debt owed to you by a student from an impacted university be forgiven  except in circumstances of intentional fraud   Sen  Landrieu wrote  The full text of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
