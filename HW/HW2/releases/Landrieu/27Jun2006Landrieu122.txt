Jefferson Parish  Safe Rooms  Fully Funded in Senate Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 27 2006    Jefferson Parish  Safe Rooms  Fully Funded in Senate Bill Senator Landrieu secures funding to protect     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced that the United States Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee on which she sits has approved an estimated  40 million in reimbursement for Jefferson Parish to construct  safe rooms  at major pumping stations  allowing pump operators to remain at their posts through even the most severe hurricanes     Local officials took the initiative to ensure that Jefferson Parish would have the facilities in place for parish pump operators to stay safely on the job through future hurricanes  at the front lines of protecting parish residents and businesses   Sen  Landrieu said    This funding is a reflection of the importance of these pump operators and the posts they stand  and I will do all that I can to make sure it remains intact through the appropriations process   As a result of legislation passed by Congress since Hurricane Katrina  the Army Corps of Engineers would have constructed these facilities at full federal expense   However  by starting work immediately on its own as part of the parish s hurricane recovery and preparation efforts  Jefferson Parish was ineligible for reimbursement of its expenses    Sen  Landrieu has righted an injustice  making sure that Jefferson Parish is not penalized for being proactive and launching without delay projects that would have been eligible by definition   Jefferson Parish President Aaron Broussard said    This is a huge relief for the parish  as this is significant money we otherwise have had to borrow   I can t express enough my gratitude to Sen  Landrieu for her leadership on our behalf in the subcommittee to provide this important debt service   The project is included in the subcommittee s version of the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill  in which Sen  Landrieu also secured  493 2 million dollars for 78 projects across Louisiana   The subcommittee s funding levels mark an increase over that allocated by the House of Representatives     437 6 million for 54 projects    as well as a nearly 30 percent increase over the President s request of  382 2 million for 45 projects  The full Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to review and approve the subcommittee s recommendations before referring the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill to the full Senate for floor consideration
