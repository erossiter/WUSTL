Sen  Landrieu Secures Nearly  500 Million for La  Projects         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 26 2007    Sen  Landrieu Secures Nearly  500 Million for La  Projects Appropriations panel clears 98 Landrieu sponsored projects throughout state     WASHINGTON    As a member of the United States Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today secured  484 133 000 in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for 98 projects across Louisiana   This funding is a crucial component of our flood control  navigation and coastal protection programs   Sen  Landrieu said    America depends on Louisiana as its trading gateway to the world and we anchor the country s only Energy Coast   This bill will strengthen our economic infrastructure while also funding flood control projects to keep our communities dry if we fall victim to a future natural disaster   In the bill  Sen  Landrieu secured  18 5 million for the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project  SELA   which provides for engineering  design and construction of projects for flood control and improvements to rainfall drainage systems in Jefferson  Orleans and St  Tammany Parishes   Sen  Landrieu last month secured  25 3 million for SELA in the emergency supplemental spending bill that was signed by the President   Sen  Landrieu also secured language directing the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to include authorized features of SELA and internal pumping requirements in the comprehensive protection system   SELA is absolutely essential to protecting the communities of southeast Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said    While we work to strengthen our levees to protect us against future disasters  SELA is critical to keeping our pumps working and preventing flooding from heavy rain storms    I want to complement the extraordinary leadership of Senator Mary Landrieu for advancing the SELA project in tandem with the 100 year flood protection plan   Aaron Broussard  President of Jefferson Parish  said    This is a brilliant plan of Sen  Landrieu s and this will be her lasting legacy for Southeast Louisiana   It is crucial because funding for SELA was being threatened  and at the rate at which it was decreasing  it would have taken decades after decades to fund the SELA projects   Sen  Landrieu s approach will accelerate the advancement of improvements to pumping stations and canals in Jefferson Parish in tandem with the 100 year flood control plan   This is how it should have been  and now  this is how it will be    We are ecstatic because the President had taken out all funding for SELA  and now Sen  Landrieu is providing the leadership to help put the money back   said Tommy Capela  Chairman of the Jefferson Parish Council    Additionally  this bill will allow the Federal Government to reimburse us for the  40 million that Jefferson Parish borrowed from the state to build safehouses and retention ponds so that we could be ready for the next hurricane season   We can now pay that off and the people of Jefferson Parish will not be on the hook for that money   The internal flooding plan in SELA along with the 100 year plan will protect us from nature on an internal drainage basis   And that makes sense because hurricane protection is an integrated system that includes external surge protection and internal pumping capacity   I thank Sen  Landrieu for her leadership and brilliant ideas to help protect our citizens   Sen  Landrieu secured  12 million for Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration projects  LCA   which span along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Mississippi   The goal of LCA is to sustain a coastal ecosystem in south Louisiana  restore the ecosystem and wetlands and aid communities and industries along the coast   Louisiana continues to lose our wetlands at a remarkable rate   Sen  Landrieu said    LCA will help restore our wetlands and maintain a sustainable environment for our communities   This funding is essential to protecting Louisiana s beauty and culture   Sen  Landrieu also secured  4 million in funding for Morganza to the Gulf flood control projects  which were authorized in the 2007 Water Resources Development Act  WRDA    Morganza to the Gulf is a series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes that will  when complete  serve to protect more than 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina   Too many Louisianians are left without hurricane protection   Sen  Landrieu said    This funding will help protect 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina   Sen  Landrieu secured  300 000 to study and develop plans for flood control in Bossier Parish and  7 million for construction of the Comite River Diversion for flood control in Baton Rouge   She also secured funding for key dredging projects for navigation in Louisiana  including  20 million in dredging to maintain navigation in the Calcasieu River in Pass and  9 865 million to maintain navigation by dredging  cutting stoplog slots and maintenance of the Ouachita and Black Rivers   Louisiana provides America s economic gateway to the rest of the world  and this funding will ensure that our waterways are navigable so that we can maximize our economic potential   Sen  Landrieu said  Among the other 92 projects Sen  Landrieu secured funded for  she secured  1 million for the Port of Iberia   2 2 million for Larose to Golden Meadow   14 million for Atchafalaya River and Bayouse Chene  Boeuf and Black and  2 million for the Houma Navigation Canal
