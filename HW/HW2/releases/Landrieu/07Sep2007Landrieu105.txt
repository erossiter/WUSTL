Landrieu Comments on FEMA Disbursement of Alternative Housing Pilot Program Funds         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 07 2007    Landrieu Comments on FEMA Disbursement of Alternative Housing Pilot Program Funds     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on a Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  announcement that the agency is today disbursing  74 5 million to Louisiana to research innovative and permanent housing alternatives to the temporary housing trailers used in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Although the 2005 hurricanes destroyed more than 205 000 homes in Louisiana and about 60 000 in Mississippi  Mississippi has already received more than 70  of the  400 million secured by Sen  Landrieu for the Alternative Housing Pilot Program   The Mississippi project will principally fund new trailers while the Louisiana project will fund single family manufactured homes that are larger  less expensive and more livable than trailers  Sen  Landrieu  Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery  which held a hearing on the issue on April 24th of this year  said   Louisiana s funding through the Alternative Housing Pilot Program is certainly welcome  and we will use it to design smarter ways to house disaster victims   Unfortunately  the vast and disproportionate majority of the funding has been disbursed to Mississippi  where the largest funded project is simply to build more trailers   This was not the intent of Congress   It is disappointing that FEMA would squander this tremendous opportunity to develop smarter ways to house disaster victims   You can add a porch to a trailer  but it s still a trailer   Despite Louisiana suffering nearly four times more housing damage due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the flooding that followed  our state received less than a third of the alternative housing funding   In Louisiana  the funding will be used to develop safer and more livable housing options at a lower cost to taxpayers   Hopefully FEMA will start to learn from its mistakes and this innovation to transition away from trailers if another disaster strikes    My subcommittee has well documented FEMA s mistakes in implementing this Alternative Housing Pilot Program   These are serious issues and may warrant additional Congressional oversight
