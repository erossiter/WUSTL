Landrieu Introduces Amendments to Strengthen Water Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 14 2007    Landrieu Introduces Amendments to Strengthen Water Bill Fast track Category 5 protection and MRGO closure     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today filed seven amendments to strengthen the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2007  one of which would fast track Category 5 protection projects and accelerate the closure of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet  MRGO   WRDA authorizes  13 9 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects nationwide  including  3 6 billion in coastal restoration  hurricane protection  flood control and navigation projects in Louisiana  The last WRDA bill was passed in 2000   Category 5 protection projects are a critical aspect to securing coastal communities from hurricanes that rise out of the Gulf   Sen  Landrieu said   This amendment moves these projects forward and addresses the Administration s constitutional and budgetary concerns that caused similar language to be stripped from the committee passed bill  The amendment ensures we don t need to wait for another WRDA bill to get these crucial projects underway  Our communities cannot wait seven years or more for Congress to turn back to WRDA   Sen  Landrieu s Category 5 MRGO amendment would approve the projects most ready for implementation in a design and analysis plan  due in December  that the Corps is preparing at Sen  Landrieu request  This language alleviates the constitutional question surrounding similar language in the Environment and Public Works committee passed version of the bill  which was removed when the bill was brought to the floor  That language would have waived full Congressional and Presidential approval for Category 5 protection projects  causing the Bush Administration to oppose the measure  claiming it violated Presidential authority granted by the Constitution   By capping early stage authorization for these projects at  500 million  the amendment also alleviates the cost concerns that arose from the committee passed language  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  had scored the original Category 5 provision at  15 billion  mistakenly assuming that the funds for the 30 year effort would be expended in a much shorter  immediate time period   The CBO  in a letter to Sen  Landrieu  later admitted they did not have any specific basis for this estimate  This unverifiable projection effectively doubled the calculated cost of the bill  setting the stage for a likely Presidential veto   Recognizing that the early stages of hurricane protection projects are primarily study and design  not construction  the  500 million Landrieu amendment would move Category 5 projects forward until Congress passes another WRDA bill  which is scheduled to be considered in 2008   The amendment also expedites the closure of MRGO  The canal  having widened as a result of decades of coastal erosion  is considered by many engineers and analysts to have been a significant contributing factor to the strength of the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain following Hurricane Katrina  The underlying bill includes language secured by Sen  Landrieu that requires the Corps to develop a closure plan for MRGO  which is due 180 days from WRDA s passage   MRGO left so many Louisianians vulnerable to the wrath of Hurricane Katrina   Sen  Landrieu said   It needs to be closed without delay so that our coastal communities can be safe from future storm surges   Sen  Landrieu also introduced an amendment to authorize the deepening of the Houma Navigation Canal  Deepening the channel would give the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico  which serves the energy needs of the entire nation  better access to offshore platforms  Previous attempts to authorize the Houma deepening by attaching it to the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project drew partisan opposition  which derailed Morganza s authorization of the entire project  This amendment adds the provision to WRDA in a way that does not make vulnerable the underlying Morganza to the Gulf project authorization  The project is a series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes that will  when complete  serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina  Another amendment that Sen  Landrieu introduced provides for a more equitable cost share for the Amite River and Tributaries Project  This language matches a provision sponsored by Rep  Richard Baker  R La   in the House passed version  For years  Rep  Baker has been fighting for a more just federal share for the project   Other amendments introduced by Sen  Landrieu would   Require a final environmental impact statement for the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal Lock by July 1  2008  Deepen a section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to keep the channel depth consistent with the Port of Morgan City  Protect Louisiana s hydro electric energy users  and Provide credit for work performed at the Leon Theriot Lock  Full text of Sen  Landrieu s amendments is available
