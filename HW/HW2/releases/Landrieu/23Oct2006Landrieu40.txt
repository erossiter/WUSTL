New York Times Reverses Course  Endorses Domenici Landrieu Offshore Revenue Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 23 2006    New York Times Reverses Course  Endorses Domenici Landrieu Offshore Revenue Bill     WASHINGTON    Saying  it is time to make a serious effort to save the vanishing wetlands and barrier islands along the coast of Louisiana   the New York Times today endorsed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  which would open 8 3 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico to new oil and gas production and dedicate a portion of the revenues to coastal restoration  hurricane protection and flood control projects in Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama and Texas  The editorial   A Reason to Drill in the Gulf   comes six days after U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   made Louisiana s case before the New York Times editorial board as part of a series of meetings with major news organizations that also included CNN  FOX News and ABC News   Sen  Landrieu is the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill  which she crafted in partnership with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   The House should adopt this measure in its present form during the coming lame duck session  and President Bush should sign it   the paper wrote  The endorsement represents an apparent reversal by the paper  which in its August 2 editorial   Delusional Thinking in the Senate   called the bill  bad fiscal policy  since one third of the royalties that would normally accrue to all Americans from drilling in federal waters would flow to just four gulf states    I am grateful to the New York Times for taking the time to meet with me last week  and am happy to have their support for the Domenici Landrieu revenue sharing bill   Sen  Landrieu said today    Our bill lays a significant foundation for the kind of steady revenue stream we can rely on to restore our wetlands  rebuild our levees and construct comprehensive flood control   I am hopeful that this support from such an influential national newspaper will aid in our efforts to see the bill passed before the year is out   The paper also distinguished the Domenici Landrieu bill from a far broader reaching bill passed by the House  saying their support for the Senate bill  should not be taken as a blanket endorsement of offshore drilling  nor as an endorsement of a mischievous bill sponsored by Representative Richard Pombo  Republican of California  and passed by the House last summer   Calling the House bill  so poorly thought out as to be unacceptable  even as a starting point for compromise   the Times cited provisions of the bill that would open the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to offshore drilling  despite widespread opposition to the proposal by Republican and Democratic Senators and Governors from the affected states     The Landrieu bill would simply enlarge the drilling area in the gulf  where oil and gas exploration has been broadly accepted for years   the paper wrote  Negotiations to forge a compromise between the House and Senate broke down last month over the House s continued insistence that some East or West coats drilling be included  with incentives for more in the future   Sen  Landrieu has said she supports such expanded offshore production  but recognizes that bipartisan opposition from East and West coast states would doom its passage   With all the facts on the table  the Times recognized that the carefully crafted Domenici Landrieu bill can have a tremendous impact on protecting and restoring America s only Energy Coast without getting involved in controversies that would threaten its passage   Sen  Landrieu said     I believe that we need to do more in the way of domestic production and energy conservation  and hope to work with my colleagues next year to craft an Energy Bill that will do that   But the last Energy Bill took ten years to come together  and Louisiana doesn t have that time to wait   We cannot afford to let our coast s future be held hostage by the politics of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts   President Bush has opposed the House bill  but has repeatedly endorsed the Senate plan   The Landrieu bill targets an immediate need   the Times said   The House should not see it as a rival to Mr  Pombo s bill  which has no chance of passing the Senate  or  for that matter  as primarily an energy bill  The House should instead see it as a way to restore the health of a battered ecosystem  as future protection for the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people  and as a way to deliver on unfulfilled promises   The full text of today s editorial can be found   and the August 2 editorial can be found
