Sen  Landrieu Statement on the London Attacks         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 21  2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement on the London Attacks     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   issued the following statement today regarding the attacks in London  Sen  Landrieu said   While the details of today s incident are still unfolding  it is another stark reminder of the many challenges before us in fighting terrorism  both at home and abroad   Our ports  trains and subways are not as safe as they should be  and our first responders have not received from Washington all the resources they need to protect us   We must do better   The cost of acting today is far less than the cost of waiting for the next attack on our shores   In addition  there are other steps we can take to increase our own security right here in the United States   With the Energy Bill currently pending  we must remember that our being a target for terrorism is in part a result of our dependence on Mid East oil    With our men and women dying in Iraq  it is unconscionable for us not to try to wean ourselves off the energy supply they are in part fighting to secure   I know that many of my colleagues in the Senate and House recognize that in order to do this  we must support the coastal states like Louisiana who are already helping to meet to our energy needs     It is my hope that the Administration will also reach this conclusion   I join the people of Louisiana and America in extending our prayers and support for the people of London who this afternoon suffered more senseless acts of violence   Today  and everyday  we continue to stand with our friends in the United Kingdom and around the world to ensure that the terrorists responsible are brought to justice     30
