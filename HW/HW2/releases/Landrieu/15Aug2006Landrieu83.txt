Former Senators Back Domenici Landrieu Revenue Sharing Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 15 2006    Former Senators Back Domenici Landrieu Revenue Sharing Bill  The Senate bill is our state s best hope   Breaux says     WASHINGTON    Former United States Senators John Breaux  D La   and J  Bennett Johnston  D La   this week announced their support for the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  in a pair of opinion pieces for the New Orleans Times Picayune and The Advocate of Baton Rouge    The bill would open new territory off the Gulf Coast to oil and natural gas drilling and share a portion of the new royalties with Louisiana and three other coastal states to fund wetlands restoration  hurricane protection and flood control projects     Three planets have come into alignment  hurricanes Katrina and Rita  a new energy crisis and a newly energized Louisiana delegation led by Sen  Mary Landrieu   Sen  Johnston wrote in a letter published in the Advocate today    The result is an excellent Senate passed bill   The House passed its own bill  with a larger share for Gulf Coast states but it would allow drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts which threatens the bill s passage   Sen  Breaux echoed that analysis in an August 10 guest opinion column in the Times Picayune   The House bill would encourage drilling off America s east and west coasts in addition to royalty sharing provisions   he wrote    But White House opposition to the cost of the bill and the irreconcilable controversy over Atlantic and Pacific coastal drilling makes it unlikely to pass in the foreseeable future   The Senate bill  on the other hand  has a much greater chance to become law   As someone who fought for more offshore revenues for Louisiana for 32 years as a member of both the House and the Senate  I can say without doubt that the framework of the Senate bill is our state s best hope to get meaningful revenue sharing now   Both senators compared the current negotiations between the Senate and House to those between Louisiana Governor Earl Long and President Harry Truman in 1949  when Long took the advice of Plaquemines Parish boss Leander Perez and rejected a 37 5 percent offshore oil and gas revenue share offered by the president   There is a good and generous offer on the table   Sen  Johnston wrote   Let s not let the unattainable perfect be the enemy of the achievable good  Leander Perez taught us a costly lesson in the 1950s  Let s not repeat his mistake    Louisiana now has a chance to reopen the window of opportunity that was closed nearly six decades ago   Sen  Breaux wrote    If we hold back  hoping for a bigger pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  and don t pass the bill that has a real chance  we could end up where we were 54 years ago  with nothing at all  History taught us a bitter lesson then  Shame on us if we don t heed it now   Sen  Johnston s letter can be found   Sen  Breaux s opinion column can be found   This week s column by Stephen Handwerk of Lafayette  who also discusses the bill on the Daily Advertiser web site  can be found   The Advocate also published an editorial endorsing the Domenici Landrieu bill  which is available
