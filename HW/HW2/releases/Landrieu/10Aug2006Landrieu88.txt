provide expanded economic incentives for new businesses  Delivers federal grants to local leaders     RAYVILLE  La     Following an Economic Development Breakfast at the Rayville Civic Center this morning  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   announced that she will work to encourage major automobile manufacturers to build a new plant on a 1 425 acre site near Holly Ridge  La   I am proud to champion North Louisiana s economic growth in Washington  and in particular  to deliver to our nation s automobile manufacturers the message of opportunity this site presents   Sen  Landrieu said    A new plant in North Louisiana would be a sturdy anchor for revitalizing the region  creating new jobs and spurring growth among the other businesses that call the Delta home   Sen  Landrieu s commitment to championing the so called  megasite  development came at the urging of Louisiana State Representative Francis C  Thompson  D Delhi     I can think of nobody better than Sen  Landrieu to help champion this important project   Rep  Thompson said  The State of Louisiana currently holds a 12 year option on the Richland Parish property  with an opportunity to secure as much as an additional 4 500 acres   Situated at the heart of a 14 parish federally designated renewal community in North Louisiana  the property is particularly attractive to industrial uses as a result of the employment credits and tax incentives that the designation grants    Sen  Landrieu has joined with Sen  Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   to introduce S  3827  a bill to extend these economic incentives through 2015 while adjusting various definitions and rules in the program to create additional flexibility for local governments and improve administration of the program     The existing renewal community and empowerment zone program is very important to the economic future of North Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said    But changes are necessary to make it more effective  more responsive to local government needs  and to ensure that the incentives work as intended   This bill will put more flexibility in the hands of our local officials  giving them a powerful tool to attract new businesses  expand local ones  create new jobs and strengthen their local economies   U S  Representative Rodney Alexander  R La   has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives  H R  5660   The only difference between the Alexander and Lincoln Landrieu bills is that the Senate bill contains additional provisions to allow rural renewal communities to expand beyond their originally defined area to encompass the entire town or parish in cases where the rates of unemployment  poverty and residents moving out of the region are particularly high  The Northern Louisiana Renewal Community is one of four renewal communities in Louisiana  and 40 nationwide  identified as being economically distressed and in a position to significantly benefit from new business development  existing business expansion and local employment growth   It includes Claiborne  Union  Morehouse  Webster  Lincoln  West Carroll  Bienville  Jackson  Richland  Red River  De Soto  Winn  Caldwell and Franklin parishes
