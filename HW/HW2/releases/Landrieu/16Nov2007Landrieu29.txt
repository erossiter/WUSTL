Landrieu Statement on Iraq Votes         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 16 2007    Landrieu Statement on Iraq Votes Calls competing funding bills  flawed      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released a statement today following her votes on whether the Senate should begin to debate either of two proposals to extend funding for the war in Iraq   Both procedural motions fell short of the 60 votes required to begin a debate on the underlying bills themselves  Sen  Landrieu said   While isolated examples of success have emerged from Iraq  the lack of clarity in the Administration s strategy has entrenched U S  forces in a seemingly open ended duty to police a prolonged civil war   We need to establish specific objectives for our presence there  clear benchmarks for our success  and a commitment to bringing our troops home once these goals are achieved   But unrealistic timetables or irresponsible cuts to troop funding are not acceptable substitutes for a coherent strategy   Our men and women in uniform need every resource at their disposal to fight this war and come home safely     The Senate voted today on whether to move forward with a pair of flawed bills to extend funding for operations in Iraq   It is important that at least one of these measures proceeds to a debate and an up or down vote to ensure that the continued funding of our troops and their protection does not get interrupted by a partisan political fight   However  in their current forms  I cannot wholeheartedly endorse either proposal   Earlier this year  I introduced legislation that would properly recalibrate our priorities in the War on Terror on dismantling al Qaeda and capturing or killing its leaders   My plan would also ensure that U S  forces only deploy when they have the equipment and training to fulfill their mission safely and successfully   We owe our troops no less   I voted today to begin debate on a House bill that sets this standard while beginning to craft clear objectives for our presence in Iraq and creating the opportunity for continued funding of our troops   The Senate Republican proposal  offered in violation of Constitutional procedure  would merely fund an extension of the status quo    blindly marching towards undefined goals   That said  I believe the 30 day target set by the House bill to begin redeployment is too ambitious   Commanders on the ground must be given a reasonable period of time to draw down the U S  presence in Iraq safely  efficiently and responsibly   If this bill were to move to a debate in its current form  I would support an amendment to grant our commanders this appropriate flexibility to do their jobs   I caution my colleagues against placing the desire for snappy sound bites ahead of the military and unstable political realities of the region
