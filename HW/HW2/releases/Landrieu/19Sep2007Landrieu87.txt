Oil and Water Do Mix         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 19 2007    Oil and Water Do Mix A column by Unites States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La     WASHINGTON    The following op ed was published today in a Capitol Hill newspaper  The Hill  Louisiana newspapers are invited to reprint it  Louisianans know a lot about oil and water  and contrary to popular belief  they do mix  They are infused in our lives like Cajun food and the Blues  Louisiana stands watch over a massive national energy infrastructure that produces  processes and transports nearly a quarter of America s oil and natural gas supply and about 20 percent of our national oil imports  It is produced close to our shores and on vast expanses of valuable coastal wetlands  The mouth of the Mississippi River in lower Plaquemines Parish  the seventh largest delta in the world  is the gateway to the interior of the United States and to ports around the world  Dozens of energy and cargo ports line our coast  The Port of South Louisiana exports 51 million tons of cargo a year  more than any other port in North America  More than 2 300 miles of navigable waterways traverse the state  connecting the rest of the country to the energy supply and products produced and imported through these mighty Louisiana waterways  The 2008 energy and water appropriations bill is literally one of Louisiana s lifeline pieces of legislation and is critical for the country  given the nation s dependence on Louisiana  Also in this bill is a solid investment in new energy sources  such as nuclear power  that will help us reduce our dependence on the waning supply of oil and natural gas  We need swift passage  and here s why  For Louisiana  the committee passed Senate bill will fund  472 million for flood control  dredging  navigation and coastal restoration programs that protect our ports and the energy infrastructure that supplies the entire nation  One of the vital provisions is  18 5 million for the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project  SELA   which undergirds vital flood control projects and rainfall drainage systems in Jefferson  Orleans and St  Tammany parishes  where nearly a million people live  As we work to strengthen our levees  SELA is essential to sustaining our unique internal pumping operations  Critical to two other significantly populated parishes  Terrebone and Lafourche  is  4 million in the bill for Morganza to the Gulf flood control projects  a series of levees  locks and other systems that  when complete  will serve to protect more than 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land that serve the nation as an energy hub  Morganza to the Gulf also requires authorization from the yet to be passed Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   the nation s key legislation guiding water related infrastructure projects all over the country  This bill is supposed to pass every two years but has been held up for seven  The House and Senate have reached a conference agreement  but the bill faces an administration veto because it says the bill s projects are  unaffordable and unnecessary   Our failing national infrastructure  as demonstrated by the Minnesota bridge collapse  hangs in the balance as the administration threatens to kill this bill  Also significant in the bill are projects to restore Louisiana s wetlands  which are disappearing at an alarming rate  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita alone washed away 217 square miles of coastal wetlands  an area 3 5 times the size of Washington  D C  This is an ecological tragedy that also imperils thousands of miles of pipelines and other vital energy infrastructure by leaving us vulnerable to further erosion  Louisiana s wetlands are nature s levee system  they diminish the destructive force of a hurricane s power  reducing a storm surge by one foot for every 2 4 square miles of wetlands  scientists estimate  To combat wetland loss  the Energy and Water bill contains an important  12 million down payment to the Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration projects  LCA   which over several decades will cost billions  LCA will work to sustain and restore the coastal ecosystem in South Louisiana through numerous methods  including sediment redistribution and fresh water diversion projects  As our natural gas and oil supplies dwindle and the situation in the Middle East remains volatile  America desperately needs to diversify its energy sources  and this bill also helps to do just that  The bill provides  135 million for the Department of Energy s Nuclear Power 2010 program  recognizing that nuclear power will combat global climate change and help meet our climbing energy needs  Government support is essential because in the next 40 years  35 new nuclear plants are needed to keep pace with our escalating energy demand  The bill also funds the Department of Energy s loan guarantee program for energy projects that utilize revolutionary new technologies  Funding the program will encourage Wall Street that the government is serious about a new direction in energy policy  Congress must come together and quickly pass and send to the president the energy and water appropriations bill  It is crucial for Louisiana  and our national economic future is intertwined with Louisiana s security  Landrieu is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee
