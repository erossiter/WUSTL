Sen  Landrieu Crafts Bipartisan Effort To Provide  1 6 Billion for Gulf Coast Schools         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 02 05    Sen  Landrieu Crafts Bipartisan Effort To Provide  1 6 Billion for Gulf Coast Schools Compromise provides immediate assistance to all schools that take in displaced students     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   brought together a bipartisan group of senators late yesterday to introduce an amendment to provide immediate funding to public and private schools that have opened their doors to children displaced by the hurricanes and subsequent levee breaks   This legislation represents a key part of the blueprint introduced by the Louisiana delegation in September   She is joined in this endeavor by a broad coalition of senators  including Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   Edward Kennedy  D Mass   Mike Enzi  R Wyo   and Christopher Dodd  D Conn   The momentum is building for a new  exciting  improved school system in New Orleans and throughout the region   said Sen  Landrieu    We will be building better schools  providing more choice for parents  and giving more opportunities for every child to achieve excellence   There is no doubt that this rebuilding effort will take time  but right now there is an important and urgent need for federal assistance to provide aid to school children along the Gulf Coast who have been displaced by these disasters    Through the savings in this reconciliation bill we have the opportunity not only to authorize programs that will serve the thousands of children affected by hurricane Katrina  but to defer the costs required to meet their educational needs   said Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Enzi    Investing these funds in this way will meet an immediate need  but education is a longer term investment in the future of our country and its ability to compete in a global economy   We must focus our efforts on ensuring that the educational needs of the children affected by this unprecedented emergency are addressed  and I believe that this amendment achieves that goal    It s been two months since this unprecedented disaster struck  and the federal government has still provided no assistance to these schools  these communities  or these children   So many schools in the region and around the country have graciously opened their doors to children without the assistance they deserve   America can do better for the people of the Gulf Coast   we need a response to Katrina that is as generous as the American people are   This measure puts aside politics and ideological battles to get the necessary aid to these schools and to these children without further delay   Sen  Kennedy said  The aid provided by the amendment would flow through the public school system and maintain public accountability while assisting both public and private schools across the country that have generously taken in the thousands of students displaced   In Louisiana alone  more than 226 000 students are currently displaced    The bipartisan effort has drawn praise from state and national education leaders  Louisiana Education Superintendent  Cecil J  Picard    Nearly half of Louisiana s 68 school systems were facing serious financial difficulties before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck  Yet these systems took a leap of faith and enrolled displaced students  knowing it would increase their financial burdens   Now the strain of absorbing thousands of students and teachers has brought these systems to the brink of bankruptcy  They did their part to help those hurt by the storms  These children  and the school systems that took them in  are now counting on the federal government to provide the assistance they so desperately need    Reverend William F  Maestri  Superintendent of Catholic Schools for the Archdiocese of New Orleans    After due consideration  and expressing our desire that there would be more inclusion in proposed relief opportunities for those attending nonpublic schools  the office of Catholic Schools for the Archdiocese of New Orleans supports this crucial national effort to provide relief for the students and families displaced by the storms   We welcome the effort to provide broad relief for so many families affected by this disaster   It is hoped that the efforts on behalf of children and families will help to rebuild our educational systems and provide for a better tomorrow   We look forward to working with federal  state  and local officials in equitably providing relief and support to all of our students and families    Chairman of the Louisiana State Senate Education Committee J  Chris Ullo    This legislation would be a big financial help for everyone who has opened their arms and taken our students in    Executive Director for the Council of Chief State School Officers G  Thomas Houlihan    State education agencies across the country have played a vital role in working with schools and districts to meet the needs of the 372 000 students displaced by the storm   This legislation provides an important step forward in framing the proper coordinated federal  state  district  and school level effort that is necessary to create a positive learning environment for displaced students across the country    Under the bill  each eligible district will receive quarterly installment payments for each student enrolled in a given quarter in either a public or a private school in that district   Maximum total payment is  6 000 per student and  7 500 per student with disabilities  not to exceed cost of tuition at private schools   This bill provides the necessary assistance to all schools that have opened their doors and their hearts following the worst natural disaster in our nation s history   In Louisiana  some school systems have seen 10 and 15 percent increases in their student body   They desperately need our help   Sen  Landrieu said   The waves of Katrina and Rita impacted our coast  and now the waves of new families are impacting our school systems   This is a time to put politics aside and provide real help and real solutions   The amendment is expected to be debated on the Senate floor tomorrow    30
