Landrieu Co Sponsors Bill to Protect Police Officers         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 20 2007    Landrieu Co Sponsors Bill to Protect Police Officers Legislation would help disaster affected communities buy bulletproof vests     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   this week co sponsored a bill to allow disaster affected and other financially limited local law enforcement officers to acquire bulletproof vests at reduced or no cost   The bill  co sponsored by Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Hillary Clinton  D N Y   Barbara Mikulski  D Md   and Richard Shelby  R Ala   would allow need based waivers of the local matching requirement for grants under the existing Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program   Our police officers risk their lives in the line of fire   Sen  Landrieu said    But a hurricane or other disaster should not stand in the way of a community s ability to serve and protect its residents   This legislation helps protect those who protect us by making it easier for cash strapped local law enforcement to provide bulletproof vests for our policemen   Law enforcement agencies have struggled to find the funds necessary to replace bulletproof and stab resistant vests  which have a life expectancy of roughly five years  and to purchase new vests for newly hired officers   Vests cost between  500 and  1000 each   Officers have had to dip into their own pockets to pay for new vests  which remain one of the most important defenses for law enforcement officers  Since 1999  the Bulletproof Vest Program has provided  173 million to purchase about 500 000 vests in more than 11 500 jurisdictions nationwide   The program funds up to 50 percent of cost of replacing or purchasing new vests   The program is required to fully fund the 50 percent of requested vest needs for jurisdictions with populations below 100 000  and the remaining funds are distributed to jurisdictions of over 100 000    The changes proposed in the legislation  introduced Tuesday night  would give discretion to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance within the Justice Department to grant waivers or reductions in the match requirements for bulletproof vest awards to state and local law enforcement agencies that can demonstrate fiscal hardship   The senators point out that local law enforcement agencies are constantly responding to new challenges  from fighting a recent rise in violent crime to responding to threats of terrorism   Waiving the match requirement as needed for life saving body armor would make vests available for law enforcement officers in New Orleans  in other Gulf Coast states  or in other rural or urban areas that experience disasters or other circumstances that create fiscal hardships   Leahy and Clinton note that DOJ already has such a mechanism in place for determining if waivers for financial hardship are warranted in programs such as the Violence Against Women Act  the COPS program  and grants to Indian tribes
