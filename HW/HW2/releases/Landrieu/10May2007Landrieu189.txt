Senate Begins Debate on Water Bill   3 6 B for La          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 10 2007    Senate Begins Debate on Water Bill   3 6 B for La  Landrieu fights to secure Category 5 protection plan     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced that the United States Senate has begun debate on a bill authorizing  13 9 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects nationwide  including  3 6 billion in coastal restoration  hurricane protection  flood control and navigation projects in Louisiana   When complete  the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2007 will be the first such bill passed since 2000  ending a seven year wait to move forward with key Louisiana projects  such as the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project and the Louisiana Coastal Area restoration project   The WRDA bill is crucial for Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said   It s crucial for hurricane protection projects  for wetlands restoration projects and for navigation projects that will support our economy and help us and our rebuilding  It has been seven years since we have been able to pass the WRDA bill  and Chairman Boxer is determined in the Senate to get this bill passed   Louisiana will benefit tremendously    we have twenty five percent of all the projects in the nation in this bill for Louisiana  including Morganza to the Gulf   We re making tremendous progress  so I m encouraged that the bill is on the floor   The WRDA measure being brought to the floor  however  does not include language previously included in the committee passed bill that would have created an expedited approval process for Category 5 hurricane protection and flood control projects    The language would have waived full Congressional and Presidential approval for Category 5 protection projects proposed by a design and analysis plan Sen  Landrieu requested in the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill   That report is due from the Army Corps of Engineers this December  and the language Sen  Landrieu worked to secure in earlier versions of the WRDA bill would have allowed projects in it to move forward following approval by a pair of Congressional committees with jurisdiction  the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  The Bush Administration opposed the measure  claiming it violated Presidential authority granted by the Constitution   With the White House having already opposed the  15 billion price tag of a WRDA bill passed by the House of Representatives  further opposition to the Category 5  fast track  provision had been expected following an erroneous estimate of its cost by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO     Having not seen the Corps  report  and with no reference for what projects would or would not be included  the CBO put a  15 billion price tag on the measure  mistakenly estimating that the funds for the 30 year effort would be expended in a much shorter  more immediate time period   This unverifiable estimate effectively doubled the calculated cost of the bill  setting the stage for a likely Presidential veto  Sen  Landrieu is working with members of the Environment and Public works Committee on language that would both expedite Category 5 projects and address the constitutional question  She is also seeking an analysis of the CBO s score for the project    If we can work out the challenges regarding Category 5 hurricane protection  we ll be in terrific shape to move forward on WRDA   Sen  Landrieu said
