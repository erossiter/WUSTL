Congress Expected to Provide  1 Billion to Louisiana  Other Coastal States         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  July 25  2005    Congress Expected to Provide  1 Billion to Louisiana  Other Coastal States Draft Conference Report Adopts Louisiana Plan for Coastal Oil  and Gas Producing States  Plus National Inventory of Offshore Resources     WASHINGTON    Draft provisions of an Energy Bill Conference Report circulated late last night and expected to be voted upon today include  1 billion in coastal impact assistance for Louisiana and other coastal oil  and gas producing states  U S  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and David Vitter  R La   announced this morning     This is an incredibly important victory for Louisiana and the other Gulf Coast producing states who contribute so much to our national energy supply  security and economy each year   said Sen  Landrieu  who led Gulf Coast efforts to secure the funding from her position on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee     As a result of our delegations  hard work over many years  the federal government will now for the first time acknowledge these significant contributions and recognize America s Wetlands and Gulf Coast for the vital security and economic strength they provide    By working together on the Energy Bill  Senator Landrieu and I convinced our colleagues that this is not just a Louisiana problem  but a national one   said Sen  Vitter    This funding is the next step in implementing the Louisiana Coastal Area program and truly restoring our coast  The future of Louisiana s coastal restoration funding is looking brighter than ever     I am especially proud of our delegation s terrific teamwork in securing this funding   Sen  Landrieu said    Governor Blanco has been a dedicated leader and strong voice addressing the challenges of our coast   And while Senator Vitter and I worked in the Senate to secure the funding  our House delegation built strong support for the concept as well   If adopted by the full conference committee this afternoon as expected  the measure would provide  1 billion     250 million per year for fiscal years 2007 through 2010    to six coastal energy producing states  Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi  Alabama  Alaska and California   Each state would be allocated a fair share based on the oil and gas production off its coast  with Louisiana standing to receive a particularly fair 54 percent  or  135 million per year   The measure authorizes funds to be used for the conservation  protection and restoration of coastal areas and wetlands  the mitigation of damage to fish  wildlife and other natural resources  and the implementation of federally approved marine  coastal and other conservation management plans   Coastal parishes  counties and boroughs  would receive 35 percent of each state s share    The direct spending  which is not subject to appropriations  was originally added to the Senate version of the bill by a 69 26 vote last month despite White House opposition     The affordability argument cited by the Office of Management and Budget ignores the  5 billion in offshore royalties Louisiana sends to the federal government each year   Sen  Landrieu said    Fortunately  under Chairman Barton s leadership  the conference committee recognized the need to share a fair portion with the critically important ports and wetlands that are serving their generations old duty as the gateways to America    We have made a giant first step with this funding  which provides the immediate support we need so urgently   Sen  Landrieu added    Louisiana could not afford to wait through more hurricane seasons without the necessary funding to protect our coast and the essential infrastructure it hosts   But the Gulf waters won t stop coming ashore when 2010 comes  and so  we cannot lose sight of the greater goal of sustained coastal impact assistance     The possibility exists for a robust out year provision that will ensure a fair share for Louisiana for many years to come  and our delegation will continue fighting for it    Our coast is in crisis and we fuel this nation    Louisiana s contribution needs to be recognized   added Vitter    I m also very pleased that a modified version of my alternative energy enhancement act is being included to encourage alternative uses of our federal offshore waters and to set up a royalty sharing mechanism by which Louisiana would receive a new source of revenue associated with offshore alternative energy production   Sen  Vitter said  In addition to the coastal impact assistance  the Energy Bill is also expected to include a Senate passed measure proposed by Sen  Landrieu for the Department of the Interior to conduct the nation s first comprehensive assessment of offshore energy resources   This inventory is about common sense policy   Sen  Landrieu said    We cannot reasonably discuss how to best lessen our dependence on Middle Eastern oil unless we fully understand what alternatives exist here at home               Both chambers of Congress are expected to pass the full bill  H R  6  later this week and deliver it to the President for his signature      30
