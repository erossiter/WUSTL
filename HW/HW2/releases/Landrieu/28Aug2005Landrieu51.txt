Sen  Landrieu Statement on Hurrican Katrina         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 28  2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement on Hurrican Katrina      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   issued the following statement from the Hurricane Command Center in Baton Rouge  Louisiana   I would like to commend both Governor Blanco and all of the local leaders who have done a tremendous job helping the people of Louisiana prepare for Hurricane Katrina   Unfortunately  the reverberations of this storm will be felt not only in Louisiana but across the nation     Our port system provides the nation with the transportation needs for our country s economy and commerce while our coastline provides the energy for our homes and industries   And Louisiana s unique wetlands provide our state with a buffer zone from natural disasters such as hurricanes   But our wetlands have been eroding   As I have said before  in order for us to protect America s energy supply and transportation needs  the federal government must join with the people of Louisiana to preserve America s wetlands     But as we have not weathered all of Katrina yet  we ask the American people to keep us in their thoughts and prayers at this time      30
