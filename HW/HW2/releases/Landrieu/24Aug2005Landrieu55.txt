Sen  Landrieu Addresses St  Mary Parish Chamber of Commerce         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 24 05    Sen  Landrieu Addresses St  Mary Parish Chamber of Commerce Discusses channel improvements  next steps for coastal restoration     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today addressed the St  Mary Parish Chamber of Commerce to discuss improvements to the port s navigation channel and the next steps for coastal restoration efforts   The meeting follows last month s passage of the Energy Bill  which includes  1 billion in coastal impact assistance over four years to six coastal oil  and gas producing states  including  135 million per year for Louisiana or 54 percent of the total funding   The recent passage of the coastal impact assistance provision was a significant victory for Louisiana and the other coastal oil  and gas producing states   said Sen  Landrieu    I am so pleased that everyone    the House  the Senate  and even ultimately the White House    was able to put reason over rancor and provide the nation with the first comprehensive energy legislation in more than 13 years  and give Louisiana some much needed coastal assistance   Louisiana and our nation would not have a successful oil and gas industry were it not for places like Morgan City   As the manufacturer of offshore structures  the port is a particularly great contributor to our national energy supply  security and economy each year   With the port doing so much for our state and nation  we must ensure that its channels are sufficiently deep and wide for the port to remain competitive   The Port of Morgan City currently serves as the host site for the fabrication of the bottom sides of offshore structures used in the oil and gas industry   In the FY 2006 Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill  nearly  25 million was included to help the port maintain its current authorized size  and  585 000 was included to deepen the channel linking the port to the Gulf of Mexico by 15 feet to 35 feet  The direct Energy Bill spending  championed by Sen  Landrieu from her position on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee  is not subject to appropriations and was originally added to the Senate bill by a 69 26 vote in June despite strong White House opposition     The coastal impact assistance in the Energy Bill is just the beginning   Sen  Landrieu said    We must build on our success and provide for a permanent and robust program acknowledging the financial contribution made by coastal oil and gas host states   On August 12  Sen  Landrieu welcomed the House Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals to Port Fourchon for a field hearing on coastal erosion   She will testify at a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works field hearing in New Orleans this Friday   Through the coastal impact assistance provision  we have seen how valuable a tour of America s Wetland can be in convincing other members of the importance of saving our coast   said Sen  Landrieu  who during the summer of 2003  took Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   and Ranking Member Jeff Bingaman  D N M   on flyover tours of Louisiana s coastline    I know that after seeing our coast firsthand  the members of the House Subcommittee better understood its unique and vital significance   Hopefully there will be multiple members of the Senate EPW Committee present Friday so they  too  can learn of our coast s national impact and need for federal support   Sen  Landrieu added    30
