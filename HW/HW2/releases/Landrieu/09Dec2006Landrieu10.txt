Oklahoma Senator Blocks Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Portection Project         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 09 2006    Oklahoma Senator Blocks Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Portection Project Project would protect 120 000 Louisianians from hurricane surges     WASHINGTON    Members of the Louisiana Congressional Delegation  led by U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   worked though the early hours of the morning today to overcome objections by Oklahoma Republican Senator Tom Coburn to authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project   The series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes would  when complete  serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina   Ultimately  Sen  Coburn would not change his position  Totaling  841 1 million with 65 percent  or  546 3 million  intended to be funded by the federal government  the Morganza to the Gulf project was originally authorized in the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2000 with the requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31 of that year   The Corps eventually submitted its report more than a year late  causing the authorization to expire despite the Corps  favorable recommendation   Though repeated attempts have been made  Congress has been unable to deliver a new WRDA bill since   Six years after Congress gave Morganza to the Gulf its first green light  it is simply not fair to delay it further simply because the Corps  bureaucracy couldn t deliver a report on time and because Congress couldn t pass a new bill   Sen  Landrieu said yesterday    There is no other item in WRDA that has been kicked down the road as many times as this   Sen  Landrieu  accompanied by staff members from the Environment and Public Works Committee  including a representative from Louisiana Senator David Vitter s office  made a final push to secure support for fulfilling Congress  promise of six years ago  presenting Southeast Louisiana s case in a 4 30 a m  meeting with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   Congressmen Richard Baker  R La   and Charlie Melancon  D La   introduced legislation that would authorize substantial parts of the project  including two reaches of levees  totaling 76 000 feet  tying into the already existing system from Larose to Golden Meadow  as well as a lock complex on the Houma Navigation Canal to protect against devastating storm surges such as the one during Hurricane Katrina  In addition  Houma would be protected from salt water intrusion in their drinking water   The House passed the Baker Melancon bill late last night  and Sen  Landrieu encouraged her Senate colleagues to pass the House bill early this morning   Earlier  she had introduced S  4105  a Senate bill to fully fund the Morganza to the Gulf project  and had secured both the unanimous support of her Democratic colleagues as well as the endorsement of key Republican leadership   Sen  Vitter had also proposed legislation that would authorize  20 million of the  841 million Morganza project  along with seven unrelated projects in four other states   The people of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes have been sitting ducks in the face of hurricanes  unprotected from disastrous storm surges and flooding   said Rep  Melancon after the House passage   Tonight  we successfully moved forward with changing that   But despite the bipartisan House vote and significant bipartisan support in the Senate for the Landrieu measure  Sen  Coburn refused to a timely withdrawal of his objections  Under Senate procedure  a single Senator may place a hold on moving legislation forward  which can be a difficult obstacle to overcome in the closing hours of a session   The intent of Congress was clear when we authorized Morganza to the Gulf six years ago  and then again when all but one member supported it last night   Sen  Landrieu said  adding that she would seek to reintroduce the Morganza authorization as a standalone measure again early next year  independent of efforts to pass a broader WRDA bill    Only one project among the thousands in the WRDA bill is in this situation   It was approved by Congress once already but saw that authorization wither away simply as the result of bureaucratic delay  We have waited long enough  and the time to make it right is well past due   With Congressman Melancon and the rest of our delegation united in fulfilling this promise  I intend to carry on our fight when the 110th Congress convenes in January
