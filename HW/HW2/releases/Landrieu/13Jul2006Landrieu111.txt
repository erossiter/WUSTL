Landrieu Secures Key La  Funding in Commerce Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 13 2006    Landrieu Secures Key La  Funding in Commerce Bill Directs Small Business Administration to appoint disaster preparedness planner     WASHINGTON    From her position representing Louisiana on the Senate Appropriations Committee  United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced the committee passage of the Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Bill  which greatly increased funding for Louisiana programs beyond the President s budget   In addition to securing  15 650 000 for Louisiana projects  Sen  Landrieu also attached five essential riders to the legislation  including one to direct the Small Business Administration  SBA  to hire a full time disaster planner to maintain a disaster response plan and to assist with SBA disaster preparedness   The SBA had neither a comprehensive disaster response plan nor full time planning staff in place for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Sen  Landrieu said    Louisiana small business owners paid a steep price for that oversight   We cannot allow the mismanagement  delays  and lack of flexibility that plagued the SBA ten months ago to stand in the way of recovery   The bill also creates a Gulf Coast International Finance Specialist with responsibility for Mississippi  Louisiana  and Alabama to assist Gulf Coast businesses with obtaining export financing   Sen  Landrieu worked with other Gulf Coast senators to include language encouraging the International Trade Administration to extend export promotion services and trade mission fee reductions through fiscal year 2007 for the Gulf Coast region   In March  Landrieu and these senators were successful in getting these fees reduced by up to 50 percent through fiscal year 2006 for hurricane affected states   Other provisions Landrieu was able to include were adding staff for the New Orleans U S  Export Assistance Center and directing SBA to use District Offices to process all disaster loans following a major disaster  rather than allow applications to be lost in the current bureaucracy   While the President s budget stripped vital programs of their funding  the Senate bill includes funding for programs such as Juvenile Justice and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program  among others   Funding for programs such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters  gang prevention  enforcement of underage drinking laws and the prosecution of child abuse are all important and deserve our support   Sen  Landrieu said  Sen  Landrieu secured full funding for several Louisiana projects  including Elmer s Island conservation and grants to the Louisiana Geodetic Spatial Reference Center   The Trust for Public Land applauds Senator Landrieu  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  for securing federal funding to help the state purchase and conserve Elmer s Island   said Larry Schmidt  Director of the New Orleans Office of The Trust for Public Land    This is a critical step towards the protection of these 1 700 acres for continued public use   Not only will the conservation of Elmer s Island prohibit inappropriate development  its recreational benefits are outstanding   It is one of only three beachfronts in the entire state accessible by car  We praise Sen  Landrieu s continuing leadership and commitment to conserving Louisiana s sensitive coastal habitat and wildlife resources for future generations   Other Louisiana projects receiving funding in the Senate Bill after having been cut out of the President s submitted budget include  Elmer s Island Phase II    1 750 000   Louisiana Geodetic Spatial Reference Center    2 300 000   Mississippi Louisiana Digital Coast    1 000 000   Coastal Restoration and Enhancement through Science and Technology    1 500 000   Southern Shrimp Alliance   Wild American Shrimp Marketing    8 000 000   Southern Shrimp Alliance   Shrimp Industry Fishing Effort Research Continuation    1 100 000  The committee s report that accompanies the legislation expressly directs the Department of Justice to give preference to the following projects in
