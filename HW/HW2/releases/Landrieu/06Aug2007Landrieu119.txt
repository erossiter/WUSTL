Senate Passes Landrieu Disaster Loan Reform Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 06 2007    Senate Passes Landrieu Disaster Loan Reform Bill     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate late Friday night passed a bipartisan disaster loan bill  cosponsored by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   that will improve the loan process for business owners and homeowners following a disaster    One of the important lessons of Katrina and Rita is that we need the Small Business Administration  SBA  to be nimble  effective and timely in disbursing loans following a disaster   said Sen  Landrieu  a Small Business Committee member   The Senate s passage of this bipartisan disaster loan bill is a huge step forward for the SBA s disaster recovery reform  It will greatly improve the loan process for business owners and homeowners  ensuring that essential recovery dollars quickly move into the hands of disaster victims  I look forward to returning to session in September and quickly reaching an agreement with the House on this vital legislation   The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act  S  163  which is supported by the Small Business Administration  passed the Senate in advance of Hurricane Katrina and Rita s second anniversary and just before the chamber adjourned for a month long recess  Sen  Landrieu and Senate cosponsors John Kerry  D Mass   Chairman of the Small Business Committee  and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  the committee s Ranking Member  worked at length to overcome the objections of Senators that had blocked the bill s passage for months  Following the 2005 hurricanes  SBA did not have a comprehensive disaster response plan  which contributed to the agency s slow response to the storms  Loan approvals in Louisiana took between six to eight months to process while closings took an additional two months   On June 1  2007  at Landrieu s request  the SBA submitted to Congress its comprehensive disaster response plan   We ve passed this critical disaster aid legislation  recognizing that there are Gulf Coast residents who are still seeking to recover nearly two years later   Sen  Kerry said   We made these changes to help future disaster victims    whether from floods or fire in my home state of Massachusetts  or the Katrina disasters of tomorrow  I thank all of my colleagues for working together in a bipartisan way to address concerns and move this important bill    This legislation provides vital resources to the SBA to enable it to respond effectively and swiftly to future disasters   Sen  Snowe said   The SBA s slow response to Hurricane Katrina makes plain the need for the SBA to be provided with additional disaster response tools   A product of compromise  this bill is forward looking  and I urge Congress to move ahead quickly with final passage    We re trying to get the government to speed up assistance to disaster victims   said Sen  Nelson  a bill cosponsor   We can t afford to have another mess like the one we experienced after Hurricane Katrina   At the request of the South Louisiana business community  Sen  Landrieu on the floor included a provision to help small businesses in the Katrina  Rita and Wilma disaster zones compete for federal contracts by making the disaster areas a Historically Underutilized Business Zone  HUBZone  for two years  Sen  Landrieu included the same provision in the Senate passed version of the Iraq Hurricane Supplemental  P L  110 28  in May  but it was dropped in conference with the House  The bill s provisions include language to   Establish a Private Disaster Loan program to be used in the aftermath of catastrophic disasters  allowing banks to make loans directly to victims with an 85 percent government guarantee  Create a new expedited disaster assistance business loan program to provide short term relief to businesses damaged or destroyed in major disasters while they await other federal assistance or insurance payments  Create a new presidential declaration of  Catastrophic National Disaster   which will allow the Small Business Administration  SBA  to issue nationwide economic injury disaster loans to small businesses affected by a large scale disaster  Increase the disaster loan disbursal amounts that the SBA can disburse without collateral from  10 000 to  14 000  Require the SBA Administrator to assign disaster planning responsibilities to one agency employee who reports directly to the Administrator  This employee must possess significant experience in disaster planning and response  Establishes floors for disaster assistance staff   Sets reporting requirements for SBA maintenance of disaster assistance staff at 800 and for disaster cadre at 750  Provide key tools for processing disaster loan applications more quickly  such as working with qualified private contractors to process the loans and requiring the SBA to report to Congress on how the application process can be improved  Increase the maximum size of a disaster loan from  1 5 million to  2 million and allows non profit groups to be eligible for disaster loans  Authorize the SBA Administrator to  in the event of a major disaster declaration  permit district offices to process disaster loans  and The House passed a version of the bill on April 17  and the House and Senate will conference on the two bills when Congress returns in September
