Bipartisan Group of Senators Introduces Iraq Study Group Bill as Amendment to DoD Authorization Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 10 2007    Bipartisan Group of Senators Introduces Iraq Study Group Bill as Amendment to DoD Authorization Bill     WASHINGTON  D C    A bipartisan group of Senators announced their intention to offer as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill  legislation that would make the Iraq Study Group recommendations the basis for future U S  strategy in Iraq    The amendment currently has twelve cosponsors  six Republicans and six Democrats  including Senators Ken Salazar  D CO   Mary Landrieu  D LA   Lamar Alexander  R TN  Mark Pryor  D AR   Robert Bennett  R UT   Robert Casey  D PA   Judd Gregg  R NH   Blanche Lincoln   D AR   John Sununu  R NH   Susan Collins  R ME   Pete Domenici  R NM   and Bill Nelson  D FL   Former Secretary of State James A  Baker  III and former Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Lee H  Hamilton co chaired the December report that seeks to bring a responsible conclusion to the Iraq War  In a July 9 letter praising the legislation  Mr  Hamilton said the report s findings if implemented would    Shift the primary mission of U S  forces from combat to training  with the goal of removing all combat brigades not necessary for training  force protection and counter terrorism by the first quarter of 2008  Make U S  political  economic or military support for the Iraqi government conditional on Iraq s progress in meeting specific benchmarks  And launch a new diplomatic offensive in the region  including all of Iraq s neighbors in an Iraq International Support Group  on behalf of stability  The Senators  amendment sets a  new way forward  by establishing these principles as United States policy   The text of the amendment is the same as their  Iraq Study Group  ISG  Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007   S 1545   Today  Iraq Study Group co chair Lee H  Hamilton said   The recommendations of the Iraq Study Group are as timely and urgent today as they were in December   Senator Ken Salazar  D CO      We have gained a lot of momentum over the past several weeks on our bipartisan effort to implement the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group   said Salazar    The principles laid out in our amendment provide a diplomatic  economic and military roadmap to end American combat operations in Iraq   The American people expect Congress to work together to solve our Nation s biggest problems  and I am hopeful we will pass it and take an important step toward a new way forward in Iraq   Senator Mary Landrieu  D LA      It is time for a sensible strategy in Iraq  and implementing the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommendations is a positive step toward getting us detangled from this long  weary war  Our troops deserve to have smart strategy driving the rest of the mission  The Iraq Study Group engaged some of the best minds in national security policy from both parties  It is high time we embraced their pragmatic approach to the crisis  At the end of the day  only a strategy that empowers Iraqis to stand up Iraq will bring our fighting men and women home     Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN      We need a political solution in Washington as much as we need one in Baghdad   said Alexander    The failure of the Iraqi government to meet benchmarks for political and economic reforms is one more reason that the time has come to change our strategy in Iraq   The Iraq Study Group report provides a bipartisan framework to get us out of the combat business and into the support  training  and equipping business as soon as we honorably can    Senator Mark Pryor  D AR      President Bush is failing as Commander in Chief to provide our troops with a plan to turn over responsibility to the Iraqi people and bring them home   Pryor said   Our legislation    based on recommendations by a panel of unparalleled expertise and bipartisanship    fills this leadership vacuum with a comprehensive plan forward     Senator Judd Gregg  R NH     This bipartisan Iraq Study Group legislation  and the underlying recommendations of the Iraq Study Group  provide a clear and concise blueprint for drawing down our troops in Iraq in a responsible and organized way  while attempting to protect our troops and our national security and establish a stable government in Iraq   said Gregg    I am pleased that more colleagues on both sides of the aisle are joining us in supporting this legislation that was crafted through serious  thoughtful policy discussions rather than dissolving into partisan rhetoric  which distracts from the important issues at hand of protecting our troops and protecting our national security   Senator Robert Casey  D PA      It is of paramount importance to transition the mission in Iraq and to send a clear signal to the White House that their Iraq policy is not working   said Casey    The President should have adopted the Iraq Study Group s recommendations when they were released last December   Instead  he ignored the report s call to withdraw combat troops by April 2008 and announced six months ago today his intention to escalate the war in Iraq   Senator Robert Bennett  R UT      My support for this amendment has been misinterpreted as a break with the president  That is not the case  I believe the goals of the Iraq Study Group are consistent with the president s goals   said Sen  Bob Bennett   For me the most attractive recommendation of the ISG is shifting from a combat mission to one of training and support  enabling an orderly drawdown of American forces  Another is the call for a new diplomatic offensive involving all of Iraq s neighbors  I fully support the work of General Petraeus and look forward to his September report to see whether these goals can be achieved   Senator Blanche Lincoln  D AR      The status quo in Iraq  which is an increase in violence in recent months and a lack of progress from the Iraqi government  is unacceptable   Lincoln said    We have learned after several attempts this year in the Senate that one party by itself cannot change the direction in Iraq   It will take the cooperation of both parties working together to produce meaningful change  and the Iraq Study Group s proposals offer us a starting point    Senator Susan Collins  R ME      I have made it clear that I do not support an open ended and unconditional commitment of U S  troops in Iraq   Collins said   Ultimately  resolving the sectarian violence in Iraq requires a political  not a military  solution   I oppose the President s current strategy in Iraq and believe it is time to redefine our mission and implement a gradual but significant withdrawal of our troops next year   The time for partisan politics to determine the direction of our policy in Iraq is long over   I believe that the unanimous recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group should be adopted as we chart a new way forward in Iraq   Senator Bill Nelson  D FL       The best solution for fixing Iraq came from the nonpartisan Iraq Study Group  which said we need to redeploy our troops away from the civil strife to focus on strikes against Al Qaeda and on training of Iraqi security forces     Senator Pete Domenici  R NM      It is time to rethink our military policy in Iraq  and force the Iraqis to do more for themselves   Our plan would transition American forces from combat to a supportive role in Iraqincluding focusing on counterterrorism and special operations   By transforming our military mission from combat to support  we should be able to begin bringing some U S  troops home and out of harm s way sooner   This plan does not call for the removal of all forces by an arbitrary date certain   I believe that is key to getting broad bipartisan support   Domenici said  Senator John Sununu  R NH      No American soldier should remain in Iraq a day longer than is absolutely necessary  These recommendations address the security measures  diplomacy  and political reforms needed to stabilize the situation in Iraq and begin withdrawing combat troops  I encouraged the administration to act on these proposals when they were first presented seven months ago by making them the official policy of our government  I hope that by enacting them into law  we will make their implementation a priority at all levels of government   Click  for the complete text of Mr  Hamilton s letter
