Sen  Landrieu on Iraq Vote   Our Principal Goal Must Be Victory          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 22 2006    Sen  Landrieu on Iraq Vote   Our Principal Goal Must Be Victory      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La  today released the following statement after voting on a pair of amendments related to the withdrawal of U S  military forces from Iraq  Sen  Landrieu said   When we send Americans to fight a war  our principal goal must be victory  Despite the administration s mismanagement of this war  their early miscalculations that were based on faulty intelligence and their failure to adequately armor and protect our troops  victory must still be our goal   Last year  the Louisiana Guard deployed to Iraq for what turned out to be a very difficult tour of duty   I went to see them in Iraq  and have talked with the leadership since their return   Based on these conversations  as well as my own observations of the circumstances today  I do not believe now is the time to set arbitrary start or end dates for withdrawal  We all want a peaceful and democratic Iraq  guarded and defended by Iraqis  but in my judgment  the disengagement of American forces  when it comes  must be based on protecting American lives  smart strategy and the realities on the ground    not on arbitrary timetables
