Landrieu Comments on Administration s Announcement   7 5 B for 100 Year Flood Protection         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 22 2007    Landrieu Comments on Administration s Announcement   7 5 B for 100 Year Flood Protection     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on Federal Coordinator of Gulf Coast Rebuilding Chairman Donald E  Powell s expected announcement tomorrow that  7 5 billion is needed for 100 year Gulf Coast flood protection  President Bush is expected to submit the funding request to Congress in February with a requirement that Louisiana pay a traditional cost share of 35 percent  or as much as  2 6 billion   The recognition of the need for more funding is a positive step toward securing our communities  from Cameron to Plaquemines parishes  from the dangerous and destructive hurricanes that rise out of the Gulf  This is certainly not a final step  but is nonetheless a timely and essential one  Almost two years ago  President Bush said in Jackson Square that he would do whatever it takes to make our communities safe and this announcement reflects the need to fulfill that commitment   I do remain very concerned about how Louisiana  which was totally devastated by the 2005 storms Katrina and Rita  will be able to afford its large share of the cost  It s important to ensure that any cost share requirements won t delay this crucial protection  I m encouraged that Chairman Powell indicates the administration remains open to cost share options  and I look forward to working with him and the state of Louisiana on developing specific proposals    EDITOR S NOTE  As noted above  this statement was released prior to the Administration s formal announcement of the levee funding request   When Chairman Powell unveiled the plan in detail  he outlined a local cost sharing model based on per project historical shares    not the across the board 35 percent share anticipated at the time of this statement   As a result  the actual local cost share now estimated under the Administration s proposal is approximately  1 7 billion
