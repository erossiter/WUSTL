Landrieu Asks FEMA to Keep Pledge to Vermillion Parish School         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 28 2006    Landrieu Asks FEMA to Keep Pledge to Vermillion Parish School Sends second plea this month to FEMA Director regarding agency s broken promises to Louisiana schools     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today appealed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to follow through on its commitment to Vermillion Parish s Henry Elementary School   which FEMA pledged to help rebuild on higher ground after it was destroyed by Hurricane Rita  The agency told Vermillion Parish school officials in the fall of 2005 that damage to the school was greater than 50 percent so it would receive funds to relocate rather than to rebuild on the same low lying ground  But FEMA reneged on its decision  telling school Superintendent Joseph Hebert that the agency has reassessed the school s damage  declaring it less than 50 percent  and thus substantially reducing the FEMA funding for the school  In a similar move  FEMA also reversed course this month on its decision to help relocate Iberia Parish s Peebles Elementary   FEMA is making a habit of breaking promises to Louisiana schools that were destroyed by Hurricane Rita   Sen  Landrieu said   In Vermillion Parish  residents decided against rebuilding their homes near the devastated Henry school site  as it was set to be rebuilt on higher ground  They altered their long term plans based on FEMA s word  And fourteen months after the hurricane  the students  lives are still in limbo   Sen  Landrieu today sent a letter to FEMA Director David Paulison  asking him to make sure FEMA keeps its word  She sent a letter to Paulison regarding Peebles Elementary on November 21   The Henry school is a prime example of FEMA s gross mishandling of its mission as it relates to rebuilding and reestablishing schools in the wake of an extraordinary natural disaster as was Hurricane Rita   Sen  Landrieu wrote   Furthermore  FEMA s latest position in these two specific cases actually would encourage school systems to rebuild in flood prone areas which is totally contrary to FEMA s supposed central mission of hazard mitigation I again urge you to take swift and decisive action on this matter so that innocent school children will have a safe  permanent place to get an education as soon as possible   The letter to FEMA Director Paulison regarding Peebles Elementary School can be found  and the letter regarding Henry Elementary can be found
