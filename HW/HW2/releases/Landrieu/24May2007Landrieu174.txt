Landrieu Puts Spotlight on Road Home Problems         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 24 2007    Landrieu Puts Spotlight on Road Home Problems Chairs Disaster Recovery hearing on shortfall and slow delivery of checks to homeowners     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today pressed the Louisiana architects of the  Road Home  program and Bush administration representatives on the housing program s projected shortfall and the tens of thousands of homeowners who have not received their checks  Sen  Landrieu received their answers at an oversight hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  which she chairs    I do not want one homeowner in Louisiana or Mississippi to believe that this government will not fulfill its promises   Sen  Landrieu said   The first panel that testified included  Chairman Donald E  Powell  Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding  and Andy Kopplin  Executive Director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority  LRA   Sen  Landrieu received conflicting answers from Chairman Powell and Kopplin on why the Road Home Program has a projected shortfall of more than  3 billion  Powell told Sen  Landrieu that Louisiana has funded victims of wind damage when the program was intended by the administration only for victims of flood damage  Kopplin said the shortfall has resulted because 20 000 more homeowners qualified than the LRA s original projection of 123 000   We designed a program to cover the wind damage that Chairman Powell wouldn t agree to cover   Kopplin said   Sen  Landrieu pointed out that an initial flaw of the program was that the Republican controlled Congress in 2005 capped Louisiana s share of the provided federal funding at 54 percent  despite having endured more than 70 percent of the disaster s damage   The Subcommittee is collecting Chairman Powell and Kopplin s testimony and supporting documents  and will be producing a report next month with findings and recommendations for improving the program   Also appearing before Sen  Landrieu s committee was a group of Louisiana citizens who told personal stories about their experiences with the program  They included  Walter Thomas of the Lower 9th Ward  Connie Uddo  Administrator  St  Paul s Beacon of Hope Organization  Debbie Gordon  President  Chimneywood Homeowner s Association  Frank Silvestri  Co Chairman  Citizens  Road Home Action Team  and Frank Trapani  President  New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors    Thomas  a cancer patient living in a handicapped accessible FEMA trailer  spoke of the lengthy process he has been through in trying to get his Road Home check    Every time I called I got the same answer   Someone will give you a call back    Thomas said   When Thomas went into the hospital three weeks ago for emergency surgery to remove his colon  a Road Home representative called him and told him he must sign his paperwork  He was unable to due so because of his surgery  and since then  he has received no call back   Gordon of New Orleans East was brought to tears during her testimony as she told the committee about the red tape strangling the Road Home program    It has been nine months since I started this process  and I am still waiting   she said   Our community of 74 homeowners is all in the same situation  We all still have mortgages   The last panel to testify today included  Nelson Bregon  Assistant Deputy Secretary  U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  David Maurstad  Mitigation Directorate  Federal Emergency Management Agency  Suzie Elkins  Executive Director  Office of Community Development  and Isabel Reiff  Senior Vice President  Social Programs and Strategic Communications  ICF  Sen  Landrieu asked Maurstad about  1 2 billion in hazard mitigation money  HMGP  that the state has been intending to use for the Road Home program  but FEMA has not agreed to release  Maurstad claimed FEMA was not consulted about redirecting HMGP money to the housing program   The bottom line is that FEMA and Secretary Paulison and the state have been trying to work this out for one year  and it s not been worked out   Sen  Landrieu said    The Road Home program was developed after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and the Louisiana Recovery Authority  LRA  in negotiations with the White House and Gulf Coast Recovery Coordinator   It provides rebuilding grants of up to  150 000 per home and was funded through  8 1 billion in federal Community Development Block Grants provided by last year s emergency supplemental appropriations bills     The lesson from this oversight hearing was clear  the mistakes for the Road Home program lie at many levels of government   said Sen  Landrieu  who with Congressman Richard Baker  R La   had proposed an alternative housing and rebuilding program    My committee is compiling the pieces of information we learned from the administration  the state of Louisiana  homeowners and the contractor that manages the program  We will be making specific recommendations next month on how to fix the problems  so that every homeowner in Louisiana whose house was blown away or devastated by rising water receives the money they need and deserve to rebuild   We will work to clear the obstacles to our recovery  and learn how to prevent making the same mistakes when the next disaster strikes this nation  be it natural or manmade
