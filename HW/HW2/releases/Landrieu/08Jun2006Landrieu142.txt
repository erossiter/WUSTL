Landrieu Statement Regarding the Estate Tax         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 08 2006    Landrieu Statement Regarding the Estate Tax     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement after voting to continue debate on reform and potential repeal of the federal estate tax  Sen  Landrieu said   Given the massive continuing demands of Gulf Coast hurricane recovery  I do not believe it is now the time for a full repeal of the federal estate tax   Nor do I believe that the true costs and deficit impact of the backloaded proposals offered to date have been honestly represented to the American taxpayer     I do  however  support exempting most family farms and small businesses from the tax entirely and I support raising the individual exemption   And so  I support and remain committed to seeking a fiscally responsible bill that provides reform and stable tax relief for all taxpayers in a more certain and stable way for the future   I will continue to work closely with my colleagues in the days and weeks ahead to achieve this more balanced result
