Sen  Landrieu Reacts to the State of the Union         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  1 31 06    Sen  Landrieu Reacts to the State of the Union     WASHINGTON    Following the State of the Union Address tonight  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   offered the following reactions to the President s address   The President had the opportunity tonight to turn the corner from being the number one obstacle to Louisiana s recovery  to being our number one champion   said Sen   Landrieu     Unfortunately  he did not take advantage of that chance   Louisiana expected and deserved more than 165 words tucked into the last five minutes of a 5 300 word speech   In fact  more time was spent applauding the President s arrival than discussing the vital recovery needs of the Gulf Coast   And so  a year after telling us that coastal protection was not one of his  highest priorities   the President made it clear tonight that his priorities have not changed     I and the rest of our delegation will return to work at the Capitol tomorrow further emboldened in our efforts to convince the White House that it is time for a new commitment to fulfilling the President s promise to do  what it takes    We will press forward and will challenge the White House to take action   I am hopeful that together  buoyed by the spirit of Louisiana  we will convince the administration to turn the corner and demonstrate the needed commitment   We need a fair offshore oil and gas revenue sharing plan to build stronger levees and coastal protection  We need to support our homeowners with an effective rebuilding tool like the Baker Bill   And we need the President to follow the lead of our state government and participate fully in the independent investigation led by Senators Collins and Lieberman   Only by learning from our past mistakes will we avoid making them again   What we do not need is to keep pouring funds into FEMA without addressing the agency s fundamental dysfunctions   Sen  Landrieu is the sponsor of the Senate counterpart  S  2172  to the Louisiana Recovery Corporation bill  H R  4100  introduced by Congressman Richard Baker  R Baton Rouge   Last week  she and Senator David Vitter  R La   sent a letter to the President encouraging him to support a revenue sharing provision to help Louisiana build and maintain a world class hurricane protection system in his State of the Union address    Every year  Louisiana sends nearly  6 billion in royalties from offshore energy production to the U S  Treasury  but keeps virtually none   In contrast  inshore states with energy production on federal lands keep at least 50  of their royalties    30
