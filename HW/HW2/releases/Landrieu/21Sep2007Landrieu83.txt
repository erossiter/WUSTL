Landrieu Responds to HUD S Decision to Demolish Public Housing Sites         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  9 21 2007    Landrieu Responds to HUD S Decision to Demolish Public Housing Sites Sends letter asking for replacement plans     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  Secretary Alphonso Jackson asking him to reconsider the agency s decision to demolish four New Orleans public housing sites without providing plans to replace them  HUD has so far only developed rebuilding or replacement plans for one of the sites  Lafitte   To announce demolition  which could begin as early as November  without sufficient planning in place seems irresponsible   Sen  Landrieu wriote   This action will only serve to deepen the ongoing affordable housing crisis for my constituents most in need and further increase distrust in the community with  the Housing Authority of New Orleans and HUD    Rents in the New Orleans area have increased more than 40 percent since the storms  and homelessness has doubled to more than 12 000  Secretary Jackson told Sen  Landrieu that HUD is moving forward with demolition because the agency is in danger of losing  7 million in tenant replacement vouchers by September 30  But HUD never asked Congress  or Sen  Landrieu  a Senate Appropriations Committee member  for an extension of these vouchers  Such a request would be given  urgent consideration   Sen  Landrieu wrote   Secretary Jackson s decision to demolish the BW Cooper  CJ Peete  Lafitte and St  Bernard sites came without affording Congress the time to consider a bill by Sen  Landrieu and Senate Banking Chairman Christopher J  Dodd  The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act  S  1668  ensures public housing that was occupied before the storm is replaced with public housing or affordable housing units  The bill also gives additional flexibility to the housing authority and developers to create mixed income communities  Unoccupied units will be replaced with housing vouchers   Sen  Landrieu is on Tuesday testifying about the bill before the Senate Banking Committee  In her letter  Sen  Landrieu asked Jackson that by Sept  24  2007  he provide plans for redeveloping the other three public housing sites  give a commitment that HUD will meet the requirements in S  1668 and indicate whether HUD will ask for an extension of housing vouchers    It seems as though HUD is abandoning support of a bill that would in a positive way  proceed with rebuilding public and workforce housing with the appropriate safeguards to make sure people can come back to New Orleans   Sen  Landrieu said   The bipartisan effort to move this bill forward is at risk because Secretary Jackson has taken it upon himself to push forward on a deadline  If the Secretary needs an extension of vouchers  I will do everything in my power to extend them   A copy of Sen  Landrieu s letter to Secretary Jackson is available
