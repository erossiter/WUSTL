Revenue Sharing Votes Expected Next Week in Senate         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 28 2006    Revenue Sharing Votes Expected Next Week in Senate Colleagues praise Sen  Landrieu for bipartisan leadership     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate is expected to vote next week on S  3711  the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  which would open additional territory in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas production and share the generated revenue with coastal states for use in funding coastal restoration and hurricane protection efforts    A procedural vote is scheduled for 5 30 p m  EST on Monday that would require 60 votes to limit debate and prevent potential filibusters of the legislation   A final passage vote  requiring a simple majority to pass  is expected as early as Tuesday morning  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill  represented Gulf Coast states in bipartisan negotiations regarding the revenue sharing provision with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   Majority Whip Mitch McConnell  R Ky   and Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M  the bill s principal sponsor   The negotiations resulted in an agreement on the revenue sharing provision on June 29   Sen  Landrieu also worked closely with Senators Bill Nelson  D Fla   and Mel Martinez  R Fla   to address Florida s concerns over the legislation  which Nelson yesterday announced he would vote in support of  During this week s floor debate on the bill  a broad bipartisan group of Sen  Landrieu s colleagues praised her leadership on the issue and noted the importance of securing Democratic votes in order to reach the 60 vote threshold required for the bill to move forward  Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   The bill s success  depends in large part on Sen  Landrieu and how effective she is in talking to her colleagues in getting bipartisan support   Minority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev    Everyone in Louisiana should know that they have a tireless champion in Senator Mary Landrieu  I wish that I could express to her father  Moon Landrieumy support for  admiration of his daughter  Mary Landrieu   She has done so much work in this regard  If it weren t for her efforts  without any question  the Senate would not be considering and passing this bill    Sen  Bill Nelson  D Fla    I must say in the negotiations that have brought this legislation to the floor now  I give great credit to the senior Senator from Louisiana  Senator Landrieu  in looking out for the interests of her state in receiving revenue   I give great credit to Senator Landrieubecause she knew that the interests of Florida had to be protected in order for her to get an agreement because both Senators from Florida were willing to filibuster any legislation that threatened the interests of Florida  And to her great credit  she worked with the two Senators from Florida   Sen  Trent Lott  R Miss    Senator Landrieu has been relentless I praised her for her persistence and insistence before she arrived in coming up with a reasonable agreement in making a bill that I believe we re going to get done and a bill that s bipartisan    As your neighbor  I want to salute you   Sen  Ron Wyden  D Ore    I want to start the discussion about the legislation before us now by acknowledging the enormous pain and hurt that so many citizens of our Gulf states have endured since Katrina struck their communities  The pictures of this tragedy are seared into our brain at this point  And here in the Senate  I sat next to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana  Senator Landrieu  and she has brought passion and energy and eloquence to the cause of securing help for those she represents so well   Sen  Mel Martinez  R Fla    I want to commend Chairman Domenici and his staff  as well as Leader Frist and Senator Mitch McConnell for their hard work in forging a strong bipartisan compromise that allows just that  I should also thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for her work in bringing this bill about   Sen  Lisa Murkowski  R Alaska   At this point I do need to certainly give credit to the Chairman of the Energy Committee  Senator Domenicito my colleague from Florida  Senator Martinezand certainly to my colleague and friend from Louisiana who has been working for years  literally for years to achieve a level of revenue sharing for her state  a battle that we know has waged for many years  Sen  Jeff Sessions  R Ala    We ve been trying to open up additional reserves in the Gulf  and we should do that  but we haven t been successful  and it hasn t worked  We ve tried and tried and tried  Now Chairman Domenici has worked his heart out  Senator Landrieu  working on the Democratic side  has met him half way   The area of new oil and gas production in the Domenici Landrieu bill includes an approximately 2 6 million acre section of the Gulf of Mexico known as Area 181  as well as about 5 8 million acres to its south  The area is expected to produce more than 1 3 billion barrels of oil    more than the proven reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma combined    and nearly six trillion cubic feet of natural gas  or six times current U S  imports of liquefied natural gas each year   If the bill becomes law  Gulf States would in the first ten years stand to receive 37 5 percent of the revenue generated in the new area  with Louisiana receiving nearly half that  based on a formula that allocates shares based on each state s distance to production  Congressional Budget Office and Minerals Management Service forecasts predict that beginning in the fiscal year 2017  when sharing would extend to all new Gulf production  Louisiana would receive more than  650 million per year   An additional12 5 percent would go to the state side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund  Current revenues coming from the entire Outer Continental Shelf  OSC  are about  6 to  8 billion per year  and are expected to top  12 billion within 20 years
