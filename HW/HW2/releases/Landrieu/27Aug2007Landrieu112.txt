Clinton  Edwards  Huckabee and Hunter Join Landrieu for  Hope   Recovery Summit          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 27 2007    Clinton  Edwards  Huckabee and Hunter Join Landrieu for  Hope   Recovery Summit  Event features five recovery related panel discussions with national  state and local experts  speeches by Chairman Powell and Administrator Preston  followed by evening Presidential Leadership Forum     NEW ORLEANS    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   is today hosting a  Hope   Recovery Summit  at the University of New Orleans to commemorate the second anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastating flooding that followed   The summit features recovery related panel discussions followed by a question and answer session and remarks with Presidential candidates  including Sen  Hillary Clinton  D N Y   former Sen  John Edwards  D N C   former Gov  Mike Huckabee  R Ark   and Rep  Duncan Hunter  R Calif   Every Democratic and Republican Presidential candidate was invited to participate   Recognizing that hurricane recovery is a critical issue of the 2008 presidential election  four candidates  Democrats and Republicans  have chosen to join us in New Orleans for the Hope   Recovery Summit   Sen  Landrieu said   It is reassuring that some of the leading candidates are focused on keeping our recovery a national priority    As the second anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita approaches  we are reminded of the significant challenges that lie ahead  The next President will bear significant responsibility for the Gulf Coast s ongoing recovery  and this forum will give Louisianians and the rest of the country an opportunity to hear the candidates  approaches for reforming national emergency preparedness and facilitating our continued recovery    Two years ago  a natural disaster became a national disgrace   Sen  Clinton said    Rebuilding this city is not a New Orleans obligation or a Louisiana obligation   It is an American obligation  And the time for action with real measurable results is right now   I look forward to joining my friend Senator Landrieu at this forum to discuss how the federal government can finally do its part to help New Orleans  recovery    We are not the country of the Superdome in New Orleans after Katrina   Sen  Edwards said   We can do better   We have a moral responsibility to get New Orleans back on its feet   I applaud Senator Landrieu for organizing this forum and bringing New Orleans the national attention it needs and deserves    Two years after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  my heart still goes out to the 75 000 tired and frightened evacuees who sought refuge in Arkansas    and to all American families who were directly or indirectly impacted by this disaster   Gov  Huckabee said    As Arkansans embraced our neighbors from the Gulf Coast  we soon learned that there was not a lack of concern or compassion  but rather of command and control    This forum is a great way to continue the dialogue on improving our emergency preparedness and enhancing communication between state and federal agencies   I applaud Sen  Landrieu for her leadership in organizing this important platform for discussion    America is a great nation  not because of what government does for people but because of  what free people do for themselves   Rep  Hunter said    The rebuilding of New Orleans is an opportunity for many to become more productive than they have ever been   Rebuilding should allow many to move from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls  Many rush to characterize New Orleans residents as long term victims  I reject that characterization   Instead  in the recovery  I see the opportunity for a newer more energetic New Orleans with citizens building a better life than before   The all day summit includes five panel discussions with national  state and local leaders on key issues related to hurricane recovery and preparedness  Coastal Protection  Levees and Infrastructure  Education  Business Recovery  Rebuilding the Criminal Justice System  and Housing Recovery and Sustainable Community Development  Featured speakers will be Federal Coordinator of Gulf Coast Rebuilding Chairman Donald E  Powell and SBA Administrator Stephen Preston    I appreciate Senator Landrieu s efforts to provide a national forum on recovery and rebuilding and I welcome the opportunity to participate   Chairman Powell said   We share a focus on forward looking efforts to assist local leaders as they rebuild the Gulf Coast region  and the City of New Orleans  in a stronger and safer way   The American taxpayers  especially taxpayers along the Gulf Coast  expect and deserve nothing less      The intent is not to revisit old debates over fault and failure in the days and months after the hurricanes    that is a road well tread   Sen  Landrieu said    This summit is a forum for fresh ideas and new paths forward for a great city and region
