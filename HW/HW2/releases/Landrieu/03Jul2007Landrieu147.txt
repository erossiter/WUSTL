Landrieu Comments on Inspection of National Hurricane Center         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 03 2007    Landrieu Comments on Inspection of National Hurricane Center Supports Bill Proenza s push to replace aging hurricane tracking satellite     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu today commented on a federal inspection of the National Hurricane Center following comments by its head  Bill Proenza  on replacing the key hurricane tracking satellite  QuikSCAT    Sen  Landrieu said   Without knowing all of the details about the investigation  I cannot comment specifically on it beyond the allegations of impropriety in alerting the nation to the impending loss of hurricane tracking capacity  The American people rely on the government to accurately gauge storm threats  and it has become clear that NOAA is far behind in efforts to replace the vital  hurricane tracking QuikSCAT satellite  which is five years past its prime  Bill Proenza has given Congress an honest account of the urgent need to replace the satellite  and I will continue to push for it in the Senate     As has been the pattern in the Defense Department  Park Police  U S  Attorneys  ranks  and elsewhere  it has become clear that this Administration is more focused on spinning the punishment of whistleblowers than on correcting the errors of management they bring to light  Mr  Proenza s outspokenness on the QuikSCAT satellite and desire to keep coastal communities safe is not a weakness of leadership  but a duty of the position the American people entrusted him with
