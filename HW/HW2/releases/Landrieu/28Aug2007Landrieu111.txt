Landrieu Announces Landmark Microsoft Commitment to Hurricane Impacted Small Businesses         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 28 2007    Landrieu Announces Landmark Microsoft Commitment to Hurricane Impacted Small Businesses Businesses to be eligible for software license reimbursement     NEW ORLEANS    Louisiana small businesses struggling to rebuild from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the subsequent levee breaks will soon be eligible for one year of Microsoft software licensing at no cost  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   announced yesterday during remarks preceding a business recovery forum at the 2007 Hope   Recovery Summit  an all day discussion of hurricane recovery issues hosted by Sen  Landrieu at the University of New Orleans  Under the program  hurricane affected businesses could purchase licenses for Microsoft software  including the popular Windows and Office products  through any authorized Microsoft reseller with payments spread over three years   Eligible business owners would then bring the first year s invoice to any Louisiana Small Business Development Center  LSBDC  for that amount to be paid by Microsoft    Small businesses are a key economic backbone of our recovery  and this landmark partnership will help provide the tools these business owners need to rebuild their businesses stronger than ever even while their financial resources remain limited   said Sen  Landrieu  who originally proposed the unprecedented licensing approach in a letter to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates last year    This novel approach reflects just one good way big business can step up and use its might to help an entire region get back on its feet  and I commend and thank Microsoft for its leadership   Their commitment is made even stronger by their smart partnership with Louisiana s Small Business Development Centers  who under Mary Lynn Wilkerson s leadership have been a tremendously helpful guiding hand to thousands of businesses working to recover    Microsoft was proud to play a role in helping the people of the Gulf Coast rebuild following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and we are committed to contributing to the ongoing community recovery efforts   said Steve Ballmer  CEO of Microsoft   In particular  we believe very strongly that small businesses are a vital engine of economic growth and opportunity and we will continue to support small business owners in Louisiana as they work to rebuild and revive their communities     Technology is critical to the success of a small business  It allows Louisiana businesses to develop customers worldwide  This agreement with Microsoft will assist small businesses with their cash flow by saving them the first year s licensing fees   said Mary Lynn Wilkerson  State Director of the Louisiana Small Business Development Centers      LSBDC applauds Senator Landrieu for initiating and negotiating this important agreement with Microsoft   Senator Landrieu has been such a champion for small businesses   said Wilkerson   The LSBDC offers high quality  no cost business consulting and low cost training for small business owners and potential owners through nine centers statewide   In October  the LSBDC will offer business training on Microsoft products with topics ranging from e commerce to small business accounting   Since Hurricane Katrina  LSBDC Greater New Orleans Region has counseled nearly 2 600 small business owners  LSBDC is a partnership program supported by the Small Business Administration  Louisiana Economic Development  and the host universities for the nine service centers  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita impacted 125 000 small and medium sized businesses across the Gulf Coast  and in Louisiana alone  more than 18 000 businesses were totally destroyed   For the typical small business of 50 employees and 25 PCs licensing Microsoft Windows Vista and the Office 2007 suite of programs  the free year can result in savings of as much as  12 050   To be eligible for the program  businesses must  have been in business prior to August 29  2005  the date of Hurricane Katrina s landfall  or September 24  2004  the date of Hurricane Rita  be based in one of the 19 federal disaster designated Louisiana parishes  have fewer than 200 employees  have applied for small business assistance through at least one federal or state government program  though the application need not have been approved for aid  and purchase a three year Microsoft Open Value License for business software  the first year will be paid for by Microsoft with proof of purchase   The software licensing program is expected to launch in September  at which point more details of it will become available  Sen  Landrieu also commended Microsoft for their continued commitment to helping the communities of the Gulf Coast rebuild as well as to supporting workforce development programs and increasing their commitment to supporting future disaster relief and recovery efforts   Microsoft s disaster response team will be working closely with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  which Sen  Landrieu chairs  to seek out new and effective ways for the company to assist following a disaster   Steps like these are more than just good corporate commitments to their communities   Sen  Landrieu said   they are good business  Microsoft has recognized that the businesses that survive disaster today are the successful customers of tomorrow   I hope their leadership inspires other companies to take similar proactive steps to help their customers rebuild their businesses when disaster strikes
