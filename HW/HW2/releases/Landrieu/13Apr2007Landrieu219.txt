Landrieu s Disaster Recovery Committee Pursues Katrina Cottage Funding Issue         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 13 2007    Landrieu s Disaster Recovery Committee Pursues Katrina Cottage Funding Issue Asks FEMA Director to explain alternative housing allocation in advance of April 24 oversight hearing     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director David Paulison asking him to provide the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  which she chairs  a detailed explanation of the disbursement process for the  400 million Alternative Housing Pilot Program  AHPP  in preparation for an April 24 hearing  On April 6  the Friday before Easter  FEMA announced that it would release  275 million to a trailer housing project in Mississippi despite Chairman Landrieu s March 8 letter asking the agency to hold off on releasing awards until a hearing could be held to assess the agency s disbursement process  The hearing had originally been planned for May   In the letter Sen  Landrieu sent Director Paulison today  she restated her concern that that FEMA thwarted Congress  intent in its disbursement method for the program    The release of these funds does not honor my request that you hold final awards until Congress can fully investigate the AHPP process  awards  and allocations   Sen  Landrieu wrote   Let me again reiterate my strong objections to your agency s handling of this important program for Gulf Coast residents  as well as victims of future disasters   Director Paulison wrote in a letter dated April 2  which Sen  Landrieu s office received April 10  that the AHPP grants were disbursed on a  competitive basis  rather than a  needs based program   Congress created the AHPP in the fourth emergency supplemental appropriations bill last year in an effort to better serve the housing needs of homeowners displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and to spur new alternatives to the trailer housing traditionally deployed by FEMA following such disasters   The  275 million Mississippi project would principally fund only slightly modified trailers and represents more than 70 percent of the  388 million in AHPP grants awarded  despite the state having suffered less than 25 percent of the housing loss from the 2005 hurricanes   Only six points on an apparent 200 point scale separated the second ranked Mississippi project and the third ranked Louisiana  Katrina Cottage  program  which was selected to be awarded approximately  75 million   FEMA has not announced when that award is expected to be released   In debating the AHPP funding  several members of Congress specifically cited  Katrina Cottages  as the intended recipient for funds under the program   They are less expensive than FEMA travel trailers and are widely considered to be safer  more comfortable and significantly more expandable  A full copy of the letter is available
