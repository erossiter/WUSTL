Landrieu and Reid Post Entries on  Hope and Recovery Tour  Travel Diary         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 24 2006    Landrieu and Reid Post Entries on  Hope and Recovery Tour  Travel Diary Reflect on visit to St  Bernard Parish     ST  BERNARD PARISH    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada today posted reflections on their visit to St  Bernard Parish to Sen  Landrieu s travel diary  which will be updated throughout her six day  Hope and Recovery Tour  of coastal Louisiana  The entries  which appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  www bayoubuzz com  are below  along with links to photos and audio of their visit  Sen  Landrieu wrote    This morning  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada joined me for a visit to hurricane ravaged St  Bernard Parish  and I am so glad he came   I only wish every American could see what we shared with him  and hear the stories we heard   Walking through Chalmette with Sheriff Jack Stephens as a guide  we were struck by how much progress has been made   The differences since earlier this summer were easy to spot   But at every turn was another reminder of how much work is left to be done   Homes are being gutted  and debris is still being taken away   Only once the remnants of disaster have been removed  can real rebuilding begin   But it was heartwarming to hear from everyone we met that no matter how much work lies ahead  the spirit of Louisiana is still strong   Everywhere we went  every tale of sorrow ended with a sense of hope for recovery   We may have been knocked down  but we will stand up again     Nick and Greer Cuccia  both Sheriff s Office employees  showed us their home   Severely damaged by the storm and flood  they are now living in a trailer in their driveway  working nights and weekends to rebuild their home and raise it to protect against future floods   They haven t hired carpenters or other workers   It isn t some FEMA contractor rebuilding the house   Nick and Greer are doing it themselves   With every bucket of cement and every nail driven  a piece of their spirit will become an integral part of the renewed home they are building    and part of the community they are helping to anchor for the future   School Superintendent Doris Voitier and Principal Leanne Harlton then led us on a visit to Andrew Jackson Elementary School  after Chalmette High School only the second school in St  Bernard to reopen since the hurricanes and levee breaks  Despite significant roof damage and more than ten feet of flooding  the main school building has been almost completely restored in the past ten weeks  and 1 700 students are already enrolled to return to school there  Despite not having air conditioning until opening day  the teachers and administration worked through the weekend before to add a personal touch to every classroom   Many of the teachers are living in FEMA trailers parked in the school parking lot   Their passion for teaching is unmistakable    they now literally live at work  driven by their dedication to the children they educate   In the second grade classroom of teacher Jena Sullivan  I asked the 20 or so children how many of them were also living in trailers   Nearly every hand went up   But other than the surprise visit by two senators and the excitement of the lights and cameras following us  it was just another day at school for these students   With full lives ahead of them  they know    consciously or not    that there is hope for a strong recovery  and that the devastation of Katrina and Rita and the levee breaks will be replaced by rebirth and renewal  as well as the continuing spirit of our state   All of us could learn a lesson by listening to these children   Our visit wrapped up at Main s Grocery on Judge Perez Drive   Carlton Main was a 23 year employee of Winn Dixie Supermarkets in the area before he moved to Tennessee for work   But he soon grew homesick  and knew all too well that residents would not return after the disaster without access to daily essentials such as food and household supplies   He moved back and worked with family and friends to open his store on June 28  the first grocery store to open or reopen in the parish since the storm   His store  like the Cuccia s home and Andrew Jackson School  is an anchor for our rebuilding    a cornerstone to the foundation of a new St  Bernard     The road to recovery is a hard one  but with people like those we met today  I know we will make it all the way through   Sen  Reid wrote   I want to thank Mary Landrieu for allowing me to join her on the first leg of her hope and recovery tour  Coming down to Louisiana I realize how much work there is to be done but at the same time I am inspired by the hope and determination of people rising to meet the challenge   I was honored to meet Superintendent Doris Voiter  who led an intensive effort to stay in contact with scattered students and their families and is widely credited with the swift reconstruction and renovation of Andrew Jackson Elementary School   Students began to return last week and are now nearly 1 800 students between pre kindergarten and 6th grade attending this school    far more than the original projection of 1 600 students   Government failure in preparing for and responding to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned a natural disaster into a national tragedy  We will not be safe until we can protect our citizens from both terrorist attacks and natural occurrences  We will not be one country until we address the very real and dire conditions of poverty too many of our citizens must endure    And now visiting the sites of human devastation one year later  I am disappointed by how much work remains  I share the frustration with local people affected about the slow pace of rebuilding  There are positive signs  but we need to do more to build permanent housing  get local businesses back on track and rebuild the levees safer and stronger   As Democratic Leader  I have made a solemn commitment to the State of Louisiana  I will work with Senator Landrieu  whose leadership has made such a difference to the people of Louisiana  to make sure the rebuilding is completed and New Orleans is rebuilt better than before to be a great American city   Photos from the
