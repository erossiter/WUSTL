Landrieu Statement on 5th Circuit Insurance Ruling         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 03 2007    Landrieu Statement on 5th Circuit Insurance Ruling     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released a statement regarding yesterday s Fifth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals decision against home and business owners  insurance claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina and the levee breaks that followed  Sen  Landrieu said   I strongly disagree with the decision reached by the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday to dismiss the claims of Louisiana residents and businesses regarding insurance coverage that they have paid significant premiums on throughout their lives     The failures of the levees were directly the result of engineering failures by the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Simply put  the damage caused by these failures was a manmade disaster  and an exclusion commonly interpreted as one for natural disasters is now being used by the insurers to sidestep their responsibility to home and business owners     The insurance companies and their lawyers certainly know how to prepare policies that distinguish between natural and manmade disasters   In fact  the Fifth Circuit acknowledged this ability more than 30 years ago  and again yesterday   Nonetheless  it has now totally ignored its own precedent  siding with manipulative insurers against the Louisianians who pay them to take the risk   The resulting decision from three Texas judges is gravely flawed   It contradicts not only Louisiana s legislative intent  but also the views of many Louisiana jurists who have considered the issue   It is yet another serious setback to the people of Louisiana who have suffered because of the greatest manmade disaster in our nation s history      This was one of the most far reaching decisions affecting Louisiana citizens and involving Louisiana issues ever handed down by a federal court  I encourage the Fifth Circuit to reconsider its decision and defer the issue to the proper court to decide it    the Louisiana Supreme Court
