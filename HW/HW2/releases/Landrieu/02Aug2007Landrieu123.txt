Landrieu Comments on Minnesota Bridge Collapse         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 02 2007    Landrieu Comments on Minnesota Bridge Collapse     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on the tragic collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis  Minn  Sen  Landrieu said   My heart goes out to all of the families who have lost loved ones in the horrific tragedy in Minnesota last night   My family and I will continue to pray for the full recovery of all who were injured   This heartbreaking disaster is reflective of the challenges our country faces as our highway infrastructure ages   It focuses us on the importance of ongoing operations and maintenance of critical infrastructure   We had it happen in a different way in Louisiana when levees collapsed  But when levees collapse and bridges go down  we have got to stay focused as a nation on the funding necessary to build not just new levees  roads and bridges  but to properly maintain the ones we have   This is an important lesson   We will determine the cause of this failure  but we must also take the time to look at our bridge replacement program in Louisiana   I understand that the legislature has appropriated some additional funding  and we need to determine whether it is enough to meet the vital need   In Washington  we are securing funding for the construction of the Leeville bridge  which was a danger ten years ago  and it s under construction down in Lafourche   We have some bridges along Bayou Lafourche and throughout Louisiana  from east to west and north to south  that need attention as well
