Landrieu Statement on GAO Levee Report         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 06 2006    Landrieu Statement on GAO Levee Report     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today after the Government Accountability Office  GAO  reported that the Army Corps of Engineers  does not have a comprehensive strategy and implementation plan  for coastal protection and that  the Corps appears to be following a piecemeal approach without giving sufficient attention to the interrelationships between various elements of those projects or fully considering whether the projects will provide an integrated level of hurricane protection for the area   Sen  Landrieu said   Today s GAO report reflects what I and the Louisiana delegation have been stressing for years    that the Corps  piecemeal approach to coastal protection simply does not work   In order to properly protect our coastal communities and the national energy supply they secure  a more comprehensive  integrated approach is needed for coastal flood control  wetlands restoration and levee protection   This must be backed up by a consistent  reliable funding stream such as that provided by the Domenici Landrieu bill  which gives Louisiana a share of the oil and gas revenues generated off our coast   Congress and the Administration also have a responsibility to act   The Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  has languished for six years on Capitol Hill  only this summer passing the Senate with language I worked to add that requires the Corps to plan in a more comprehensive manner  with independent review of their actions   Congress needs to act  and this bill needs to pass   The Corps is also currently preparing  at the direction of an amendment I added to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill  a design for full Category 5 hurricane protection along our coast   Rest assured  I will continue to fight to turn around the track record the GAO so appropriately brings to light
