Sen  Landrieu  Centrists Forge Compromise to Preserve Minority Voice in the Senate         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 23 2005    Sen  Landrieu  Centrists Forge Compromise to Preserve Minority Voice in the Senate     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   tonight announced that she and 13 other centrist members of the United States Senate had reached an agreement that will stave off the  nuclear option     a Republican supported rule change that would have limited the voice of individuals in debates over judicial nominations   I am so proud we were able to reach an agreement that truly reflects the best traditions of the Senate   Sen  Landrieu said   Had the Republican leadership launched this  nuclear option  tomorrow  I fear we would have reached a point of no return   That would have been a sad day indeed   But now  we have an opportunity for pause  a moment for hope and a chance to return to the finest traditions of our body  avoiding the rancor that has become so commonplace in recent years   This agreement helps protect these cherished traditions by ensuring that the minority    and even a lone individual    will continue to have the right to speak up and be heard   The 14 centrist senators agreed to support cloture    an end to debate  allowing an up or down vote    for Priscilla Owen  5th Circuit   Janice Rogers Brown  D C  Circuit  and William Pryor  11th Circuit    They made no commitment to vote in a particular way on cloture for William Myers  9th Circuit  or Henry Saad  6th Circuit   and are not obliged to vote for or against the final confirmation of any of the nominees  The senators made a good faith pledge that the filibuster should only be employed under extraordinary circumstances  and that each senator would use his or her discretion and judgment to determine whether such circumstances exist   They also agreed to oppose the  nuclear option  or any other similar change to the rules of the filibuster for the remainder of the 109th Congress   Finally  the agreement encourages the Executive Branch to make a greater effort to consult with members of the Senate  of both parties  before submitting judicial nominations  Signing the agreement in addition to Sen  Landrieu were Sens  Ben Nelson  D Neb   John McCain  R Ariz   Mike DeWine  R Ohio  John Warner  R Va   Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Robert Byrd  D W Va   Susan Collins  R Maine  Mark Pryor  D Ark   Olympia Snowe  R Maine  Lindsey Graham  R S C   Ken Salazar  D Colo   Lincoln Chafee  R R I   Daniel Inouye  D Hawaii
