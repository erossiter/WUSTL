Landrieu Lays Out New Strategy for War on Terror         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 17 2007    Landrieu Lays Out New Strategy for War on Terror Amendment sets priority on taking out al Qaeda leadership  reducing combat troops in Iraq     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today proposed legislation to significantly step up U S  efforts to dismantle the al Qaeda terrorist network and draw down combat forces deployed to Iraq  Introduced as an amendment to H R  1585  the Defense Authorization Bill  the proposal states that  it shall be the policy of the United States Government that the foremost objective of the United States in the Global War on Terrorism is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri and other leaders of al Qaeda  and to dismantle the al Qaeda network   The Landrieu plan repositions U S  troops from Iraq to Afghanistan to root out and combat al Qaeda forces  authorizes  3 6 billion for counter terror programs in the region and reestablishes Alec Station  the CIA mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants  The mission had been aborted last year after the Bush Administration determined that bin Laden no longer posed a threat to the United States   An intelligence report due out today  however  is expected to describe al Qaeda s strength as having returned to pre 9 11 levels   Our brave soldiers and Marines  sailors and airmen  answered the duty call of 9 11   Sen  Landrieu said    But our nation s focus has been misdirected  allowing al Qaeda to flourish while the White House pursues a flawed strategy in Iraq  Nearly six years after orchestrating the deaths of 2 997 people  Osama bin Laden remains at large  rebuilding his network to strike again  Holding him and the other perpetrators of that horrible day to account can be no less than our foremost priority  We must redouble our efforts to deliver justice where it is due  root out evil where it hides and destroy al Qaeda s capacity to act out its desire to destroy America   Consistent with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group  the Landrieu proposal boosts support for Afghan Security Forces and NATO forces in Afghanistan and for increased security cooperation inside Pakistan  It also adds funding for translators and translation technologies  drug interdiction and counter drug activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan  and operations to secure the Pakistani and Iranian borders  As the U S  draws down combat forces in Iraq  the Landrieu amendment would limit the mission of remaining combat troops to protecting U S  and Coalition personnel and infrastructure  training  equipping and providing logistical support for the Iraqi Security Forces  and conducting targeted counter terrorism operations   Combat resources could then be repositioned as needed to support the bolstered mission of Operation Enduring Freedom and the NATO International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan  Under the Landrieu plan  every unit deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan would be required to meet the baseline C 1 readiness standard  Units would not be permitted to deploy without the proper training and full complement of equipment required for their specific mission   Where al Qaeda and other terrorist groups exist in Iraq  this plan would continue to empower our forces to strike  and strike hard   Sen  Landrieu said    But a fish rots from the head  and we ve spent too much time chasing the tail   We must make sure our skilled men and women in combat have the clear mission and full resources they need to focus their fight at the top  where it belongs   A full copy of the amendment is available
