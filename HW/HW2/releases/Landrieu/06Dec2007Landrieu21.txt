Partisan Tactics Threaten Farm Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 06 2007    Partisan Tactics Threaten Farm Bill Procedural vote in Senate scheduled for tomorrow     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate tomorrow morning will again vote to stop a filibuster on the 2007 Farm Bill that will reauthorize agricultural programs through 2012 for Louisiana s more than 20 000 farmers  Last month  a similar procedural vote fell five votes shy of the 60 vote threshold required to proceed to the bill  Most Republicans  including Sen  David Vitter  R La   opposed the bill in a partisan effort to force votes on unrelated amendments  and these delaying tactics threaten the bill again    Certain Senators are holding our farmers and rural communities hostage because they want to attach unrelated issues to the Farm Bill   Senator Landrieu said   Keeping the old Farm Bill will be devastating to Louisiana farmers  The new bill maintains critical market assistance for farmers and ensures all our farmers remain competitive   Voting against the Farm Bill tomorrow dooms chances for the bill s passage this year  Our farmers deserve better from the United States Senate    There is no better Christmas gift for our farmers than getting this bill out of Washington gridlock   Louisiana farmers have united behind Sen  Landrieu s effort to get the Farm Bill passed this year and are against extending the current bill    If the bill passes the procedural hurdle  the Senate will vote on a version that Sen  Landrieu amended since the Agriculture Committee voted on the bill  Sen  Landrieu s amendments include a study to determine how to safely reopen the domestic turtle market  which has been closed since 1975  Sen  Landrieu had previously added an amendment to the Food and Drug Reauthorization bill to open the domestic market  but the provision failed in conference meetings with the House of Representatives  The bill also includes another post committee markup amendment to combat the hypoxic condition of the Gulf of Mexico  which occurs because of nitrogen runoff from the Upper Mississippi River Basin     The 2007 Farm Bill helps protect domestic sugar producers from the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   to be fully implemented January 1  that leaves uncertainty in the U S  sugar market  Sugar is one of Louisiana s most important commodities  representing a nearly  280 million a year industry  The bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture flexibility in setting the quota for imports and provides additional security by increasing the government backed loan rate for the sugar program from 18 cents to 19 cents per pound over the next five years  Despite dramatic surges in energy and fertilizer costs  the last time the loan rate was increased was in 1985   Language Sen  Landrieu included in the bill will give Louisiana sweet potato producers the ability to qualify for crop disaster assistance  Natural disasters  such as hurricanes  droughts or floods can wipe out an entire year s crop  as Hurricane Katrina did in Louisiana  This language fixes a flawed accounting method that left sweet potato producers ineligible for disaster assistance   Also included in the Farm Bill is a provision Sen  Landrieu authored to help the Louisiana oyster industry recover in the aftermath of a disaster  The industry suffered a  266 million loss as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and the provision will create a crop insurance pilot program to protect it from future storms  At Sen  Landrieu s request  bill also establishes separate loan rates for long grain and medium short grain rice  The current loan rates unfairly penalize producers of long grain rice  much of which is farmed in the South   Sen  Landrieu joined with other Senators in pushing for the bill s expansion of the USDA Snack Program to include all 50 states  The current pilot program helps schools provide healthy snacks to students during after school activities  and the expansion will help promote healthy eating among Louisiana youngsters  The House passed a version of the Farm Bill in July
