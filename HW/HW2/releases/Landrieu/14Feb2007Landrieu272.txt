GAO Report Confirms Bipartisan Call for Accountability in Disaster Loan Program         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 14 2007    GAO Report Confirms Bipartisan Call for Accountability in Disaster Loan Program     WASHINGTON    A Government Accountability Office  GAO  report to be released today reveals the need for legislation introduced today by Senators John Kerry  D Mass    Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine   Mary Landrieu  D La    and David Vitter  R La   to require the federal government to provide a detailed plan for implementing the Disaster Loan Program and regular reports on the solvency of the program to Congress  The GAO report recommends the Small Business Administration  SBA  establish timeframes for completing key elements of its disaster plan and assess whether the use of disaster simulations could improve future responses to disasters  Both recommendations are incorporated in the bipartisan legislation    This GAO report makes clear that more information and better planning is needed to ensure adequate services and funding will always be available for those in need after a disaster  and that s what our bipartisan legislation does   said Kerry  Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship   We re working to prevent a  sky is falling  scenario that results in multiple last minute funding requests  The uncertainty that inherently comes with a disaster shouldn t translate into uncertainty over money for loans  or even whether there s a staffer to process your application or return your phone call   Over the last year  the program has been close to shutting down three times due to insufficient funds    most recently this week  though Congress is expected to address the shortfall by the 15th   Twice last February the program needed emergency funding to ensure that victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita would receive critical disaster aid    With the SBA at the forefront of disaster relief efforts  it is essential that we find ways to ensure that this country s 25 million small businesses have a resource they can depend on when disaster strikes   Snowe said   We learned all too well after the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes  it is critical for government programs to run smoothly and efficiently when called upon to aide disaster victims   We can all agree that that there were significant deficiencies with the SBA s disaster response effort  and I believe that we can all agree that this vital legislation will support the SBA in its continuing efforts to ensure those deficiencies are eliminated    An important lesson of hurricanes Katrina and Rita is that we must reform  streamline and strengthen the SBA with better tools to prepare for the next disaster   Sen  Landrieu said    This bill will provide vital Congressional oversight and ensure that the SBA has a flexible  fast acting disaster response plan for any disaster  be it natural or manmade  I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure quick passage of this important legislation    If we are going to meet our local contracting goals  we need the proper information and authority to prevent backlog and delayed funding   said Vitter    This legislation reflects the GAO report and will provide greater stability and peace of mind to our small businesses recovering from natural disasters like hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The Small Business Disaster Loan Reporting Act of 2007 requires the Small Business Administration  SBA  to  Update its Hurricane Response Plan by May 1  2007  detailing how the Administration will respond to major disasters in the future  including the use and training of staff  coordination with other agencies  and models for response based on the scale of the disaster  Submit monthly accounting reports to Congress outlining disaster loan activity for all major disasters during the previous month  including loan volumes  amount spent on loans and administrative costs  and an estimate of how long funding will be available  Report daily to Congress on the loan activity for each individual disaster declared by the President  including the number of applications received and their status as well as the dollar amount of the applications approved and disbursed  Provide Congress with a notice of the need for supplemental funding  Compile a report on how the processing of disaster loans can be improved  and Submit a report on federal contracts awarded as a result of a major disaster every six months from the date it was declared  including the total number of contracts awarded and the number of contracts awarded to small businesses  women and minority owned businesses  and local businesses
