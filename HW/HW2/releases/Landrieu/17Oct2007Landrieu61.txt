Landrieu Statement on FEMA Hazard Mitigation Reversal         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 17 2007    Landrieu Statement on FEMA Hazard Mitigation Reversal Echoes Landrieu legislation in finally reconsidering policyon eligibility for homeowners who show initiative     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released a statement following an announcement by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  that it would revisit its eligibility requirements for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program  HMGP    Previously  the agency s policy had been to deny grants to homeowners that took the initiative to start their disaster preparedness work before completing the HMGP application process   Until today s announcement  FEMA insisted that it could not revisit the eligibility rules without new legislation being enacted  The U S  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in August unanimously passed Sen  Landrieu s SMART RESPONSE Act  which included among its provisions language to reverse this denial of grants   Sen  Landrieu chairs the committee s Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  Sen  Landrieu today said   Today s announcement that FEMA intends to revisit the HMGP eligibility rules is a welcome step that I have been pressing them to take for many months   The  self starter penalty  discourages swift rebuilding and protection against future floods  and instead perpetuates a bureaucracy laden status quo   While it took unnecessarily long to get here  the agency s recognition that an act of Congress was not needed to fix the problem is a breakthrough I hope we can build on   Retroactive eligibility is essential  and new momentum toward expedited reviews is encouraging  but a streamlined process is also needed for cost benefit analyses  post construction inspections and data coordination   Without a top to bottom shedding of red tape  the program cannot get on track   The SMART RESPONSE Act addresses these issues and helps to close the Road Home funding gap   I will continue my fight to encourage its passage  and will keep working with FEMA to identify more immediately actionable solutions
