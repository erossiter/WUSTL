Landrieu Implores President to  Relieve Unmitigated Suffering   End FEMA s  Abject Failures           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 03 2005    Landrieu Implores President to  Relieve Unmitigated Suffering   End FEMA s  Abject Failures       WASHINGTON    U S   Senator Mary Landrieu  D La   issued the following statement this afternoon regarding her call yesterday for President Bush to appoint a cabinet level official to oversee Hurricane Katrina relief and recovery efforts within 24 hours  Sen  Landrieu said   Yesterday  I was hoping President Bush would come away from his tour of the regional devastation triggered by Hurricane Katrina with a new understanding for the magnitude of the suffering and for the abject failures of the current Federal Emergency Management Agency   24 hours later  the President has yet to answer my call for a cabinet level official to lead our efforts   Meanwhile  FEMA  now a shell of what it once was  continues to be overwhelmed by the task at hand   I understand that the U S  Forest Service had water tanker aircraft available to help douse the fires raging on our riverfront  but FEMA has yet to accept the aid   When Amtrak offered trains to evacuate significant numbers of victims    far more efficiently than buses    FEMA again dragged its feet    Offers of medicine  communications equipment and other desperately needed items continue to flow in  only to be ignored by the agency   But perhaps the greatest disappointment stands at the breached 17th Street levee   Touring this critical site yesterday with the President  I saw what I believed to be a real and significant effort to get a handle on a major cause of this catastrophe    Flying over this critical spot again this morning  less than 24 hours later  it became apparent that yesterday we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity  and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single  lonely piece of equipment  The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast    black and white  rich and poor  young and old    deserve far better from their national government   Mr  President   I m imploring you once again to get a cabinet level official stood up as soon as possible to get this entire operation moving forward regionwide with all the resources    military and otherwise    necessary to relieve the unmitigated suffering and economic damage that is unfolding   Today s aerial tour of the 17th Street levee will be featured tomorrow on ABC s This Week with George Stephanopoulos   Later  Sen  Landrieu will also appear on CBS s 60 Minutes
