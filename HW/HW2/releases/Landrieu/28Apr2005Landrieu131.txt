taught the kids about how the lawmaking process works  and then allowed them each to draft their own legislation  After learning how to write a press release and speak to the media  the students were given the opportunity to brief reporters individually and introduce their bills at a press conference  They then wrapped up their day by meeting in a room traditionally used for large Senate committee meetings and voting on their legislation  Among the bills that passed were measures to increase teacher salaries  ban smoking in the presence of children  reduce drug use and drunk driving  and a bill to improve school lunch food  Several bills to shorten the school week were voted down  although one proposal to cut the school day to one minute passed unanimously  The issued that they discussed were very important and timely  Sen  Landrieu said  Their proposals are essential and relevant to many of the debates going on right now in Congress and in                  Louisiana
