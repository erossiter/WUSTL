Sen  Landrieu Testifies on Baker Bill to Senate Committee         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  2 15 06    Sen  Landrieu Testifies on Baker Bill to Senate Committee     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   testified before the Senate Banking Committee today in support of the Louisiana Recovery Corporation bill  H R  4100   S  2172  which she introduced in the Senate in December   Sen  Landrieu was joined at today s hearing by the bill s author  Congressman Richard Baker  R Baton Rouge  and Sen  David Vitter  R La    Highlights of the Sen  Landrieu s testimony are included below      One hundred ninety eight years ago  every public building in Washington  DC was razed to the ground by invading soldiers of Great Britain   Imagine the very pertinent questions that must have occurred to the members of Congress at that time     We are a young nation   We have placed our capitol in a very difficult physical environment   We have placed our capitol where it sits at the mercy of the British navy   Should we rebuild   Should we relocate to the interior   Should we concentrate the seat of government and make it vulnerable to attack      Of course  we would rebuild Washington   President Madison returned to this city  amid the ruins and devastation and did the only thing he could  he followed the American spirit of optimism and hope   We always rebuild  bigger  better and smarter     New Orleans will be rebuilt and there is nothing the government can do to stop that   The question for every level of government is how do we rebuild   What policy choices can government make today that will pay off in the long run   How do we perform our most fundamental duty of protecting people while also minimizing the human costs of this tragedy   Congressman Baker has developed one answer to that question and one piece of that puzzle   I believe that his efforts are innovative  bold and precisely the kind of initiative that would set the course of reconstruction in the Gulf Coast region onto the right track     There are several key virtues of the Baker plan that I believe need to be incorporated into any plan to address the housing crisis now facing the region     First  the Baker bill is collaborative   It takes representation from all levels of government  compels coordination with state and local planning and institutes a mechanism for everyone to be heard  while also creating a unified vision for redevelopment   Secondly  the bill treats both mortgage lenders and home owners equitably   Under his legislation  homeowners would be guaranteed a return on their equity  and mortgage lenders would be required to absorb their fair share of the losses   Finally  the Baker bill provides stability and certainty  while also giving state and local planning entities a realistic time frame to develop a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the region      Mr  Chairman  it is very easy to forget when we talk about facts and figures  and process and government that we are also talking about people s lives   Louisiana has 650 000 displaced people from this storm   The only thing that compares in this country s history is the Civil War   We lost over 217 000 homes   That means a lot of lives that need to start over     We are the most powerful nation on earth   This should be an opportunity to prove it  Instead  we have slipped from one embarrassment to another    While the foibles of 11 000 homes sitting in Arkansas  rotting  may make for good fodder for late night comedians  and gives politicians something to rail about  think of its effect on our people   Think what that means to a family that has been living out of a hotel room for six months   It is crushing    To be clear  I don t think anyone in Louisiana is wedded to any particular detail of this solution   We are willing to talk  to compromise  to amend our plans   But that cannot happen if there is no one to talk to   However  the fundamental principles of the Baker plan ARE needed  a unified vision  collaboration between all levels of government  equity between homeowners and mortgage lenders  and short term stability that will give planners the time necessary to develop the road ahead   That is what Congressman Baker has offered the Congress  and I believe that is what the Senate should do    The people of Louisiana deserve more and indeed it will take more than a few old programs  it will take a coordinated effort and new tools   I commend Congressman Baker for doing just that as we work together move forward     30
