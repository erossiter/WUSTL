Senators Announce Complete Deal on Offshore Oil and Gas Production  Revenue Sharing         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 12 2006    Senators Announce Complete Deal on Offshore Oil and Gas Production  Revenue Sharing Florida issues reach resolution  June 29 deal to go to full Senate     WASHINGTON    Having gained support from Florida s two senators for its core concepts  Senate leaders and Gulf Coast senators today announced that legislation will soon be brought to the Senate floor that opens new areas of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas production and shares a portion of the revenues with coastal energy producing states    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   last month represented the Gulf Coast states in final negotiations on the revenue sharing provisions with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   Majority Whip Mitch McConnell  R Ky   and Senator Pete Domenici  R N M   the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee on which Sen  Landrieu sits   Joining them in today s announcement were Senators David Vitter  R La   Trent Lott  R Miss   Thad Cochran  R Miss   Jeff Sessions  R Ala   Kay Bailey Hutchison  R Tex   John Cornyn  R Tex   and Mel Martinez  R Fla   Senator Bill Nelson  D Fla   also attended the event  saying he considers the legislation promising but awaits final details to be worked out   This is a very proud and hopeful day for Louisiana and America s energy coast   Sen  Landrieu said    It s been a day that many of us have looked forward to for a long time  setting in place a partnership that works   for the nation and for the states  for the coast and its economies  and for the Gulf itself   None of this would have been possible without Senator Domenici  who has been a leader on energy issues for more years than most of us can count   Without his leadership and strong support  this would not have been possible   But let me also thank the Gulf Coast team  and in particular  Senators Vitter and Lott   All the senators from the Gulf Coast stepped up to make this breakthrough happen   The legislation would open nearly eight million acres of the Gulf of Mexico to energy production   A 37 5 percent share of the federal revenues generated by this lease sale and subsequent production would flow to the four Gulf Coast energy producing states  Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama    In the first ten years  Louisiana would stand to receive about a third of these funds  based on a formula that allocates shares based on each state s distance to production  with no state receiving less than ten percent   In combination with the coastal impact assistance funding secured in last year s Energy Bill  Louisiana stands to receive more than three quarters of a billion dollars over the next ten years   Beginning in 2017  coastal energy producing states would receive 37 5 percent of oil and gas revenues generated from any Gulf lease issued after the enactment of this legislation   The distribution among the Gulf Coast states would continue to be based on proximity to production  with historical production levels also taken into account   Louisiana s share would be approximately 40 to 50 percent  but the formula would be recalculated each year   This is a way to provide more energy to Americans to help lower and stabilize gas prices   Sen  Landrieu said    At the same time  critical resources will be made available to Louisiana and the Gulf Coast states to rebuild our wetlands and strengthen our levees and hurricane defenses   Current OCS revenues are approximately  6 to  8 billion  and are expected to top  12 billion within 20 years   Conservative estimates based on forecasts from the Congressional Budget office and Minerals Management Service predict that Louisiana would under this plan receive more than  650 million per year  beginning in fiscal year 2017    The area of new production includes an approximately 1 5 million acre section of the Gulf of Mexico known as Area 181  as well as about 6 million acres to its south   It is expected to produce more than 1 1 billion barrels of oil    more than the proven reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma combined    and at least six trillion cubic feet of natural gas  or six times current U S  imports of liquefied natural gas each year  The federal government would retain 50 percent of the new revenues  and up to  450 million per year of the remaining 12 5 percent would be allocated to the state side of the Land and Water Conservation fund  The bill would also extend a moratoria around the coast of Florida until 2022  disallowing energy production within 125 miles of shore in the state s territorial waters  as defined by the Minerals Management Service   Other states would not be allowed to produce in their waters within 100 miles of Florida s shore   Production would also be prohibited east of the military mission line  which extends due south of Pensacola  Fla     more than 200 miles west of most of the state s shoreline   Today s agreement marks the most significant advance in the state delegation s fight for its fair share since the 1998 Conservation and Reinvestment Act  CARA  and 2002 Energy Bill   Led by Sens  Landrieu and John Breaux  D La   63 senators demanded that CARA be brought to the floor  but no further Senate action was taken   Last year  Sens  Landrieu and Vitter secured with Sen  Domenici a  1 billion coastal impact assistance amendment to the 2005 Energy Bill that will result in Louisiana receiving  135 million per year for the next four years   Also last year  as part of the negotiations for her pivotal vote in passing the President s Budget Resolution  Sen  Landrieu was able to secure a reserve fund of up to  10 billion for coastal protection and restoration in the Senate version of the bill  Today s agreement is expected to be brought to the floor for full Senate consideration later this month
