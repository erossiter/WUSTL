Landrieu  Coleman Work to Ensure New Requirements Do Not Impair Guatemala Adoptions         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 31 2007    Landrieu  Coleman Work to Ensure New Requirements Do Not Impair Guatemala Adoptions Senators  letters request Guatemalan president and UNICEF to ensure Hague Treaty ratification considers well being of Guatemala s orphaned children     WASHINGTON    In an effort to address the current Guatemalan adoption crisis  Co Chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Norm Coleman  R Minn   today sent two separate letters    one to Guatemalan President  Oscar Berger  and one to the leadership of the United Nations Children s Fund  UNICEF     to encourage an interim measure for pending adoption applications in Guatemala so orphaned children do not remain outside the care of a loving family for prolonged periods of time    Specifically  the letters encourage President Berger and the Guatemalan government to allow applications filed before January 1st  2008 to continue after that date  which marks the beginning of Guatemala s full implementation of the Hague treaty   This type of  grandfather  clause would allow for legal adoptions by United States citizens to continue uninterrupted    The U S  has not yet completed ratification of the Hague Treaty  leading to the concerns surrounding Guatemala s implementation plans   Guatemala s ratification and implementation of the Hague treaty is commendable   Sen  Landrieu said   but it should not stand in the way of finding homes for children in need of loving families   Every abandoned and orphaned child deserves a permanent  safe and loving home  and the United States continues to provide the most opportunity for children as they get older   We must not allow one positive step forward for Guatemala to be two steps back for Guatemala s orphaned children   I hope that we can work with UNICEF and President Berger to ensure Guatemala s orphans are not kept out of loving homes in the United States pending our implementation of the Hague treaty    I applaud the efforts for the Guatemalan government to implement a Hague compliant system  however  I am concerned that the suspension of intercountry adoptions with the United States could result in denying over 3 000 of the country s orphaned children the chance to be part of a loving family   said Coleman    While well intentioned  these rules could withhold children from a permanent familyone of the basic building blocks of a child s long term physical and emotional development   Suspending currently pending adoptions to the U S  is clearly not in the best interest of the children and it is my hope President Berger and the Guatemalan government will heed our concerns as outlined in the letters and provide a way for adoptions to continue   More than 180 members of Congress have signed each letter  and Coleman will meet with Guatemalan Ambassador Guillermo Castillo later this week to discuss this issue  Congressman James Oberstar  D Minn   and Congresswoman Ginny Brown Waite  R Fla   House Co Chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption  are circulating identical letters amount Members of the House of Representatives   Due to the implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption  an international agreement intended to safeguard adopted children from trafficking  significant changes are taking place in adoption law in the United States and Guatemala   The government of Guatemala has announced that their nation will require all adoption cases to meet Hague standards as of January 1  2008  and stop all processing of adoption cases with non Hague countries  including the United States  until such a system can be implemented   Though there is a strong need to reform the intercountry adoption process in Guatemala and there are benefits to adhering to the Hague Convention  this action may cause unnecessary harm to Guatemala s orphaned children   According to the State Department  the U S  is expected to move towards ratification of the treaty during the coming year  As co chairs of Congressional Coalition on Adoption  Senators Landrieu and Coleman have championed a number of initiatives to encourage adoption  including  most recently  the passage of a provision to permit children adopted after the age of 13 to file for federal college financial aid as independent students  removing a financial disincentive for teen adoptions
