Landrieu Responds to Bush WRDA Veto Statement         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 05 2007    Landrieu Responds to Bush WRDA Veto Statement     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement regarding President Bush s stated reasons for vetoing the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   As soon as the veto was confirmed Friday  Sen  Landrieu spoke with Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev  The House of Representatives must act first under constitutional procedure  but Sen  Reid promised Sen  Landrieu he would move to schedule a Senate vote to override the veto at the earliest opportunity following the House  which is expected to do so as early as tomorrow   I am extremely disappointed with the President s veto last week of the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  that was passed out of the House and Senate by overwhelming majorities     In a brush with irony from a President who has racked up more than  3 trillion in debt since taking office  President Bush now claims that WRDA  lacks fiscal discipline    But replacing aging infrastructure is sound fiscal policy and a wise investment in our future  Letting our nation s infrastructure deteriorate and failing to invest in our national flood control  navigation and environmental restoration projects will cost the American taxpayer dearly down the road  For Louisiana  the bill will help protect our communities and energy infrastructure from future hurricanes rising out of the Gulf   The President does accurately point out that this WRDA bill is very costly  However  the increased cost of this bill is the result of not passing a bill in seven years due to partisan gridlock  The cost of this bill is in line with what would have been spent over this period if a WRDA bill had been signed into law every two years as intended   Without the authorizations in this bill  Louisiana s coast will continue to wash away at an alarming rate  leaving our communities perilously exposed to flooding and the energy infrastructure that serves the entire nation in grave danger
