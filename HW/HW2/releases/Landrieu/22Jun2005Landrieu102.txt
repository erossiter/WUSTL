Senators Offer  1 Billion Energy Amendment to Support Coastal States         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 22 2005    Senators Offer  1 Billion Energy Amendment to Support Coastal States Louisiana s coast stands to receive direct revenue of about  540 million    About  135 million per year over four years  starting in 2007     WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and David Vitter  R La   today joined Sens  Pete Domenici  R N M   and Jeff Bingaman  D N M   to file a  1 billion coastal impact assistance amendment to H R  6  the Energy Bill   The measure  expected to be debated tomorrow  would provide  1 billion     250 million per year for fiscal years 2007 through 2010    to six coastal energy producing states  Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi  Alabama  Alaska and California   Sens  Trent Lott  R Miss   Jeff Sessions  R Ala   Thad Cochran  R Miss   and John Warner  R Va   are also co sponsors  The direct funding would not be subject to Congress  annual appropriations process  and would be allocated based on each state s share of energy production on the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS    Through the formula  by which each state would receive funds based on the amount of OCS energy leases within 200 miles its coast  Louisiana stands to receive about  135 million per year   Louisiana and our other coastal producing states have long served the nation by increasing our domestic energy supply and helping to secure our economic independence and security   said Sen  Landrieu  who shepherded the proposal through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in close partnership with Sen  Domenici  the Committee Chairman  and Sen  Bingaman  the Ranking Member    With the Senate s support  we will finally now begin to be recognized for our substantial contributions    This much needed infusion of resources is a good foundation for assuring Louisiana its fair share  and it will help save America s Wetland    This is the closest the Senate has ever been to passing mandatory spending to address Louisiana s eroding coast   said Sen  Vitter    After years of falling short  the Senate is on the cusp of taking a historic step forward in our fight to protect our coast   Working together with Senator Landrieu and others  we have been able to convince our Senate colleagues that this is not just a Louisiana problem  but a national one    Senator Landrieu has taken me on a tour of Louisiana s coastal wetlands  so I have seen first hand the need for federal assistance to help restore and protect this important resource   said Sen  Bingaman    I m pleased to join Louisiana s senators in their efforts to obtain this coastal impact assistance    Though oil and gas exploration take place far offshore on the outer continental shelf  it is local coastal communities which play the leading role in facilitating and hosting this important industry   Sen  Lott said    It s certainly fitting that coastal states be entitled to impact assistance which restores and preserves invaluable environmental treasures   The amendment authorize funds to be used for the conservation  protection and restoration of coastal areas and wetlands  the mitigation of damage to fish  wildlife and other natural resources  and the implementation of federally approved marine  coastal and other conservation management plans   Up to 23 percent of the funds may also be spent each year on mitigating of the impact of OCS activities as well as planning assistance and administrative costs related to these coastal projects   The amendment also requires the Governor of each coastal producing state to present a coastal impact assistance plan to the Secretary of the Interior by July 1  2008    Coastal political subdivisions  such as parishes  counties and boroughs  would receive 35 percent of each state s share   In general  25 percent of this allocation would be distributed based on the relative population of each subdivision   Another 25 percent would be proportional to the relative lengths of the subdivisions  coastlines   The remaining 50 percent would be a function of each subdivision s distance to energy production leases on the OCS  with subdivisions farther away from production receiving a smaller share than those closer to leased OCS tracts  To calculate these allocations for Louisiana  coastal parishes without a coastline would be considered to have a coastline equal in length to one third of the average coastline length for parishes with coastlines   In Alaska  the allocation based on distance to leased tracts would simply be split evenly between the two nearest subdivisions to each tract  The amendment is expected to be voted upon as early as tomorrow afternoon   The funding from this amendment is the next step in implementing the Louisiana Coastal Area program and truly restoring our coast   said Sen  Vitter    This provision will help fund the major authorization I was able to secure in the WRDA bill through my seat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee   I look forward to working with the rest of the Louisiana delegation to ensure that this funding and the WRDA reauthorization becomes a reality    As long as the waters keep beating away at our shores  I will continue to fight for the assistance we need and  more importantly  deserve   Sen  Landrieu said    I am proud to have worked with my colleagues in the Senate Energy Committee and the other members of the Louisiana delegation to secure this funding that will help protect one of the most precious resources to Louisiana and our nation    our coast
