Homeland Security Committee Chair Endorses Landrieu Amendments         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 02 2007    Homeland Security Committee Chair Endorses Landrieu Amendments Sen  Lieberman delivers floor statement endorsing amendments introduced by Sen  Landrieu     WASHINGTON    Chairman of the U S  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   today delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate endorsing S  Amdt  295 and S  Amdt  296  introduced by Sen  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to S  4  the Improving America s Security Act of 2007  S  Amdt  295  the FAIR Funding Amendment  would waive for Katrina  and Rita affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  S  Amdt  296  the Disaster Loan Fairness Amendment  makes Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness made available to all other disaster stricken communities  Sen  Lieberman said   I thank the chair  Mr  President  I wanted to ask unanimous consent that I might put two statements in the record supporting amendments that the Senator from Louisiana  Senator Landrieu  put in earlier today  One of the amendments  amendment numbered 295  is actually identical to a bill that Senators Landrieu and Stevens and I introduced earlier this year called the Local Government Disaster Relief Act of 2007   That bill  S  664  would waive the 10  state match requirement for the restoration of public infrastructure under FEMA s public assistance program  The statement I m going to put in the record explains this in more detail  Senator Landrieu talked some about it earlier in the day  I believe she ll return to the floor to describe it in more detail   Our homeland security committee held a hearing in New Orleans during January of this year  and  you know  progress has been made in recovering from Hurricane Katrina  but there is an enormous amount yet to be done in the Gulf Coast and particularly in New Orleans  one of America s great cities  large sections of which are really a shadow town now    a ghost town and part of what    there is a lot of bureaucratic red tape   The problem here is not that Congress has not responded   In fact  we have appropriated  I believe  well over  110 billion in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to the Gulf Coast  The problem is that so much of that money is tied up  And in the case of this match  a lot of the programs are being tied up because some of the governments down there just don t have the resources to provide the match  The match has been waived in other natural disasters  I think this amendment that has been offered is exactly the right thing to do to expedite the recovery of the Gulf Coast   The second amendment that Senator Landrieu introduced is amendment number 296  which I also want to support  It would allow the forgiveness of certain loans provided in the second Katrina supplemental appropriations bill passed last congress to Gulf Coast states devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  The program is authorized under the Stafford Act as a tool for local governments that suffer substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a disaster  The program is capped at  5 million or no more than 25  of the locality s operating budget  whichever is reached first   The Stafford Act also provides for the forgiveness of these loans  Congress passed the supplemental appropriations bill in part to provide  750 million to help gulf coast localities recover from the storm  And the bill waived respect to  5 million and 25  caps because of the enormous and immediate need that all of us saw  And this law would continue that  I supported waiving these caps to allow for the full flow of aid  At the time I did not  however  support another provision that prohibited forgiveness of the CDL loan as a condition for allowing funds to be released   The fact is that rebuilding is underway  but that recovery will take years  Some people think decades  The Stafford Act provides for the forgiveness of these loans because it recognizes in certain instances localities are simply unable to recover lost revenues  which in turn stops their efforts to rebuild  which ultimately leads to longer dependence on federal assistance  This amendment would allow the Gulf Coast localities    some of them so devastated with their revenue bases dramatically shrunk    to continue their rebuilding free from the burden of repaying loans that they simply  in fact  cannot repay  So I ask unanimous consent  Mr  President  that the full text of both of my statements in support of both of these amendments that Senator Landrieu has offered be printed in the record as if read
