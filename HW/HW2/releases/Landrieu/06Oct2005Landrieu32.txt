Landrieu To Congress  White House  Don t Abandon Louisiana Again         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 06 05    Landrieu To Congress  White House  Don t Abandon Louisiana Again Urges Washington not to go on vacation without addressing immediate disaster needs    WASHINGTON    In a late night speech on the floor of the Unites States Senate  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   Wednesday pledged to use all options available to her to ensure that the Senate takes immediate action to help people affected by Hurricane Katrina before breaking for a one week Columbus Day recess     Sen  Landrieu said   I m going to push and insist and use all the power that I have as a senator from the state of Louisiana with anyone else  Republican or Democrat  that will help to get this message to the White House and to the House leadership  Please don t abandon the people of Louisiana again  the people of Mississippi again  and the people of Alabama again by leaving before we do something to help them in a direct and concrete manner   In a letter sent to President Bush and Senate leaders earlier on Wednesday  Sen  Landrieu outlined five areas of urgent need that could be immediately addressed using a portion of the  42 billion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  has yet to use of the nearly  62 billion appropriated to it by Congress last month    Sen  Landrieu is calling for  15 billion of the unspent funding to be immediately dedicated to supporting elementary  secondary and post secondary schools  helping local governments continue providing essential services such as emergency responders  relieving health care costs for hurricane victims and the hospitals that treat them  and securing the financial stability of the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy   Sen  Landrieu is expected to return to the floor on Thursday and continue her fight to ensure that the immediate needs of Katrina victims are addressed before members of Congress embark on vacation  Other excerpts from Sen  Landrieu s floor speech   I m going to stay on this floor   I m going to push this issue so we get something for the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast before we leave    something for their health care  something for their education  something for their small businesses  something for their police and their fire departments  and something for their operating budgets so we can have something to work with when we get back  But the reason I m also pressing it is because I know as sure as I m standing here that there s going to be another disaster  And if we don t fix FEMA  if we don t fix some of these systems It s going to happen to someone else    I will not apologize for asking this on behalf of the 4 5 million people that live in my state  black and white  that have been devastated    Hispanic and Asian  that have been devastated by this storm    two million of them who have lost their home  their neighborhood and their place   Most of them have never asked the government for one thing    never been on one program    and they come here to ask for a little bit of help and they have to be told   You need to be more self reliant   How much more self reliant can people be  Other than raise their children  send them to school  balance their budget  pay for their house and pay their bills on time  And serve in the military  How much more self reliant can they be  They thought they lived in a nation that when something like this happened  that was really unexpected and not their fault  somebody would be there to help them  But all we have is photo ops and message boards and press releases   When it comes down the actually passing some legislation with some money attached to it that could actually help someone  we can t    Everyone agrees that FEMA is not what it used to be  that it s not working very well for whatever reason and whosever fault that might be  we cannot fix that overnight  So I am asking to take a few billion of that money that s just sitting there and allocate it to programs already established that are already working  so we can give hope to people   I m going to stand here on this floor all day tomorrow and use every pressure point that I can to see that some agreement can be reached before we leave   If we don t get action anything we do in January or February or March or April in large measure will be for naught  because the counties and cities and parishes and police departments and fire departments that we re trying to help may not make it    And people  in conclusion  want to come home  Some people may not be able to  but as a senator from Louisiana  I want people to know from our state  everyone is welcomed home  All people are welcomed  and we want everyone back  And we re doing the very best we can to try to provide and prioritize what we need to do first and second and third in order to get people back and get our communities started again  Not only is New Orleans a great city  but the region is pretty spectacular and special  Generation after generation of families have vacationed together and lived together and worshiped together and gone to school together and it s gone  And we would like the help of this nation to build it back higher  stronger and better  We don t want to waste a penny  but we need this help now  So let us act  Mr  President  when we come back early in the morning to get some of this done and to work with our colleagues to see that we can get help to the people who are desperately in need of it      30
