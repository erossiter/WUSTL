Senate Passes Farm Bill with Landrieu Language to Protect La  Farmers         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 14 2007    Senate Passes Farm Bill with Landrieu Language to Protect La  Farmers Bill heads to conference with House     WASHINGTON    In an overwhelming 79 14 vote  the United States Senate today passed the 2007 Farm Bill that reauthorizes agricultural programs through 2012 for Louisiana s more than 200 000 farmers  Sen  Landrieu successfully pushed her colleagues to get the bill through the Senate despite a partisan effort to stall the bill over unrelated amendments    Today was a true victory for our Louisiana farmers who can enjoy the holidays knowing that this bill retains the critical market assistance they need to have an edge in global commerce   Sen  Landrieu said   We overcame a difficult partisan stalemate to get this bill through the Senate  and I will continue this momentum by working with my House colleagues to make sure this bill is quickly sent to the President s desk   The Senate passed version includes several amendments Sen  Landrieu added since the Agriculture Committee voted on the bill in October  These include a study to determine how to safely reopen the domestic turtle market  which has been closed since 1975  Sen  Landrieu had previously added an amendment to the Food and Drug Reauthorization bill to open the domestic market  but the provision failed in conference meetings with the House of Representatives  The bill includes another post committee  Landrieu amendment to combat the hypoxic condition of the Gulf of Mexico  which occurs because of nitrogen runoff from the Upper Mississippi River Basin  It also includes language by Sens  David Vitter  R La   and Landrieu that will require the National Finance Center  NFC   a government agency that employs 1 280 people in New Orleans  to provide Congress with a report if it plans to relocate  Congress will have 60 days to review the report before the NFC is able to take any action to move away from the city       The 2007 Farm Bill helps protect domestic sugar producers from the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   scheduled to be fully implemented January 1  that leaves uncertainty in the U S  sugar market  Sugar is one of Louisiana s most important commodities  representing a nearly  280 million per year industry  The bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture flexibility in setting the quota for imports and provides additional security by increasing the government backed loan rate for the sugar program    from 18 cents to 19 cents per pound over the next five years  Despite dramatic surges in energy and fertilizer costs  the last time the loan rate was increased was in 1985   Language Sen  Landrieu included in the bill will give Louisiana sweet potato producers the ability to qualify for crop disaster assistance  Natural disasters  such as hurricanes  droughts or floods can wipe out an entire year s crop  as Hurricane Katrina did in Louisiana  This language fixes a flawed accounting method that left sweet potato producers ineligible for disaster assistance   Also included is a provision Sen  Landrieu authored to help the Louisiana oyster industry recover in the aftermath of a disaster  The industry suffered a  266 million loss as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and the provision will create a crop insurance pilot program to protect it from future storms  At Sen  Landrieu s request  the bill establishes separate loan rates for long grain and medium short grain rice  The current loan rates unfairly penalize producers of long grain rice  much of which is farmed in the South   Sen  Landrieu joined with other Senators in pushing for the bill s expansion of the USDA Snack Program to include all 50 states  The current pilot program helps schools provide healthy snacks to students during after school activities  and the expansion will help promote healthy eating among Louisiana youngsters   The House of Representatives passed a version of the Farm Bill in July  and the two bills are headed for a Senate House conference committee to work out differences before it is sent to the President s desk
