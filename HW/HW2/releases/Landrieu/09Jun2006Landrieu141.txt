Hurricane Bill to Ease Baton Rouge Transit Headaches         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 09 2006    Hurricane Bill to Ease Baton Rouge Transit Headaches Gives parish greater flexibility with federal transportation funds     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced that the conference report agreed to yesterday for the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill includes language that should help East Baton Rouge Parish alleviate the pressures of added population on the Capital Area Transit System  CATS    Baton Rouge has truly been a lifeboat for thousands of south Louisiana residents displaced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastating levee breaks that followed   Sen  Landrieu said    But that selfless service to the state comes at a price  and an overnight population increase creates burdens that cannot be ignored   I am proud to do all I can to make sure Mayor Holden and his team have the tools they need to continue managing their rapidly growing parish and serving Louisiana when Louisianians need their leadership the most   Baton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden  in a May 24 letter to Sen  Landrieu  had expressed concerns for the overburdened transit system  noting that average daily traffic now exceeds a level not expected until 2029   Emergency transportation funding provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  and the U S  Department of Transportation will expire at the end of June  Sen  Landrieu secured  200 million in additional transit funding in the Senate version of the emergency relief bill  but the funding was not accepted by the U S  House of Representatives   As a member of the conference committee negotiating the final report  Sen  Landrieu then instead secured language at the Mayor s request that allows the parish to use funds previously earmarked for capital investments to help defray ongoing operational costs   CATS has had to develop a plan for a reduction in the level of service it provides by July 2  2006   Mayor Holden said    The language included in the conference committee report will allow the flexibility to utilize funding that will lessen the impact on the proposed cuts in service to its ridership   This is a major step and one that will provide immediate relief   On behalf of the people of East Baton Rouge Parish  I would like to thank Senator Mary Landrieu for her untiring dedication to our people   The final conference report is expected to pass both chambers of Congress next week  and be signed into law shortly thereafter
