Landrieu on Confirmation of New SBA Administrator         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 30 2006    Landrieu on Confirmation of New SBA Administrator     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding yesterday s confirmation of Steven C  Preston to be Administrator of the U S  Small Business Administration   Mr  Preston replaces outgoing Administrator Hector Barreto  who announced his resignation in April  Senator Landrieu said   I applaud the confirmation of Steven Preston to be SBA Administrator   He has the management experience to bring private sector efficiency to this Federal bureaucracy   As I have said before  we need an SBA Administrator that is a  work horse  not a  show horse   and I believe that Mr  Preston s passion to serve and his expressed willingness to be a bridge between Congress and the White House will serve him well in this challenging position   For too long  this agency has been a second class citizen in this Administration   The SBA s budget has been cut by nearly 40 percent since 2001    more than any other Federal agency   This sends the wrong signal to small businesses  especially our small businesses down in the Gulf Coast   It tells them that they are not worth the investment  that small businesses are not a national priority   I intend to offer legislation during the upcoming SBA reauthorization to help the SBA be more effective and responsive  especially during this hurricane season  and look forward to working with Mr  Preston and my colleagues on the Senate Small Business Committee on this and other issues   As part of the most recent Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill that passed the Congress  Senator Landrieu included language which requires the SBA to submit a status report by June 15  2006  on their comprehensive disaster response plan for the 2006 Atlantic Hurricane season   This is to ensure that the SBA is better prepared for this hurricane season and for future disasters as well    When the Senate reconvenes  Senator Landrieu will also introduce comprehensive legislation for the upcoming SBA reauthorization process that will provide the SBA with more tools for future disasters
