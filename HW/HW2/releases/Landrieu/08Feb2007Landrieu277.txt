Landrieu Introduces Gulf Coast Small Business Recovery Package         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 08 2007    Landrieu Introduces Gulf Coast Small Business Recovery Package Gives needed boost to struggling Gulf Coast small businesses and tourism industry     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced a comprehensive legislative package to help small businesses in the Gulf Coast recover from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  The storms impacted 125 000 small and medium sized businesses Gulfwide  and in Louisiana alone  more than 18 000 businesses were totally destroyed    This legislative package is a targeted response to what I ve been hearing from our small businesses   Sen  Landrieu said   There is ongoing need a year and half after the storms    Affected small businesses endured the two worst hurricanes in American history  and the federal government has an important role in their recovery  This package helps our tourism industry  provides small business grants  makes SBA loans more flexible  and extends tax incentives for investment in the Go Zone  Together these bills provide commonsense solutions so that our businesses can recover and our economy can thrive    The Gulf Coast Back to Business Act The bill  cosponsored by Sens  Trent Lott  R Miss  Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Chairman John Kerry  D Mass   and Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   authorizes  100 million in grants for business affected by the storms  Of the total   75 million is authorized for Louisiana and  25 million for Mississippi   The bill allows businesses and homeowners with Small Business Administration  SBA  disaster loans to defer payment for one year  It also allows the SBA to immediately disburse  35 000    up from  10 000    on an approved loan without requiring additional collateral   The legislation further helps Gulf Coast small businesses in the disaster zone compete for federal contracts by designating them as part of the Historically Underutilized Business Zone  HUBZone  for two to three years  at the discretion of the SBA Administrator   This legislation will give our small businesses access to much needed cash through grants and help with existing loans  and it will better position them to compete for federal contracts   Sen  Landrieu said   With this assistance  our businesses will be able to reopen and fully resume operations    Senator Landrieu s tireless leadership on behalf of Gulf Coast hurricane victims is not only key to the region s recovery  but to restoring its former glory as a tourist destination   Sen  Kerry said   Washington s work to rebuild the Gulf Coast is still not done  I m proud to cosponsor this legislation with Senator Landrieu today because it will give businesses the resources they need to create jobs and contribute to the Gulf Coast s economic growth    I am proud to join Senator Landrieu as an original co sponsor of the Gulf Coast Back to Business Act   Sen  Lieberman said   Almost half of all businesses that shut down temporarily after a natural disaster never reopen their doors  The widespread devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita affected more than 125 000 small businesses along the Gulf Coast   This bill provides much needed assistance to small businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi through grants and extended loan deferments   Available funds will enable small business owners to pay employees  buy merchandise  and perform repairs   Small businesses are the backbone of the Gulf Coast  and this legislation will go a long way in reinvigorating a critical sector of the region s economy   Helping Our States through Tourism Act  HOST Act  The HOST Act will boost Gulf Coast travel and tourism  an economic mainstay for the area  The legislation includes  130 million for Louisiana and  45 million for Mississippi for tourism marketing  It allows the Small Business Administration  SBA  to provide businesses with Economic Injury Disaster Loans because of the area s tourism slowdown    a direct result of Katrina and Rita  It also establishes a  2 5 million fund for government agencies to hold conventions and other events in Katrina and Rita affected areas   Tourism was Louisiana s second largest industry before the storms and is vital to our recovery today   Sen  Landrieu said   This bill gives the industry the tools it needs to recover     The Work  Hope and Opportunity for the Disaster Area Today Act This tax package is designed to help the struggling small businesses in the most heavily damaged areas of the disaster zone   It gives small businesses a one year tax credit of up to  15 000 of wages paid  and it increases from 50 percent to 100 percent the income tax deduction for business and entertainment expenses in the GO Zone   The bill extends certain Gulf Opportunity  GO  Zone tax incentives  which were passed in 2005 and have allowed hundreds of businesses to invest in areas impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  It includes a two year extension  until 2009  of the  200 000 deduction that GO Zone businesses can take for property costs and a one year extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit  WOTC  designation for Katrina and Rita employees  The WOTC provides a tax credit to businesses who hire employees in certain groups   It also provides restaurants and retailers in the GO Zone with more time to take advantage of tax incentives for facility improvements   These tax incentives for redevelopment in the GO Zone are essential to our economic recovery and rebuilding our communities   Sen  Landrieu said
