Landrieu and Melancon Introduce Bill to Replace Aging Hurricane Tracking Satellite         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 25 2007    Landrieu and Melancon Introduce Bill to Replace Aging Hurricane Tracking Satellite Satellite s failure would dramatically hinder accuracy of hurricane forecast     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and U S  Rep  Charlie Melancon  D La   yesterday introduced companion legislation in the Senate and House to replace an aging satellite key to tracking hurricanes and tropical storms   The Improved Hurricane Tracking and Forecasting Act of 2007 authorizes  375 million to the National Oceanic   Atmospheric Administration for the design and launch of an improved QuikSCAT satellite  which forecasts hurricanes  coastal winds  storm surges  and other weather related disasters  such as  El Ni  o   Sens  Mel Martinez  R Fla   Bill Nelson  D Fla   John Kerry  D Mass   and Rep  Ron Klein  D Fla   co sponsored the legislation   As the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season approaches  it is crucial that our nation s hurricane tracking system be first class   Sen  Landrieu said   With more than 50 percent of our population living within 50 miles of the coast  residents of these communities    in Louisiana  Florida and across the nation    deserve the best technology available to track impending hurricanes    The current satellite is five years past its projected lifespan  making it vulnerable to failure  We need more advanced warning of storms  and can t afford to slide backwards  This requires a long term solution rather than a short term band aid is essential    On the eve of another hurricane season  people all along the Gulf Coast are preparing once again to face any number of severe storms   Rep  Melancon said   To help them better plan when to evacuate  we need to apply the latest advances in technology to provide our coastal communities with the most advanced hurricane forecasting and tracking systems available   Better hurricane forecasting will no doubt save lives  and I am pleased to join Senator Landrieu  Rep  Klein  and other coastal members of Congress in introducing this bipartisan legislation    Accurately forecasting hurricanes is essential to saving lives and securing property   said Sen  Nelson    There is no one thing that can help more than early warning  and these funds will help ensure we have time to take the proper precautions    After the devastation Hurricane Katrina  we said as a nation  Never Again    Sen  Kerry said   In order to keep that promise to the survivors and to ourselves  we must ensure access to the best technology  to help us predict dangerous hurricanes before they hit  There is no better way to learn from this tragedy than creating real security from future threats    We cannot afford to be taking steps backwards when it comes to tracking and forecasting hurricanes   Rep  Klein said   Congress must do whatever it can to help get replacement technology in place   Given that over half of all Americans live within 50 miles of the coast line this is an issue that is important to a majority of the American people   The new  next generation satellite would maintain weather forecasting and warning capabilities and improve data capabilities for future weather related disasters   The bill also requires that the NOAA provide annual reports on the status of the satellite    NASA launched the current QuikSCAT satellite in 1999  and it was expected to remain in service until 2002  It was built in just 12 months because a previous satellite was lost in 1997    An instrument on the satellite sends pulses of microwave energy through the atmosphere to the ocean surface  and measures the energy that bounces back from the wind roughened surface   The energy of the microwave pulses changes depending on wind speed and direction  allowing scientists to monitor wind around the world     Bill Proenza  Director of the National Hurricane Center  has said that without QuikSCAT  hurricane forecasting would be 16 percent less accurate 72 hours before hurricane s landfall and 10 percent less accurate 48 hours before hurricane s landfall    The Senate bill  S 1509  was referred to the Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee  on which both Sen  Nelson and Sen  Kerry sit  Sen  Nelson is Chairman of the Subcommittee on Space  Aeronautics  and Related Agencies  The House bill  H R 2531  was referred to the Science and Technology Committee  on which Rep  Melancon sits
