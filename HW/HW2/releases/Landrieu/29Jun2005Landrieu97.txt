Sen  Landrieu On Emergency Supplemental Appropriation For Veterans Affairs         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 29 2005    Sen  Landrieu On Emergency Supplemental Appropriation For Veterans Affairs     WASHINGTON    Tonight  the United States Senate passed a  1 5 billion emergency supplemental appropriation to ensure that veterans  medical programs continue   The funding will help bail out the Department of Veterans Affairs which last week revealed a  1 billion budget deficit   Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   who is a cosponsor of the amendment  released the following statement   I am relieved that we were able to provide the funding necessary to give our veterans the medical care they deserve  however  I am deeply troubled that the Bush administration even allowed this problem to occur     The Senate has kept the doors open to our VA hospitals this year  but we must also make certain our government never again threatens to close those doors   In order to prevent this tragedy from happening again  we cannot make permanent President Bush s tax cuts for the wealthy when funding for our military and their families is already stretched so thin    We must ensure our troops have the resources they need to win in the field  and that our veterans have the health care they need here at home   These brave men and women have sacrificed so much for our nation  the very least we can do is give them the benefits and support they have earned in defense of our freedom
