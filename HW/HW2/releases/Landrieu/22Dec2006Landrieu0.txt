FEMA Short on Answers for Unfairness in Housing Dollars         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 22 2006    FEMA Short on Answers for Unfairness in Housing Dollars Mississippi granted nearly four times as much funding as Louisiana for trailer alternatives   WASHINGTON    Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  today briefed Congressional aides as to the rationale for granting Mississippi nearly four times the funding granted Louisiana for alternative housing solutions  despite Louisiana having suffered more than three times the housing loss in the 2005 hurricanes  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed more than 205 000 homes in Louisiana while fewer than 62 000 were destroyed in Mississippi   But in allocating  400 million that U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   an Appropriations Committee member  had helped to secure for innovative housing solutions such as modular homes and Katrina Cottages  FEMA awarded more than  281 million to Mississippi projects and only  74 5 million to housing projects in Louisiana  FEMAs pattern of unfairness continues  and regrettably  we were given little encouragement by the agencys attempts to defend its decisions today  Sen  Landrieu said   They described the process as competitive  but neglected the most important measure of all    need   A formula that distributes recovery funds with no regard for where they are most needed simply does not make any sense  At one point in this mornings briefing  a FEMA official went so far as to suggest that under their original  competitive  standards  Louisiana would not have received any share of the funding whatsoever   Agency officials were also unable to specifically address why the largest of the Mississippi projects  principally made up of modified travel trailers  could not be funded through existing channels    The Stafford Act allows for FEMA to invest in temporary housing such as trailers and similar construction  but the agency has interpreted those rules as prohibiting the use of FEMA funds for more permanent construction  such as the  Katrina Cottages    The Alternative Housing Pilot Program  AHPP  was included in the Fourth Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill specifically as a way to broaden FEMAs thinking and provide it with the tools to encourage more permanent and innovative housing alternatives to trailers   FEMA made these announcements as most Americans prepare for the holidays in an apparent hope that no one would notice  Sen  Landrieu added   They were wrong   We were watching   The 75 000 Louisianians still living in trailers were watching   And I will do everything in my power to ensure that the federal governments responsibility to the all people of the Gulf Coast is met fairly and honestly  Last month  Sen  Landrieu was named to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs for the 110th Congress  which convenes in January   The committee is responsible for overseeing FEMA
