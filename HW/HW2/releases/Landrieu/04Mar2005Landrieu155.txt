Sen  Landrieu on Sec  Snow Visit to New Orleans  Don t take the security out of Social Security           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 04 2005    Sen  Landrieu on Sec  Snow Visit to New Orleans  Don t take the security out of Social Security       WASHINGTON    The following is a statement by U S  Sen  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   regarding today s visit to New Orleans by Treasury Secretary John W  Snow  Sen  Landrieu said   I agree with Treasury Secretary Snow on one very important point  We do need to strengthen retirement security in our nation   All Americans deserve the confidence that their retirement will be secure    that Social Security will be there as promised  their 401 k  plans won t be raided through unscrupulous practices  and their pensions won t be squandered by reckless corporate management     The President s plan doesn t seek to address any of these concerns   It is too narrowly focused and creates too much risk by betting hard earned savings on an ever changing stock market when we should be working to add certainty and stability to the system   I agree that we must expand opportunities for retirement saving  but we must not undermine this worthy effort with a flawed privatization scheme that takes the  security  out of  Social Security    We in Louisiana understand strong retirement security  and have about 350 000 state and municipal workers enrolled in a public pension plan that encourages savings and financial stability   I will oppose any federal proposal which changes or undermines this program  just as I intend reject any proposal which cuts Social Security benefits or adds to our already rising and troubling deficit   I look forward to my meeting next month with Secretary Snow  and hope for a productive discussion on Social Security and the mounting national debt   Last month  Sen  Landrieu released The Path to a Debt Society  a 34 page report detailing how the President s budget proposal shortchanges Louisiana s future by passing the costs of the Administration s fiscal irresponsibility on to our children and state and local governments   She is expected to present the Treasury Secretary with a copy of the report  as well as a collection of e mails from constituents describing what they believe the right budget priorities to be   The report is available online at
