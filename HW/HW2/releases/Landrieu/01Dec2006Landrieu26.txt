CNN Keeps FEMA Honest with Report on Agency s Broken Promises to La  Schools         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 01 2006    CNN Keeps FEMA Honest with Report on Agency s Broken Promises to La  Schools     WASHINGTON    CNN s Anderson Cooper 360 last night continued their ongoing  Keeping Them Honest  series of coverage on the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the flooding that followed with a segment on the Federal Emergency Management Agency s  FEMA  recent reneging on a promise to pay for the relocation of two elementary schools devastated by Hurricane Rita  Peebles Elementary School in Iberia Parish had received assurance months ago that FEMA would pay to move the school out of the floodplain  and Henry Elementary in Vermillion Parish received similar assurances more than a year ago   But when new management arrived at FEMA s New Orleans offices a few weeks ago  the agency reversed course and withdrew both commitments  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   had sent two letters to FEMA Director David Paulison asking him to ensure FEMA keeps its word     This  is a prime example of FEMA s gross mishandling of its mission as it relates to rebuilding and reestablishing schools in the wake of an extraordinary natural disaster as was Hurricane Rita   Sen  Landrieu wrote    Furthermore  FEMA s latest position in these two specific cases actually would encourage school systems to rebuild in flood prone areas which is totally contrary to FEMA s supposed central mission of hazard mitigation I again urge you to take swift and decisive action on this matter so that innocent school children will have a safe  permanent place to get an education as soon as possible   Video of CNN s report is available at
