Landrieu Votes for Corps Reform         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 19 2006    Landrieu Votes for Corps Reform     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   a member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee  today voted to support a pair of amendments to the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  that would substantially reform the Army Corps of Engineers   The amendments  offered by Senators John McCain  R Ariz   and Russ Feingold  D Wisc   would create an independent peer review process to oversee and validate Corps projects  and would establish a better system of prioritization by which future projects would be evaluated     After hurricanes Katrina and Rita  one thing has become abundantly clear to the people of Louisiana  the Corps  process is broken   Sen  Landrieu said   The McCain Feingold reforms will provide improved oversight which is essential to protecting human life  homes and communities   We ve seen what happens when levees don t work   Stronger technical review will help prevent the design flaws that can prove to be so damaging   The proposed prioritization in the McCain Feingold reforms would dramatically increase the weight given to protecting human life in considering flood control and hurricane protection projects  would take a more comprehensive view of economic benefits stemming from navigation projects  and would address priority coastal restoration needs   The peer review process would be concurrent with project planning  and not slow down Corps work   Other elements of the underlying bill would also streamline many projects  allowing for more efficient Congressional approval of Louisiana wetlands restoration and levee projects      Corps projects in Louisiana protect the lives of millions of people and secure our economy as the global trade gateway to America   said Sen  Landrieu    The stakes couldn t be higher   One need only to look at the distribution of funding in this bill  in which Louisiana represents more than 20 percent of the Corps  work  to recognize how important smart planning and management is to our state    The peer review amendment passed  while the prioritization amendment did not  Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe  R Okla   and Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee Chairman Christopher Bond  R Mo   introduced alternatives to the McCain Feingold amendments   However  the Inhofe Bond proposals are significantly more limited   The Inhofe Bond amendments would require far fewer projects to be reviewed  and would limit the scope of the review   They would also not distinguish between storm protection  navigation  and coastal restoration projects in determining prioritization     A vote for this approach would largely have been a vote for more of the same  a status quo that doesn t work   Sen  Landrieu said    The McCain Feingold reforms recognize the uniquely different goals of projects  evaluate them accordingly  and provide a greater level of review and oversight to make sure they are designed  engineered and built right
