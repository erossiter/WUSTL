Landrieu Comments on Anniversary of No Child Left Behind Act         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 08 2007    Landrieu Comments on Anniversary of No Child Left Behind Act Landrieu was a principle author of the education reform law     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement on the fifth anniversary of the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB   Sen  Landrieu   I am proud that five years ago  I worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to craft legislation that encourages public schools to meet new  higher standards in education for all children  including the most disadvantaged  The law demonstrated Congress  commitment to becoming a reliable partner in accomplishing real education reforms benefiting our children    However  since its inception  the No Child Left Behind Act has been chronically underfunded  Making sweeping reforms without giving states the resources they need to implement them is precisely the way that children do get left behind in education  We need to make the necessary investments  to support our nation s children  and I encourage the President to fully fund NCLB in his 2008 budget   As Congress works to reauthorize the program this year  Louisiana should serve as an example of success for its accountability program  which has proven to be one of the best in the nation  providing the incentives and guidance schools need to encourage the educational enrichment of every child
