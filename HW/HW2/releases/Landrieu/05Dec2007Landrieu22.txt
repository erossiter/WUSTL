Landrieu  Stevens Urge FEMA to Ensure Trailer Safety         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 05 2007    Landrieu  Stevens Urge FEMA to Ensure Trailer Safety     WASHINGTON    United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Chairman Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Ranking Member Ted Stevens  R Alaska  today wrote to Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator R  David Paulison to urge the agency to resume testing of temporary housing trailers for excessive levels of formaldehyde   The issue of formaldehyde in trailers has been a significant problem for well over a year   Sens  Landrieu and Stevens wrote    In press releases  Congressional briefings and hearings  and in meetings with our subcommittee staff  FEMA has continually promised to test these trailers  find out the potential health risks to those exposed  and to find a new way forward on disaster housing   In September  FEMA agreed to conduct initial formaldehyde exposure assessments and determine the public health impact of the chemical in the agency s trailers   In early November  however  FEMA announced that it would postpone testing until the agency could finalize how to respond to the results of the testing   This is a startling setback  not only because the individuals who are currently receiving assistance through FEMA s trailer program face an unknown threat from formaldehyde exposure  but also because FEMA has made additional changes to its disaster housing programs in lieu of the impending analysis and testing by CDC   the Senators wrote   The failure of FEMA to test these trailers and to come up with substantive data on the potential health effects on 2005 hurricane season survivors is having a dramatic impact  not only on the individuals working so hard to rebuild their lives through this long recovery process  but also on the nation s ability to respond to housing needs during future disasters or catastrophes   This is precisely the type of  Failure of Initiative   to quote the title of the House Select Committee on Hurricane Katrina report  that led to the disastrous failure of our government to respond to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   the Senators continued  Sens  Landrieu and Stevens asked Administrator Paulison to provide by December 17  2007  the date when FEMA will resume testing the trailers and the agency s plans to remove Gulf Coast residents from unsafe trailers  The full text of the Senators  letter is available
