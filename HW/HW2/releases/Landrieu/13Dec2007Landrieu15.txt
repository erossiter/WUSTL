Landrieu Votes to Protect La  Cotton and Rice Farmers         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 13 2007    Landrieu Votes to Protect La  Cotton and Rice Farmers Pushes for 2007 Farm Bill that doesn t unfairly cap payments     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today helped defeat an amendment to the 2007 Farm Bill that would have capped annual farm payments at  250 000 per couple  endangering southern cotton and rice farmers  The amendment  sponsored by Byron Dorgan  D N D   and Charles Grassley  R Iowa  failed 56 43 because under a Senate agreement  it required 60 votes  Sen  Landrieu spoke against the amendment on the Senate floor  Sen  Landrieu said   I am pleased to come to the floor today to join my colleagues  the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Arkansas  in a strong appeal to our colleagues to vote against the Grassley Dorgan amendment  As Senator Lincoln so eloquently stated  this underlying bill is the single largest reform to the farm program practically in the last two decades  if not forever  We have made significant underlying reforms to try to limit and streamline subsidies and to make it fair  But as the Senator from Alabama said  our rural areas  particularly in the South and Southeast  need this bill to continue to grow and prosper  There are parts of the country that are doing very well  But in rural America  there are still difficulties  We have over 200 000 farmers in Louisiana   I respect the two Senators offering this amendment  They truly are two of the most respected in this Chamber  But I have to say  perhaps it would be easy for me to support an amendment such as this if the crop in my State was getting two or three times the price it once did   The fact is  rice and cotton are not in the best shape  We are being pressed by imports  We have different rules and subsidies  With all due respect to other Senators  corn has done very well lately  A couple of years ago it was selling on the market for  2 10 a bushel  Today the commodities rate is  4 33  So people growing corn are doing very well  I have some of them in my State as well  But because of the ethanol subsidies  because of what we have done on the fuel business  corn is doing well  We are happy for that  But rice  soybeans  and cotton fighting for markets  fighting against unfair trade practices  This amendment will do them great harm   Senator Lincoln has done an excellent job representing Southern farming on the Agriculture Committee  She has  with our support  put forward some reforms to reduce the cost to taxpayers  But we can t do anymore  Asking us to do it is not right  For Georgia and for Alabama and for Louisiana and parts of Texas  this is as far as we can go  I am saying to our farm guys  we help you with subsidies for ethanol  We know farmers growing corn are making a boatload of money  We are happy for that  But we cannot accept this amendment  I urge our colleagues to reject it  Let s move forward together on reform for the taxpayers and for our rural areas   On another note  our sugar farmers have not had a loan increase in 25 years  Now with this administration supporting huge imports from Mexico  we are at a great transitional time for sugar  This is not the time to cut them anymore  For rice farmers  which Senator Lincoln spoke aboutshe is from a rice farming family herself  she most certainly knows what it means to walk the rice rowsthe current this amendment would unfairly penalizes producers of rice  Any further cuts to our rice industry would be detrimental   I am pleased that with Senator Lincoln s assistance  we were able to put in extra help for some of our specialty crops  Sweet potatoes we grow a lot of  and we are proud of that crop and others  But this is not insignificant business  This is billion dollar business  It is important to Louisiana  We need to hold the line with the reform   I urge my colleagues to vote no on Dorgan Grassley  We have given enough from our region  We want to support reforms  We have supported reforms  But enough is enough   I am happy corn is now at  4 33 a bushel  I wish my sugarcane farmers and rice farmers were getting two or three times what they were getting a couple years ago  but they are not  Let s hold the line and vote no on the Grassley Dorgan amendment
