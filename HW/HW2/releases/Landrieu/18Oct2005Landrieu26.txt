Sen  Landrieu Fights For Louisiana Workers         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  October 18  2005    Sen  Landrieu Fights For Louisiana Workers Letter to Chertoff Prompted by Plight of Belle Chase Workers featured on CNN    WASHINGTON    The Department of Homeland Security must adopt a zero tolerance policy for government contractors hiring undocumented workers for Gulf Coast reconstruction  according to a letter sent by U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La today to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff   The use of undocumented workers in federal contracts for hurricane relief comes at the direct expense of hurricane victims   Sen  Landrieu wrote  describing how local workers are locked out of employment opportunities by contractors that circumvent existing labor laws to hire undocumented workers at lower wages    While my state experiences unemployment rates not seen since the Great Depression  it is unconscionable that illegal workers would be brought into Louisiana aggravating our employment crisis and depressing earnings for our workers    The letter cites a recent incident where Louisiana electricians were dismissed from reconstruction efforts at the Belle Chase Naval Air Station and replaced by less skilled  lower wage workers of unclear origin   Some of those unfairly dismissed electricians will be featured tonight on CNN s  Lou Dobbs Tonight   6 00pm ET  5 00pm CT    The workers testified yesterday before a hearing with Sen  Landrieu and other members of the Senate  Sen  Landrieu called upon the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to dispatch an additional team of immigration enforcement officers to the region to help ensure government contractors follow the nation s labor laws and that available jobs go to those residents who have lost their jobs as a result of the hurricanes   Local unemployment has skyrocketed since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita first hit Louisiana  a problem which has only been exacerbated by contractors hiring out of state  undocumented workers     The use of undocumented  illegal workers in the construction industry is a lamentable reality   Sen  Landrieu wrote    However  if press accounts are true  the issue is quickly becoming chronic along the Gulf Coast    I am confident that immediate and rigorous prosecution of these illegal activities would quickly stem this tide      30
