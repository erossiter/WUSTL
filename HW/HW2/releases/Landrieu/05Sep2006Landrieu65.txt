Landrieu Statement on Oil Discovery in Gulf of Mexico         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 05 2006    Landrieu Statement on Oil Discovery in Gulf of Mexico  This is great news for Louisiana s offshore energy industry      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released a statement after Chevron Corp   Statoil ASA of Norway and Devon Energy Corp  of Oklahoma City discovered the possibility of billions of barrels of oil in a deep offshore well off of the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico   The companies  test well sustained a flow rate of more than 6 000 barrels of crude oil per day  Sen  Landrieu said   This is great news for achieving American energy independence  It is especially great news for Louisiana s offshore energy industry and the future of deepwater production  Much of the deepwater exploration and production activity will be operated from ports and land bases in Louisiana such as Port Fourchon  Venice  and Morgan City  This latest development underscores the enormous contribution made by energy production in the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of America  It strengthens our case for the Domenici Landrieu bill  which recently passed the Senate in a bipartisan 71 25 vote  that opens up 8 3 million acres for new energy production in the central part of the Gulf  And it reinforces our cause for offshore revenue sharing with the states    Some geologists have speculated that these mineral rich ridges could extend eastward into the 181 and 181 South area  which would be opened up by the Domenici Landrieu bill  This is another strong indication that this new lease sale area will produce tremendous revenues both for the federal government and  under our revenue sharing proposal  for Louisiana and the other producing coastal states
