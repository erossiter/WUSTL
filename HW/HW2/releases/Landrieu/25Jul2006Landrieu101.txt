FACT CHECK  Anti Drilling Groups Miss Point on Revenue Sharing         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 25 2006    FACT CHECK  Anti Drilling Groups Miss Point on Revenue Sharing     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following summary clarifying facts misrepresented in an advertisement placed in various Washington publications by a consortium of anti drilling groups   With the headline   Big Oil s Next Victims  U S  Budget and Florida Coast   the advertisement was sponsored by the Sierra Club  Greenpeace  U S  PIRG and a dozen other groups opposed to offshore oil and gas revenue sharing  despite the environmental protection it would be funding  The Domenici Landrieu bill  S  3711  would open about 8 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico for new oil and gas production and share a portion of the royalties generated with Gulf Coast states in order to fund coastal restoration and hurricane protection   A procedural vote on the bill is scheduled for 10 a m  Wednesday      THE ADVERTISEMENT   FACT      It s not enough that 80  of the nation s off shore oil and gas reserves are already open to development     Only 20  of the outer continental shelf is currently open to development  with 98  of OCS production occurring in the Gulf of Mexico   Estimates of reserves are revised upwards each year  further decreasing the total proportion of areas open to development       They are pushing to pass S  3711 so they can drill in 8 million acres off the coast of Florida      Off the coast  must be a relative term   Most of the acreage that S  3711 opens to development is more than 200 miles off of the coast of Florida  with no production in Florida waters any closer than 125 miles       S  3711 would also allow Alabama  Louisiana  Mississippi  and Texas to devour  20 billion in federal drilling revenues that belong to all Americans     For decades  Louisiana and Gulf Coast states have assumed all of the burden of producing more than a quarter of the nation s domestic oil and gas  while reaping little reward   Inshore oil and gas producing states receive 50  of revenue generated on federal land   Yet Gulf Coast states continue to receive virtually nothing   This bill ensures that Gulf Coast states will finally get their fair share       President Truman called a similar scheme  robbery in broad daylight      The quote is out of context   President Truman did oppose a proposal to give states 100  of the revenue from offshore drilling  and that s the proposal referred to in the quote   But Truman himself offered coastal oil and gas producing states 37 5  of the oil and gas revenues generated off their coasts    the same percentage as the Domenici Landrieu bill   On May 29  1952  Truman said   The Congress should provide for the disposition of revenues obtained from oil and gas leases on the undersea lands   S J  Res  20   would have granted the adjacent coastal States 37 1 2 percent of the revenues from submerged lands of the marginal sea   I would have no objection to such a provision  which is similar to existing provisions under which the States receive 37 1 2 percent of the revenues from the Federal Government s oil producing public lands within their borders        A major spill is a real possibility  and would devastate Florida s billion dollar coastal economy     Oil spills are far more likely to stem from oil tankers than from offshore oil platforms   In fact  according to the National Academy of Sciences  between 1990 and 1999  33 times more spilled oil came from tankers than platforms  and nearly 17 times more oil seeped naturally from the ocean floor   By reducing the need for imported oil and the tankers that transport it  the Domenici Landrieu bill will actually reduce the likelihood of a spill       Despite industry claims to the contrary  oil drilling operations are very vulnerable to spills after hurricanes     While oil operations are vulnerable after hurricanes  the most vulnerable infrastructure is on land  where pipelines and refineries are already situated   The wetlands that protect this critical infrastructure have been eroding at a rate of a football field every 38 minutes for years    with an area twice the size of Washington  D C   lost to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita alone   The Domenici Landrieu bill would invest in flood control and coastal and wetlands restoration  which will protect this energy infrastructure before  during and after hurricanes  as well as the people who live in the neighboring coastal communities
