Landrieu Vows to Pursue New Strategy in War on Terror Despite Stalled Defense Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 20 2007    Landrieu Vows to Pursue New Strategy in War on Terror Despite Stalled Defense Bill Shreveport Times   Landrieu amendment has merit      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today said she will continue to push for her legislation to refocus the U S  mission in the Middle East on hunting down Osama bin Laden and dismantling the al Qaeda terrorist organization  She had earlier this week introduced the plan as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill  which stalled after a partisan deadlock  Sen  Landrieu said she will again offer elements of the proposal as an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that is scheduled to be on the Senate floor before the August recess   Calling it an  idea of merit   The Shreveport Times today editorialized in favor of Sen  Landrieu s strategy   From a military standpoint  search and destroy in Afghanistan would have to be a more natural mission for our ground soldiers than acting as human duct tape on a fragmented Iraq   the paper wrote   Sen  Landrieu s proposal states that  it shall be the policy of the United States Government that the foremost objective of the United States in the Global War on Terrorism is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri and other leaders of al Qaeda  and to dismantle the al Qaeda network   The defense amendment also repositions U S  troops from Iraq to Afghanistan to root out and combat al Qaeda forces and authorizes  3 6 billion for counter terror programs in the region   I thank the Shreveport Times for their strong support of my amendment   Sen  Landrieu said   For too long we have prioritized policing a civil war in Iraq and drawn resources away from defeating the agents of terror who attacked us  We need to focus our efforts anew on the terrorist network that orchestrated the devastating Sept  11 attacks  and that terrorist leadership is flourishing in Afghanistan and Pakistan   The Shreveport Times said the legislation was a  responsible and politically palatable alternative to the standard stay the course and cut and run rhetoric   Among the provisions the paper supported was Sen  Landrieu s move to reestablish the CIA s Alec Station  which was aborted in 2006 after the Bush Administration determined that bin Laden no longer posed a threat to the United States   However  the National Intelligence Estimate issued July 17 said al Qaeda remains today the most dangerous threat to the United States  Consistent with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group  the Landrieu proposal to the defense bill boosts support for Afghan Security Forces and NATO forces in Afghanistan and increases to the security cooperation inside Pakistan  It also adds funding for translators and translation technologies  drug interdiction and counter drug activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan  and operations to secure the Pakistani and Iranian borders  As the U S  draws down combat forces in Iraq  the Landrieu amendment would limit the mission of remaining combat troops to protecting U S  and Coalition personnel and infrastructure  training  equipping and providing logistical support for the Iraqi Security Forces  and conducting targeted counter terrorism operations   Combat resources could then be repositioned as needed to support the bolstered mission of Operation Enduring Freedom and the NATO International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan  Under the Landrieu plan  every unit deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan would be required to meet the baseline C 1 readiness standard  Units would not be permitted to deploy without the proper training and full complement of equipment required for their specific mission   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill offers another opportunity in the immediate future to direct American resources and strength to defeating the biggest  most dangerous threat to our homeland  Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terror network   Sen  Landrieu said  The text of the Shreveport Times editorial may be read here
