Landrieu Comments on German Steel Mill Decision         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 11 2007    Landrieu Comments on German Steel Mill Decision     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding the decision by German steel manufacturer ThyssenKrupp AG to site a new  3 7 billion  2 700 employee steel mill in Alabama   The other site in final consideration had been on the banks of the Mississippi River in St  James Parish  La   near Convent  La  Sen  Landrieu said   It is a disappointment that ThyssenKrupp chose not to build their new mill in St  James Parish  La   where the long standing industrial base and direct access to the Mississippi River has continued to provide an excellent hub for manufacturing and trade   However  it is at the same time encouraging  because out of all the communities competing nationwide  Louisiana s strong presentation positioned our state among the top two finalists  That we came so far in the process  and so close to winning it  is a testament to the strength of the package put together by the Governor  the Legislature and Parish President Dale Hymel    There are already other international companies that have expressed interest in both the St  James site and the northeast Louisiana megasite  We need to continue to work together and put our absolute best  most competitive foot forward in every effort to secure these and other investments   The ports of south Louisiana export more than any other port system in the United States  and form one of America s strongest gateways to global commerce   I continue to be in direct contact with the German government and representatives of other nations as we develop the international partnerships to further cement Louisiana s long standing strength in the world economy
