Sen  Landrieu Calls for End to Delays in Reauthorization of Voting Rights Act         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 23 2006    Sen  Landrieu Calls for End to Delays in Reauthorization of Voting Rights Act     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement after division among Republicans in the House of Representatives this week delayed the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  which is set to expire next year     Sen  Landrieu said   The Voting Rights Act extends to all Americans our most basic of democratic rights regardless of race   The argument of some Republican House members that the bill s protections are no longer needed is not correct and their attempts to delay this legislation should be resisted     Enormous progress has been made since this law was passed 41 years ago  but continued vigilance is needed to ensure that voting rights for all Americans are never infringed upon by any means  direct or indirect  As recently as 2001  for example  local officials in Kilmichael  Mississippi  canceled elections out of fears that an African American mayor might be elected   But under the Voting Rights Act  the Justice Department intervened to ensure that the right to vote was protected  and two years later  Kilmichael elected its first African American mayor   The People of Louisiana understand that the Voting Rights Act marks a vital turning point in the long march of American liberty   The bill helped to close an ugly chapter of hate and intolerance chapter in our state  and throughout the nation   The signal that the House of Representatives sent the American people is that we are moving backward in a partisan fashion  when our country could be moving forward  together
