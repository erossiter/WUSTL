Sen  Landrieu Comments on Iraq Study Group Report         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 06 2006    Sen  Landrieu Comments on Iraq Study Group Report     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary  L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding the report issued this morning by the Iraq Study Group  Sen  Landrieu said   Under the leadership of James Baker and Lee Hamilton  the Iraq Study Group has contributed a much needed bipartisan approach and open minded thinking to the debate over the direction of the war in Iraq   As the commission so rightly notes  there is no magic formula to solving the problems that continue to plague the current strategy and management of the war   While not a complete answer on its own  this report may represent the most significant step forward in many months    but only if we show the will and bipartisan cooperation to heed its call    It s time to set partisan politics and slick slogans aside and use this opportunity to make a serious reassessment of our Iraq strategy  I pledge to work in this spirit  and urge all our leaders to do the same as we draw upon the study group s counsel and the wisdom of our generals and others to forge a lasting peace in Iraq and bring our troops home
