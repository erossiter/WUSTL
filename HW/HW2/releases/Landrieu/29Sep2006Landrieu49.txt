Landrieu Comments on Status of Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 29 2006    Landrieu Comments on Status of Oil and Gas Revenue Sharing Bill  Committed to leading the effort again in the  lame duck  session      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary Landrieu  D La   commented today after talks reached an impasse in achieving a compromise between Senate and House energy production and revenue sharing legislation   Despite hundreds of hours of meetings and conversations during the last week  a final agreement on passage of a Gulf Coast energy and revenue sharing bill slipped out of reach   Sen  Landrieu said   With Senators Frist  Reid  Domenici  Lott and Martinez  I remain committed to leading the effort again in the  lame duck  session that begins November 13    I am hopeful that the compelling case presented by a new national energy supply drawn from Lease Areas 181 and 181 South will motivate House negotiators to move away from their Atlantic drilling strategy and toward the Gulf Coast approach already embraced by the Senate and the President   The lease areas opened by S  3711  the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  are projected to produce enough natural gas alone to fuel one thousand chemical plants for 40 years  or sustain the needs of every iron and steel mill in the United States for 14 years  Alternatively  this supply could meet the residential natural gas needs of Pennsylvania for 24 years  New York for 14  Florida for nine  or North Carolina for 204 years  Sen  Landrieu also today introduced S  3985  the Outer Continental Shelf Royalty Reform and Enhancement Act    a bill to demonstrate to her Senate colleagues a roadmap to compromise on the recovery of  10 billion in back lease payments lost due to a bureaucratic error in 1998 and 1999  A copy of the bill is available    She said that she believed Senate support could be built for legislation to open areas off the Virgina coast to natural gas drilling  so long as the compromise could be crafted with the support of senators from the neighboring states  For much of this week  House insistence on opening the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling stood in the way of deal making  Today  Sen  Landrieu said  most major issues were either resolved or brought close enough that negotiators believed compromise was achievable  The remaining obstacles stem from a House demand that new state maritime boundaries be established for the entire nation  rewarding Atlantic states perceived to be persuadable on drilling issues with proportionately larger tracts than less inclined states  The map has been met with wide opposition by coastal senators who were not involved in the House s redrawing of their state boundaries  The House map would also create new boundaries for the Gulf of Mexico  locating Lease Area 181 in Mississippi and Alabama waters  rendering Louisiana ineligible for much of the near term revenues that would be generated  Despite a factually inaccurate statement by House members referring to  boundary lines from the original Senate bill   the Domenici Landrieu bill  in fact  draws no map lines whatsoever  It relies instead on a mathematical formula crafted by Gulf Coast senators to distribute shared revenues   The Senate approach creates cooperation between the Gulf Coast states by sharing all the revenues  rather than placing us in a competitive posture with arbitrary lines on a map   Sen  Landrieu said
