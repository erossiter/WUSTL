Landrieu Secures  3 Billion for Road Home Program         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 06 2007    Landrieu Secures  3 Billion for Road Home Program Rebuilding funds help cover all Katrina  and Rita affected Louisiana homeowners with wind or water damage     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today announced that congressional negotiators have agreed to provide an additional  3 billion for Louisiana s Road Home program in a pending defense bill   Sen  Landrieu worked closely with Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd  D W V   Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Patty Murray  D Wash   and other committee colleagues to secure the funds  which help close an estimated  3 to 4 5 billion shortfall in the post hurricane housing rebuilding program   This support for the Road Home is an encouraging reflection of Congress  commitment to fully funding Louisiana s rebuilding from the 2005 hurricanes and levee failures   said Sen  Landrieu    It is a shot in the arm for our recovery  and with the holidays approaching  provides much needed peace of mind to those fearing the Road Home would be closed to them    A fundamental key to the recovery of the Gulf Coast is ensuring Louisiana s homeowners the availability of resources they need to rebuild their homes and communities   Chairman Byrd said    The Road Home program is an example of the many steps Congress is taking to help the region through its long term recovery  The people of Louisiana have a strong champion in Senator Landrieu  and I remain committed to working with her to restore the Gulf Coast    The delivery of these critical dollars means a renewed commitment to bringing people home and bringing vitality back to the state Louisiana   We all know that housing is the critical first step to the regrowth and renewal of any community   said Sen  Murray  a member of the Senate Democratic Leadership    I am pleased to have worked with Senator Landrieu on this critical issue   this victory would not have been possible without her passion and commitment to the people of Louisiana   The Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Conference Report  a compromise between funding bills passed by the Senate and House of Representatives earlier this year  now returns to the floor to be passed in each chamber before going to the President for his signature   However  congressional Republicans have indicated that they may attempt to block the legislation on the floor   Senators Byrd and Murray and the Senate Leadership have been essential partners in this effort  standing with Louisiana and the hundreds of thousands of homeowners who need our support   Sen  Landrieu said    I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to follow this example  and allow this vital measure to move forward by rejecting the partisanship that has entangled past hurricane recovery efforts   This funding will help Louisiana fully implement the Road Home program by continuing to cover both water and wind damage resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005   While Bush Administration officials have recently blamed the inclusion of wind damaged homes for the program s shortfall  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  originally approved coverage when the Road Home was first developed   Without this coverage  thousands of Rita affected homeowners would be left out of the rebuilding program  An additional  1 17 billion could be made available to the program by providing greater flexibility for the state s use of Hazard Mitigation Grant Program  HMGP  funds   Responding to pressure from Sen  Landrieu and the media  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  has taken steps to make these funds available administratively    The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in August passed the SMART RESPONSE Act  introduced by Sen  Landrieu  which would specifically allow the  1 17 billion in HMGP funds to be used for the Road Home   That bill is pending floor action   Today s agreement is a major step forward  but there is still much work left to do   Sen  Landrieu said   I will continue to fight to ensure that every penny due Louisiana s recovery is made available  and not trapped behind partisan games or federal bureaucracy   The Road Home program was developed after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and the Louisiana Recovery Authority  LRA  in negotiations with the White House and Gulf Coast Recovery Coordinator Donald Powell  It provides rebuilding grants of up to  150 000 per home and was funded through  8 1 billion in federal Community Development Block Grants provided by emergency supplemental appropriations bills     This money is vital to giving our citizens the resources they need to rebuild   Governor Blanco said    Now is not a time for partisanship   The people of Louisiana need our Delegation in Washington to stand together and fight for their people   I applaud Senator Landrieu s continued efforts  the Congressional Leadership has committed to meeting our ongoing recovery needs and I ask that Congress join this effort to deliver on this federal promise    Senator Landrieu has given us another reason to be grateful this Thanksgiving   said Dr  Norman C  Francis  Chairman of the Louisiana Recovery Authority    We have been blessed by the support we ve received from the American people and their representatives in Congress  and this announcement to ensure that all of our families can rebuild their homes and their lives couldn t have come at a better time or season   On behalf of all Louisianians  we again offer our heartfelt appreciation for having another reason to express our gratitude this holiday   The Republican controlled Congress in 2005 and 2006 capped Louisiana s share of the federal funding at 54 percent  despite having endured more than 70 percent of the disaster s damage    As of October 25  a total of 185 895 applications to the Road Home had been recorded  with an average of  67 358 having been disbursed to 66 314 homeowners
