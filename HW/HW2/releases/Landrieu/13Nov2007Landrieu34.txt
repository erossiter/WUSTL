Road Home Funding Signed by President         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 13 2007    Road Home Funding Signed by President Bill includes  5 billion for Road Home  La  Defense Projects    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on President Bush s signing this morning of the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Act   Last week  Sen  Landrieu worked to negotiate with other Senators  3 billion in the bill to help close the funding shortfall in Louisiana s Road Home housing recovery program    The defense bill  passed Thursday as part of Louisiana s   12 Billion Day   also includes  2 billion in defense related Louisiana projects and passed after Congress successfully overrode the President s veto of the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA    That bill authorizes  7 billion for Louisiana coastal protection projects and secures avenues of commerce throughout the state  Sen  Landrieu said   The President s signature on this bill caps Louisiana s historic  12 billion day in Congress last week   It means no more waiting  no more worrying what will happen with this vital funding   It is now law  and provides much needed peace of mind to thousands of homeowners who were starting the holiday season unsure of whether the Road Home would be there for them   This funding does not completely address the Road Home shortfall  nor many of the other challenges we face in our continued recovery   But it is a significant step forward in all of these efforts   I met today with Governor Blanco and Governor elect Jindal as we thanked many of my Senate colleagues for their support and laid out the challenges that remain for the future   This is a time of transition  but there will be no change in our resolve and commitment   As I said to Governor elect Jindal on Election Night    Louisiana s fights are our fights  and we will fight them together
