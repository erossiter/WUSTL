Sen  Landrieu Statement On The Retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O Connor         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 01 2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement On The Retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O Connor     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   issued the following statement today regarding the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O Connor   From the day she became the first woman to sit on the United States Supreme Court  Sandra Day O Connor has been an inspiration for millions of Americans  particularly for women and girls   Throughout 24 years of service  Justice O Connor has proven herself to be one of our nation s leading legal scholars  consistently putting the rule of law ahead of politics   Finding a suitable successor to such a dedicated jurist is a heavy task indeed   To protect the rights and liberties of all Americans  there is perhaps no more important decision a president makes than nominating a Justice to the Supreme Court    I strongly urge President Bush to rise above partisan politics and reach out to Senators from both parties as he selects a nominee to succeed Justice O Connor   Regardless of party affiliation  Senators must all weigh nominations carefully and consciously   I will continue working with Senators from both sides of the aisle to ensure that the next member of the Supreme Court will uphold the rights of the American people and base his or her decisions on the law and the Constitution    not political ideology      I look forward to working with President Bush and my colleagues in the Senate at this historic time
