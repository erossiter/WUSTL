 Secret  Senators Block Landrieu Hurricane Recovery Fairness Amendments as 9 11 Bill Passes         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 13 2007     Secret  Senators Block Landrieu Hurricane Recovery Fairness Amendments as 9 11 Bill Passes Democratic leaders vow inclusion in upcoming bill     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate today passed the 9 11 Commission bill  S  4  by a 60 to 38 vote  but without the inclusion of two amendments  secretly blocked by senators identified only as Republicans  that would right hurricane recovery funding rules unfair to Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states     The people of Louisiana sought just one thing in these amendments  fairness   said Sen  Landrieu  the author of the amendments    We asked our federal government to stand up  meet its responsibility and give us the same opportunities to recover as are afforded every other state   Instead  such fairness was cast aside by obstructionist politics  with some senators blocking so much as an up or down vote on these measures without even coming to the floor to identify themselves publicly or defend their actions   Such tactics are shameful  and are not what the American people elected us to come here to do   In meetings last week with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   and today with Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd  R W V   Sen  Landrieu has secured commitments to include the blocked measures in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill the Senate is expected to debate later this month   Leaders in the House of Representatives have said the measures will also be included in their version of the bill as well   Senators Reid and Byrd have assured me that we will get the job done in the next few weeks on the Supplemental Bill instead  where the process will be far more favorable to blunting obstructionist politics and doing what is right for the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast   Sen  Landrieu said  The final bill did  however  include an amendment by Sen  Landrieu to extend the designation of  critical national infrastructure  to the 15 000 miles of levees that protect lives and communities across America   The amendment  which passed unanimously  requires the Department of Homeland Security to consider the risk of levee targeted terrorist attacks and to take steps to ensure their protection  especially in densely populated  low lying areas   The Fair Assistance in Recovery Funding Amendment  S  Amdt  295 The FAIR Funding Amendment  for which secretly unidentified Republican senators objected to holding an up or down vote  would have waived for Hurricanes Katrina   Rita  and Wilma affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  With local tax bases devastated by the hurricanes and the provision s excessive paperwork requirements for each of the 23 000 public assistance projects in Louisiana alone  the match has become a significant obstacle to Gulf Coast recovery     This essential waiver could be accomplished with a single stroke of the President s pen  but it hasn t been   Sen  Landrieu said   Because the Administration has not acted  Congress now has the responsibility to   Our communities need this fair  fighting chance to tear up the red tape and rebuild the roads and bridges and houses and schools that need rebuilding   President Bush has the authority to waive the onerous requirement without legislation when per capita rebuilding costs become excessive    a presidential authority that has been exercised 32 times since 1985  In 1992  President George H  W  Bush waived the requirement when the per capita recovery cost of Hurricane Andrew reached  139  It was also waived for New York City following the attacks of September 11th  where the per capita cost totaled  390  But despite a  6 700 per capita recovery cost following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the Administration has thus far refused repeated requests for such a waiver  prompting Sen  Landrieu s efforts to waive the requirement legislatively  The Disaster Loan Fairness Amendment  S  Amdt  296 The Disaster Loan Fairness Amendment would have made Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness made available to all other disaster stricken communities  The Stafford Act has historically required forgiveness of such loans when independent audits determine the fiscal recovery of affected local communities is insufficient to repay the loans after a three year grace period   Shortly after the hurricanes  Sen  Landrieu proposed making  1 billion in unspent FEMA funds available for Community Disaster Loans under the same terms as had been afforded to other communities   But the version that was passed in October 2005  sponsored by Senators David Vitter  R La   and Bill Frist  R Tenn   specifically prohibited the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities were unable to pay them back   This was the first time in American history that loan forgiveness was excluded as an option for qualifying local governments  and the prohibition was specific to Katrina affected states  not any future loans outside the Gulf Coast    We are not seeking special treatment   Sen  Landrieu said    We are not asking for loans to be automatically canceled   This amendment would simply make the same repayment options available to Gulf Coast states as have been and will be afforded to all other disaster stricken communities nationwide    Sen  Judd Gregg  R N H   the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  this week opposed language in the Landrieu amendment that would have made Louisiana eligible for the same terms as every other state by striking the phrase  such loans may not be canceled  from the 2005 law   In its place  Gregg and other Senate Republicans argued for alternate language which would keep the restriction in place  but would allow FEMA to recover unpaid Community Disaster Loans with money from its Disaster Relief Fund  DRF     This solution would move funds away from other disaster recovery needs around the country  and there would be no guarantee that the funds in the DRF would be sufficient at the time they were needed    The hard working taxpayers whose communities were devastated by hurricanes Katrina and Rita should not be asked to accept a lower standard than any other American   Sen  Landrieu said    This requires a simple  one sentence change    not a Washington shell game
