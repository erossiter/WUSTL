Landrieu Asks Justice Dept  to Investigate Corps Pump Contract  Tells GAO   Keep Digging          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 08 07    Landrieu Asks Justice Dept  to Investigate Corps Pump Contract  Tells GAO   Keep Digging  Independent Corps report finds contract improprieties  technical failures     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to the Justice Department asking for an investigation into the Army Corps of Engineers 2006 contract with Moving Water Industries  MWI  to provide pumps for New Orleans drainage canals  An independent report commissioned by the Corps and released today found that MWI did not test the pumps in accordance with their contract  and that much of the documentation between the company and the Corps is missing  leaving the government vulnerable to contract claims by MWI     I respectfully request that the United States Department of Justice conduct a full investigation into the charges of misconduct in the contract administration between the Corps of Engineers and Moving Water Industries   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter to Attorney General Alberto R  Gonzales   Due to the severity of the situation  it is necessary for the Department of Justice to further examine the contracting process and hold the Army Corps of Engineers to the highest standards   The report was written by an independent team of Corps engineers from outside the Vicksburg Division   Reduced reliability increased the risk to public safety   the report stated  The Corps report determined that MWI deviated from the contract  and in some instances it appears that MWI independently changed elements of the contact    This testing was not performed in accordance with the contract requirements and a significant credit is due to the government for the nonperformance of it   the report states   It actually appears in certain circumstances as if the contractor himself developed the scope of work for the change order along with the pricing   The report also found that  key elements  of contract documents were missing and as such   further investigation  is needed  Among the missing documents are  the government s request for proposal  price  and cost analysis  technical analysis  price negotiation reasonableness memorandums  independent government estimates  price negotiations  and negotiation meeting notes   Any lack of proper documentation leaves the government open to potential contract claims that would be difficult to defend   the report says   The government must be able to defend its position on contractual actions if MWI makes any allegations seeking additional monetary compensation due to this contract   In a preliminary report released May 29 at Sen  Landrieu s request  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that the Corps was hasty in installing pumps in New Orleans drainage canals before the 2006 hurricane season despite warnings of factory tested problems and having no comprehensive test plan  The GAO said it did not find any instances of fraud or impropriety  However  the Corps  internal investigation team  which did today identify potential impropriety  did so after having been provided greater access to sources and evidence   This report demonstrates that with greater investigatory access comes a greater understanding of the facts  and the GAO must keep digging to ensure that Congress and the people of New Orleans have the truth   Sen  Landrieu said   While it was very important to release some findings prior to the start of the 2007 hurricane season  I asked the GAO last month to incorporate this expected report and other subsequent information turned up into the final  blue cover  version anticipated later this year   The independent Corps report also places a high priority on having certified hydraulic systems inspector review the piping system to certify that the current pump system is safe to operate  The Corps must then incorporate any additional operating requirements determined by the inspector   The proper functioning of the canal pumps is crucial to the safety and flood protection of New Orleans   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter to Gonzales   In addition to the contracting misdeeds  I find it gravely troubling that the independent report cited 10 instances of catastrophic failure  as well as several other minor failures of the hydraulic oil pumps  As we enter the 2007 hurricane season  it is imperative that New Orleans be equipped with adequate pumping capability  The report said that in 2006  the  pumps would not have performed as designed  due to deficiencies that include  Personnel was not on the platform to start operation of the pump equipment  which can cause irreversible damage to the hydraulic oil pumps  The pumps experienced hydraulic pulsation during operation that could have led to motor failure  The pumps did not meet the anticipated speed when operating at the maximum rpm  which reduced discharge capacity  The welding of pumping equipment was found to be faulty  and if the welds failed  it could have shut down the equipment   Perhaps the Corps  biggest mistake was not being up front with the public about the ineffective pumping operation in the New Orleans region during the 2006 hurricane season   Sen  Landrieu said   They led us to believe we were safe  They knew we were not   A copy of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available   A copy of the independent report is available
