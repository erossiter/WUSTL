Former Speaker Gingrich Urges House to Pass Domenici Landrieu Gulf Energy Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 04 2006    Former Speaker Gingrich Urges House to Pass Domenici Landrieu Gulf Energy Bill Column appears in today s Washington Times     WASHINGTON    Former United States Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich today urged the House of Representatives to pass the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  which would open additional territory in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling and share revenues with energy producing Gulf states  The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House tomorrow during the final lame duck session of the 109th Congress   Congress must act to provide the infrastructure necessary to prevent a Katrina scale disaster from ever reoccurring along the Gulf Coast while providing for our growing energy needs   Speaker Gingrich wrote in his column titled  An important first step   which appeared in today s Washington Times  The Domenici Landrieu bill would open 8 3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to new oil and gas production and share 37 5 percent of the revenues with Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama and Texas  The money would be dedicated to coastal restoration  hurricane protection and flood control projects  Another 12 5 percent of the revenues would go to the state side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund  benefiting all 50 states  The Senate passed the bill with a bipartisan 71 to 25 vote in August   Speaker Gingrich effectively lays out the case for the Domenici Landrieu bill   Sen  Landrieu said   The bill reduces our reliance on foreign energy sources and helps Louisiana restore the wetlands fast disappearing into the Gulf of Mexico  build stronger levees and construct comprehensive flood control  I am optimistic that Speaker Gingrich s position on this issue will help spur the bicameral  bipartisan support we need to pass this bill  which is good for the Gulf Coast and good for the nation    In his column  Speaker Gingrich said the bill would correct an inequity between inland energy producing states  which receive 50 percent of the revenues from production within their borders  and coastal states that receive none of the proceeds from energy generated off their shores   The Domenici Landrieu bill also gives the coastal states a fairer deal on offshore drilling   Speaker Gingrich wrote   Speaker Gingrich said it was important to make progress on additional energy production now  rather than waiting for momentum on a bill passed by the House earlier this year  which would lift the long stand moratorium on drilling along the East and West Coasts   Instead of holding out for an impossible bill  the House Republicans would be wise to see the Senate bill as an important first step toward energy self sufficiency through expanded offshore oil and gas production  disaster prevention and ecological restoration   The full text of today s column is available
