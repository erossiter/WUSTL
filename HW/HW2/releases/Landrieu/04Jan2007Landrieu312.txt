Landrieu Introduces  Road Home  Taxation Fix         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 04 2007    Landrieu Introduces  Road Home  Taxation Fix     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced legislation in the United States Senate that protects Louisiana homeowners from federal taxation on rebuilding grants received under the  Road Home  program following hurricanes Katrina and Rita    The bill rights a circumstance under which homeowners who claimed a casualty loss deduction on their 2005 federal income tax return have been required to pay the money back to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  upon receiving a rebuilding grant   Congress had passed legislation immediately following the hurricanes easing restrictions on the rules for such deductions   Congress encouraged people to take the new deduction by changing the law   Sen  Landrieu said    Now the IRS wants to take it back from the many taxpayers who chose this option   Casualty loss deductions are routinely taken when a home has been damaged by fire or other tragic destruction  and are normally reduced by the amount of any insurance payments or other expected financial recovery   In fact  at the time the taxpayer makes the deduction  he or she is supposed to reduce the amount of the loss by any insurance recovery they reasonably expect to receive   If a homeowner receives a larger payment than what was expected  they are required to claim it on their next income tax return and reimburse the federal government for the excess deduction  Applying these rules to  Road Home  rebuilding grants  however  has the effect of taxing homeowners who choose to rebuild   If a homeowner took the casualty loss on their 2005 return  and then received a  150 000 Road Home payment to rebuild their home  for example  they would face a tax consequence   But if the homeowner instead sold the house to the Louisiana Recovery Authority for the  150 000 payment  the transaction would be considered a home sale and not subject to repaying the deduction     The problem is that this policy will encourage people to leave Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said    The Road Home will become the Road Out   The legislation introduced today would direct the IRS to disregard  Road Home  payments when determining whether a taxpayer should pay the amount they had previously deducted from their taxes   We should not put road blocks on the Road Home   Sen  Landrieu said    This legislation clears this obstruction and clarifies that Road Home payments are not to be taxed   The hurricanes in 2005 were remarkable events causing unprecedented damage   As Congress has done in the past  we must respond in equally unprecedented and innovative ways
