Senate Passes Landrieu Provision to Protect Turtle Farmers          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 08 2007    Senate Passes Landrieu Provision to Protect Turtle Farmers      WASHINGTON    In a 93 1 vote  the United States Senate today passed S  1082  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Revitalization Act  which includes a key amendment offered by U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   that would lift the current ban on the sale of baby turtles in the United States  In 1975  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  banned turtle farmers from selling turtle eggs and turtles fewer than four inches in length to protect pet owners from salmonella   A provision in Sen  Landrieu s amendment would require all turtles sold to be treated for salmonella  providing for the safe sale of turtles as pets   It would also require the dissemination of literature regarding risks involved with salmonella in turtles and how to properly protect turtle owners and children   My amendment frees Louisiana s turtle farmers from outdated FDA regulations that have crippled them for more than 30 years   Sen  Landrieu said    This is a great success for our agriculture industry  and I am proud that I could work with the Senate leadership to get this key provision passed   I urge the House to follow the Senate and pass this legislation so that the President can sign it and our farmers can have the freedom they need to provide safe and healthy turtles to America s children and families   In response to the salmonella threat in turtles  scientists at Louisiana State University developed the Siebling method to make turtles and turtle eggs free from the disease  Sen  Landrieu s amendment requires that every turtle sold be treated using the Siebling or similar technique   The amendment also requires that states in which turtles are raised issue a certificate of sanitization signed by a federally certified veterinarian to assure that the turtles have been treated for salmonella poisoning    Snakes  iguanas  geckos  frogs and other amphibians and reptiles also carry salmonella but the FDA does not ban them from being sold in the U S   nor does the FDA require that they be treated for salmonella before purchase  There are approximately 78 turtle farmers in Louisiana  comprising a  9 4 million industry  This amendment builds on the success of similar stand alone legislation that Sen  Landrieu introduced with Sen  David Vitter  R La   earlier this year
