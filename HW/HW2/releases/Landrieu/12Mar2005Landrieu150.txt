Sen  Landrieu Comments on the President s Planto Privatize Social Security         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 12 2005    Sen  Landrieu Comments on the President s Planto Privatize Social Security  We have come a long way  But we still have a long way to go  Originally published in The Shreveport Times     Some of the seeds of Social Security were sown by the people of Louisiana themselves  In 1934  Sen  Huey P  Long introduced his plan to make  Every Man a King   In expressing his intent to provide a  30 pension to everyone over 60  he said   something must be done for our old people who work out their lives  feed and clothe their children  and are left penniless in their declining years   And so  spurred on by citizens right here in Louisiana  he planted the seeds for Social Security in fertile soil of a nation desperate for certainty  weary of risk  and in great need of economic reform  The president has described Social Security as  flat bust  and  bankrupt   But that is not what the Congressional Budget Office or the Board of Trustees for Social Security tells us  According to a nonpartisan group of CBO economic analysts  the system as it is will remain solvent for 47 years into the future    when President Bush will be 106 years old  There is a problem on the horizon  however  and the beneficial part of the president s call for privatization is that it has riveted the nation s attention on Social Security at a time when incremental steps taken today could have significant payoffs in the future  But the president s plan is too narrowly focused and creates too much risk by betting hard earned savings on an ever changing stock market when we should be working to add certainty and stability to the system  We in Louisiana understand strong retirement security  In this state 125 000 retirees receive benefits from one of our 20 public retirement systems  separate and apart from Social Security  This year alone  2 8 million workers in our state will make investments in their future through Social Security contributions  private pension plans  public pension plans and private options involving 401 k s or IRAs  We know that we must expand opportunities for retirement saving  but we must not undermine this worthy effort with a flawed privatization scheme that takes the  security  out of  Social Security   We should instead follow the example of President Reagan and Senators Dole and Moynihan in 1983  With a few adjustments  and by putting the certainty and stability of the system ahead of radical change  they were able to not only save the program  but to generate surpluses that continue to this day  In the words of the grand architect of the Social Security program  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt   We have come a long way  But we still have a long way to go
