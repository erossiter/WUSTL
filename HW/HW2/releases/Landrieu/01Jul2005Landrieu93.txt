Sen  Landrieu Floor Statement On The Retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O Connor         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 01 2005    Sen  Landrieu Floor Statement On The Retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O Connor     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   gave the following statement today to the Congressional Record regarding the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O Connor and the upcoming judicial nomination process   Last month  Senator Landrieu was part of the group of 14 Senators that brokered a compromise on judicial nominations   Mr  President  from the day she became the first woman to sit on the United States Supreme Court  Sandra Day O Connor has been an inspiration for millions of Americans  particularly for women and girls   I know this is true because she inspired me     I was a young woman in my twenties serving in the Louisiana State Legislature when Justice O Connor was appointed to the Supreme Court  and I remember that day very clearly   I always knew I wanted to serve the people of my country  and on that day I realized that there was no limit to what one woman could do   And today  24 years later  I am a woman standing on the floor of the United States Senate and the number of women in the Louisiana State Legislature has grown from 2 to 24   We all owe a great debt to pioneers like Sandra Day O Connor who the broke the judicial glass ceiling and paved the way for me and for millions of other women     But O Connor s legacy is not limited to the barriers she broke   Throughout her 24 years of service  Justice O Connor has proven herself to be one of our nation s leading legal scholars  consistently putting the rule of law ahead of politics   She has been a champion of the law  a champion for our rights  and a champion for our country      Finding an appropriate successor to such a dedicated jurist is a heavy task indeed   To protect the rights and liberties of all Americans  there is perhaps no more important decision a president makes than nominating a Justice to the Supreme Court    I strongly urge President Bush to rise above the partisan politics that have gripped recent judicial confirmations and to reach out to both Republican and Democratic Senators as he selects a nominee to succeed Justice O Connor   It is the Senate s constitutional duty to provide  Advice and Consent    To provide real advice and to grant real consent  every single Senator must weigh the nomination carefully and consciously     Senators from both sides of the aisle must come together to ensure that the next member of the Supreme Court will uphold the rights of the American people and base his or her decisions on the law and the Constitution    not on political ideology      I hope President Bush will join us in this partnership and allow us to provide real advice at this historic time     Working together  I am confident that we can find a suitable Justice who will follow the great precedent of Sandra Day O Connor
