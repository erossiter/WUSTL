Landrieu to FEMA  Trailers Unsafe for Your Employees  but Good Enough for Storm Victims           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 07 2007    Landrieu to FEMA  Trailers Unsafe for Your Employees  but Good Enough for Storm Victims       WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on internal FEMA emails  as reported this evening by the CBS Evening News  that reveal the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  will not allow their own employees to enter FEMA trailers despite insisting they are safe for residents  She also commented on the FEMA decision to delay the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  from testing FEMA trailers for formaldehyde   Press accounts and congressional inquiries have revealed that FEMA knowingly let storm victims from the 2005 hurricanes move into FEMA trailers with formaldehyde  a carcinogen  in the flooring  cabinetry and wallboard  When the stories of residents getting severely sick made national news  the agency listened to the call of residents and members of Congress and moved to have the CDC test the air quality of trailers  But just before testing was scheduled to begin  FEMA yesterday decided to postpone the CDC from revealing to the public the prevalence of formaldehyde in trailers  FEMA said it has no plan for how to deal with the information once it s revealed   Tonight s CBS Evening News report exposes internal FEMA emails forbidding FEMA employees from entering trailers because of formaldehyde fumes   The particularly dangerous trailers  according to FEMA emails  are those sitting in the sun where the heat may have released high levels of the toxic fumes  While the trailers are too unsafe  FEMA says  for brief visits by their own employees for repair work  they still house two years after the storms nearly 50 000 people in Louisiana and Mississippi  This double standard is wholly unacceptable   Also very troubling is FEMA s decision to halt the CDC s testing  Storm victims are suffering from the health effects of formaldehyde exposure while the agency  fully aware of the danger reflected in its own employee policy  is blocking public scrutiny of the extent of the carcinogen in these trailers  It turns out the agency has no idea what it would do with the information once it s compiled   These are more sad examples of ineptitude by the broken agency  As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  I will use my jurisdiction over FEMA to press forward with the agency s reform  We need a swift  effective and smart agency with flexibility in its response    not an agency that knowingly leaves American disaster victims exposed to a whole new nightmare from the walls of their FEMA built temporary homes    Sen  Landrieu in July added an amendment to the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations bill that requires FEMA Director R  David Paulison to conduct a study of the amount and risk of formaldehyde in FEMA trailers used for temporary housing after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  In May  Sen  Landrieu sent a letter to Paulison seeking an explanation for the high levels of formaldehyde discovered in FEMA trailers
