Sen  Landrieu Optimistic Coastal Funds Will Be in Energy Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 18 2005    Sen  Landrieu Optimistic Coastal Funds Will Be in Energy Bill     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   said today that she was optimistic about Louisiana s potential for coastal restoration funding in the energy bill currently being marked up by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee   Her remarks follow a productive meeting yesterday with Sen  David Vitter  R La   and Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   in which the chairman reaffirmed his support for elements of Sen  Landrieu s Stewardship for our Coasts and Opportunities for Reliable Energy Act   SCORE     The SCORE Act  S  1026  would automatically share 50 percent of offshore oil   gas revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  with Louisiana and the four other coastal energy producing states without production moratoria off their coasts   In a statement released last week  Sen  Domenici said he hoped the committee would incorporate key parts of the plan into the energy bill   With Chairman Domenici s leadership and support  I am increasingly confident this energy bill will include these vital provisions for Louisiana s coast and recognize our role in so much of our nation s offshore energy production   Sen  Landrieu said    As a member of the committee  I ve worked to strengthen Louisiana s position in the energy bill  and I am grateful for Sen  Vitter s hard work on his committees as well   Under the pending mark  from fiscal year 2006 to 2010  OCS revenues would be authorized by Congress to be appropriated to these states   Then  beginning in FY 2011  SCORE calls for OCS revenues to be automatically distributed each year and not be subject to the traditional appropriations process   The distribution to these states    Louisiana  Alaska  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama    would be based on each state s energy production  with 35 percent of each state s allocation directed to coastal political subdivisions    The SCORE legislation would also direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish seaward lateral boundaries for all coastal states to explore the possibility of offshore energy development  and would allow those with moratoria in place to petition the Secretary for a resource assessment of energy sources within their boundaries   With these assessments in hand  state legislatures could then request that any or all of the area within their boundaries be made available for leasing  thereby providing a local option for energy exploration    Finally  SCORE would provide the opportunity for innovative  alternative uses of the OCS    including renewable energy projects such as wind  wave and solar     A portion of revenues from this production would be shared with the state off whose coastline the production took place
