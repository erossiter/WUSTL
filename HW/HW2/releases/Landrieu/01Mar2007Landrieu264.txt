Landrieu on Bush Visit   We Need Real Action          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 01 2007    Landrieu on Bush Visit   We Need Real Action  On 18 month Katrina anniversary  calls for immediate steps to advance hurricane recovery     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   said this afternoon that while President Bush s visit to the Gulf Coast today is appreciated  more effective steps need to be taken by the federal government to spur hurricane recovery in the region   The President has had 18 months to listen    to hear that the realities of the federal response have not lived up to the promises he made in Jackson Square   Sen  Landrieu said  noting that today marks exactly a year and a half since Hurricane Katrina came ashore on August 29  2005    We need the President to take real action   We need his leadership  We need him to get FEMA and the Army Corps moving   Sen  Landrieu specifically cited the President s authority under the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief Act to waive the requirement that local communities match 10 percent of the cost for recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government   This cost sharing provision has been waived 32 times since 1985 when per capita rebuilding costs have been excessive  In 1992  President George H  W  Bush waived the cost sharing requirement when the per capita recovery cost of Hurricane Andrew reached  139   The requirement was also waived for New York City following the attacks of September 11th  where the per capita cost totaled  390   But despite a  6 700 per capita recovery cost following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and local communities stretched to the limit by high rebuilding costs and a decimated tax base generating little revenue  the Administration has thus far refused to waive the requirement   The President can move the recovery of the Gulf Coast forward by a giant leap with a simple stroke of his pen   said Sen  Landrieu  who on February 9 sent the President a letter asking that the requirement be waived   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   and Homeland Security Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   co signed the letter   Sen  Landrieu has also introduced legislation  the Fair Assistance in Recovery Funding Act  to waive the requirement and intends to offer a similar amendment to the 9 11 Commission Bill   I call upon the President to use his authority to do the right thing   Sen  Landrieu said   The fair thing   If he won t  I will push hard to get it done legislatively   Sen  Landrieu also discussed the upcoming Supplemental Appropriations Bill  which the Senate is expected to take up later this month   In the President s budget request  the Administration proposed correcting a  1 3 billion cost overrun on levee projects authorized in the Third Supplemental Appropriations Bill by moving the funds from levee projects identified in the Fourth Supplemental   The additional costs were principally the result of increased labor and material costs following the hurricanes   Casting aside the lessons learned from years of underfunding levee protection to devastating results  the Administration seeks now to shuffle  1 3 billion from one set of projects to another rather than pay the bill for each   Sen  Landrieu said    This  robbing Peter to pay Paul  strategy may cover up the Administration s underestimation of short term protection costs  but it leaves open a gaping budgetary hole for another day   This bureaucratic shell game has deadly consequences  The only way to fix the situation is with a comprehensive levee and flood control program for the entire area    West Bank and East    that s fully funded with immediate implementation   Reflecting on a dramatic increase in violent crime in the New Orleans region since the start of the year  Sen  Landrieu announced that she would seek  50 million in the Supplemental Bill to fund a comprehensive response to the problem   The most immediate component of the request would be to fully fund a  6 32 million proposal by metro New Orleans business leaders and civic groups to meet urgent operational needs  The funds would provide for hiring back 50 former New Orleans police officers to fill the void in officers on the street   Current total officer strength stands at only 1 250    well below the authorized number of 1 600  The plan also includes nearly  1 million to hire eight additional Orleans Parish prosecutors and  2 million to support the development of an information sharing project between criminal justice agencies in the region  The goal is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of system wide criminal justice operations   This problem is so serious that the federal government must be fully engaged   Sen  Landrieu said    We need to beef up the crime fighting operations in the state by making sure the law enforcement community has the resources it needs to apprehend and prosecute the criminals on the streets
