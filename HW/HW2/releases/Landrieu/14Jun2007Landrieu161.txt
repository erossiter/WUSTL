Senate Chairmen Seek State Dept  Reforms on Foreign Disaster Aid         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 14 2007    Senate Chairmen Seek State Dept  Reforms on Foreign Disaster Aid Press Secretary of State Rice for update on overdue reforms     WASHINGTON    Three Senate chairmen today asked the State Department for an update on its efforts to reform its methods for receiving and managing international aid following domestic disasters  In a joint letter  Senators Joseph R  Biden  Jr   D Del   Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Mary L  Landrieu  D La   requested that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice provide a status report addressing ten specific concerns no later than June 28  2007   As you know  the Department of State s responsibility is not limited solely to advancing our nation s interests abroad   the Senators wrote   Its duty extends to representing the American people to the international community when the interests in question are right here at home   The Washington Post reported earlier this year that the United States turned down  854 million in offers of foreign assistance from 151 countries following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastating failure of the federal levee system  According to the April 29 article  only  126 4 was accepted   The hurricanes of 2005 united the world in a spirit of goodwill for Americans rebuilding their lives along our Gulf Coast   the Senators wrote   This spirit should not be laid to waste  and should another disaster tragically befall our nation  we must do better to ensure that such helping hands are not unjustifiably turned away again   The Bush Administration s own February 2006 report   The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina  Lessons Learned   makes nine specific recommendations on how to improve the management of future foreign assistance offers  The White House report had originally set a June 31  2006  deadline for implementation  but little progress has to date been reported  At a May 10 hearing of the Senate Appropriations State  Foreign Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee  of which Sen  Landrieu is a member  she asked Secretary Rice about the rejection of this significant assistance and the State Department s efforts to implement the  Lessons Learned  recommendations  But despite a commitment from Secretary Rice to respond by letter  and subsequent e mails communicating a desire for it to be delivered no later than June 8  no response has yet been received   We are two weeks into the 2007 hurricane season  yet it is decidedly unclear whether the federal government is today any better equipped to wisely and effectively manage offers of international assistance   the Senators wrote   The one certainty is that our nation will eventually confront another disaster  be it natural or manmade    We believe a month is more than adequate time to provide the Senate with a response to this essential question   the Senators added  Sen  Biden is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Sen  Leahy is Chairman of the Senate Appropriations State  Foreign Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee  Sen  Landrieu chairs the Disaster Recovery Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affair Committee  A full copy of the letter is available
