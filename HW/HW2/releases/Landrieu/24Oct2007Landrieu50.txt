Landrieu Statement on Southwick Vote         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 24 2007    Landrieu Statement on Southwick Vote     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released a statement after voting against cloture on the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the 5th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals based in New Orleans  La  Sen  Landrieu said   I have given deep consideration to Judge Leslie Southwick s record and qualifications to hold a seat on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals   The Fifth Circuit is not just an ordinary court in our nation s history   It is a very special place that was home to Judge Minor Wisdom and the Great Four   This circuit did more to restore equity and balance to our nation s civil rights jurisprudence than any other court in America   I am not willing to quietly abandon this tradition  In many respects  the question is not about Judge Southwick as an individual nominee  but rather about the future of the Fifth Circuit    The Fifth Circuit has the highest proportion of African Americans within its jurisdiction of any circuit in the country   It also has one of the highest concentrations of people in poverty of any Federal Circuit   Circumstances like the Jena Six fall within its jurisdiction   This is a federal court that must absolutely have its doors wide open to Americans of every race  color and economic circumstance      More immediately  the people of the Gulf Coast find themselves in a special circumstance  We have been devastated by two hurricanes that were compounded by the failure of the Federal Government   There are numerous federal cases arising from this catastrophe   These suits are being brought by ordinary people who have lost everything   It is vital that people without means  without clout  without resources have confidence that they will be able to attain justice in our federal courts   When Senator Durbin asked Judge Southwick if he could think of a single case where he had ruled for an underprivileged group  he could not   When the citizens of my state head to the Fifth Circuit with the cards already stacked against them  they need a judge who will deal a fair hand    So  I view this vote about the needs and future of this court   Whatever Judge Southwick s credentials  with hundreds of exemplary lawyers and judges to choose from  I do not think he meets the needs for this circuit   Of those hundreds  there must surely have been a qualified candidate that would not divide the Senate and the citizens of the Gulf Coast  while also being acceptable to the President   This decision does not come easy to me   I have been a supporter of a less partisan  more cordial approach to judicial confirmations in the Senate   However  I do not believe that Judge Southwick is the right appointment for the Fifth Circuit
