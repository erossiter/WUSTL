Landrieu Spotlights Small Business Recovery         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 19 2007    Landrieu Spotlights Small Business Recovery Joins local business owners  Microsoft to recognize important servicesat the Louisiana Small Business Development Center    NEW ORLEANS    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today joined local small business owners  the State Director of the Louisiana Small Business Development Center  LSBDC  and a representative of the Microsoft Corporation to discuss small business recovery in the region following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The 2005 storms impacted 125 000 small and medium sized businesses across the Gulf Coast  and in Louisiana alone  more than 18 000 businesses were totally destroyed     Small businesses are a critical foundation for the economic recovery of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast   Sen  Landrieu said    They invest in neighborhood storefronts and other community anchors  providing jobs and working with other local suppliers and customers to further extend the impact of successful businesses on lifting the region to its feet     For thousands of businesses with roots here in Louisiana and a desire to grow and thrive  the LSBDC provides the much needed sunlight   The LSBDC s training programs  assistance and counsel provide an essential guiding hand for our small business community  and in so doing are helping drive our recovery from the catastrophic storms and levee failures    The LSBDC offers high quality  no cost business consulting and low cost training for small business owners and potential owners through nine centers statewide   Through a landmark agreement organized by Sen  Landrieu  the LSBDC has partnered with Microsoft to provide one year of free software licensing to hurricane affected small businesses and will also expand its Microsoft software training opportunities     What the LSBDC consultants in the New Orleans region have been doing is helping small businesses figure out how to first survive and then increase their sales and profits   said Mary Lynn Wilkerson  the LSBDC State Director    A good portion of those businesses must determine how to expand beyond their local market   LSBDC consultants have been helping our clients develop new business strategies that include selling on the internet  developing totally new markets  tightly managing inventory  and how to manage with fewer employees   These strategies require the use of technology   We at LSBDC are grateful to Microsoft and Senator Mary Landrieu for this opportunity  This offer could provide the jumpstart into technology that small and medium sized businesses must embrace to prosper    Under the program launched this month  hurricane affected businesses can purchase licenses for Microsoft software  including the popular Windows and Office products  through any authorized Microsoft reseller with payments spread over three years   Eligible business owners then bring the first year s invoice to any LSBDC and Microsoft will pay it on the business  behalf   For a small business of 50 employees and 25 computers licensing Microsoft Windows Vista and the Office 2007 suite of programs  the free year results in savings of about  12 000         Microsoft applauds the work of the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Small Business Development Center to restore these businesses and their local economies   said Chris Sakalosky  South Central Area General Manager for Microsoft s Small and Mid Market Solutions   Partner Group    Small businesses are the cornerstone of local communities across the nation  creating millions of new jobs each year  and we are pleased to be able provide a year of free licensing for Microsoft software purchased by affected small businesses        This effort demonstrates how partnerships between big businesses and small  government and the private sector  can help drive recovery after a disaster   said Sen  Landrieu  who chairs the Disaster Recovery Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee    But it is also smart business  Microsoft recognizes that the businesses that survive disasters today are the successful customers and partners of tomorrow   I hope their leadership inspires other companies to take similar proactive steps   Joining Wilkerson  Sakalosky and the senator at the Greater New Orleans SBDC today were several local small business owners there to discuss the challenges of recovery or participate in training programs at the center   Among them was Dianne Sclafani  whose family s Metairie cooking school has been training professional chefs  restaurant managers  and food service entrepreneurs for 20 years   The Sclafani family saw their enrollment drop drastically after Katrina because many of their students were displaced by the Hurricane   With the LSBDC s help  Sclafani is now developing an online curriculum to serve students from more outlying regions who have difficulties finding lodging in the New Orleans region   Louisiana s rebirth requires new strategies and inventive approaches  not tired ideas of the past   Sen  Landrieu said    This means harnessing the power of new technologies   Businesses that recognize this potential will be the ones leading the way as we rebuild   With partners like the LSBDC and Microsoft  I hope many more will be able follow Dianne Sclafani s example and use technology to rebuild  reinvent and grow their businesses
