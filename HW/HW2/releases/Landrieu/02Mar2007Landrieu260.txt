Landrieu Amendments Right Unfair Hurricane Recovery Funding Rules         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 02 2007    Landrieu Amendments Right Unfair Hurricane Recovery Funding Rules Make Levees National Priority    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today offered three amendments to S  4  the 9 11 Commission bill  that will address unfair recovery funding policies following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and pave the way for a greater national commitment to stronger  better levee protection from coast to coast   The intent of the 9 11 bill is to begin to close the book on past failures in disaster preparedness and response while setting the stage for a safer  more secure future   Sen  Landrieu said   The amendments I am introducing today do just that   They eliminate two gross double standards which have hampered our recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and they assign a far greater priority to protecting our federal levee system from ever failing so catastrophically ever again   The Fair Assistance in Recovery Funding Amendment The FAIR Funding Amendment  S  Amdt  295  would waive for Katrina  and Rita affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  This provision has been waived 32 times since 1985 when per capita rebuilding costs have been excessive  In 1992  President George H  W  Bush waived the requirement when the per capita recovery cost of Hurricane Andrew reached  139  It was also waived for New York City following the attacks of September 11th  where the per capita cost totaled  390  But despite a  6 700 per capita recovery cost following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and local communities stretched to the limit by high rebuilding costs and a decimated tax base generating little revenue  the Administration has thus far refused repeated requests for a waiver   The President has the authority to move Gulf Coast recovery a giant leap forward with a single stroke of his pen   said Sen  Landrieu    If he won t get it done administratively  I will continue to push hard to get it done legislatively   Sen  Landrieu has also introduced standalone legislation waiving the requirement  and on February 9  joined Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   and Homeland Security Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   in a letter to the President urging the waiver   The rationale for this match may be sound in the case of an ordinary disaster   the Senators wrote   However  given the unique magnitude of this disaster  and the extremely difficult circumstances that Louisiana now faces  we believe that the most appropriate step for the Federal government is to waive the match requirement in this case   The Disaster Loan Fairness Amendment The Disaster Loan Fairness Amendment  S  Amdt  296  makes Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness made available to all other disaster stricken communities  The Stafford Act has historically required forgiveness of such loans when independent audits determine the fiscal recovery of affected local communities is insufficient to repay the loans after a three year grace period  In the 29 years of the program  64 loan applications have been received regarding 21 federal disasters  with approximately 93 percent being deemed by independent auditors as warranting partial or complete forgiveness   According to press accounts   227 billion in Community Disaster Loans have been forgiven since 1974   The hard working taxpayers whose communities were devastated by hurricanes Katrina and Rita should not be asked to accept a lower standard than any other American   Sen  Landrieu said    We are not seeking special treatment  We are not asking for loans to be automatically canceled   This bill serves only to make the same repayment options available to Gulf Coast states as have been and will be afforded to all other disaster stricken communities nationwide   Shortly after the hurricanes  Sen  Landrieu proposed making  1 billion in unspent FEMA funds available for Community Disaster Loans under the same terms as had been afforded to other communities   But the version that was passed in October 2005  sponsored by Senators David Vitter  R La   and Bill Frist  R Tenn   specifically prohibited the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities were unable to pay them back  This marked the first time in American history that loan forgiveness was excluded as an option for qualifying local governments  and the prohibition was specific to Katrina affected states  not any future loans outside the Gulf Coast  Holding the floor though the night in a procedural stalemate during which Republican leaders would not allow her to speak  Sen  Landrieu delayed by two days Congress  intended Columbus Day recess that year in an attempt to pass an alternative more consistent with the standards applied in all other disasters   These unprecedented and unfair lending terms did not make sense at the time  and they do not make sense now   Sen  Landrieu said today   It is time we give Gulf Coast communities a fair opportunity to reopen schools  rebuild key infrastructure and keep police cars  fire trucks and sanitation vehicles rolling as they bring communities back to life   In January  Sen  Landrieu introduced S  253  a standalone bill identical to today s amendment   Other pending legislation exists to address the issue  but would only make forgivable some  not all of the funds Louisiana received since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  The Critical Levee Infrastructure Amendment The Critical Levee Infrastructure Amendment  S  Amdt  324  would build upon the 9 11 Commission s recommendations regarding the protection of critical national infrastructure by extending the designation to include the 15 000 miles of levees that protect lives and communities across America    The 9 11 bill  as written  defines our  critical national infrastructure  as those systems whose destruction by a hurricane or other disaster would result in a  significant loss of life  severe economic harm  mass evacuations  or the loss of a city    Sen  Landrieu said   We don t need a federal study to remind us that the failure of the federal levee system meets all four of these criteria    It is time we make a clear national commitment to an integrated water management system anchored by stronger  better levees   Designating the levees as critical national infrastructure would require the Department of Homeland Security to consider the risk of a levee targeted terrorist attack and ensure their protection  especially in densely populated  low lying areas  The bill already requires the Department to secure 17 other types of infrastructure  including dams
