Landrieu to Meet with Blocked Army Corps Nominee         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 03 2007    Landrieu to Meet with Blocked Army Corps Nominee     NEW ORLEANS    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   this afternoon said that she will soon meet with Lieutenant General Robert Van Antwerp  Jr   to discuss his plans for leading the Army Corps of Engineers as significant hurricane recovery and coastal protection projects remain underway in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast   The meeting was agreed to mere hours after Sen  Landrieu announced that she had placed a procedural hold on Lt  Gen  Van Antwerp s nomination to be the new Corps Chief of Engineers    We cannot protect our communities without effective leadership and competent management   Sen  Landrieu said    We ve seen only too recently what happens when these qualities are missing   Sen  Landrieu  Chairman of the Disaster Recovery Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  reiterated that Lt  Gen  Van Antwerp s credentials are not in dispute  but that she is seeking assurances  that both he and this Administration are ready to get serious about reforming the Army Corps  bureaucracy   Standing this morning at the 17th Street Canal levee which was breached following Hurricane Katrina  Sen  Landrieu said that one indication of Lt  Gen  Van Antwerp s commitment to the region s recovery and future protection would be a willingness to meet with the entire Louisiana Congressional delegation to discuss the outstanding challenges and their necessary response    To this end  Sen  Landrieu will be inviting each of the other delegation members    Republicans and Democrats alike    to participate in the meeting with Lt  Gen  Van Antwerp on April 17   The nominee s confirmation hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is planned for the following day   I want to make sure that he understands the need for integrated engineering and essential levee funding   Sen  Landrieu said   I want to make sure that he puts people above red tape  safety above corner cutting  and won t allow endless delays and mindless procedures to threaten the future of our communities and our economy   We must ask   Will this nominee be the partner we need for the recovery and protection of our region  or will he be the agent of a failed status quo    Sen  Landrieu said that before considering whether to allow Lt  Gen  Van Antwerp s confirmation to move forward  she would also ask that he visit coastal Louisiana to tour communities  levees and wetlands and meet with local officials and members of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority  Last week  the Senate passed an Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill which includes  1 3 billion to cover a funding shortfall and complete repairs to New Orleans levees damaged by Hurricane Katrina   Calling the funds  excessive and extraneous   the White House has cited the levee provision as one reason for the President s expected veto of the bill and its House of Representatives companion    The site of Sen  Landrieu s announcement this morning was also mere feet from where the Army Corps of Engineers appears to have installed faulty and untested water pumps they claimed would be sufficient to protect the community through the 2006 hurricane season   The Governmental Accountability Office  GAO  is investigating the process behind the decision  at Sen  Landrieu s request  and is expected to release its first findings next month   I want to use every opportunity available to me as a Senator from Louisiana to spotlight the serious issue of storm protection and to secure from this Administration the necessary commitment to action   Sen  Landrieu said today    Our people have already paid too high a price for official neglect and mismanagement for us to allow business as usual   The senator also noted that last week  a Senate committee passed the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   which authorizes key coastal wetlands restoration  flood control and hurricane protection projects throughout Louisiana   Intended to be passed once every two years  Congress has not passed a WRDA bill since 2000   It has been 7 years since a WRDA bill made it through Congress and to the President s desk   she said   It is time to pass this long overdue legislation and to get these life saving projects started   Sen  Landrieu was joined at today s event by local elected officials who stressed the importance of the Louisiana projects included in the legislation   Speaking at the event were Orleans Parish Councilman at large Arnie Fielkow  St  Bernard Parish Council Chairman Joey Difatta  Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser and Jefferson Parish Councilman at large Tom Capella   The lives and livelihood of millions of Louisianians depend on an integrated water management system to keep our communities safe   Sen  Landrieu said    This means stronger levees  coastal wetlands restoration  integrated flood control systems  smart design of navigation projects  and the foresight to look at each of these as part of a complete  integrated plan
