Landrieu  Internet Regulator Turns Back on Children with Online Sex Decision         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 30 2007    Landrieu  Internet Regulator Turns Back on Children with Online Sex Decision Agency rejects call for adult content domains     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today criticized the chief Internet regulatory agency for deciding not to take steps to help parents more easily identify pornographic web sites inappropriate for viewing by children    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  ICANN   the multinational public private partnership which assigns Internet domain names  voted 9 to 5 yesterday against creating a  xxx top level domain   This step would have added to the list of internationally recognized extensions which currently includes  com   org   gov   net and others   The new naming category was most recently proposed by ICM Registry LLC  and ICANN s rejection of the ICM application marks the third time the agency has rejected proposals to provide unique designations for web sites that host content inappropriate for minors   These top level domain names are the first signal to parents as to what their children are viewing online   said Sen  Landrieu  who in the 107th Congress introduced the Family Privacy and Security Act  S  2137   The bill would have directed  under the authority of an agreement between the U S  Department of Commerce and ICANN  the creation of a new top level domain extension such as  xxx or  prn as the required naming convention for web sites whose principal content would be harmful to minors   For example  when we see   gov  we know we are visiting a government agency  and   edu  tells us an educational institution is about to appear   Yet  ICANN continues to turn its back on child protection by refusing to take similar steps to make harmful content as readily identifiable   The protective step has been strongly opposed by members of the adult entertainment industry  some of whom disguise their web sites with domain names that appear to represent child friendly commercial  government or educational content   Due in large part to deceptive naming and advertising methods commonplace in the industry  children can far too easily stumble into adult web sites with materials highly inappropriate for their age   said Sen  Landrieu    In 2005  Sen  Landrieu joined Sen  Blanche Lincoln  D Ark   and others to introduce the Internet Safety and Child Protection Act  S  1507  which would require stronger age verification safeguards on pornographic web sites and create a trust fund for increased law enforcement and educational efforts to protect children online     Protecting our children is no longer as simple as holding their hands as they cross the street or watching them as they play in the park   Sen  Landrieu said    A whole generation is now growing up with the Internet as a classroom and as a playground  and this virtual world can be every bit as dangerous as the streets and playgrounds outside our doors     As a mother and as a legislator  I believe we need to provide every tool possible to help keep our children safe  and I will continue this effort in Congress
