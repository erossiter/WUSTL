Landrieu  Coleman Bill Provides Needed Surgery for Children with Birth Defects         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 13 2007    Landrieu  Coleman Bill Provides Needed Surgery for Children with Birth Defects     WASHINGTON    United States Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Norm Coleman  R Minn   this week introduced legislation  S  1588  to require insurance companies to cover surgical costs for children suffering from birth defects requiring reconstructive care   Children with birth defects should not be denied life altering surgery while the insurance industry earns record breaking profits   Sen  Landrieu said   This legislation will put an end to a disingenuous practice that has misclassified thousands of legitimate health care claims  These children will finally receive their coverage for the necessary surgical procedures that give them the opportunity to grow and thrive     It is a tragedy that insurance companies continue to deny treatment to over 50  of children who suffer from birth defects   Sen  Coleman said   Reconstructive surgery is essential for children affected by such disorders because it gives them the confidence to flourish into healthy adulthoods  As a public servant and as a father  I am aware of the need for this vital legislation and it is my hope when it comes time to vote  my colleagues will as well   Insurance companies increasingly deny access to reconstructive care by labeling these procedures as  cosmetic  or  non functional  and claiming they are not medically necessary   The Children s Access to Reconstructive Evaluation and Surgeries Act  CARES Act   S  1588  previously introduced as the  Treatment of Children s Deformities Act   codifies in law the American Medical Association s definition for reconstructive as surgery performed on  abnormal structures of the body  while the definition of cosmetic surgery is reshaping  normal structures of the body   This distinction will reduce the obstacles to obtaining approval for coverage of reconstructive surgeries previously considered as cosmetic  The Senate bill is cosponsored by Sens  Even Bayh  D Ind   Olympia Snowe  R Maine  Thad Cochran  R Miss  Richard Lugar  R Ind   and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich  Reps  Carolyn McCarthy  D N Y   and Patrick Tiberi  R Ohio  introduced companion legislation  H R  1655  in the House  which has 35 additional cosponsors   According to the March of Dimes  120 000 U S  babies are born each year with birth defects  Approximately 40 000 require reconstructive surgery   Birth defects include abnormalities of structure  function  or body metabolism present at birth that results in physical or mental disability or even death   Examples of these deformities include cleft lip  cleft palate  skin lesions  vascular anomalies  malformations of the ear  hand  or foot  and other more profound craniofacial deformities  Sen  Landrieu also continues to work for appropriations dollars for Operation Smile  an organization that provides surgical procedures for children with birth defects in other countries  Since 1982  more than 100 000 children and young adults have been treated by thousands of volunteers worldwide  By intervening with the Department of Homeland Security and removing bureaucratic red tape  Sen  Landrieu recently ensured that Rayan  a little girl from Iraq with life threatening birth defects  was able to come with her mother to the United States for treatment  On Monday  Rayan was scheduled to be operated on at Children s Hospital of the King s Daughters in Norfolk  Va
