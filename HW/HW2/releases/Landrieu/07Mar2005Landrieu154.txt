Sen  Landrieu Introduces Measure to Protect Potential Disaster Victims from Added Taxation         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  3 7 2005    Sen  Landrieu Introduces Measure to Protect Potential Disaster Victims from Added Taxation     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced a measure to protect families who receive federal disaster assistance from being taxed on the federal aid they receive   Her amendment to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act was inspired in part by the plight of two Avondale constituents who received federal assistance to protect their home from flooding  but were then told the Internal Revenue Service considered the grant to be part of the couple s gross income for tax purposes   This tax is unfair  unexpected and an unfortunate policy decision   Sen  Landrieu said    No one told this family that they would be taxed for accepting assistance from the government   About 20 percent of Louisiana s coastal zone lies below sea level  including 80 percent of New Orleans  and 377 000 Louisiana property owners participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency s National Flood Insurance Program   The program provides flood mitigation assistance in the form of grants to local governments    grants which may then used by homeowners in risk areas to raise their homes above the base flood elevation  To qualify  the Avondale family was required to raise  20 000 on their own  which they did through refinancing their home   Jefferson Parish used National Flood Insurance Program grant funds to pay the remaining  45 000 to the contractor who performed the work   Neither the family or parish government knew at the time that the assistance would be classified as income by the IRS  and the resulting tax increase places a a significant financial burden on the family   All the people in my state ask for is an opportunity to protect themselves  their homes  and their loved ones from these disasters   Sen  Landrieu said   But by making these payments taxable  the IRS has turned this valuable disaster preparedness and prevention program into a financial disaster for responsible property owners   If signed into law  Sen  Landrieu s measure will be retroactive  covering homeowners who received grants in 2004   She also intends to introduce the legislation as a stand alone bill should the Senate not adopt it in its current form  A companion measure is expected to be introduced in the U S  House of Representatives by Rep  Mark Foley  R Fla   with the support of many other members from states with high flood and natural disaster risks  including Louisiana
