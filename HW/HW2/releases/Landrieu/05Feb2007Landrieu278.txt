Bush Budget Undercuts Levee Protection  Crime Prevention and Other Essentials         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 05 2007    Bush Budget Undercuts Levee Protection  Crime Prevention and Other Essentials     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement in response to the Fiscal Year 2008 Federal Budget proposal submitted to Congress by the President  Sen  Landrieu said   The budget proposal submitted by the Bush Administration today is yet one more example of fiscal policies that have steered our nation down the wrong path   It makes cuts in the most essential areas while relying on accounting trickery to mask the true costs of its priorities   Casting aside the lessons learned from years of underfunding levee protection to devastating results  the Administration seeks now to shuffle  1 3 billion from one set of projects to another rather than pay the bill for each   This  robbing Peter to pay Paul  strategy may cover up the Administration s underestimation of short term protection costs  but it leaves open a gaping budgetary hole for another day   This bureaucratic shell game has deadly consequences  The only way to fix the situation is with a comprehensive levee and flood control program for the entire area    West Bank and East    that s fully funded with immediate implementation   There could also perhaps be no worse time for the President to eliminate the COPS program  which funds additional police officers for local communities   Despite rising rates of violent crime nationwide  and an even more dramatic surge in the New Orleans region  this budget seeks to do just that  and also slashes key disaster prevention  response and emergency management funding   Programs that support community rebuilding and renewal  expand economic opportunity  provide healthcare to our children and veterans  and help make college more affordable are all on the chopping block as well   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  I will fight to ensure Louisiana has the resources necessary to meet its needs  and I am committed to working with my colleagues toward a disciplined  more balanced budget that doesn t spend money we don t have
