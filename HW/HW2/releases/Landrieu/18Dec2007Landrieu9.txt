Senate Passes Omnibus Appropriations Bill with  142M Specifically for La          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 18 2007    Senate Passes Omnibus Appropriations Bill with  142M Specifically for La  Landrieu fights for state s share on Senate Appropriations Committee     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate tonight approved in a 76 to 17 vote an omnibus appropriations bill  which includes  142 million in projects specifically secured for Louisiana following efforts by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  The omnibus  HR 2764  combined the 11 remaining appropriations bills not yet enacted for fiscal year 2008  In November  Congress passed the Defense Appropriations bill with  5 billion Sen  Landrieu secured for Louisiana  including  3 billion to reduce the Road Home program s shortfall    The omnibus appropriations bill contains key funding for Louisiana that will help us recover from the 2005 hurricanes and boost our economy by fueling infrastructure projects all over the state   Sen  Landrieu said   This bill culminates a year of appropriations work for our state  and as a committee member  I will continue fighting for essential Louisiana dollars   The bill now must return to the House of Representatives for final consideration before being sent to President Bush s desk   In the Homeland Security section of the bill  Sen  Landrieu  chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  secured  25 million in specific Louisiana projects  It includes no cost language she authored to allow school districts impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita to receive a single Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  payment to rebuild schools  School districts would otherwise have to go through FEMA s complicated Public Assistance process on a building by building basis   Two and a half years after the storms  we are working to unravel the red tape that still inhibits our recovery   Sen  Landrieu said   This bill includes commonsense language that will allow schools to swiftly rebuild and get children back in the classroom  It should serve as a model for future disaster response as we work to reform FEMA s inflexible policies   Sen  Landrieu also added language to give  3 1 million in rebuilding funds to Peebles Elementary School  an Iberia Parish school destroyed by Hurricane Rita  In May 2006  FEMA had pledged to fund relocating the school away from the flood plain  Based on FEMA s commitment  the school s new site was purchased  But in November 2006  a FEMA official reversed course and claimed the agency could no longer meet its commitment because the school did not qualify under his new interpretation of the agency s relocation funding rules    Peebles Elementary School will finally be able to rebuild on higher ground with the money FEMA promised 19 months ago   Sen  Landrieu said   Congress recognizes what FEMA has continually rejected  we need the flexibility to rebuild smarter and stronger   The measure also jump starts FEMA s formaldehyde testing process by requiring the agency to design a test for an appropriate number of FEMA trailers and mobile homes  The test would determine formaldehyde levels in the housing units  and the agency would be required to report to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  HSGAC  and the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee within 45 days of the bill s enactment  Sen  Landrieu added  7 7 million for Louisiana health care projects  including a provision to restore priority grant funding to centers that provide mental health services to children affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita    One of our most pressing needs as we recover from the 2005 hurricanes is mental health care services  but the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA  inexplicably decided to defund the Louisiana Rural Trauma Services Center  a successful program for children with traumatic stress   Sen  Landrieu said   The omnibus includes a provision I pushed through requiring SAMSHA to consider Katrina and Rita affected areas as the first priority for mental health care grants  ensuring our children will get the care they need   The legislation also includes  1 million to supply a New Orleans based mobile medical hospital   I pushed for this funding because our city must be better prepared to address immediate health care needs during future disasters  be they natural or manmade   Sen  Landrieu said     Louisiana will receive  6 1 million in energy related projects secured by Sen  Landrieu  including a last minute grant of  984 000 for the Nicholls State University Clean Power Energy Research Consortium  The project is a joint venture between five Louisiana Universities    Louisiana State University  University of New Orleans  Tulane  Southern University and Nicholls State University    to develop clean power technologies that will reduce energy costs   Louisiana is America s only energy coast  and in that tradition  we continue to be on the forefront of new technologies to reduce energy costs and decrease our dependence on foreign oil   Sen  Landrieu said    Louisiana will receive  62 5 million in transportation infrastructure projects  including  40 million to replace aging bridges across the state  such as the 1 10 Calcasieu River Bridge in Lake Charles and the Red River Bridge at Fort Buhlow  The bill includes money for Interstates 10  49 and 69 as well as  500 million in federal highway formula grants   The catastrophic levee failures after Hurricane Katrina and Rita revealed that much of our country s infrastructure must be updated to keep our communities safe   Sen  Landrieu said   The Louisiana infrastructure funds in this bill  including the  40 million for our bridges  are a solid investment in our future and will strengthen our channels of commerce and bolster our economy    Sen  Landrieu secured  17 7 million for three Louisiana military construction projects  including building the Brigade Headquarters for the 4th Brigade 10th Mountain Division  which has more than 3 200 soldiers  The bill also includes  16 million Sen  Landrieu added for Louisiana agriculture projects  Among them is  530 000 for the Delta Nutritional Project at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge for the continuation of the center s human nutrition research on obesity among children     Sen  Landrieu pushed for  3 9 million in Louisiana projects under the Commerce  Justice  Science section of the bill  including  1 5 million for the Louisiana State University Coastal Restoration and Enhancement through Science and Technology project  These funds will be used to advance coastal habitat restoration programs   The Interior section of the bill gives  2 2 million to Louisiana  including  393 760 Sen  Landrieu added for water system upgrades in Hammond  La   Under the legislation s Financial Services section  Louisiana will receive  745 000 for small business development  including  450 000 to create a Northeast Louisiana Business and Community Development Center    a joint venture of the University of Louisiana at Monroe College of Business and the Louisiana Small Business Development Center  The center will offer community development services to advance entrepreneurship and support economic development through community outreach  and training of community leaders  This section also contains Landrieu language to halt the closing of the Alexandria  La   mail processing facility that serves 140 communities in the area and bolsters the economic growth of the entire region  The following is a detailed list of
