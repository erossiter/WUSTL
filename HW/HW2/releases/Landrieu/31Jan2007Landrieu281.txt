Legislators Renew Effort to Support Breast Cancer Patients         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 31 2007    Legislators Renew Effort to Support Breast Cancer Patients Express hope that bipartisan  bicameral bill will pass in new Congress     WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Olympia Snowe  R ME  together with Congresswoman Rosa L  DeLauro  Conn  3  today renewed their support for breast cancer patients by reintroducing The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act    legislation that has languished in Congress for over a decade due to the previous leadership in Congress   The act will ensure that breast cancer patients have access to appropriate health care by giving them an option of remaining in the hospital for up to 48 hours following a mastectomy with insurance coverage   Many women are forced to leave the hospital the same day as surgery because their insurance will not cover their stay      According to the American Cancer Society  there are approximately three million women living with breast cancer in the United States  and a woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime   In no civilized country in the world should a mastectomy be an outpatient procedure   Sen  Landrieu said    Medical decisions should be made by women and their doctors  not by nameless  faceless file clerks following nameless  faceless guidelines   I have heard far too many stories from women and their families about being forced to leave the hospital too soon after a mastectomy  and it is long past time that Congress recognizes the importance of allowing a woman to stay in the hospital after this very difficult  both physically and emotionally  experience    We are renewing our effort today to ensure that the millions of American women diagnosed with breast cancer each year know they will receive the care they need and deserve   said Snowe    Guaranteeing women have the option of remaining in the hospital for up to 48 hours following a mastectomy provides both the patient and the doctor with piece of mind and the time to make appropriate treatment decisions   It is inexplicable that the Congress has not taken action to ensure this basic right to adequate treatment  and I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to enact this legislation immediately    After being diagnosed with breast cancer  a woman will work with her doctor to determine if a mastectomy is the best option and should have her hospital stay determined by her doctor    not her insurance company   Yet many will be forced to leave the hospital when they are still in pain  groggy from anesthesia  and with drainage tubes that require professional attention because their HMO will not cover their stay   said DeLauro    I have worked on the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act for an entire decade in this Congress  without a vote or hearing ever having been held   The time has come to pass this common sense  compassionate legislation in support of women s health  When faced with a crisis like breast cancer  the last thing any woman should have to do is fight her insurance company for basic health care    Over 14 million Americans have now signed a petition sponsored by Lifetime Television calling for passage of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act   The bill would ensure that women receive the appropriate care by  Guaranteeing a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for a woman having a mastectomy or lumpectomy  and 24 hours for a woman undergoing a lymph node removal  Requiring health plans to include notice of these benefits in their monthly mailing and yearly information packet sent to plan participants  Requiring plans to provide full coverage of second opinions should the patient seek one  This bill does not mandate a 48 hour hospital stay if a patient chooses to go home sooner  nor does it set 48 hours as a maximum amount of time a woman can stay in the hospital  It simply ensures that any decision in favor of a shorter or longer hospital stay will be made by the patient and her doctor  and not an insurance company  The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act had 19 cosponsors in the U S  Senate and 185 cosponsors in the U S  House in the 109th Congress   The legislation was today reintroduced with 13 cosponsors in the Senate and 127 cosponsors in the House
