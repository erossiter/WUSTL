Vitter Landrieu Amendment Secures Additional  1 2 Billion for Coastal Restoration Efforts         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 03 05    Vitter Landrieu Amendment Secures Additional  1 2 Billion for Coastal Restoration Efforts Funding Adds to  200 Million Vitter Secured from Senate Commerce Committee last week     Washington  D C      U S  Sens  David Vitter and Mary Landrieu announced passage of an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Act today that would provide  1 2 billion for coastal restoration efforts in the Gulf States  The Vitter Landrieu amendment passed by voice vote  This money is in addition to the  200 million for coastal restoration for states impacted by hurricanes and disasters that Vitter announced last week as a member of the U S  Senate Committee on Commerce  Science and Transportation    This amendment offers a tremendous opportunity to restore Louisiana s coasts  which were heavily damaged during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  This  1 2 billion in new revenue will serve as another tool to support our coastal restoration efforts without taxing the American public or creating more of a deficit   said Vitter   This federal funding is in addition to the  200 million I secured in the Commerce Committee last week  I am very grateful to Commerce Committee Chairman Stevens for his leadership on this important issue to Louisiana    Katrina showed the nation what the people of Louisiana have always known   our wetlands are our first defense against natural disasters   said Landrieu  who yesterday introduced a coastal impact assistance amendment she today withdrew in favor of the joint measure   We are making an important down payment today on the resources necessary to provide comprehensive hurricane protection for the Gulf Coast  These funds will protect our communities  and also protect this nation s commerce and energy infrastructure             The funding will come from the sale of analog spectrum that will become available upon the transition to digital television  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the auction of this spectrum will yield  10 billion  but outside industry experts project the revenue to be between  20  30 billion  From this extra revenue  the first excess  1 billion would go toward deficit reduction and the next  500 million would go to the first responder s interoperability fund  Then  1 2 billion would be allocated for coastal restoration in states that have had coastlines damaged by hurricanes  And any additional revenue would also be allocated toward deficit reduction  Calling coastal hurricane protection one of the  five keys to reopening our home   Landrieu also said   Any attempt to rebuild the Gulf Coast will be for naught unless we build a comprehensive flood protection program  including the restoration of our wetlands  I thank Senator Vitter and Chairman Stevens for their leadership on the Commerce Committee  and am committed to continuing this important effort together as we work to secure the funding necessary to fully restore America s Wetland and the crucial infrastructure it protects    I will continue to diligently work to secure this funding and additional funding for our coastal restoration efforts   Vitter said    30
