Landrieu Votes for Continued Troop Funding  Clear Benchmarks for Iraqi Success         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  3 15 2007    Landrieu Votes for Continued Troop Funding  Clear Benchmarks for Iraqi Success     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement after voting for resolutions supporting continued troop funding and setting clear benchmarks for the war in Iraq  Sen  Landrieu said   Today  I voted to chart a new course for our strategy in Iraq  I believe that a full and open debate of this issue is vital for our country  and critical for our democracy  The President needs to provide the American people with measurable benchmarks of victory   This is the only way that the public can have the assurance that we are making progress  Unfortunately  the Administration has not provided such benchmarks  That failure has been a major cause of the policy errors and mismanagement that we have seen far too often in this very difficult situation   To effectively fight the global war on terror  to protect the lives of our men and women in uniform  and to enhance our nation s security at home and abroad  we must set clear goals and benchmarks for success in Iraq  take steps to ensure that they are timely met and reassess our strategy if they are not  This is our obligation to our troops and to the American people    It is why I support sending a clear  constructive message to the Administration and to the Iraqi government  To do any less would be to shirk my duty as a United States Senator   I will continue to support full funding for our troops  I will continue to support our military personnel as they make military decisions in the field that they deem most appropriate to achieve our objectives  And I will continue to oppose any arbitrary timetables that could jeopardize the safety of our troops or diminish our nation s fight against terrorism
