Landrieu Urges FEMA to Keep Promise to Woman s Hospital         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 11 2007    Landrieu Urges FEMA to Keep Promise to Woman s Hospital Asks FEMA Director Paulison not to take money back from hospital     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison to express her disappointment over FEMA s recent decision to recoup funding that had been granted to Woman s Hospital in Baton Rouge   In July  the agency reimbursed the hospital more than  1 1 million in Public Assistance Funds  but the hospital recently learned that FEMA intends to  de obligate  the funding and seek repayment   This is yet another example of FEMA s broken promises to Louisiana   Sen  Landrieu said    Woman s Hospital provided essential medical care to many critically ill infants and pregnant women after Hurricane Katrina  and FEMA s decision to take back a check is reprehensible   FEMA has a history of committing funding to post hurricane projects in Louisiana and then reneging on its promises   After notifying Peebles Elementary School in Iberia Parish and Henry Elementary School in Vermillion Parish that they would receive funding to relocate the schools to higher ground after the 2005 hurricanes  FEMA changed course and declined to grant the promised funding   In this instance  however  Woman s Hospital had been promised the funding and had already received payment  but FEMA has indicated that it expects repayment  In July of last year  FEMA sent out a press release announcing the funding for the hospital in which FEMA s Deputy Director of Gulf Coast Recovery Gil Jamieson said   We are very pleased to reimburse the state for costs associated with  Women s Hospital in East Baton Rouge and other important projects     I find this latest development outrageous   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter to Paulison    Woman s Hospital was led to believe that they would receive reimbursement and were in fact reimbursed  only to be informed they must return the funding that alleviates the increased costs of serving evacuated Hurricane Katrina victims   Additionally  should they appeal FEMA s most recent decision to  de obligate  funding  Woman s Hospital will incur further costs as valuable resources will be obligated to the appeals process   Accordingly  I encourage you to take swift and decisive action to rectify this matter in a manner that is consistent with FEMA s previous commitments    The full text of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
