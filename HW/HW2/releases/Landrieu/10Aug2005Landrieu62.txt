Landrieu Looks Ahead to Roberts Hearing and Senate Floor Vote         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 10 2005    Landrieu Looks Ahead to Roberts Hearing and Senate Floor Vote Puzzled by unnecessary Capitol Coalition campaign     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   reiterated today her pride in how efforts of the  Gang of 14  senators have led to a smooth start to a fair and thorough process to confirm Judge John G  Roberts  Jr   to the United States Supreme Court   Sen  Landrieu and the other 13 members of the bipartisan group brokered a compromise on judicial nominations earlier this year that Sen  Landrieu said will help ensure a Senate floor vote on Judge Roberts  confirmation     The  Gang of 14  also urged President Bush to consult with senators before making his nomination  and after meeting with Judge Roberts last month  Sen  Landrieu praised the President for responding to that request by reaching out to members of the  Gang of 14  and Judiciary Committee in particular   This consultation will further help smooth the confirmation process and expected  up or down  vote   As I said after our meeting three weeks ago  Judge Roberts brings impressive credentials and an array of experiences to the table  Sen  Landrieu said    His agile mind and pleasant demeanor will serve him well in front of the Judiciary Committee   I look forward to a fair and comprehensive confirmation process that will allow all Americans the chance to hear Judge Roberts discuss his background and qualifications as eloquently as he did with me   When we met  I was particularly impressed to hear Judge Roberts use words like  humility    moderation  and  modesty    These are not terms you hear often enough around the Capitol or courtrooms across the nation  but they are certainly words I like and I was pleased to hear him use them as well   At this early point  I have not seen anything that would warrant a filibuster of this nominee  and I ve been honored to help lay the groundwork to ensure an  up or down  vote   In fact  as I ve indicated before  I m encouraged by what I ve heard so far from him and those who know him and have been leaning towards supporting his confirmation     The process has only just begun  and both the Judiciary Committee and full Senate have a lot of work ahead   I agree with Louisiana Family Forum founder Tony Perkins  comments on CNN today that before any of us reach a final decision on Judge Roberts  confirmation  we must make sure he is first given a thorough and fair review   We re off to a good start  and I m committed to continuing my work to ensure this goal is met   It is puzzling to me  then  why the Capitol Coalition has embarked on such an ambitious public relations campaign when there is little doubt that the process is moving smoothly  with a floor vote likely in large part due to efforts by me and the other  Gang of 14  senators   We are    and always have been    on the same page looking for a full  open and fair confirmation process culminating in a vote on the Senate floor   I would like to reach out to the leaders of the Capitol Coalition and invite them to help fight for the issues we all recognize are important to Louisiana s families    issues such as education reform  coastal restoration and affordable healthcare   In particular  through working together  we have a tremendous opportunity to help protect our children from Internet pornography and to bridge the political divide that has slowed breakthrough medical advances such as ethical stem cell research
