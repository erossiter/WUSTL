Sen  Landrieu Statement on Senate CAFTA Passage         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 30 2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement on Senate CAFTA Passage     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today following the Senate s passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   which she opposed  Sen  Landrieu said   For our state  sugar is not simply a trade issue  it is a way of life   Now in its third century  Louisiana s  2 billion sugar industry employs 27 000 people in 15 mills  two refineries and nearly 700 farms in 25 parishes   We cannot speak about the trade implications of this treaty without first and foremost acknowledging the devastating impact it could have on Louisiana jobs  families and economy   This ill advised agreement puts them all at risk   While Governor Blanco and others work to actively create jobs and expand economic opportunity at home  it is disappointing that the President s policies seem to undermine these efforts   On the heels of White House opposition to coastal impact assistance  we are left to wonder whether this Administration has begun to take Louisiana for granted     CAFTA increases subsidized sugar imports and will dramatically undermine the critical balance that helps make the U S  sugar industry profitable   Louisiana sugar growers will give and give  but without any benefits in return   Yet  the President refuses to stand up and fight for these hardworking Americans  jobs   They are instead sacrificed for a pact the Administration s own economists say will increase our trade deficit and barely benefit our economy by one hundredth of one percent   I support free trade  so long as it is fair    and fair free trade requires that all players operate on as level a playing field as possible  accountable to the same labor laws  environmental standards and governmental intervention   Rest assured  I will continue to advocate for policies that preserve this principle and protect our vital Louisiana industries  the jobs they create and the communities they enrich
