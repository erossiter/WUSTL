 A Louisiana Conversation on Social Security Opening Remarks by Sen  Landrieu  As Prepared          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 11 2005     A Louisiana Conversation on Social Security Opening Remarks by Sen  Landrieu  As Prepared  MArch 11  2005   1 30 p m Old State Capital  Baton Rouge  Louisiana    Thank you very much for joining me in this Louisiana conversation on the future of social security   I thank our public officials and our distinguished panelists for joining us this afternoon  I will introduce them to you momentarily  It is worth noting as we begin this dialogue today  that some seeds of social security were sown by the people of Louisiana themselves  For  on February 5th  1934  Louisiana Senator  Huey P  Long went to the floor to introduce to the nation his plan to make  Every Man a King   A national pension system was one of the hallmarks of his agenda   In expressing his intent to provide a  30 pension to everyone over 60  he said   everyone has begun to realize that something must be done for our old people who work out their lives  feed and clothe their children  and are left penniless in their declining years   They should be made to look forward to the mature years for comfort  rather than fear   And so  Huey Long  spurred on by citizens right here in LA  planted the seeds for Social Security in fertile soil of a nation desperate for certainty  weary of risk  and in great need of economic reform   It is indeed fitting  then  that we would meet here to hold this important conversation in Baton Rouge    our state s capital    in the chamber of the Old State Capitol Building  where Senator Long himself held forth  I hope what is said here today will bring light rather than heat to the important debate about strengthening and improving what has become one of the most successful and popular programs in the history of America    What makes Social Security unique and popular is that it is the only universal  portable  defined benefit retirement plan for American workers   Over 95  of all workers in America are covered by it   In contrast  less than 50  of workers are covered by an employer pension through their jobs    Social security is primarily an insurance program   It guards against some of life s most tragic  but common circumstances  It protects against the risk of poverty in old age  against the economic risk of a career ending disability and premature death by providing benefits to the surviving spouse and children of the deceased breadwinners   And it does all of this while spending only one penny of every dollar it takes in to keep the program up and running   That overhead of 1  is not just enviable by government standards  but compares favorably against any similarly sized program in the private sector  One out of every four households  or 731 000 people  in Louisiana receives benefits from Social Security  The vast majority of those  532 000  receive these benefits as retirement benefits  In 2003  the typical retired worker in Louisiana received a monthly social security check of  830 amounting to  9 960 per year  For many individuals  this check represents their only source of retirement income   For others  it serves as a dependable foundation for their retirement portfolio   Without this assistance  nearly 200 000 of our parents and grandparents would be living in poverty   In addition to these individual benefits  it is also worth noting that in 2002   6 6 billion flowed into the Louisiana economy in the form of Social Security checks   That amount is equal to one third of our entire state budget in Louisiana   It is no wonder that with outcomes like these that Social Security is considered so important   In fact  seventy years after its creation  it is the single largest source of retirement income in the United States  While Social Security is an important component of Louisiana s economic security  it is not the only way people in our state save for later years   125 000 retirees in Louisiana are currently receiving benefits from one of our twenty public retirement systems  separate and apart from Social Security  In addition   294 000 have private employer pension plans  103 000 have 401 k s and 100 000 have IRAs   This year alone  2 8 million workers in our state will make investments in their future through social security contributions  private pension plans  public pension plans and private options involving 401 k  s or IRA s    Clearly  the program has served our parents and grandparents well  but young people are asking themselves  will it still work for me   The answer is yes   Here is how  At 22  young Joe or Jane  Boudreaux graduates from LSU and begins working  making  30 000 a year   At age 65  he or she retires  and his income at this time has risen to  150 000   A successful life by most standards   Let s say he lives to the age of 85   When all is said and done  Joe would have paid  250 000 in social security taxes  but over the twenty years of his retirement  he would receive  526 800 in benefits   That is approximately  2 000 a month   26 000 dollars a year   Add this amount to what he has saved in his 401 k  or private employer pension plan  and he will have a secure retirement   The president has described Social Security as  flat bust  and  bankrupt    But that is not what they Congressional Budget Office or the Board of Trustees for Social Security tells us   According to analysts at CBO  a non partisan group of economic analysts   America s Social Security system will be able to pay all of the benefits promised to workers now paying into the system until the year 2052   In other words  without an infusion of cash the system will remain solvent for some 47 years into the future  when President Bush will be 106 years old   So if it is not going broke tomorrow  what can we do today to secure its future   This will be one of the many topics talked about by our panelists today  So there is a problem on the horizon  and the beneficial part of the President s call for privatization is that it has riveted the nation s attention on Social Security at a time when incremental steps taken today could have significant payoffs in the future  In fact  there have been minor and major amendments to the Social Security program all along the way  including most recently  an effort led by President Reagan and Senators Dole and Moynihan in 1983   With a few adjustments  such as stalling the cost of living increase and slowly raising the retirement age  they were able to not only save the program  but to generate surpluses that continue to this day  So this afternoon  we will discuss whether we should essentially continue down the tried and tested road of making incremental changes that strengthen Social Security  or whether we should take the more radical    and some would say risky    approach that the President has laid out   To help facilitate this discussion  and address your questions  I am pleased to be joined today by a panel of experts who can help guide us in our discussion  but most importantly  I am glad to have the opportunity to hear from all of you about what you think should be done   In the words of the grand architect of the social security program  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt   We have come a long way  But we still have a long way to go  There is still today a frontier that remains unconquered  an America unclaimed  This is the great  the nationwide frontier of insecurity  of human want and fear  This is the frontier  the America  we have set ourselves to reclaim
