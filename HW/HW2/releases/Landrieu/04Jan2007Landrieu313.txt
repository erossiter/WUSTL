Landrieu  Melancon Make Hurricane Protection Project First Priority in New Congress         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 04 2007    Landrieu  Melancon Make Hurricane Protection Project First Priority in New Congress Introduce legislation to fully green light Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection     WASHINGTON    In her first piece of legislation of the 110th Congress  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced a bill to fully authorize the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane and storm protection project   Congressman Charlie Melancon  D La   is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives  The series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes will  when complete  serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina   This project is about the life or death of thousands of people  a way of life  and a vital part of our state s economy   said Sen  Landrieu  who with Rep  Melancon and others worked unsuccessfully though the final hours of the 109th Congress to authorize the project  which was originally authorized in the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2000   The bill directed the Army Corps of Engineers to deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31st of that year  but while the recommendation was favorable  it was submitted more than a year late and the authorization expired   Congress has not delivered a new WRDA bill since   The people of Lafourche and Terrebonne have been patient through nearly seven long and challenging years  watching essential hurricane protection be promised to them once  only to be kicked down the field time and time again   Sen  Landrieu said   Over a hundred thousand people in south Louisiana currently have almost no protection from deadly hurricanes and the storm surges and flooding they cause   said Rep  Melancon    Morganza to the Gulf is vitally important to the survival of these communities  They have been levying local taxes on themselves for years to pay for their share of the project and  sadly  the federal government has dragged its feet in doing its part    With this legislation  Senator Landrieu and I hope to fulfill the promise Congress made to the people of Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes seven years ago  and finally move forward with protecting south Louisiana from hurricanes and flooding   Efforts to secure authorization for the Morganza project stretched into the early morning hours of December 9  2006  but were thwarted by a procedural  hold  placed by Senator Tom Coburn  R Okla   Through a spokesman  Sen  Coburn has derided the hurricane protection project and likened it to  pork barrel  spending   Anyone who considers levees to be  pork  clearly doesn t understand the devastation of seeing your home flooded as so many were after hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Sen  Landrieu said    Congress recognized the need for this project more than six years ago  and cannot let its intent be undermined by bureaucratic delays at the Corps of Engineers   Congressman Melancon and I will not give up our fight until this project is made whole again  as the 2000 law directed    Today marks the start of the new 110th Congress  and I think it is important that our first order of business be addressing hurricane and flood protection for south Louisiana   Rep  Melancon said    Pushing forward with building Morganza to the Gulf is a crucial step  and Senator Landrieu and I are renewing our efforts to finally get this project moving   As Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reminded us  we can t afford to put hurricane protection for coastal Louisiana on the back burner any longer   The future of our way of life depends on taking action now   The legislation introduced today would authorize the entire Morganza to the Gulf project  as originally authorized in 2000  at its current estimated cost of  886 7 million  with 65 percent  or about  576 4 million of the amount intended to be funded by the federal government   The legislation also credits any funds already expended by state and local authorities towards the 35 percent non federal share of about  310 3 million
