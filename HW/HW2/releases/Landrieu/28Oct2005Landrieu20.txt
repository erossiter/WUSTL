Sen  Landrieu on White House Hurricane Recovery Proposal         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 28 05    Sen  Landrieu on White House Hurricane Recovery Proposal     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement today regarding a request by President Bush to reallocate  17 billion of the  62 billion previously appropriated by Congress for Gulf Coast hurricane relief by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   Sen  Landrieu said   The one good thing I can say about this proposal is that part of the nearly  40 billion currently collecting dust in FEMA s bank account will now finally be put to use  as I and others have urged for weeks   But the  17 billion in this request falls far short of the blueprint for reconstruction that the President promised the people of the Gulf Coast   We asked for real resources  not an accounting shell game with a wink and nod to possible real commitment down the line   We see a very ugly double standard developing   When it comes to reconstructing Iraq  we don t just rearrange the money already given to cover unmet needs   We time and again send every last penny of what s asked for   and are called anti American if we question the amount     When the President came to Jackson Square  he said   Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation  I as President am responsible for the problem  and for the solution    Mr  President  this is not the solution     30     The United States has provided  28 billion for Iraqi reconstruction   Of that amount  nearly 25 percent has gone unallocated   With  6 7 billion left unspent  Congress has already voted to send an additional  607 million for Iraqi reconstruction this year alone
