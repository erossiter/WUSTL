Landrieu  Lieberman  Coleman Introduce All Students Can Achieve Act         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 07 2007    Landrieu  Lieberman  Coleman Introduce All Students Can Achieve Act Bill improves upon 2001 s No Child Left Behind Act     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   Friday introduced the All Students Can Achieve Act with Sens  Joseph Lieberman  ID Conn   and Norm Coleman  R Minn   The legislation focuses on improving teacher effectiveness and raising education standards for America s students   I was proud to have been a part of developing the No Child Left Behind legislation  which made strides in holding schools accountable and drawing attention to the students who had fallen between the cracks   Sen  Landrieu said    The All Students Can Achieve Act improves NCLB by focusing on the achievements of all students   America s children should be prepared to compete and succeed once they graduate   We need to improve our schools and hold them accountable for the achievement of all students   Though there has been much discussion about No Child Left Behind Act  there has been little action toward the reauthorization of this law   This bill will provide the resources and requirements to improve all of our country s schools   Last month  the Senators were joined at a press conference on Capitol Hill by former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes of the Aspen Institute s Commission on No Child Left Behind  Chancellor Joel Klein of the New York City Public Schools and Chancellor Michelle Rhee of the Washington  DC Public Schools to show their support for the proposal  The legislation aims to improve schools by getting teachers with demonstrated ability to achieve results into the classroom   It seeks to encourage high standards throughout the country and better align the curriculum of schools across America   The proposal focuses on closing the achievement gap by holding schools accountable for the performance of all students and providing resources to address this gap  The bill has been endorsed by the Aspen Institute s bipartisan  independent Commission on No Child Left Behind  Last year  the Commission held numerous public hearings and roundtables across the country and collected written testimony and research from many parents  teachers and administrators  These hearings played a critical role in helping to shape many of the proposals contained in ASCA  Below is a summary of the bill s highlights  Focusing on the achievements of all students  To ensure parents that all students are achieving  states must create comprehensive data systems that track students  academic progress and other factors that affect their success  One of the most important factors in school and student achievement is teachers  The quality of teachers should be determined by their effect on students  learning  not just their qualifications  All students should have effective teachers  Thus  these data systems must link student achievement data to teachers  allowing states to measure teacher effectiveness  States should be held accountable for student achievement  However  students do not progress at the same pace or start in the same place  Thus  states are allowed the flexibility to measure student academic growth  rather than looking at absolute test scores  States are also encouraged to look at merit pay including getting the best teachers to teach in the poorest schools  High expectations for all students  To ensure that all elementary through secondary school students  regardless of where they live  are prepared for success in college or the workplace  states must set high expectations for all students  Academic standards must be designed to prepare students to succeed and assessments must be effective tools to measure students  progress toward meeting these standards  Currently  states often weaken standards and assessments so that more schools and students appear to meet requirements  Voluntary American standards and assessments in reading  math and science would help raise the standards and assessments in states that have set their expectations too low  States will have the flexibility to adopt or adapt the American standards  thereby freeing up state resources for other educational needs  or keep their own standards  which the Secretary of Education would compare with the American standards  In order to ensure that high expectations are held for students from before they begin school to after they graduate  states must establish P 16 Commissions to ensure that state curriculum is aligned to standards that are at an optimum level  This will help to ensure that students graduating from high school succeed in college or the workplace  Closing the Achievement Gap  States need to focus resources on closing the achievement gap  This includes directing their attention to comprehensive interventions where more than 50  of students are not making Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  or focused interventions where less than 50  of students are not making AYP  Federal support for these interventions will increase  New approaches need to be taken to close the gap  Thus  incentive grants will be awarded for innovative teacher and school programs  To ensure that all students are properly measured  current loopholes in the law that allow states to avoid counting students  especially students with disabilities and English language learners  or skew achievement data  are closed  Another important measure of academic achievement is high school graduation rates  which should be tracked and reported for all groups of students
