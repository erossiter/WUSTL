Landrieu Comments on Reduction in Louisiana Homeland Security Funding         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 18 2007    Landrieu Comments on Reduction in Louisiana Homeland Security Funding Louisiana to receive significantly less funding despite need to protect critical infrastructure     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released a statement on the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  announcement that Louisiana would suffer a significant reduction in homeland security grant funding   Through the State Homeland Security Grant Program  SHSGP   Louisiana will this year receive  16 22 million  which is a 21  reduction from last year s  20 76 million in funding  Through the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI   New Orleans was awarded  4 38 million  cut from  4 69 million last year   Baton Rouge was ruled ineligible for UASI grant funding this year due to an arbitrary reduction in the number of eligible urban areas by DHS   Sen  Landrieu wrote to the agency earlier this year to take issue with the urban area reduction and the formula used by the agency to consider risk  In the new Public Safety Interoperable Communications  PSIC  program  which Sen  Landrieu worked to create  Louisiana will receive  19 67 million  comprising 2  of the nearly  1 billion in funding being rewarded nationally  Sen  Landrieu said   Louisiana is home to one of America s most important ports and provides much of the oil and gas infrastructure that fuels the rest of the country   Just as yesterday s National Intelligence Estimate suggests that America is vulnerable to future terrorist attacks  the Department of Homeland Security has stripped vital funding to secure America s only energy coast   It is essential that we protect Louisiana s critical infrastructure  including our military bases  ports and levees   It is particularly upsetting and shortsighted for DHS to reduce essential funding and make Baton Rouge entirely ineligible to receive UASI grants   I will continue to fight to ensure that the federal government contributes its share to safeguarding Louisiana from natural and manmade disasters   Louisiana suffered an insurmountable blow to our communications system during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and the Public Safety Interoperable Communications grant I fought to create is designed to avoid such failures in the future   But the funding allocation demonstrates a lack of foresight by DHS   We must ensure that Louisiana has the full resources we need to effectively communicate in the event of a future disaster
