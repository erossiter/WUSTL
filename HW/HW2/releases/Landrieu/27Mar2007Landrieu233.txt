President Reaffirms Opposition to Hurricane Funding  Fairness         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 27 2007    President Reaffirms Opposition to Hurricane Funding  Fairness Calls vital hurricane protection and recovery spending  excessive and extraneous      WASHINGTON    The White House today released a Statement of Administration Policy reaffirming its opposition to fair hurricane funding rules and levee construction in S  965  the Senate Supplemental Appropriations Bill   U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   secured language in the bill to waive the 10 percent local cost match required of Hurricane Katrina   Rita  and Wilma affected communities for disaster recovery projects   She also secured  1 3 billion to cover a shortfall for east and west bank levee projects in New Orleans and surrounding parishes  which was originally authorized in the 3rd supplemental in 2005  According to the statement   because of the excessive and extraneous non emergency spending it contains  if this legislation were presented to the President  he would veto the bill    Last week  the Administration expressed similar opposition to H R  1591  the House Supplemental Appropriations Bill   It is very disappointing that the Administration continues to hold Louisiana and the Gulf Coast to a different standard than all other disaster stricken communities   Sen  Landrieu said    Our communities withstood an unprecedented disaster  but the Administration continues to oppose giving the region the same funding tools that he gave after 9 11 and his father gave to Hurricane Andrew victims in 1992   This match requirement  and the paperwork it creates  paralyzes the recovery of Louisiana s schools  firehouses and small businesses   The President could remove much of this red tape with a stroke of his pen  and as long as our communities must meet this requirement  recovery will continue to be slow   If the President will not act  I will ensure that this is solved legislatively   The President made a promise to Louisiana that the Federal Government would not abandon Louisiana  but by opposing necessary funding for levee construction in New Orleans  his Administration is helping to leave parts of Louisiana vulnerable to another catastrophe on the scale of Hurricane Katrina or Rita   Simply moving money from one project to another will leave our flood control system inadequate   White House Statement on Administration Policy excerpt regarding the 10 percent match waiver   The Administration opposes a waiver of the State match requirement   The Robert T  Stafford Act requires localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  With local tax bases devastated by the hurricanes and the provision s excessive paperwork requirements for each of the 23 000 public assistance projects in Louisiana alone  the match has become a significant obstacle to Gulf Coast recovery    President Bush has the authority to waive the onerous requirement without legislation when per capita rebuilding costs become excessive    a presidential authority that has been exercised 32 times since 1985  In 1992  President George H  W  Bush waived the requirement when the per capita recovery cost of Hurricane Andrew reached  139  It was also waived for New York City following the attacks of September 11th  where the per capita cost totaled  390  But despite a  6 700 per capita recovery cost following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the Administration has thus far refused repeated requests for such a waiver  prompting Sen  Landrieu s efforts to waive the requirement legislatively  White House Statement on Administration Policy excerpt regarding the  1 3 billion   The Administration opposes the  1 45 billion in unrequested and unnecessary emergency funding the bill provides for work related to Katrina and other 2005 season hurricanes  including the  1 3 billion provided to address increased costs for certain ongoing levee restoration projects that were provided supplemental funding in P L  109 234   When cost overruns created a  1 3 billion shortfall for east and west bank levee projects in the New Orleans area  originally authorized by the 3rd Supplemental bill passed last year  the Bush Administration sought to shuffle the money away from other levee projects authorized in the 4th Supplemental bill  The funds secured by Sen  Landrieu would address the shortfall with direct funding  rather than simply borrowing funds and creating a shortfall in another set of levee projects instead  The entire Statement on Administration Policy is available
