Sen  Landrieu Reaffirms Commitment to Domestic Energy Production  Restoring Louisiana s Coast         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 05 2005    Sen  Landrieu Reaffirms Commitment to Domestic Energy Production  Restoring Louisiana s Coast     LAFAYETTE  LA     Speaking at a meeting of the Lafayette Economic Development Authority here today  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   reaffirmed her commitment to domestic energy production and the protection and restoration of Louisiana s coast   For a great part of our nation s history  we looked to the western frontier for its rich resources and the promise of new economic and military security   Sen  Landrieu said    Before that  this promise was found on the seas   Our oceans have today reemerged as a great frontier capable of helping build a stronger  more secure and more economically stable nation     Sen  Landrieu discussed several related measures she plans to advance through the Senate as it considers the energy bill this month   Among these were two keystones of her comprehensive energy and conservation plan   the Americans Outdoors Act  AOA   first introduced last year with Sen  Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and the Stewardship for our Coasts and Opportunities for Reliable Energy Act  SCORE   a measure she will introduce later this month to strengthen our national economic security and help protect and restore Louisiana s coast     In supporting the production and transportation of 80 percent of our nation s offshore oil supply   Sen  Landrieu said   Louisiana s coast has a tremendous national impact   But coastal erosion in our state presents a direct threat to our national security and the global economy   It is truly America s Wetland    and America faces a national emergency     The Americans Outdoors Act  S  964  is a landmark  multi year commitment to conservation programs that will directly benefit all 50 States and hundreds of local communities   It creates a conservation royalty earned from the offshore production of oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  and directs it towards the restoration of coastal wetlands  preservation of wildlife habitat and the building and maintenance of local and state parks   While the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 shares with states 50 percent of revenues from mineral production on federal lands within each state s boundaries  there is no similar provision for coastal producing states to share federal oil and gas revenues generated on the OCS     In light of the OCS  vital contribution to our nation s energy  economic and national security needs  we should return a share of these revenues to the few states that sustain this critical energy supply   Sen  Landrieu said    In this regard  Louisiana and other coastal producing states are no different than states producing onshore   They each serve as the platforms that support basic elements of our daily lives    turning on our lights  heating our homes and running our commuter trains   AOA would mark the most significant commitment of resources to conservation ever  and builds on an effort made during the 106th Congress that was supported by governors  mayors and a coalition of more than 5 000 organizations throughout the country    This year  Sens  David Vitter  R La   and Tim Johnson  D S D   joined Sens  Alexander and Landrieu as co sponsors of the bill  The SCORE Act would automatically reserve a significant portion of OCS revenues and distribute it to the five coastal energy producing states without production moratoria off their coasts   The distribution to these states    Alaska  Texas  Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama    would be based on each state s energy production  with 35 percent of each state s allocation directed to coastal political subdivisions   From fiscal year 2006 to 2010  OCS revenues would be authorized by Congress to be appropriated to these states   Then  beginning in FY 2011  OCS revenues would be automatically distributed each year and not be subject to the traditional appropriations process   Returning a portion of OCS revenues to Louisiana and other coastal producing states is a crucial first step to restoring and preserving our vital wetlands and the billions of dollars in energy investments they protect   Sen  Landrieu said  The legislation would also direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish seaward lateral boundaries for all coastal states to explore the possibility of offshore energy development  and would allow states with moratoria in place off their coasts to petition the Secretary for a resource assessment of energy sources within their boundaries   With these assessments in hand  state legislatures could then request that any or all of the area within their boundaries be made available for energy leasing    Finally  SCORE would provide the opportunity for innovative  alternative uses of the OCS    including renewable energy projects such as wind  wave and solar     A portion of revenues from this production would be shared with the state off whose coastline the production took place
