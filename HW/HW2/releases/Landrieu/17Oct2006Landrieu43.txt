Landrieu Brings Fight for Offshore Revenue Sharing  to National Audience         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 17 2006    Landrieu Brings Fight for Offshore Revenue Sharing  to National Audience Emphasizes importance of building strong levees     NEW YORK CITY    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today met with the New York Times editorial board to make the case for a dedicated revenue stream for hurricane protection  flood control and wetlands restoration projects in Louisiana  Sen  Landrieu also met with editorial boards at CNN  Fox News and ABC News   Louisianians are well aware of why protecting our coastline is vital to the nation   Sen  Landrieu said   Today I am proud to have taken our fight to the national media s editorial boards  I am hopeful that today s meetings will shine the national spotlight on Louisiana s critical needs and will help push Congress to pass a bill giving Louisiana a significant share of the oil and gas revenues produced off its coast   The two worst hurricanes in American history  Katrina and Rita  tore through our state last year  The lesson of these devastating hurricanes is that we can no longer allow our coastal wetlands  which provide a buffer to storm surges  to continue to erode  Every 33 minutes another acre of wetlands disappears into the Gulf  We need a long term revenue source for levees and coastal restoration  and the Domenici Landrieu bill  which passed with a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate  would provide the necessary funds to protect our people and the exposed energy infrastructure of America s only Energy Coast    The Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  which the Senate passed 71 to 25 on August 1  would open 8 3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to new oil and gas production and share 37 5 percent of new royalties with four Gulf Coast states  Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama  The House also passed a bill containing new drilling and revenue sharing provisions  and Sen  Landrieu is pushing for a resolution between the two chambers during the post election   lame duck  session of Congress so that a bill can be sent to President Bush s desk this year    The Domenici Landrieu bill makes economic sense   Sen  Landrieu said   It would increase our nation s energy supply and reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources  It would decrease energy prices nationwide and reduce the federal deficit nearly  1 billion by 2016  It would also give producing coastal states a significant share of the revenues that would be dedicated to hurricane protection and wetlands restoration   The bill would open domestic drilling that is expected to produce at least 1 6 billion barrels of oil and nearly six trillion cubic feet of natural gas  or six times today s annual U S  imports  Experts believe the natural gas in the region would sustain 1 000 chemical plants for 40 years  providing about 400 000 U S  jobs
