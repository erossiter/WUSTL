Snowe  Landrieu Introduce Small Business Disaster Relief Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 14 2007    Snowe  Landrieu Introduce Small Business Disaster Relief Bill Legislation reduces red tape for SBA loans     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine  Ranking Member and former Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  and Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   a committee member  today introduced the Private Disaster Loan Act   This legislation provides the Small Business Administration  SBA  with the resources necessary to help small businesses and homeowners recover in the wake of a disaster  such as the 2005 hurricanes Katrina and Rita     Victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita faced six to eight month delays waiting for SBA to approve their loans    and even longer to receive their cash   Sen  Landrieu said   It is clear that we need to reform  streamline and strengthen the SBA with better tools to prepare for the next disaster  The bill allows local lenders and credit unions to make direct loans to disaster victims  with an SBA guarantee  This commonsense solution will quickly free up cash for disaster victims and remove the endless red tape that is hampering our recovery    With the SBA at the forefront of disaster relief efforts  it is essential that we find ways to ensure that this country s 25 million small businesses have a resource they can depend on when disaster strikes   Sen  Snowe said    We learned all too well after the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes  it is critical for government programs to run smoothly and efficiently when called upon to aide disaster victims   We can all agree that that there were significant deficiencies with the SBA s disaster response effort  and I believe that we can all agree that this vital legislation will support the SBA in its continuing efforts to ensure those deficiencies are eliminate   The Private Disaster Loan Act would create a new type of disaster loan  which would be issued by private banks with a partial Federal guarantee  rather than being directly provided by the Federal government   Under the proposal  these Private Disaster Loans would have the following characteristics   The loans will be made by private banks  which will have to apply for eligibility  The SBA will provide a guarantee for the loans  and can set the specifics of eligibility criteria  The program will be available to make loans for businesses under the following circumstances  a business will be eligible if the parish or county in which the business is located was declared a disaster area anytime in the last 24 months  The business will not have to show a nexus between its need for a loan  and the disaster that occurred  It will be enough to be located in that parish or county  The business does not have to have been located in the county before the disaster  Maximum loan size will be  2 million  Maximum term will be 25 years  if collateral is involved  otherwise  the maximum term for uncollateralized loans will be 15 years  The maximum guaranty will be 85 percent  no matter the size of the loan  SBA guaranty fee  which is 2    3 5 percent for regular 7 a  loans  will be zero  There will be a loan origination fee  paid to lenders by the SBA using appropriated funds  of an amount previously negotiated between the SBA and the lender  The program will be authorized to use funds appropriated for the standard disaster loan program  and such appropriations will be used to reduce the interest rate in the program by up to 3percent   In other words  if enough appropriations are available  the interest rates charged by banks will be subsidized so that they are reduced by 3 percent   If less appropriations are available  the rates may only be reduced by 2 percent  1 5 percent  zero  etc  The size standard used to determine a borrower s eligibility will be that currently used in the 7 a  program or that used in the 504 loan program  the bank may choose on a case by case basis
