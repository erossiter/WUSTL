Senate Passes Supplemental Spending Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 29 2007    Senate Passes Supplemental Spending Bill Landrieu provisions secure more than  3 billion for Louisiana projects  correct unfair hurricane recovery funding rules and help protect Louisiana from flooding     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate today passed by a vote of 51 to 47 the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill  which includes more than  3 billion in key funding for hurricane recovery and other projects in Louisiana   Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   secured the provisions from her seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee  The Senate also passed key amendments to the spending bill introduced by Sen  Landrieu that would seek a technical review of flood control pumps in the New Orleans area that are reportedly untested or ineffective and would allocate  60 million to recruit teachers and principals to K 12 schools in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and would assist colleges and universities recovering from the storms   Allegations that the Corps of Engineers installed faulty pumps in our flood control system are gravely troubling  and this provision in the supplemental bill will allow the necessary technical review to ensure that our communities are safe from flooding during future hurricanes   Sen  Landrieu said    Louisianians must have confidence that the flood control system will not fail   This review is essential to ensure our communities are made safe   Hurricanes Katrina and Rita drove many of our teachers and principals away from Louisiana because their homes and communities were destroyed   My amendment will provide the necessary incentives to bring teachers and principals back to Louisiana and the Gulf Coast   Without these leaders  our education system will suffer and our students will go without the quality education that every child deserves   Our public school system  colleges and universities are vital components of our recovery  and this provision will give them the resources they need to rebuild stronger than they have ever been before   Last week  Sen  Robert C  Byrd  D W V   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  said   The people of Louisiana have the strength and the spirit to rebuild their homes and their communities   We owe them the support to get the job done   Senator Landrieu is working hard to make sure that the Congress makes good on the promises made to the people of the Gulf Coast  and I will continue to stand with her at every step of the way   FAIR Funding Sen  Landrieu also secured language in the bill that would waive for Katrina  and Rita affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  This provision has been waived 32 times since 1985 when per capita rebuilding costs have been excessive   The local match requirement costs our communities millions that would better be spent recovering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  but it also ensnares them in insurmountable red tape  bringing our recovery to a crawl   Sen  Landrieu said    The President has the authority to move Gulf Coast recovery forward with a single stroke of his pen   But he has refused to use this authority   If he remains unwilling to remove this obstacle to recovery  we must do it legislatively   Disaster Loan Forgiveness Sen  Landrieu secured language in the bill that would make Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness option made available to all other disaster stricken communities  The Stafford Act has historically required forgiveness of such loans when independent audits determine the fiscal recovery of affected local communities is insufficient to repay the loans after a three year grace period   The Federal Government should not hold Louisiana and other Gulf Coast communities to a different standard while we recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Sen  Landrieu said    This bill will remove a significant roadblock to our recovery by correcting a major mistake made in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes   Shortly after the hurricanes  Sen  Landrieu proposed making  1 billion in unspent FEMA funds available for Community Disaster Loans under the same terms as had been afforded to other communities   But the version that was passed in October 2005  sponsored by Senators David Vitter  R La   and Bill Frist  R Tenn   specifically prohibited the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities were unable to pay them back  Levee Funding Sen  Landrieu secured  1 3 billion for east and west bank levee projects in the New Orleans area  When cost overruns created a  1 3 billion shortfall in the projects  originally authorized by the 3rd Supplemental bill passed last year  the Bush Administration sought to shuffle the money away from other levee projects authorized in the 4th Supplemental bill  The funds secured by Sen  Landrieu would address the shortfall with direct funding  rather than simply borrowing funds and creating a shortfall in another set of levee projects instead   Without strong and effective levees  many parts of Louisiana will remain vulnerable to major flooding during and after hurricanes   Sen  Landrieu said    The Administration wants to simply move money from one levee project to another  leaving levees vulnerable   But levees cannot be built or strengthened without the necessary funding   Our communities cannot wait while levee projects remain unfunded   Sen  Landrieu also secured  150 million for the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project  SELA   which provides for engineering  design and construction of projects for flood control and improvements to rainfall drainage systems in Jefferson  Orleans and St  Tammany Parishes  Curbing Crime Sen  Landrieu secured  70 million to curb crime along the Gulf Coast  with  55 million designated specifically to Louisiana   The funding is intended to go to several projects  including nearly  7 million for the New Orleans Common Good program  a plan proposed by a coalition of local civic and business groups  which will give the New Orleans Police Department  NOPD  funding it needs to fight crime as New Orleans continues to recover from Hurricane Katrina   The funding allows the NOPD to hire more officers and give Orleans Parish the ability to hire eight additional prosecutors   Crime remains an obstacle to Louisiana s recovery  but this funding will provide some of the resources our criminal justice system badly needs   Sen  Landrieu said    Safe neighborhoods are essential to our rebuilding  and I will continue to do everything in my power to stem crime in the New Orleans area   The New Orleans anti crime package will also develop an Orleans Parish Information Sharing and Integrated Systems project  The system will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal justice operations by increasing information sharing across agencies  streamlining business processes and promoting transparency and accountability  Of the  55 million that Sen  Landrieu secured to fight crime in Louisiana   38 million is intended to assist the criminal operations of five parishes in south Louisiana   The money would assist the Cameron  Calcasieu  St  Bernard  Plaquemines and Orleans Parish Sheriff s Offices and the NOPD through the Byrne Grant program at the Bureau of Justice Assistance  Other Funding Sen  Landrieu also secured funding in the bill for the following projects  Extension of the deadline to use  150 million in Social Services Block Grants from September 2007 to Sept  30  2008   15 million for additional historic preservation grants in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   10 million to allow local governments to use FEMA funds for utility expenses associated with shelter evacuees for 24 months   65 million for fisheries recovery in Louisiana   25 million for Small Business Administration  SBA  economic injury loans  Extension of Historically Underutilized Business Zone  HUBZone  status to Hurricane Katrina  and Rita affected parishes for two years  which can be extended to three years at the SBA s discretion   30 million in additional funding to help defray expenses incurred by higher education institutions that were forced to close  relocate or curtail their activities as a result of the 2005 hurricanes   This provision also allows the money to be used for grants to students   75 million for Federal Transit grants for operating and capital costs for transit services impacted for Katrina and Rita  which included the LA Swift bus from Baton Rouge to New Orleans and also waived the local cost share  Gulf Coast Public Housing Agencies in areas that received emergency assistance after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will receive allocations based on their 2006 funding   11 million to provide 75  of the cost of replanting trees lost due to natural disasters in excess of 15  mortality under the Tree Assistance Program  and  15 million for crops  including irrigated crops   The crops are covered up to 55 percent of the established price for a given year
