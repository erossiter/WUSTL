Landrieu Secures Local Match Waiver in Hurricane Recovery Bill  Now Headed for President s Signature         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 24 2007    Landrieu Secures Local Match Waiver in Hurricane Recovery Bill  Now Headed for President s Signature Landrieu provisions make disaster loans forgivable  fund levees and fund review of Louisiana flood control pumps     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate today passed the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill by a vote of 80 to 14   The bill includes a provision authored by Sen  Landrieu that would waive the ten percent local match requirement for hurricane recovery projects   The bill now goes to the White House  where the President today signaled his intention to sign the legislation into law despite vetoing a previous version   I am very proud that the work of this Congress has held true to its promise to keep the Katrina Rita money in this Emergency Supplemental Package   said Sen  Landrieu  who as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee was also a member of the conference committee negotiating the final package  said    There was attempt after attempt to take it out   But we fought for it  and it is in there    every penny of it    and it is now going to the President s desk   As discussions between Democratic leaders and the White House intensified over the past week  significant portions of the hurricane recovery package stood in jeopardy   Negotiating into the late evenings this week  however  Sen  Landrieu successfully secured the package s inclusion with the support of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   Democratic Conference Vice Chairman Chuck Schumer  D N Y   House Appropriations Chairman Dave Obey  D Wisc   and House Democratic Whip James Clyburn  D S C  Principal among the bill s hurricane recovery provisions is language secured by Sen  Landrieu that would waive for Katrina  and Rita affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  This provision has been waived 32 times since 1985 when per capita rebuilding costs have been excessive   This was a landmark vote for south Louisiana s continued recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the flooding that followed   Sen  Landrieu said    The local match requirement costs our communities millions of dollars while drowning them in thousands of forms and regulations  Louisiana needs more money and less paper   The insurmountable red tape slows recovery to a crawl  and this bill is a key step to cutting through it   Sen  Landrieu also secured more than  3 billion in key funding and reforms for hurricane recovery and other projects in Louisiana  Disaster Loan Forgiveness Sen  Landrieu secured additional language in the bill that would make Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness option made available to all other disaster stricken communities  The Stafford Act has historically required forgiveness of such loans when independent audits determine the fiscal recovery of affected local communities is insufficient to repay the loans after a three year grace period   Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit our coast  the Federal Government has held Louisiana and other Gulf Coast communities to a different standard during our recovery   Sen  Landrieu said    This bill will fix a major mistake made after the hurricanes by making disaster loans forgivable  removing a significant roadblock to our recovery   Shortly after the hurricanes  Sen  Landrieu proposed making  1 billion in unspent FEMA funds available for Community Disaster Loans under the same terms as had been afforded to other communities   But the version that was passed in October 2005  sponsored by Senators David Vitter  R La   and Bill Frist  R Tenn   specifically prohibited the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities were unable to pay them back  Levee Funding Sen  Landrieu secured  1 3 billion for east and west bank levee projects in the New Orleans area  When cost overruns created a  1 3 billion shortfall in the projects  originally authorized by the 3rd Supplemental bill passed last year  the Bush Administration sought to shuffle the money away from other levee projects authorized in the 4th Supplemental bill  The funds secured by Sen  Landrieu would address the shortfall with direct funding  rather than simply borrowing funds and creating a shortfall in another set of levee projects instead   We must never let what happened after Hurricane Katrina happen again   Sen  Landrieu said    Southeast Louisiana flooded because of the failure of the federal levee system  As we build the levees that protect our state  we must dedicate the necessary funding for levees on both sides of the Mississippi River   But the Administration wants to simply move money from one levee project to another  leaving levees vulnerable  Our communities cannot wait while levee projects remain unfunded   Sen  Landrieu also secured  25 3 million for the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project  SELA   which provides for engineering  design and construction of projects for flood control and improvements to rainfall drainage systems in Jefferson  Orleans and St  Tammany Parishes  Flood Control Pumps In the conference report  Sen  Landrieu secured language that would seek a technical review of flood control pumps in the New Orleans area that are reportedly untested or ineffective   The Government Accountability Office is also investigating the process by which the pumps were installed   Our recovery depends on confidence in our flood control system   Sen  Landrieu said    Reports that the Corps of Engineers installed faulty and untested pumps are gravely troubling   The supplemental spending bill will allow a technical review that will demonstrate what needs to be fixed so that we can make sure our communities are safe from flooding during future disasters   Teacher Recruitment Sen  Landrieu ensured that provisions to fund teacher recruitment in south Louisiana stayed in the bill   The bill allocates  60 million to recruit teachers and principals to K 12 schools in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and would assist colleges and universities recovering from the storms   The 2005 hurricanes left many of our schools without the teachers and principals they need to operate   Sen  Landrieu said    This provision will fund necessary teacher and principal recruitments so that our schools can provide students with the quality education that every child deserves  Without these leaders  our education system will suffer   Curbing Crime Sen  Landrieu secured  50 million to curb crime along the Gulf Coast   The funding is intended to go to several projects  including the New Orleans Common Good program  a plan proposed by a coalition of local civic and business groups  which will give the New Orleans Police Department  NOPD  funding it needs to fight crime as New Orleans continues to recover from Hurricane Katrina   The funding allows the NOPD to hire more officers and give Orleans Parish the ability to hire eight additional prosecutors   Without safe neighborhoods  south Louisianians will be hesitant to return and tourism will continue to stagnate   Sen  Landrieu said    This bill will help give our justice system the resources it needs to keep our streets safe from crime   The New Orleans anti crime package will also develop an Orleans Parish Information Sharing and Integrated Systems project  The system will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal justice operations by increasing information sharing across agencies  streamlining business processes and promoting transparency and accountability  The money would assist the Cameron  Calcasieu  St  Bernard  Plaquemines and Orleans Parish Sheriff s Offices and the NOPD through the Byrne Grant program at the Bureau of Justice Assistance  Other Funding Sen  Landrieu also secured funding in the bill for the following projects  Extension of the deadline to use  150 million in Social Services Block Grants from September 2007 to Sept  30  2008    10 million for additional historic preservation grants in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita    10 million to allow local governments to use FEMA funds for utility expenses associated with shelter evacuees for 24 months    25 million for Small Business Administration  SBA  economic injury loans   Extension of Historically Underutilized Business Zone  HUBZone  status to Hurricane Katrina  and Rita affected parishes for two years  which can be extended to three years at the SBA s discretion    30 million in additional funding to help defray expenses incurred by higher education institutions that were forced to close  relocate or curtail their activities as a result of the 2005 hurricanes   This provision also allows the money to be used for grants to students    35 million for Federal Transit grants for operating and capital costs for transit services impacted for Katrina and Rita  which included the LA Swift bus from Baton Rouge to New Orleans and also waived the local cost share  and  Gulf Coast Public Housing Agencies in areas that received emergency assistance after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will receive allocations based on their 2006 funding
