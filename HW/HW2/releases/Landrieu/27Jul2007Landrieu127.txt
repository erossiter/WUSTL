Senate Passes Homeland Security Spending Bill With Landrieu Language to Protect Louisiana Crawfish Industry          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 27 2007    Senate Passes Homeland Security Spending Bill With Landrieu Language to Protect Louisiana Crawfish Industry  Also includes Landrieu provisions to test FEMA trailers for formaldehyde  fast track school recovery funding and fund emergency preparedness programs     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate last night passed the fiscal 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  which includes language authored by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to enforce tariffs on Chinese crawfish imports   In 2006  Chinese crawfish dumping made up the majority of uncollected dumping duties  comprising  91 8 million of  146 4 million total duties   I cannot begin to tell you how outraged I am about the fact that our government is unable to collect duties that  by law and pursuant to international agreement  must be paid to the United States   Sen  Landrieu  a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  said on the Senate floor yesterday    The problem of non collection feels like a dagger pointed straight at the heart of Louisiana   Our crawfish producers have lost more money from the failure of U S  importers to pay the duties owed by China than any other industry in the nation   In Louisiana  3 300 crawfish producers and 40 processors rely on the crawfish industry for their livelihood  and Customs and Border Patrol has thus far failed to collect nearly  70 million in antidumping duties on crawfish tail meat from China owed to Louisiana crawfish processors and farmers  In the bill  Sen  Landrieu  Chair of the Homeland Security Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  also secured a key amendment that requires Federal Emergency Management Agency Director R  David Paulison to conduct a study of the amount and risk of formaldehyde in FEMA trailers used for temporary housing after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the flooding that followed   In May  Sen  Landrieu sent a letter to Paulison seeking an explanation for the high levels of formaldehyde  a known carcinogen  discovered in FEMA trailers   We must make sure that disaster victims are safe from deadly carcinogens when they rely on the federal government for temporary housing   Sen  Landrieu said    It is gravely troubling that FEMA would distribute trailers that they knew to have unacceptable levels of formaldehyde   This amendment will require a necessary report to determine the health risks in FEMA trailers so that victims    some of whom have lost their homes and all of their possessions    are not housed in a trailer that is dangerous to their health   The amendment jump starts FEMA s testing process by requiring the FEMA Administrator to design a test for an appropriate number of FEMA trailers and mobile homes to determine formaldehyde levels and report on the design to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  HSGAC  and the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee   It requires that the tests be completed within 45 days of the bill s enactment  and the Administrator must report the results to Congress 30 days later  Sen  Landrieu also secured language that allows school districts impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita to receive a single FEMA payment to rebuild schools  School districts have had to go through FEMA s complicated Public Assistance process on a building by building basis    Requiring schools to get FEMA approval for every building drowns them in red tape   Sen  Landrieu said    This provision will expedite school rebuilding and give our students a complete and stable learning environment   Sen  Landrieu also ensured that the legislation requires FEMA to complete flood maps for Katrina and Rita affected communities by October 31  FEMA has twice pushed back the date for completing the maps   These flood maps are vital to help hurricane victims rebuild smarter   Sen  Landrieu said   The recovery effort is being held up because our communities lack accurate information   The Senate also passed an amendment co sponsored by Sen  Landrieu that would fortify the U S  border against the entry of illegal immigrants   Securing our borders from illegal aliens is of paramount importance to protecting our homeland   Sen  Landrieu said yesterday    We face many threats from abroad  and  for the safety of the American people  we must take the necessary steps to ensure our southern border is impermeable   Other Landrieu provisions in the bill include   700 million for firefighter grants  which was an increase of  400 million beyond the president s request   375 million for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  The president s budget request zeroed out the program   300 million for Emergency Management Performance Grants  the nation s planning program for all types of hazards  This is an increase of  100 million beyond the President Bush s budget request   145 million for the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium   We must invest in the programs that will protect us from disasters  be they natural or manmade   Sen  Landrieu said   I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Appropriations and Homeland Security committees to fund  reform and reinforce programs that keep us safe
