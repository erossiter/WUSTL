Landrieu Concerned by Corps  Levee Report Delay  Administration Editing         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 30 2006    Landrieu Concerned by Corps  Levee Report Delay  Administration Editing     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   expressed concern today after the Army Corps of Engineers missed a deadline for presenting to Congress a preliminary report outlining the engineering steps necessary for Category 5 hurricane protection in coastal Louisiana   Missing a deadline for submitting such a vital report to Congress would be cause for concern entirely on its own   Sen  Landrieu said    But even more troubling is that this delay appears to be the result of highly unusual attempts to present scientific analysis through a political screen   Amid reports that the White House Office of Management and Budget was reviewing the Corps  technical findings as they relate to Administration policy  Sen  Landrieu yesterday secured report language accompanying the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill that directs the Administration to submit results of technical findings  not those varnished by Administration policy goals  Despite this unanimous and bipartisan direction from the Senate Appropriations Committee  Sen  Landrieu s office has learned that one cause of the delay is that the Administration is proceeding with significant policy driven changes to the technical report   The intent of the Senate Appropriations Committee was clear  both when it ordered this study at my request six months ago  and when it added yesterday more direct language as to our expectations   Sen  Landrieu said    We are looking to the Corps to present their best analysis of what steps need to be taken to protect the people  communities and national infrastructure along Louisiana s coast    not another policy paper from the Administration     I strongly urge the Administration to deliver to Congress the unvarnished facts and recommendations we requested  and am prepared to take steps to ensure that we receive an unfiltered analysis   In a letter this evening by Louisiana officials who worked with the Corps to develop the original draft  the state reported that  the rewriting of the report by the Administration  inserting policy statements  has been done in a way that seems unprecedented in our history of working with the Corps    The officials also reported that the  policy review resulted in the rewriting of the entire executive summary and much of the report  without consultation with the Corps State Project Delivery Team
