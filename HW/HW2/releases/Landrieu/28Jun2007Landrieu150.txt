Landrieu Votes No on Immigration Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 28 2007    Landrieu Votes No on Immigration Bill     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement after voting against a cloture motion on S  1639  the immigration bill  which failed 46 53  This procedural motion ended debate on the bill  signaling the Senate s opposition  Sen  Landrieu said   Today  for the fifth time  I voted against this immigration bill because it would take our country down the wrong path  The guest worker program encouraged people to break the law and did little to help our employers  Illegal immigrants would all too easily gain citizenship while legal immigrants and their families were not afforded the same rights   This bill was also supposed to be carried out by the Department of Homeland Security  which already struggles with its current responsibilities and botched  in so many ways  the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  There is no way this agency could have shouldered its responsibilities under this bill   Congress does need to find a way to realistically and methodically secure our borders  We also need to ensure that businesses have enough available workers  particularly as the Gulf Coast recovers from the 2005 hurricanes  But this bill was not the way  and would have done little to solve the illegal immigration problem in the United States
