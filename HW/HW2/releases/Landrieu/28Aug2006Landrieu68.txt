Landrieu Posts Travel Diary Entry on Day in New Orleans         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 28 2006    Landrieu Posts Travel Diary Entry on Day in New Orleans     NEW ORLEANS    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today posted an entry to her travel diary of her  Hope and Recovery Tour  of coastal Louisiana on her day in New Orleans  All of her entries appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  http   www bayoubuzz com   a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  On the road to Houma  Sen  Landrieu wrote   Today was truly a day of hope and recovery  reopening and rebuilding   We returned this morning to C  Ray Bergeron s gas station and auto repair shop in Lakeview  where a crew from Bloomberg TV was preparing a news story about small businesses recovering after the hurricanes and levee breaks   Then it was on to New Orleans East  and a visit to DIMHRS    the facility that handles the behind the scenes management of our military payroll   Finally  we enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Caf   Reconcile in Central City  which  even before the disasters  was giving new hope to its central city location   These three New Orleans businesses differ in size and location  in the type of work that they do  and in the people they serve   But what they have in common is that they each represent the backbone of our recovery   Mr  Bergeron s shop has for many years been a gateway to the neighborhood  and today it is a gateway to its future   On this street corner  where Tony Angelo s restaurant is located  and still closed  the Fleur de Lis Car Care Center is one place where life is beginning to return to normal   While I did an interview with Bloomberg TV  Mr    Bergeron was hard at work filling gas  checking oil  and greeting with a handshake and a smile the customers he has been serving all this time   The more things change  the more they stay the same    and it is the constants  like Mr  Bergeron  that will rebuild our local neighborhoods   The DIMHRS facility was flooded  primarily by rainwater  when Hurricane Katrina rolled ashore a year ago tomorrow   Today  their doors are open again   Louisiana has always played a key role supporting our military  from the forces stationed here to the ships we build at Avondale and the Armored Service Vehicles Textron builds in plants around the state   But many don t realize that we do so much more  including managing the entire back office of the Defense Department s personnel operation   This is why our Federal City project is so important  bringing together all our federal service operations    including  potentially  the Joint Reserve Headquarters and regional Coast Guard and Homeland Security operations    in one place   It will allow us to continue serving the nation  while doing it in the most efficient way possible   After years of our commitment to service  the Pentagon showed a commitment to us by keeping DIMHRS here despite the damage    and we hope that same commitment will extend to building the Federal City   Caf   Reconcile nourishes the community with not only great local food  but also with a serving of true neighborliness   The caf   does so much good work to bring new hope to our city that I was proud to facilitate a Justice Department grant of  500 000 to support its job training program   Here 16  to 21 year olds are trained in the culinary arts  taught the basics of customer service    which are not far from good citizenship  when you think about it     and are given the support and mentoring they need   They are helping to rebuild our workforce while keeping our youth on a better path for life   Today s reopening marks so much more than the reopening of a single restaurant  but the start to rebuilding the lives of all they touch   I was so proud to be a part of it  and left with both my heart and stomach full   Across Louisiana  businesses large and small are helping to stand up and breathe new life into our communities   Many have done it with the help of the Small Business Administration  even though they have assisted fewer than 7 000 of the more than 20 000 small businesses devastated by the hurricanes and levee breaks   Under new leadership  the SBA is improving    but not fast enough   Like FEMA  the SBA s response continues to be hampered by what seems to be an unlimited roll of red tape   We need to do better  and from my seat on the Senate Small Business Committee  I will keep fighting for Louisiana small businesses   Our small business owners are the pillars that will stand up the new Louisiana  and the last thing they need is bureaucratic paper shuffling and governmental delay  They define the true meaning of individual initiative  free enterprise and entrepreneurship   Over the last few months  I have seen real progress and recovery in every damaged part of our state   But one spot in New Orleans has seen particularly rapid change   Near the corner of Harrison Avenue and Pontchartrain Boulevard stands a lovely  new yellow house   They broke ground less than six weeks ago  and the home will be ready to move into    fully furnished    this Thursday   What s often called  modular homes   when built according to local design standards  with quality workmanship and sturdy construction  offer a viable alternative to stick built housing for our region  They go up fast  often cost less  and are completed on site by local contractors and workers  Louisiana needs to attract these housing manufacturers to our state  so that we can get the full economic benefit and jobs from the enormous amount of building that will be done in coastal Louisiana over the next few years  We have more than 200 000 homes to replace  and we need all the innovation  and speed  we can get   The yellow house is being built right next to one built in 1910 New Orleans  past  and its future  standing side by side   And on that note  I have said before that the reason I have so much faith in our recovery is because I have so much confidence in the vibrant spirit of our people   Our people are tough  They re survivors  They make things happen  Generation after generation of Louisiana families still live only blocks away from each other  often in longtime family homes   Our people don t flee from challenges   We don t give up   This was perhaps best illustrated today at the Monteleone Hotel  where  Hotel Al   the hotel s shuttle van driver  today celebrated his 47th year on the job  A lot of Louisianians are a lot like Al   And we re not going anywhere
