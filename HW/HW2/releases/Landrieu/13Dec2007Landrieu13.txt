Landrieu Supports Revised Energy Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 13 2007    Landrieu Supports Revised Energy Bill New proposal makes  wise steps  without leaving Louisiana  footing the bill      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   tonight released the following statement after voting for an energy bill that promotes greater American energy independence and efficiency   The measure passed by an overwhelming 86 to 8 margin  Earlier today  Sen  Landrieu had cast the sole Democratic vote opposing a proposal that would have left Louisiana industry footing the multi billion dollar bill for the new policies   In an otherwise largely party line vote of 59 to 40  supporters of the legislation came just one vote short of the 60 required to move forward    Following this evening s vote  Sen  Landrieu said   Tonight the Senate passed the most comprehensive overhaul in years of the nation s fuel economy standards and incentives for renewable fuels  These are wise steps worth taking to move the United States closer to energy independence  and I am proud to join the bipartisan consensus of 86 senators supporting them   This package is a significant improvement over legislation we successfully defeated this morning  which would have left Louisiana footing the bill for the nation s progress  One sided policymaking solves few problems  and America s path forward depends on a comprehensive  balanced approach to energy conservation and domestic production   We must invest in smart energy solutions for the future  but not at the expense of the states that strengthen our energy security today
