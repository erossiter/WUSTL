Landrieu Comments on New Geological Survey         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 04 2006    Landrieu Comments on New Geological Survey Study finds that Louisiana lost 217 square miles of coastline to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita     WASHINGTON    The United States Geological Survey  USGS  today announced that Louisiana has lost 217 square miles of its coastline due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year   The area lost    nearly double earlier estimates    is larger than the entire city of New Orleans  and it is equivalent in size to three times the land area of Washington  D C   U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today reacted to the USGS s National Wetlands Research Center s findings by emphasizing the need for coastal restoration  Sen  Landrieu said   These findings underscore what I and other have been saying for many years  America needs to make a massive commitment to protect and restore our wetlands   Stronger wetlands and barrier islands can save lives and protect our people from hurricanes  They provide the first line of defense against storm surges and are essential to an integrated hurricane and flood protection system   For every 2 4 miles of wetlands  storm surge is reduced by a foot   In addition to the risk of loss of life and property in Louisiana and other Gulf states  coastal erosion presents a direct threat to America s national security and economy by exposing our energy infrastructure  We must meet this threat with the sense of urgency a national problem of this magnitude demands   Louisiana already lost 1 900 square miles of coastal lands between 1932 and 2000  and the land loss from the 2005 hurricanes represents nearly half the predicted land loss for the next 50 years   This is why we need the federal government to share with Louisiana the revenues from our offshore oil and gas production to be used for hurricane protection and coastal restoration   The Domenici Landrieu bill  which the Senate passed this summer  will give Louisiana a long term funding stream to restore our coast and build strong levees   Now is the time to secure our coast and this new USGS study clearly strengthens Louisiana s cause for a major national commitment to wetlands restoration and protection
