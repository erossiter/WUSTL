Landrieu  Snowe Convene Common Ground Coalition         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 11 2007    Landrieu  Snowe Convene Common Ground Coalition Senators Want to Build on Success of  Gang of 14      WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine  today convened a bipartisan  consensus building group  the Common Ground Coalition  that will build on the success of the  Gang of 14     the bipartisan group that averted a Senate shutdown over judicial nominations in the spring of 2005  This group will forge consensus on key issues in the 110th Congress    So many meetings around Capitol Hill are about Democrats finding ground or Republicans finding ground   Sen  Landrieu said   This group is about finding common ground for the American people  I am proud to chair with Senator Snowe the Common Ground Coalition  which provides a venue for advocating bipartisan ideas   Sen  Landrieu said   In keeping with the success of the  Gang of 14   this bipartisan caucus will work to ensure sensible policies from the political center are a formidable force in the U S  Senate    The influence and success of this bipartisan group comes from the willingness of Senators from both parties to reach across the aisle to exchange ideas and discuss real solutions to the real challenges facing Americans   Sen  Snowe said    I am proud to be working along side Senator Landrieu as we work to find common ground in the Senate on important issues   Below is the text of a December 18 letter inviting Senators to join the bipartisan group  December 18  2006 Dear Colleague   We are writing to invite you to a meeting to reconstitute a group or caucus to bring together members of the Senate   both Democrats and Republicans   who may wish to work together across party lines  to forge bipartisan consensus on key issues  This kind of  coming together  proved successful with the efforts of the so called  Gang of 14  on judicial nominations  for example  On many important issues  there is more common ground than is often realized  It is therefore critical that the Senate has a constructive  independent  bipartisan force that works to bring both sides together to solve America s pressing problems  That is what this group intends to do  We fully understand that there will often be legitimate philosophical differences between us on many issues  We each have our own deeply held principles we intend to honor and we each have a responsibility to represent the interests of our own states  But the American people want us to work together whenever possible to find reasonable solutions on serious issues  They are tired of the extremes on both sides pulling us apart  paralyzing effective action  That was a clear message of the 2006 elections  It is our intention to meet regularly at lunch  and hopefully identify one consistent meeting room for that purpose  to discuss current and upcoming issues on which we may want to work together   and  at the first meeting  we propose discussing both the frequency of meetings and also the name for this group going forward  Additionally  we would have special meetings when needed  We would also welcome the participation of members of the Senate who may not regularly meet with us but who may join want to join us to work together on specific issues of mutual concern  Our first meeting will be held on Thursday  January 11  at 4 00 pm   We will follow up with a location  which will be a meeting room   We hope you are able to attend  We want to emphasize that while many of us may not always find ourselves in agreement with our party s caucus on some issues  it is not the intent of this group to undermine each party s leadership or the Senate committees  In fact  we hope that our work will actually strengthen the effectiveness of each party s caucus by providing an influence within each of them to facilitate action and bipartisan consensus on vital issues  We also look forward to working with the new Bipartisan Members Group  which is being organized by Lamar Alexander  Joe Lieberman and others  The Bipartisan Members Group intends to bring together in social settings members of both parties and every ideological persuasion to help build relationships  This  too  is a good idea  While different from the consensus building  issue oriented group we re planning  the aims of fostering civil discussion and creating new avenues of cooperation are all complementary  As we look forward to working together in the new Congress  we are Sincerely  Olympia Snowe L  Landrieu
