Sen  Landrieu Applauds House Passage ofTax Relief for Potential Disaster Victims         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 14 2005    Sen  Landrieu Applauds House Passage ofTax Relief for Potential Disaster Victims Bill Includes Landrieu Sponsored Senate AmendmentThat Guarantees All Homeowners Will Be Covered    WASHINGTON    Sen  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today applauded the U S  House of Representatives for passing a measure that will ensure that homeowners will not be taxed on disaster mitigation grants  regardless of when they were received   The bill passed the House last month  but without affording this protection to families receiving aid last year   Landrieu joined Sens  Max Baucus  D Mont   and Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  in adding a retroactivity amendment last night  ensuring that thousands of flood  and other disaster vulnerable homeowners who received this aid in 2004 and other years will not be taxed   I am glad the House joined the Senate today in guaranteeing that no Louisiana homeowners will be left out of this very important tax relief   Sen  Landrieu said    The bill now  with our retroactivity amendment included  goes much further than the wink and nod promises from the IRS the House relied upon the first time they passed it   It provides those receiving grants last year with the confidence they will not be taxed on those grants  and leaves no room for IRS misinterpretation    I urge the President to sign this legislation as soon as possible and finally give homeowners the peace of mind they deserve as they file their taxes tomorrow   As originally passed in the House and introduced in the Senate  H R  1134 stated that the tax free status of grants  shall apply to amounts received after the date of the enactment of this Act    The Baucus Grassley Landrieu amendment modified this clause to apply  to amounts received before  on  or after the date of the enactment    emphasis added  Supporters of the un amended bills had suggested the IRS would apply the relief retroactively even though the bills provided a specific cut off date   But despite a formal request last week from Sens  Landrieu  Baucus and Bill Nelson  D Fla    the Treasury Department refused to provide written guarantees of their intent and legal authority to apply the relief to past year recipients  About 20 percent of Louisiana s coastal zone lies below sea level  including 80 percent of New Orleans  and 377 000 Louisiana property owners participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency s National Flood Insurance Program   The program provides flood mitigation assistance in the form of grants to local governments    grants which may then used to protect at risk homes   The IRS ruled in June 2004 that these grants were legally taxable  even though they are usually paid directly to the contractor performing the mitigation work  and not the homeowners themselves  Sen  Landrieu has fought to ensure the non taxable status of these grants since last year  having offered her measure for inclusion in the omnibus appropriations bill and more recently in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act   On March 9  she introduced S  583  a separate bill that would also have provided the relief retroactively   She later co sponsored the Senate version of H R  1134    S  586    once it was introduced  while continuing to highlight the need for retroactivity
