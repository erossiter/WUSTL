Senate Passes Labor HHS Bill with  7M  for La          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 24 2007    Senate Passes Labor HHS Bill with  7M  for La  Includes Landrieu amendment to restore children s mental health funding     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate last night passed 75 19 the Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  and Education Appropriations bill  H R  3043  that includes  7 1 million for Louisiana projects secured by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La  The bill also includes a Landrieu amendment to restore priority grant funding to centers that provide mental health services to children affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita   There is an incredible  pressing need for mental health services in areas hit by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   said Sen  Landrieu  an Appropriations Committee member   But SAMSHA decided to ignore Congress  intent and defund a successful mental health program  which was just shy of the agency s target score  This is just not acceptable  I authored clear language in this appropriations bill for the agency to consider children in Katrina and Rita affected areas to be the No  1 priority for mental health care grants   The Louisiana Rural Trauma Services Center  managed by Louisiana State University    had received funding for four years to aid children faced with traumatic stress  But the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   which awards the grants  decided to determine this year s grantees by selectively picking and choosing among recommended scoring methods in a bill passed by the Senate last year  By including some of Congress  intent  while ignoring a Landrieu backed directive to give priority to programs that help children in the hurricane affected area  the agency excluded the Louisiana program from being chosen  Sen  Landrieu s amendment would give first priority for Child Trauma Stress Network grant funding included in the bill to established grant recipients  like LSU  who provide assistance to Katrina  and Rita affected children  Sen  Landrieu  Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  called the directors of SAMHSA and LSU to testify on October 31 at a subcommittee hearing on Gulf Coast mental health care   The full bill also includes a number of hurricane recovery projects secured by Sen  Landrieu  including  1 5 million to fund the infrastructure development of the St  Bernard Health Center  which was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina       Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed much of the infrastructure in South Louisiana  including many of our health facilities   Sen  Landrieu said   St  Bernard Parish was particularly hard hit during the storm because of the federal levee breaks and flooding that followed the storm  Rebuilding health facilities in the parish is critical to its long term recovery   Sen  Landrieu also secured  1 million for the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness to purchase equipment and supplies for a mobile medical hospital   When a disaster strikes  we must be flexible in our response  and this mobile hospital will get medical help to those who need it in a swift and effective way   she said  Sens  Landrieu and Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   have also secured a commitment from Labor  HHS and Education Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Tom Harkin  D Iowa  to fight for charter school funding in conference  which is where the Senate bill and House bill will reconcile differences before being sent to President Bush  Sen  Landrieu also inserted language to push the Department of Health and Human Services to better communicate that Medicare does not pay for long term care  which many people are not aware of   Other Louisiana projects in the bill include  Early Childhood and Family Learning Center Foundation  New Orleans    500 000 to establish a comprehensive early childhood center  Children s Coalition for Northeast Louisiana  also know as Teen Screen   250 000 to expand a nationally recognized  community based mental illness screening program for middle school youth  Pointe Coup  e Better Access
