Our  12 Billion Day         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 08 2007    Our  12 Billion Day House  Senate pass  3 billion Landrieu measure to fix Road Home  override President s veto of water bill with  7 billion for state     WASHINGTON     The United States Senate late tonight unanimously approved a defense bill which includes  3 billion secured by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to help close an estimated  3 to  4 5 billion funding shortfall in Louisiana s Road Home housing recovery program   The passage followed the successful override this morning of the President s veto of the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   which authorizes  7 billion in Louisiana coastal protection projects and secures avenues of commerce throughout the state and nation   Today was a truly historic   12 billion day for Louisiana   said Sen  Landrieu  a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee    Congress made a  3 billion pledge to Louisiana homeowners to ensure they receive their Road Home grants to rebuild and recover   Republicans and Democrats joined together to buck the President s opposition to the WRDA bill  marking the first veto override of this presidency   The support shown for Louisiana tonight is a powerful demonstration of this Congress  commitment to fully funding out state s rebuilding from the 2005 hurricanes and levee failures  We are grateful for the steadfast partnership shown by the many Senators without whom tonight s victory would have been impossible   The Road Home funds were included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Conference Report  a  471 billion compromise between Defense Department funding bills passed by the Senate and House of Representatives earlier this year   The bill  which includes  2 billion in Louisiana projects secured by Sen  Landrieu  passed the House in a 400 to 15 vote this afternoon and now goes to the President for his signature    PAVING THE ROAD HOME Sen  Landrieu worked closely with Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd  D W V   Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Patty Murray  D Wash   and other committee colleagues to secure the Road Home funds     Senators Byrd and Murray and the Senate Leadership have been essential partners in our effort to make the Road Home whole  standing with Louisiana through our long struggle to rebuild   Sen  Landrieu said    Tonight  I am very grateful that colleagues on both sides of the aisle followed this example and rejected intense partisan pressures of recent days to move Louisiana s interests forward     In 2005 and 2006  Louisiana s share of rebuilding funds was unfairly capped at 54 percent despite our having suffered more than 70 percent of the damage from the hurricanes and levee breaks   The President was wrong to insist on that unfair treatment then  and I urge him to set it right by signing this bill into law now   The legislation also funds federal government operations through December 14 at the levels authorized for fiscal year 2007  which ended October 1   Without this Continuing Resolution  the federal government would be shut down late next week    SUPPORTING OUR ARMED FORCES Among defense related projects in the bill  Sen  Landrieu secured more than  2 billion in projects for Louisiana  including  287 million for Armored Security Vehicles  ASVs  to be produced in the New Orleans area by Textron  Inc    The vehicles are proven to be more effective than up armored Humvees for protecting U S  forces from Improvised Explosive Devices  IEDs   or  roadside bombs     It also included  4 million Sen  Landrieu inserted for the 8th Air Force Cyberspace Innovation Center for Cyber Combat Development  or  Cyber Command   at Barksdale Air Force Base   She also secured  1 45 billion to continue construction on the LPD 17 Class of Expeditionary Warfare Ships  The LPD 25 and 26 ships  respectively the 9th and 10th in the class  will be built at Avondale Shipyard near New Orleans  with LPD 25 now fully funded   Louisiana has for generations provided strong homefront support for our brave men and women in the armed services  and this bill reiterates that long standing partnership   Sen  Landrieu said   ASVs keep our soldier s safe from roadside bomb attacks  and I am proud that this bill is keeping ASVs rolling out of the Textron plants in Louisiana  It also buttresses our efforts to fight new wars in cyberspace  and promotes job growth in the New Orleans area while we provide the best in naval technology and engineering for our Sailors   PROTECTING OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND SECURING AVENUES OF COMMERCE ACROSS LOUISIANA The WRDA bill easily met the two thirds majority threshold set by the U S  Constitution for overriding a Presidential veto  passing the Senate in a 79 to 14 vote today and the House by 361 to 54 yesterday   It is only the 107th time in U S  history that a veto has been rejected by Congress   The bill now becomes law    the first WRDA bill enacted in seven years despite historical requirements for new WRDA bills every two years   At about 10 minutes after 12 pm eastern time today  green lights went on all over south Louisiana  and the stop signs and the red lights came down   Sen  Landrieu said at a press conference after the vote today   We started to turn dirt  restore wetlands and build levees  We started to build the foundation that we need for strong economic resurgence in south Louisiana and the Gulf Coast   Congress kept its promise to the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast when it enacted the Water Bill today  making it law   This is a strong infrastructure bill for our nation  and provides an historic commitment to Louisiana  still in the midst of a difficult recovery    The legislation includes Louisiana Coastal Area  LCA  Ecosystem Restoration  which authorizes the Corps of Engineers to implement 16 coastal restoration projects totaling nearly  1 9 billion  It expedites closure of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet  MRGO  and provides relocation assistance to business along the canal   WRDA authorizes key hurricane protection projects  including the first steps toward the 100 year protection in the Larose to Golden Meadow project and  886 million for Morganza to the Gulf  The Morganza project is a series of levees  locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes that will  when complete  serve to protect approximately 200 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina  The bill also expedites Category 5 hurricane protection projects
