Senators Alexander  Landrieu Honor Teddy Roosevelt s Conservation Legacy  Reintroduce Americans Outdoors Act         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 16  2005    Senators Alexander  Landrieu Honor Teddy Roosevelt s Conservation Legacy  Reintroduce Americans Outdoors Act Bill marks most significant federal commitment of resources to conservation ever     WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and Mary L  Landrieu  D La   visited the Teddy Roosevelt Memorial on Virginia s Roosevelt Island today to honor the president s lasting legacy of conservation and to announce the recent reintroduction of the Americans Outdoors Act  AOA   The Americans Outdoors Act  S  964  is a landmark  multi year commitment to conservation programs that will directly benefit all 50 states and hundreds of local communities   It creates conservation royalties earned from the offshore production of oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  and directs them towards the restoration of coastal wetlands  preservation of wildlife habitat and the building and maintenance of local and state parks     The Great American Outdoors is an essential part of the American character   said Sen  Alexander    Italy has its art  Egypt has its pyramids  England has its history  And we have the Great American Outdoors  This legislation looks ahead for a generation to make sure we have places to enjoy our outdoors  This bill would fully fund already existing programs for wildlife conservation  which will benefit hunters and fisherman  birdwatchers  walkers  bikers and all Americans who enjoy outdoor recreation  It would fully fund city parks  so children can have decent  clean places to play  It would also protect wetlands    With this legislation  we can make the most significant dedication of resources to conservation this nation has ever made and ensure a positive legacy of protecting and enhancing our cultural  natural and recreational resources for generations to come   Sen  Landrieu said   Although the federal government has time and again said it would fully fund these initiatives  these programs have instead been shortchanged  under funded or left out altogether  It is time to move past that kind of thinking and provide reliable  steady and significant funding for the urgent conservation and outdoor recreation needs of our states and cities   The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 already shares with states 50 percent of revenues from mineral production on federal lands within each state s boundaries   These funds are distributed to states automatically  outside the budget process and not subject to appropriations   But there is no similar provision for states to share offshore oil and gas revenues generated on the OCS   The Americans Outdoors Act would be paid for by what I think of as a  conservation royalty    Sen  Alexander said    It is modeled after the state royalty for onshore drilling that has been in existence since the 1920 s  in which 50 cents of every dollar goes to the state in which drilling occurs  In a similar way  this would create a conservation royalty of about 25 percent for revenues collected from oil and gas drilling on offshore federal lands    In supporting the production and transportation of 80 percent of our nation s offshore oil supply  Louisiana s coast has a tremendous national impact   Sen  Landrieu said    Our coast is truly America s Wetland    and America faces a national emergency  Returning a portion of OCS revenues to Louisiana and other coastal producing states is a crucial first step to restoring and preserving our vital wetlands and the billions of dollars in energy investments they protect    HONORING PROMISES MADE LONG AGO TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AOA dedicates assured funding for four distinct programs   They include    Coastal Impact Assistance    This program acknowledges the impact to and contribution of the states that provide the bulk of our nation s energy   It directs  450 million to oil and gas producing coastal states without moratoria off their coasts to provide for wetland restoration and mitigate the various impacts of serving as the platform for developing offshore energy resources  nbsp   Land and Water Conservation Fund  LWCF     AOA would provide greater revenue certainty for state and local governments by allocating  450 million for the state side of the LWCF to fund the planning and development of parks and recreation facilities   Of this funding  60 percent would be divided equally among all 50 states and 40 percent would be distributed relative to population   nbsp  Wildlife Conservation  Education and Restoration     350 million would be allocated to all 50 states through the successful Pittman Robertson program for the conservation of non game and game species  with the principal goal of preventing species from becoming endangered or listed under the Endangered Species Act   nbsp  The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program  UPARR      125 million in matching grants  70   would provide direct assistance to our cities and towns so they may focus on the need to provide more green spaces  playgrounds and athletic fields for our youth in the more densely inhabited areas of the country   Sen  Alexander  chairman of the Energy Subcommittee  served as chairman of President Reagan s Commission on Americans Outdoors  which recommended many of these programs  including offshore oil drilling to fully fund federal and state conservation programs  Sen  Landrieu  a member of the Senate Energy Committee  has championed direct and dedicated federal funding for coastal restoration and conservation efforts since being elected in 1996   She has been a passionate voice for her state and a strong advocate for a common sense approach to our nation s energy needs   Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   said last week   BUILDING ON WIDESPREAD SUPPORT The legislation builds on an effort made during the 106th Congress that was supported by governors  mayors and a coalition of more than 5 000 organizations throughout the country    Research has shown that accessibility to trails and recreation opportunities are directly related to increased physical activity and thus healthier Americans   said Frank Hugelmeyer  president of Outdoor Industry Association  which last month honored Sens  Alexander and Landrieu with its Friend of the Outdoor Industry Award for their work on AOA    We stand united to endorse the power and promise of this major legislative vehicle to reduce inactivity and promote health and wellness through increased access to quality parks and recreation    The U S  Soccer Foundation and the U S  Soccer Federation member organizations  including U S  Youth Soccer  U S  Adult Soccer  and the American Youth Soccer Organization  enthusiastically support the passage of the Americans Outdoors Act   U S  Soccer Foundation President John Koskinen said    The reason for our support is clear  the LWCF has played an integral role in creating and developing our nation s parks and recreation spaces    HONORING THEODORE ROOSEVELT S LEGACY OF CONSERVATION Teddy Roosevelt visited Louisiana s barrier islands in 1915  but much of the landscape he visited no longer exists  having been washed away by coastal erosion  In the past 50 years alone  Louisiana s size has been reduced by an area larger than that of Rhode Island    Reflecting on his visit  Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography  A Book Lover s Holidays in the Open   To lose the chance to see frigate birds soaring in circles above the storm  or a file of pelicans winging their way homeward across the crimson afterglow of the sunset  or a myriad terns flashing in the bright light of midday as they hover in a shifting maze above the beach    why  the loss is like the loss of a gallery of the masterpieces of the artists of old time    Roosevelt was a president committed enough to his dream of conservation that he traveled to a small and distant group of barrier islands off the coast of Louisiana to see firsthand the affected land and wildlife   Sen  Landrieu said    Unfortunately  even with the efforts of conservation visionaries like Roosevelt  the story of the past 100 years has been one of continued coastal and wildlife losses   Consider that Battledore Island  where Roosevelt went to connect with nature  is no more   Today  fishermen know it as Battledore reef   It is too late for Battledore Island  but it is not too late to save countless other natural treasures around our nation   Today we have an opportunity to carry on Roosevelt s conservation legacy and write a different ending to the story he began so long ago   Video and photographs from today s event and Roosevelt s 1915 Louisiana visit are available from the offices of Sens  Alexander and Landrieu  as are additional excerpts of Roosevelt s autobiography
