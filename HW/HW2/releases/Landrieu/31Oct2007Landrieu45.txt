Landrieu Chairs Hearing on Post Hurricane Mental Health         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 31 2007    Landrieu Chairs Hearing on Post Hurricane Mental Health Examines growing crisis on Gulf Coast     WASHINGTON    Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Chairman Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today held a hearing on the growing mental health care needs in the Gulf Coast and the lack of infrastructure and psychiatric professionals to deal with the problem   Katrina and Rita survivors are suffering from the extreme emotional impact of this catastrophic disaster   Sen  Landrieu said   The stress from the storms and the hardships in  rebuilding have hit a level that can only be described as a crisis and is a serious barrier to our recovery    Data from the New Orleans Coroner s Office indicates that New Orleans  suicide rate has tripled  and in the last six months of 2006  the murder rate in Orleans Parish doubled  A recent Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center survey of 1 638 school children grades four to 12 found that 54 percent met the criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or depression  In August of 2006  only 77 of the 460 pre Katrina  New Orleans psychiatric beds were available  forcing hospitals to turn away even suicidal patients  Only 22 of 196 psychiatrists are still practicing in New Orleans  Waiting lists for mental health counseling have grown from days to weeks              Louisiana doctors representing state and local mental health care agencies testified that many Gulf Coast residents with no troubles before the storms are experiencing mental health problems               They are fearful and anxious about the next storm and living in a trailer   said Dr  Anthony Speier  Director of Disaster Mental Health Operations at the Louisiana Office of Mental Health  We need a  national strategy for psychological first aid   he added  Speier also said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  was too rigid in its rules about how states and localities can spend funds for mental health  Dr  Jan Kasofsky  executive director of Capital Area Human Services District  the Baton Rouge public health agency  said that lack of available and affordable housing in the Gulf Coast is a significant challenge to the mental health of post Katrina and Rita affected communities   Housing is so critical   she said   It s just not feasible to stabilize people when they re half living on the street or in a car   Sen  Landrieu has sponsored legislation  the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of 2007  S  1668  to replace occupied affordable housing units that were destroyed in the hurricanes  The bill also will authorize funding for the multi billion Road Home shortfall  The bipartisan legislation is a companion bill to legislation passed in the House with the support of every member of the Louisiana House delegation  Republicans and Democrats  Sen  Landrieu also today pushed Kathryn Power  director of the Center for Mental Health Services under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   to recognize the extent of the disaster in the Gulf Coast  SAMHSA  which oversees federal mental health care grants  excluded the Louisiana Rural Trauma Services Center  a successful program that provides care to children affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita   A Landrieu amendment to restore priority grant funding to programs serving children impacted by the hurricanes was included in the Senate passed Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  and Education Appropriations bill  H R  3043   Children  in particular  are experiencing mental trauma in the aftermath of the hurricanes  said Dr  Howard Osofsky  chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the LSU Health Sciences Center   Without adequate mental health services  we can count on these children having increased incidences of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression  and decreased ability to meet their potential   he said  Sen  Landrieu discussed solutions with the witnesses  such as instituting a more robust mental health care plan in schools  programs to provide psychiatry services over the phone and targeted funding to recruit more psychiatrists to meet the demand in the Gulf Coast   We need to develop better strategies for dealing with the ongoing mental health care emergency in the Gulf Coast   Sen  Landrieu said   My subcommittee will continue working with the experts who testified today to develop a plan to overcome this situation plaguing our communities and to better prepare for future disasters that strike the United States  be they natural or manmade   Also testifying before the subcommittee were Dr  Jan Kasofsky  Executive Director  Capital Area Human Services District  Dr  Kevin Stephens  Director  New Orleans Health Department  Dr  Ronald Kessler  Harvard Professor of Health Care Policy  Chair of the Hurricane Katrina Advisory Group  and Dr  Mark Townsend  Professor and Vice Chair for General Psychiatry  Director of Psychiatry  Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans
