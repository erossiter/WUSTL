Sen  Landrieu Calls for Hearings intoArmy Corps  Levee Report Modifications         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 10 2006    Sen  Landrieu Calls for Hearings intoArmy Corps  Levee Report Modifications     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   responded today to the release of an Army Corps of Engineers Hurricane Protection Study preliminary report expected to outline steps for providing Category 5 hurricane protection for the Louisiana coast   The report was delivered 10 days past the June 30 deadline mandated by Congress  Sen  Landrieu  who as a member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Committee inserted the language requesting the report in the Fiscal Year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill  said today   Levee and flood control is a life or death situation for the people of coastal Louisiana  and so  it is very disappointing that this report fails to do what Congress mandated  Give us all the facts and show us what it will take to protect coastal Louisiana     There are numerous differences between the final text and the report reviewed by the Corps State Project Delivery Team  the Corps  Independent Technical Review team  and the Independent Peer Review   Of particular cause for concern is the appearance that the report may have been altered to eliminate important technical information and proposals   As a result  the modified report omits many recommendations that could have helped protect the people of Louisiana and the nation they serve      Clearly  the will of Congress has been ignored   To get the facts  I have today asked the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee on which I sit to hold investigative hearings into the matter   We need the facts and our people need protection
