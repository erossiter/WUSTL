Landrieu Authors Amendment to Reset U S  Sights on bin Laden         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 25 2007    Landrieu Authors Amendment to Reset U S  Sights on bin Laden     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would make it the United States  principle priority in the Global War on Terror to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and dismantle the al Qaeda network    Sen  Landrieu introduced a similar amendment to the Defense Authorization bill last week  which stalled after a partisan deadlock   Since September 11  2001  it has been the priority of every American citizen to capture or kill the man responsible for that day s horrific terrorist attacks   Sen  Landrieu said   Sen  Landrieu s amendment states   It shall be the policy of the United States Government that the foremost objective of the United States in the Global War on Terror and in protecting the United States Homeland is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri  and other members of al Qaeda and to destroy the al Qaeda network   The amendment would appropriate  25 million to the CIA intended to fund reestablishing the agency s bin Laden task force  know as Alec Station  The al Qaeda hunting group was disbanded by President Bush after the administration determined that bin Laden no longer posed a threat to the United States   With recent intelligence estimates indicating that al Qaeda s strength has returned to levels not seen since before 9 11 and with the vast majority of our military might policing a civil war in Iraq  it is clear that our nation s priorities our misdirected   Sen  Landrieu said   It is essential that we make it the number one objective of the United States in the War on Terror to capture or kill bin Laden and his top deputies and dismantle his terrorist network   We need to hunt down bin Laden where he s hiding  and he s not in the streets of downtown Baghdad   Sens  Landrieu and Byron L  Dorgan  D N D   spoke about her amendment on the Senate floor this evening  Here is the full text of their speeches  Sen  Landrieu  I d like to remind all of us here  my colleagues  it s hard to remember this or to put this in perspective  but a few years ago  just over five  we didn t have a Homeland Security Appropriations bill  Until Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda established a network and put 19 plus men on planes that took out buildings in New York and a section of the Pentagon here in Washington and crashed into a field in Pennsylvania  this department didn t even exist  And this department has been put together to try to help this country stand up against a great and growing threat  Unfortunately  according to the latest intelligence report    of which I have the unclassified summary here    this is not a diminishing threat  You would think that after the money we spent prosecuting a war  the diplomacy and all the other things that we re doing  that this report would say that al Qaeda is weakened  But it doesn t say that  It says al Qaeda is strengthening  Of course  we know that Osama bin laden is still on the loose   And so I come to the floor to offer an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill to try to refocus our attention on how this whole thing got started  And it all got started by a guy named Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network  And my amendment says that it shall be the policy of the United States to refocus our efforts to find him  to destroy him  and to focus on the al Qaeda network  wherever it is found  And while there are pieces of it in Iraq    I m not going to debate that here    there are more pieces of al Qaeda  and they are still focused  according to this National Intelligence Estimate  right here in our homeland   My amendment is substantive in the sense that it simply restates or states that it is the policy of the United States that the foremost objective in the Global War on Terror and protecting the United States homeland is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and to destroy his network and other members of his network  I understand that this is just not the work of one person  And it adds  25 million to the Central Intelligence Agency for that purpose  I know there are other amounts of money that are being spent and resources  some readily attainable and some that are classified  But there are additional resources that need to be brought to bear  Sen  Dorgan  I visited earlier with my colleague from Louisiana and it    and this amendment is a very good amendment and establishes a priority  When the president was asked about Osama bin Laden at one point  he said I don t think about Osama bin Laden  Now we have the National Intelligence Estimate that says the greatest terrorist threat to this country is al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden  It should be job one to eliminate the leadership of al Qaeda  eliminating the greatest threat to our country ought to be the most important goal  and that s what the senator states in her amendment  I spoke yesterday about this issue at some length describing the kind of Byzantine position we re in with everyone telling us that here s the great threat to our country  and yet on the other hand  we re going door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war with our soldiers while there is what is called safe harbor or a secure haven in apparently Pakistan or Afghanistan or somewhere on the border   My point is  there ought not be a square inch of safety an anywhere  no safe harbor  no secure hideaway anywhere on this planet for the leadership of al Qaeda  So I think it is a good amendment  I am    I intend to offer the amendment that I offered on the defense authorization bill as well tomorrow  and my hope is    it was pass unanimously  and my hope is we would accept it unanimously  Senator Conrad and I offered it  But the defense authorization bill was pulled  I intend to offer that tomorrow  But my open is the senate will approve the amendment offered by the senator from Louisiana because I think it advances this country s effort in defeating terrorism   Sen  Landrieu  I thank the Senator from North Dakota and he has been a leader in helping us to stay focused by increasing the reward  We have to remember    I wish I had my poster  but I don t  But this is what a small version of it looked like  I know  madam chair  you may have a hard time seeing  but this is what Osama bin Laden looks like  I think it is important for us to continue to see his picture  He is on the FBI most wanted list  This is before he organized the attack against our country that has killed over 3 000 innocent civilians  And as we know now  4 000 of our soldiers approximately have lost their lives and 38 000 to 40 000 have been wounded trying to retaliate against this attack  So I thank the senator from North Dakota  I intend to be a cosponsor of his amendment  It is complementary to this one  So  again  I offer it on this bill which lays out the resources to protect our homeland  Let s make sure those resources are put on the target  There is a big target on the back of this man  Osama bin Laden  and his very dangerous network that is still alive and well and  unfortunately  according to our own estimates  growing as a threat
