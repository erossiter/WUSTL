Landrieu Statement on Reassignment of Hurricane Center Director         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 09 2007    Landrieu Statement on Reassignment of Hurricane Center Director     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding the reassignment of National Hurricane Center Director Bill Proenza   The center s Deputy Director  Ed Rappaport  has been named Acting Director  Director Proenza came under fire in recent weeks for drawing national attention to the imminent failure of QuikSCAT  a critical hurricane tracking and forecasting satellite   Sen  Landrieu has introduced legislation  S  1509  to replace the aging satellite  which is already more than five years past its intended length of service   The Senate Commerce Committee is expected to discuss the bill as part of a hearing on weather satellites this Wednesday  Sen  Landrieu said   The American people look to the government to provide accurate warnings of impending disaster  and expect every tool necessary to do the job right to be made available to the forecasters   NOAA is embarrassingly far behind in ensuring that QuikSCAT remains part of that arsenal  and Director Proenza was right to expose their failures to public scrutiny as higher ups looked the other way   Covering up problems doesn t do anything to solve them  and this Administration has made silencing the truth an all too often response to its own weaknesses   There is no excuse for putting bureaucratic office politics ahead of the safety of the American people   Whether Director Proenza was directly reassigned or simply  forced out   perhaps one day NOAA will present an appropriate justification for their action   However  sounding the alarm on QuikSCAT is not justification enough     Ed Rappaport is well respected in the forecasting community and has built a strong reputation over his years of service   I look forward to working with him as we fight for the resources the NHC needs to produce the best forecasts possible
