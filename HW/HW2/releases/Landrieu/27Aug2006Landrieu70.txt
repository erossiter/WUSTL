Landrieu Posts Entry in  Hope and Recovery Tour  Travel Diary From Plaquemines Parish         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 27 2006    Landrieu Posts Entry in  Hope and Recovery Tour  Travel Diary From Plaquemines Parish     PLAQUEMINES PARISH    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today posted her sixth entry to her travel diary of her  Hope and Recovery Tour  of coastal Louisiana after attending a briefing on the status of hurricane recovery in Plaquemines Parish   All of her entries appear exclusively on Bayou Buzz  http   www bayoubuzz com   a Louisiana news  political and cultural Web site  From Plaquemines Parish  Sen  Landrieu wrote   After attending church services this morning in Jefferson Parish  I tonight attended a briefing for Plaquemines residents at Belle Chasse High School   This parish  like so many others in our state  was hit incredibly hard by Hurricane Katrina   But it is well on the road to recovery   While six of nine parish schools were shut down by the storm  the parish now has eight open and functioning    several of them opened only two months after the hurricane   The Venice marina is functioning again  and across the board  parish officials took to the microphone to report successes over the past year   Plaquemines Parish Sheriff Jiff Hingle assured the crowd that together  we will build a bigger  better  and safer Plaquemines   And he s right   He reminded the audience of about 200 parish residents that we should use this opportunity to build better than what we had before    to leave a legacy for our children and grandchildren to enjoy   This was the lesson we learned in Morgan City when we discussed the Lake End Park with Mayor Matte yesterday  and it was echoed along the way and in Belle Chasse tonight   You can listen to my comments at the briefing at http   landrieu senate gov hrt Plaquemines mp3      Tomorrow  we will be in Houma and the New Orleans area    Everywhere I go on this tour  I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of goodwill and positive spirit shown by all of the people I have met along the way   There is a lot of frustration out there    with FEMA  with the SBA  with elected officials  with the media I d like to take a moment to talk about some of the more common issues people have raised in the last few days   On hurricane recovery and the federal bureaucracy  Federal agencies have let us down over and over again  The dysfunctional system we have for managing the nation s response to catastrophes is broken  almost collapsing under the weight of its own red tape   Wasteful mismanagement on the part of federal agencies  big contracts to companies a thousand miles away from Louisiana  and a system seemingly designed to delay the process as much as possible have eroded the impact and benefit of the  110 billion Congress has appropriated for hurricane relief  recovery and rebuilding   I ve spent much of my time the past 12 months pushing and prodding government entities    from the White House to FEMA to the SBA to the Army Corps of Engineers and to a host of cabinet departments     to move faster  to do better  to be more responsive and to keep in mind their real objectives  help people and allow us to rebuild safe and healthy communities  I will keep working  pushing and prodding to reform this system and to clean up the bureaucracy   On levees and our eroding coast  More than 200 miles of levees have been repaired since the hurricanes  many of them to conditions better than we had before   This is a step in the right direction  but it s only a start    much more must be done   I will not stop fighting until Louisiana has a category 5 protection system we can count on    and that will require the restoration of our first line of defense  our eroding wetlands   When I return to Washington next week  I will push passage of historic legislation to get for Louisiana its rightful share of federal revenues  from oil and gas production that can be used to build stronger levees and restore our coast   No piece of legislation could be more important to our state this fall  and I will keep you posted on its progress   On insurance  People and businesses in all of Louisiana must be able to get affordable insurance coverage  Unfortunately  the insurance system is off track and that could threaten the future of our state   Victims of Katrina and Rita are having to wait far too long to receive far too little  and I share the frustration many of you have expressed to me along my tour  Though the insurance system is largely regulated by state government and not the federal government  I will do whatever can be done from my position in Congress to not only draw attention to this increasingly important issue but to take any and every corrective action we can   One area I have been working on is flood insurance  which is a national program administered by FEMA  We must stabilize the National Flood Insurance Program  pay off the  21  billion deficit that resulted from last year s storms and enact fair and responsible reforms to make sure we have a system that is both affordable and reliable for the long term   On Hurricane Rita  Many people overlook that had it not been for Hurricane Katrina  Hurricane Rita would be on the record books as the worst hurricane in our history   But for the people of southwest Louisiana  they need no reminders of Rita s force   Unfortunately  Rita often gets lost in the news media shadow of Katrina and far too often goes ignored by national media and many policymakers   Let me assure you  I have not forgotten about the destruction caused by Rita  and I never will  It angers me when people ignore the suffering and loss caused by Rita  The people of southwest Louisiana know better and I will continue to do whatever is necessary to make Washington listen to them and to respond to their needs   On the Estate Tax  While most of the questions along the tour have been about the hurricanes  many of you have asked me about my position on repealing the Estate Tax   Given the massive continuing demands of hurricane recovery  I do not believe it is the right time for a full repeal that could cost more than  700 billion  But we must reduce and reform the federal estate tax  That s why I ve been working with members of Congress of both parties to find a solution that will free more than 99 9 percent of Louisiana families  small business people and family farmers from the burden of this tax   I have introduced a bill that would exempt estates valued at less than  5 million   10 million for a couple  from paying any federal estate tax whatsoever  My bill would also reduce the tax rate and stabilize the system so that all taxpayers can do long term estate planning with a sense of certainty   Some advocates of full repeal of this tax have said that I favor continuation of the current estate tax without change  That s simply not true  In fact  as long as they stick to their position of full repeal or nothing  it s likely nothing will get done  That s why I am committed to finding a fiscally responsible way to provide reform and significant tax relief for all taxpayers  and I will continue fighting to achieve a balanced solution that our nation can afford  For me  the estate tax is not about partisan political games  as it is with some  It s about finding a fair and responsible way to give Louisiana taxpayers real relief    not meaningless political rhetoric
