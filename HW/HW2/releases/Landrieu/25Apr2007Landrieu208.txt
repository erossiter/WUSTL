Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Members Introduce First Response Broadcasters Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 25 2007    Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Members Introduce First Response Broadcasters Bill     WASHINGTON    Members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  led by Chair Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Ranking Member Ted Stevens  R Alaska  today introduced the First Response Broadcasters Act of 2007  The bill reinforces the existing partnership between the federal government and broadcasters by taking steps to ensure local television and radio stations are able to stay on the air when a major disaster strikes   All of our local media    broadcasters  newspapers and Web sites    did an amazing job keeping the people of Louisiana and our region informed in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Sen  Landrieu said   But with phone lines down  cell phones out  and streets flooded  the sound of local radio and television stations was what many people relied on  It was an important voice in those dark days and nights following the storm and flooding  and that voice continued on for months   As many local radio and television stations stood up and put commercial interests aside to serve the public interest  the federal government should be ready to stand up with them  That is what this bill is about    Broadcasters provide an invaluable public service to Americans  especially in times of crisis   said Sen  Stevens  also the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee   Many people in my state know this first hand   Alaskans  particularly those in the most remote areas of the state  have endured devastating earthquakes  tsunamis and typhoons     As we strive to improve disaster preparedness in Alaska and the nation  Congress must ensure that broadcasters have the tools to effectively communicate with people when time is of the essence   History has proven that the critical information provided by television and radio broadcasters can save lives    I m pleased to join my colleagues in putting forward this important proposal   said Tom Carper  D Del   Anyone who has dealt with an emergency situation in their state    as I have as Governor of Delaware    knows how important local radio and television broadcasters are in providing assistance and key information to those who may be riding out a storm or waiting for aid to arrive in the aftermath of a disaster   The steps taken in this bill to ensure that broadcasters have access to information and the resources necessary to stay on the air will help us save lives and property and improve our disaster response capabilities     Broadcasters provide a critical service in helping us all prepare for and respond during emergencies   said Sen  Mark Pryor  D Ark  also the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on State  Local  and Private Sector Preparedness Integration   This legislation will give them the ability to get emergency information to the public quickly and accurately   The bill designates local radio and television stations as  first response broadcasters  because of their existing disaster response partnership with the federal government  Radio and television stations are required to participate in the national Emergency Alert System  EAS   There are also 34 radio stations  called Primary Entry Points  with government funded direct lines connecting them to emergency command centers in Washington and in their states  The Landrieu Stevens bill adds Primary Entry Points nationwide to ensure every state can broadcast urgent warnings  evacuation rouges  safety instructions and other critical emergency information   We cannot prevent tornadoes  hurricanes or earthquakes   Sen  Landrieu said   But what we can and should do is to warn people and keep people informed in times of disaster  For more than 50 years  we have required local broadcasters to be on that front line  sounding the alarm  With the entire industry dependent upon the public airwaves  broadcasters have a duty to serve the public in times of crisis   Following Hurricane Katrina  confiscations of fuel procured by Mississippi broadcasters inhibited efforts by local radio and television stations  dependent on generators for electricity  to stay on the air   The bill would open access to federal supplies of fuel  water and food   While highest priority would remain reserved for emergency services  health care facilities and public utilities  the bill would protect broadcasters  independently secured supplies from federal government seizure except in the most dire cases of emergency need    Despite our federal investment in emergency systems and entry point stations  there were several Gulf Coast broadcasters after the hurricanes that could not stay on the air simply because the government took the fuel away   Sen  Landrieu said   This bill protects the critical resources broadcasters need to stay on the air   The bill invests in critical to air facilities  often in the path of destruction  by establishing a Broadcast Disaster Preparedness Matching Grant Program   The grants could be used to protect  upgrade or enhance facilities and infrastructure to better position stations to continue providing vital public information during a disaster  The legislation further directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to expedite access to the disaster area by broadcast engineers to restore transmitters and other key broadcast facilities and infrastructure     The legislation also determines that press access guidelines for broadcast  print and Internet reporters to a disaster area shall continue to be determined by the local agencies that had been so responsible before the disaster occurs  This creates a consistent model for journalist accreditation and eliminates the bureaucratic confusion created by multiple local and federal agencies attempting to enforce conflicting access rules  The National Association of Broadcasters  NAB   state broadcasting associations representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia  and the Radio Television News Directors Association have joined in support of the bill  The provisions are also aligned with recommendations already made by the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  and an independent presidential advisory panel  The Senate bill will be referred to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  and a House version is expected to be introduced by Rep  Charlie Melancon  D La  More information regarding the First Response Broadcasters Act  including full bill text and profiles of broadcaster efforts following recent
