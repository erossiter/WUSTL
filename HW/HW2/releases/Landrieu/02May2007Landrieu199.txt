Landrieu Cosponsors Journalist Shield Law  Freedom of Information Act Reforms         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 02 2007    Landrieu Cosponsors Journalist Shield Law  Freedom of Information Act Reforms     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today introduced along with Sens  Dick Lugar  R Ind   Chris Dodd  D Conn   Lindsey Graham  R S C  and Pete Domenici  R N M   the Free Flow of Information Act to protect the public s right to information through a free press  This legislation provides journalists with certain rights and abilities to seek sources without fear of intimidation or imprisonment   U S  Reps  Rick Boucher  D Va   and Mike Pence  R Ind   today introduced identical legislation in the House of Representatives   One of the responsibilities of the press is to inform citizens about their government  and to shine a light on the truth   Sen  Landrieu said   Our Democracy cannot function as our forefather s intended if our  free press  is strangled by the federal judiciary  And so  a free government has a responsibility to protect the press from having to reveal their sources in federal court  It is fitting that we introduce this bill in the same week as World Press Freedom Day  and I will work to see it sent to the President s desk      This legislation confirms America s Constitutional commitment to press freedom and advances our foreign policy initiatives to promote and protect democracy   Sen  Lugar said    We must lead by example and the role of the media as a conduit between government and the citizens it serves cannot be devalued    We enter dangerous territory for a democracy when journalists are hauled into court and threatened with imprisonment if they don t divulge their sources   said Sen  Dodd    Forty nine states and the District of Columbia have already recognized the need for a reporter shield by enacting protection on the state level either through legislation or court decisions  This legislation should not be viewed as a privilege for reporters  but as a protection of every American citizen s right to information and their ability to inform themselves   It is an important first step toward rebalancing the pursuit of justice and the distribution of truth    The bill would set national standards that must be met before a federal entity may issue a subpoena to a member of the news media in any federal criminal or civil case   It would specify certain tests that civil litigants or prosecutors must meet before they can force a journalist to turn over information  For example  litigants or prosecutors must show that they have tried unsuccessfully to get the information in other ways and that the information is essential to the case   These standards were based on Justice Department guidelines and common law standards    Additional protections are included to ensure that information will be disclosed in cases where the information is critical to prevent death or bodily harm or in cases that relate to the unlawful disclosure of trade secrets   The bill would permit a reporter to be compelled to reveal source information when disclosure is necessary to prevent imminent and actual harm to national security   Finally  the bill would provide protections to ensure that source information can be provided when personal health records and financial records were disclosed in violation of federal law    By providing the courts with a framework for compelled disclosure  the legislation would promote greater transparency of government  maintain the ability of the courts to operate effectively and protect whistleblowers who identify government or corporate misdeeds    Sen  Landrieu also cosponsored a bill with Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  and John Cornyn  R Texas  to reform  update and strengthen the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA   The Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007   OPEN Government Act    passed the Judiciary Committee this month     Open government is a tenant of our Democracy   Sen  Landrieu said   Federal agencies  which serve taxpayers  must release documents and must release them quickly so that we can shine the light on government processes  The revelation this week that the Bush Administration turned away nearly  1 billion in foreign aid after Hurricane Katrina came to light as the result of the FOIA process and demonstrates its essential function as a public check on government power and policy    The bill contains key reforms to   Restore meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA  Impose real consequences on federal agencies for missing statutory deadlines  Clarify that FOIA applies to agency records held by outside private contractors  Establish a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies  and Create a FOIA Ombudsman as an alternative to costly litigation  The OPEN Government bill is also cosponsored by Senators Arlen Specter  R Pa    the committee s ranking member  Russ Feingold  D Wisc    John Kerry  D Mass    Johnny Isakson  R Ga    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio  and Ben Cardin  D Md    Sen  Landrieu last week introduced the First Response Broadcasters Act of 2007  S  1223  which gives the local agency in charge of press credentialing and access before a disaster strikes the same jurisdiction to handle media credentialing after a disaster for all journalists    print  broadcast and online  After a disaster  the Federal Emergency Management Agency military and other federal responding agencies would have to recognize those locally issued credentials and would be prohibited from unduly denying disaster zone access otherwise granted by local authorities
