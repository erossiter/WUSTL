Times Picayune Op Ed Backs Dodd Landrieu Housing Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 01 2007    Times Picayune Op Ed Backs Dodd Landrieu Housing Bill     WASHINGTON    This weekend  the New Orleans Times Picayune published an op ed by James Perry  director of the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center  citing the critical need for the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act cosponsored by Senate Banking Chairman Chris Dodd  D Conn   and Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La  The article clarifies common misconceptions of the bill and appears in its entirety below  Opinion  Housing recovery needs senator s help Times Picayune  September 29  2007  by James Perry Recovering from Hurricane Katrina has been difficult for us all  Regardless of race  sex  religion or political affiliation  the greatest obstacle has been the lack of housing  There are three main problems  not enough relief for homeowners  not enough relief for renters and the lack of any serious plan for fixing either problem  It has been incredibly frustrating for me  a native New Orleanian  homeowner and full time housing advocate  So  you can imagine my relief when Congress got around to taking charge  Through the Gulf Coast Recovery Act of 2007  House Bill 1227 and Senate Bill 1668   U S  Rep  Maxine Waters  Sen  Mary Landrieu and Sen  Chris Dodd have attempted to create plans and provide funding that would mend many of the Gulf Coast s housing woes  The Senate version of the bill would  among other things  cover most of the Road Home funding gap to save homeowners  provide enough affordable and low income housing units to meet the needs of New Orleans  poor  fix federal housing rules to help deal with blighted properties and fix federal insurance guidelines to free up local mortgage lenders  capital  allowing lenders to make more housing loans to Gulf Coast citizens  While the legislation isn t perfect  those who understand the housing challenges in the Gulf Coast area agree that it moves us in the right direction  The House version of the bill passed 302 125 with strong bipartisan support  The entire Louisiana House of Representatives delegation  including Republicans Bobby Jindal and Richard Baker  voted for the Democrat sponsored bill  In addition  more than 100 Gulf Coast organizations signed letters supporting the legislation  Tuesday  I testified in support of the bill with representatives from the Brookings Institution  representatives of Catholic housing groups  the Louisiana Mortgage Bankers  Association and two non profit developers  You could feel the energy in the room  We all sensed progress at long last  But not so fast  What we noticed was that one important person was absent from the hearing  Sen  David Vitter  We had worked with Vitter and his staff for months negotiating the bill to assuage his concerns  It was our understanding that he supported the legislation  Sadly  Vitter abruptly sent out a press release following the hearing  condemning the Gulf Coast Recovery Act and offering no alternative  We sat frustrated in the Senate chambers  hearing that the first solid progress on the housing front could die at Vitter s hands  Press reports indicate that Vitter is in opposition because he believes the act would reopen existing public housing and concentrate poverty  and that the housing need described in the act isn t real  He is wrong on all counts  I met with Vitter Wednesday morning and I explained the following  The Gulf Coast Recovery Act does not require that public housing be reopened as it was pre Katrina  nor does it encourage the concentration of poverty  As a matter of fact  it allows the Housing Authority to place housing wherever it chooses using vouchers and subsidized physical units  Further  in most cases  it requires that no more than 50 percent of units in the new buildings can be low income units  It will result in commonly praised mixed income housing and the improvement of New Orleans  decades old and long criticized public housing projects  Vitter would know this if he had attended Tuesday s hearing  Affordable housing advocates support the Gulf Coast Recovery Act because it requires that enough affordable housing be built to meet the needs of the working poor  the elderly poor  people with disabilities and people with very low incomes  This is extremely helpful  since HANO consistently has failed to replace enough of the low income units it has demolished  Business people support the Gulf Coast Recovery Act because it will ensure that housing is built for low wage workers  who are needed to make the New Orleans  tourism industry profitable  Homeowners support the Gulf Coast Recovery Act because it will fix the gap in the Road Home program necessary to make them whole  The Gulf Coast Recovery Act has wide business  advocate  bi partisan  state and local support  Sen  Vitter stands as the main roadblock  voicing concerns that don t jibe with the actual bill  all while offering no plan of his own  He does so in spite of the fact that he skipped out on a hearing to discuss what may be our most important step towards real housing progress on the Gulf Coast  I urge Vitter to move forward on the Gulf Coast Recovery Act or give us something better so we can move our recovery forward in a way that provides housing opportunities for everyone
