Landrieu Introduces Bill to Expand Jean Lafitte National Park         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 07 2007    Landrieu Introduces Bill to Expand Jean Lafitte National Park Bill authorizes acquisition of Fleming Berthoud Plantation     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   yesterday introduced legislation that will expand the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve by transferring more than 3 000 acres of federally owned wetlands to the Preserve in hopes of protecting the land for future generations   Sen  Landrieu has introduced and the Senate has passed similar legislation in the last two Congresses  but House Republican leaders never allowed a vote on the measure   Wetlands are invaluable to Louisiana  giving our state its unique beauty and history while protecting us against devastating storm surges   Sen  Landrieu said    Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reminded us of the importance of our wetlands  and we must do everything in our power to protect them   This legislation will help preserve our most valuable resource  and I urge the Senate to pass it in this Congress as it has in the past   The bill would transfer 3 083 acres of federal land to the Barataria Preserve Unit of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and authorize the Park to purchase up to 821 acres of neighboring private lands from willing sellers   The transferred lands contain important freshwater wetlands and would allow the park boundary to conform to existing waterways and levee corridors  Preserving the wetlands affected by this legislation will help protect Louisiana s eroding coast because of their proximity with coastal marsh   When water flows are interrupted  coastal marshes draw less freshwater and more saltwater  causing them to die off   When marshes disappear  it is much easier for the natural actions of the Gulf to erode the land  The Jean Lafitte National Historic Park and Preserve was first established in 1978 to preserve the rich natural and cultural resources of Louisiana s Mississippi Delta region for future generations   Located on the outskirts of New Orleans  the Barataria Preserve Unit represents both the culture of those who settled the area and the unique ecosystem  natural levee forests  bayous  swamps and marshes  that sustained them   Barataria serves as an interpretive experience of this greatest of coastal wetlands   the only part of Louisiana s coastal wetlands preserved in the National Park System  The legislation also authorizes the park to acquire the Fleming Berthoud Plantation    previously known as the Mavis Grove Plantation     This plantation is one of the southernmost early sugar plantations and surrounds a prehistoric Indian mound and one of the most scenic and most photographed historic cemeteries near New Orleans   After floods destroyed the plantation in the 19th century  it was turned into a large cypress tree lumbering plantation   It has been highlighted in the recent Cabildo exhibition and book on historic cemeteries of New Orleans  as well as National Geographic Magazine and several Hollywood movies   This bill will authorize the management and preservation of several ecological  cultural and historic gems   Sen  Landrieu continued    I hope that my colleagues will fully support this endeavor as they have in the past so that we can protect Louisiana s coast and its historical artifacts
