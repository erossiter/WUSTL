Do Not Forget the Lessons of Hurricane Rita          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 24 2007    Do Not Forget the Lessons of Hurricane Rita  A column by United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu and Congressman Charles Boustany     WASHINGTON    The following op ed by United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Congressman Charles Boustany  R La   was published today in a Capitol Hill newspaper  Roll Call  Two years ago  Hurricane Rita came crashing ashore along the Louisiana Texas border  With winds in excess of 120 miles per hour pushing a 20 foot wall of water  the storm wreaked catastrophic damage across Southeast Texas and Southwest Louisiana  The storm at its peak was the most intense ever to have entered the Gulf of Mexico  breaking a record set only three weeks earlier by Hurricane Katrina  When the skies cleared  Rita ranked as the third most expensive natural disaster in U S  history   In any other circumstance  the devastation of more than 20 000 homes  an interruption to our core national energy infrastructure and the destruction of half a billion dollars in agriculture  forests and fisheries would be big news  and it should be  Yet this catastrophe has been lost in the media shadow of Hurricane Katrina  all but forgotten by too many in Washington  D C   and the national media  and still very much in need of attention from both   There is simply no substitute for a firsthand appreciation of the storm s wrath and the long term recovery needs of the region  As we fight for the tools to rebuild and recover from both hurricanes  our greatest ally has been the impact of eyewitness understanding  and our greatest enemies have been ignorance and passive disregard   We are tremendously grateful to all those who have shared in and told Southeast Louisiana s important story of hope and recovery  But this story does not end at the Mississippi River  Rita was massive  but nonetheless a  traditional  hurricane  Katrina s effects were magnified by the failure of federal levees and the flooding that followed  With different disasters come unique challenges to recovery  and stories equally worth telling   With Rita approaching  Southwest Louisiana communities mounted an evacuation operation far larger than ever before envisioned  Not only did residents of these parishes need to seek safety themselves  but thousands of Katrina evacuees they had opened their hearts and homes to were incorporated into the plans as well  The unique combination of energy  petrochemical  timber  fishing and other regional bedrock industries serving our nation are now suffering from an equally unique labor shortage  The nature of the damage also raises questions as to whether homeowners affected by Rita will be eligible for the same rebuilding assistance as those flooded as a result of levee breaks  All the while  a failed federal bureaucracy continues to meter out miles of red tape  without the consistent guidance or decision making to hint when  if ever  projects can move forward   Yet  without the national spotlight rightly afforded Katrina affected areas  the people of Cameron  Calcasieu  Jefferson Davis  Vermilion  Iberia and other Rita devastated parishes have marched on  With generations old roots in their community and the vibrant Louisiana spirit in their hearts  they have pulled themselves up and begun the difficult yet essential process of rebuilding  Theirs is an untold story in need of witnesses with strong voices   And so  to the hardworking members of the media  our colleagues in Washington and to millions of Americans  we ask simply  Do not forget Hurricane Rita  It too has many lessons to offer for how we prepare for and recover from natural disasters  It tells a tale of distinctly American spirit and community  The stalwart people of south Louisiana continue to work hard to serve our nation s energy  agriculture and other needs as they work to rebuild their own homes  This story of hope  recovery  resilience and service can never be forgotten
