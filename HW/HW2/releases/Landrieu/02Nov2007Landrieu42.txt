Landrieu Comments on Bush WRDA Veto         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 02 2007    Landrieu Comments on Bush WRDA Veto     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement after President Bush vetoed the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   As soon as the veto was confirmed  Sen  Landrieu spoke with Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev  The House of Representatives must act first under constitutional procedure  but Sen  Reid promised Sen  Landrieu he would move to schedule a Senate vote to override the veto at the earliest opportunity following the House  which is expected to act as early as Tuesday   The Senate passed the WRDA conference report 81 12  and the House voted 381 40  A two thirds majority of each chamber is needed for an override  Sen  Landrieu said    The President today vetoed a bipartisan bill that provides critical coastal protection and strengthens avenues of commerce all over the country  This protection from natural catastrophes underpins Louisiana s recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   The Senate and House decided to put an end to the tedious seven year wait and voted overwhelmingly for this bill that includes wetland protection  flood protection and levee repair and construction  and dredging of our navigable waters and ports   For Louisiana  the bill authorizes a  7 billion investment in protecting our communities from future storms rising in the Gulf  It is truly an historic commitment to coastal restoration in our state   I am disappointed that the President chose to veto this critical legislation  but I stand united with the Louisiana delegation to work to override the veto in the House and Senate  With so much on the line for our state  we will fight to enact this vital bill with or without the President s consent
