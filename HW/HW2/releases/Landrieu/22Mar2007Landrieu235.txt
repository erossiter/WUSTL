Sen  Landrieu Secures More Than  3 Billion for Louisiana In Senate Spending Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 22 2007    Sen  Landrieu Secures More Than  3 Billion for Louisiana In Senate Spending Bill Bill also corrects unfair hurricane recovery funding rules     WASHINGTON    From her seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee  United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today secured more than  3 billion in key funding for hurricane recovery and other projects for Louisiana in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill   By correcting unfair policies that have snared our rebuilding efforts in red tape and bureaucratic obstacles  this bill helps put our recovery on a stronger footing   Sen  Landrieu said    It also directs more than  3 billion to strengthen our efforts to fight crime and to rebuild Louisiana levees  businesses  colleges and communities   I was proud to work with Chairman Byrd to secure these funds from my seat on the Appropriations Committee  and as the bill moves to the floor and the White House  I will keep fighting to make sure the people of Louisiana get a fair  fighting chance to recover from two of the worst natural disasters in our nation s history   Louisianians look to the federal government to be a rebuilding partner  not a rebuilding obstacle  and I will continue to work to cut through the red tape   Sen  Robert C  Byrd  D W V   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  said   The people of Louisiana have the strength and the spirit to rebuild their homes and their communities   We owe them the support to get the job done   Senator Landrieu is working hard to make sure that the Congress makes good on the promises made to the people of the Gulf Coast  and I will continue to stand with her at every step of the way   FAIR Funding In the supplemental spending bill  Sen  Landrieu secured inclusion of language that would waive for Katrina  and Rita affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  This provision has been waived 32 times since 1985 when per capita rebuilding costs have been excessive   This match requirement and the paperwork it creates are reducing the speed of recovery in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast   Sen  Landrieu said    The President has the authority to move Gulf Coast recovery forward with a single stroke of his pen  but has refused to use this authority   It will literally take an act of Congress to remove this bureaucratic stranglehold from our recovery and that s what we re fighting to accomplish   Disaster Loan Forgiveness Sen  Landrieu also secured language that would make Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness option made available to all other disaster stricken communities  The Stafford Act has historically required forgiveness of such loans when independent audits determine the fiscal recovery of affected local communities is insufficient to repay the loans after a three year grace period   The Federal Government enacted a double standard when it prohibited Katrina  and Rita affected areas in the Gulf Coast from being eligible for Community Disaster Loan forgiveness   Sen  Landrieu said   This provision in the supplemental appropriations bill corrects a big mistake that was made in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes and will remove a significant obstacle to the recovery of the region   Shortly after the hurricanes  Sen  Landrieu proposed making  1 billion in unspent FEMA funds available for Community Disaster Loans under the same terms as had been afforded to other communities   But the version that was passed in October 2005  sponsored by Senators David Vitter  R La   and Bill Frist  R Tenn   specifically prohibited the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities were unable to pay them back  This marked the first time in American history that loan forgiveness was excluded as an option for qualifying local governments  and the prohibition was specific to Katrina affected states  not any future loans outside the Gulf Coast  In the 29 years of the program  64 loan applications have been received regarding 21 federal disasters  with approximately 93 percent being deemed by independent auditors as warranting partial or complete forgiveness   According to press accounts   227 billion in Community Disaster Loans have been forgiven since 1974   I have been fighting for fair lending terms since Katrina and Rita struck our coast   Sen  Landrieu said today   This bill would finally give Gulf Coast communities a fair opportunity to reopen schools  rebuild key infrastructure and keep police cars  fire trucks and sanitation vehicles rolling as they bring communities back to life    Sen  Landrieu also introduced an amendment to the 9 11 bill that would have made Katrina and Rita community disaster loans forgivable  Levee Funding Sen  Landrieu also secured  1 3 billion for east and west bank levee projects in the New Orleans area  When cost overruns created a  1 3 billion shortfall in the projects  originally authorized by the 3rd Supplemental bill passed last year  the Bush Administration sought to shuffle the money away from other levee projects authorized in the 4th Supplemental bill  The funds secured by Sen  Landrieu would address the shortfall with direct funding  rather than simply borrowing funds and creating a shortfall in another set of levee projects instead   Levee projects are essential to our safety and our ability to rebuild   Sen  Landrieu said    The administration wants to move  1 3 billion from one levee project to another  but that will only leave our flood control system vulnerable during future disasters  A Washington shell game won t build strong levees and effective flood protection   We need real money to get that done   Sen  Landrieu also secured  150 million for the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project  SELA   which provides for engineering  design and construction of projects for flood control and improvements to rainfall drainage systems in Jefferson  Orleans and St  Tammany Parishes   SELA will provide essential improvements to this area s flood control system   Sen  Landrieu said    I will continue to work to ensure that it gets the funding it needs to better prepare southeast Louisiana for a natural disaster   Curbing Crime Sen  Landrieu secured  70 million to curb crime along the Gulf Coast  with  55 million designated specifically to Louisiana   The funding is intended to go to several projects  including nearly  7 million for the New Orleans Common Good program  a plan proposed by a coalition of local civic and business groups  which will give the New Orleans Police Department  NOPD  funding it needs to fight crime as New Orleans continues to recover from Hurricane Katrina   The funding allows the NOPD to hire more officers and give Orleans Parish the ability to hire eight additional prosecutors   I will continue to do everything in my power to stem crime in the New Orleans area   Sen  Landrieu said    Safe neighborhoods are essential to rebuilding  and this funding will provide some of the resources our criminal justice system badly needs   The New Orleans anti crime package will also develop an Orleans Parish Information Sharing and Integrated Systems project  The system will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal justice operations by increasing information sharing across agencies  streamlining business processes and promoting transparency and accountability  Of the  55 million that Sen  Landrieu secured to fight crime in Louisiana   38 million is intended to assist the criminal operations of five parishes in south Louisiana   The money would assist the Cameron  Calcasieu  St  Bernard  Plaquemines and Orleans Parish Sheriff s Offices and the NOPD through the Byrne Grant program at the Bureau of Justice Assistance  Sen  Landrieu and the Appropriations Committee also appropriated  2 million for the Louisiana Supreme Court to support Civil Court record digitization program administered by the COPS Law Enforcement Technology Program   Paper records are exceptionally vulnerable during flooding   Sen  Landrieu said    Record digitization will give the Louisiana Supreme Court necessary security to ensure that all of its files are preserved   Other Funding Sen  Landrieu also secured funding in the bill for the following projects  Extension of the deadline to use  150 million in Social Services Block Grants from September 2007 to Sept  30  2008   15 million for additional historic preservation grants in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   10 million to allow local governments to use FEMA funds for utility expenses associated with shelter evacuees for 24 months   65 million for fisheries recovery in Louisiana   25 million for Small Business Administration  SBA  economic injury loans  Extension of Historically Underutilized Business Zone  HUBZone  status to Hurricane Katrina  and Rita affected parishes for two years  which can be extended to three years at the SBA s discretion   30 million in additional funding to help defray expenses incurred by higher education institutions that were forced to close  relocate or curtail their activities as a result of the 2005 hurricanes   This provision also allows the money to be used for grants to students   75 million for Federal Transit grants for operating and capital costs for transit services impacted for Katrina and Rita  which included the LA Swift bus from Baton Rouge to New Orleans and also waived the local cost share  Gulf Coast Public Housing Agencies in areas that received emergency assistance after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will receive allocations based on their 2006 funding   11 million to provide 75  of the cost of replanting trees lost due to natural disasters in excess of 15  mortality under the Tree Assistance Program   15 million for crops  including irrigated crops   The crops are covered up to 55 percent of the established price for a given year
