Homeland Security Committee Passes Landrieu Bill to Move HMGP Money to Road Home         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 01 2007    Homeland Security Committee Passes Landrieu Bill to Move HMGP Money to Road Home     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate Homeland Security Committee today unanimously voted to pass the SMART RESPONSE Act  a bill authored by Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Chairman Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to allow Louisiana to use  1 17 billion in hazard mitigation money  HMGP  for the Road Home program  The Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  has not allowed the state to use this already appropriated money for Louisiana s housing program  which has a shortfall projected at about  5 billion    Today the Homeland Security Committee recognized the scope of the 2005 hurricanes and supported my commonsense bill to reduce the Road Home program s shortfall by  1 17 billion and fast track money to hurricane victims   Sen  Landrieu said   This bill will speed up our recovery by allowing previously appropriated money to be used to rebuild the more than 200 000 Louisiana homes that were destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Homes that were more than 50 percent damaged by flooding are required to elevate their homes  which affects 36 percent of Orleans Parish Road Home applicants  Recognizing that home elevation and other disaster mitigation steps are key elements of rebuilding  Louisiana designated  1 17 in HMGP disaster mitigation funds to be combined with the Road Home program  But FEMA blocked this combination because the program reduced grants for people who left the state and exempts senior citizens from this penalty  a policy that FEMA calls discriminatory   In addition to directing FEMA to allow the HMGP money to be used for Road Home  Sen  Landrieu s bill also streamlines the process for HMGP funds by expediting the review process for homeowners and reimbursing homeowners who have already begun elevation work    The bill also directs FEMA to coordinate state and local evacuation plans and create a National Sheltering Database   Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was a catastrophic disaster that involved multiple states   Sen  Landrieu said   We need coordinated evacuation plans at the regional level so that the next time a disaster strikes  be it natural or manmade  we can evacuate people quickly  efficiently and safely   The Homeland Security Committee also voted for an amendment to the bill sponsored by Sens  Norm Coleman  R Minn   and Landrieu that gives FEMA the authority to waive additional HMGP program requirements at Louisiana s request  adding flexibility to HMGP money  The amendment also authorizes FEMA to give homeowners mitigation money up front  The two flexibility waivers provided by the Colemen Landrieu amendment are in addition to five flexibility provisions already included in the original bill  and were also unanimously agreed to following late night negotiations led by Sen  Landrieu   I thank Senator Coleman for working with me on this amendment to add additional flexibility to the HMGP money that has been appropriated for Louisiana so disaster victims can get their well deserved recovery money more quickly   Sen  Landrieu said
