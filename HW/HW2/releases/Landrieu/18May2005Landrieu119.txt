Sen  Landrieu Statement on the Nuclear Option         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 18 2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement on the Nuclear Option     WASHINGTON    The following is a statement by U S  Sen  Mary Landrieu  D La   regarding the so called  nuclear option   a potential Senate rule change that would eliminate the possibility of filibusters during debates on federal judicial nominations  Sen  Landrieu said   For more than 200 years  the Senate has fulfilled our Framers  intent that it be the body of our government where the minority  and even the lone voice of one individual  is protected from the potential absolute power of the majority   This tradition has for generations empowered individual senators to stand up and fight for what they believe  even when political expediency or the will of the majority dictated otherwise   In October  these rules allowed me to prevent a  137 billion dollar tax break bill from leaving out the patriotic employers who honor our military families by keeping their paychecks whole   This noble heritage is a model for burgeoning democracies around the world such as Iraq  where we are spending nearly  1 billion a week    and sacrificing hundreds of American lives    in the pursuit of a democracy that respects the minority   In these nations  citizens seek the assurance our democracy takes for granted    that leadership will come from consensus     I and other Democrats are committed to ensuring this consensus  and have recognized the president s prerogative by confirming more than 95 percent of his judicial nominees   But while our nation defends these cornerstones of freedom abroad  it is indeed ironic that the Republican leadership is willing to cast them aside here at home     Our democracy is built on the promise that every American has a voice  and that promise is in danger of being broken   And so  I am working with some of my centrist colleagues to forge a compromise that will preserve the voice of the individual  while keeping the wheels of government turning        The birth of our nation and spread of freedom across the seas reminds us of the observation that we should never forget the power of an individual to change the world Indeed  it is the only thing that ever has
