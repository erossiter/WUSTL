Louisiana Delegation Demands Answers on FEMA s Flawed Decisions         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 05 2007    Louisiana Delegation Demands Answers on FEMA s Flawed Decisions Sends letter to FEMA Director  Congressional Committees  GAO seeking explanation for FEMA s alternative housing rationale     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today joined the rest of Louisiana Congressional delegation in sending a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison expressing extreme disappointment over FEMA s decision to give Mississippi four times more housing money for alternative housing programs for hurricane victims than Louisiana   As Louisiana sustained more than three times the housing damage as Mississippi  the delegation questioned the process by which FEMA determined the preliminary awards   The delegation also asked FEMA to hold the final awards until Congress can thoroughly investigate the process and the agency can provide the delegation with real answers on its allocation decisions  The letter was sent after FEMA was unable to adequately explain in Congressional staff briefings the rationale used in determining the funding allocation   We are extremely disappointed by the announcement of the projects preliminarily selected by the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  under the Alternative Housing Pilot Program  AHPP    the delegation wrote    As members of the Louisiana Congressional delegation  we are also concerned about the particular process used to determine these preliminary awards and the fact that this decision disregards the intent of Congress in creating this program   Louisiana  in particular  certainly needs these new solutions  but with these lingering questions still unanswered  these awards must be reviewed and revisited by the Congress   Furthermore  real experts should also review these projects and provide substantive input into the final decision   The Alternative Housing Pilot Program  AHPP  was developed to encourage FEMA to provide more permanent and more innovative housing alternatives to trailers    The 2005 Hurricanes destroyed more than 205 000 homes in Louisiana  while 61 386 were destroyed in Mississippi   The Louisiana Congressional delegation secured  400 million for alternative housing pilot initiatives  such as modular homes or  Katrina Cottages   in the Fourth Supplemental Appropriations bill   FEMA late last month announced the state by state distribution of the funds  granting Mississippi  281 million while Louisiana received  74 5 million   After FEMA s continued inability to defend its process  we have no option but to encourage Congress to investigate the process in making these unfair and illogical decisions   Sen  Landrieu said    In response to repeated questioning  they can only defend their process as  competitive   but have never accounted for the most important measure of all    need   A formula that distributes recovery funds with no regard for where they are most needed simply does not make any sense    FEMA was wrong to make these announcements as most Americans prepared for the holidays and the agency mistakenly assumed no one was watching   Sen  Landrieu added   But we were watching  The 75 000 Louisianians still living in trailers were watching  And I will continue to work with the Louisiana delegation to ensure that the federal government s responsibility to the all people of the Gulf Coast is met fairly and honestly    Based on legislation I wrote  alternative housing options like Katrina Cottages are now a permanent part of federal post disaster housing policy  So it s essential that we make sure this pilot program can be truly replicated nationwide  and I believe the Louisiana models best reflect this capacity   said Rep  Richard Baker  R Baton Rouge   But we must never forget that a pilot program is not the same as a scientific experiment or an inhuman computer model  that the whole point of this program is to help people  and as many as possible those who actually need the help    My colleagues and I in Congress allocated this money with the understanding that FEMA would ensure it was given to the areas with the greatest needs   Congressman Bobby Jindal said   Instead  FEMA has once again defied common sense and seemingly ignored the plight of thousands of Louisianans still waiting for adequate housing  I sincerely hope that FEMA will reconsider the allocation of these dollars  and keep in mind that thousands of Louisiana families are still struggling to rebuild their homes or find affordable housing   The delegation sent its letters to FEMA  relevant Congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office  GAO    The full text of the delegation s letter to FEMA Director Paulison is available  and the full text of the delegation s letter to the GAO is available
