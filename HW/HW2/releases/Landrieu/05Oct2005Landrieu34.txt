Sen  Landrieu  No More Broken Promises         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 05 05    Sen  Landrieu  No More Broken Promises USA Today Op Ed highlights national importance of aiding Louisiana  refutes critics  misstatements    WASHINGTON    U S Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today published in USA Today an op ed highlighting the national importance of urgently providing the much needed aid to Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  Sen  Landrieu s column is below  As south Louisiana began rebuilding after Hurricane Betsy in 1965  President Johnson pledged that  the national government will be at Louisiana s side to help every step of the way   But as memories faded and debates over how to help dragged on  the promise of strong and timely federal support faded  too   A project that could have saved New Orleans from much of Hurricane Katrina s wrath languished in the courts   Countless requests for more flood and hurricane protection went unheeded   And initiatives to restore the USA s wetlands were repeatedly and irrationally opposed    Tight fisted ignorance and misstated statistics seem to push us down this tired road of broken promises again   Some suggest that  212 billion over five years is too much for rebuilding Louisiana s devastated infrastructure and diverse economy   They claim  40 billion of it is too high for protection projects already authorized by Congress and recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers   Comparing the costs with the Corps  annual budget  critics fail to note that these projects will span decades and protect parishes across Louisiana  not just New Orleans  We have long understood that coastal projects are part of an integrated system  but critics oppose vital navigational projects without which the effort would be akin to a highway without exit ramps   Coastal protection continues to be our priority  making up more than 95  of this  40 billion proposal and 84  of my 2006 Corps funding request for coastal Louisiana construction  The USA depends on Louisiana as a lifeline for energy and commerce and cannot afford to fall victim again to shortsighted pundits with little understanding of our unique and valuable coast   The proposed PELICAN Commission ensures knowledgeable experts will make the important judgments quickly  With the majority of seats appointed by the president  the commission will protect federal interests  I am open to adding a delegate from the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that environmental concerns are appropriately weighed  But decisions should lead to effective  immediate action  not decades of bureaucratic delay  Unfortunately for the good people of Louisiana  we ve been down that road before  and it leads only to disaster   Louisiana s spirit remains unbroken   So too should America s promises    30
