Landrieu Honors National Adoption Month         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 15 2007    Landrieu Honors National Adoption Month Introduces resolution with Sen  Coleman     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement on the floor of the Senate recognizing National Adoption Month  which is November  and National Adoption Day  November 17  Sens  Landrieu and Norm Coleman  R Minn   co chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption  today introduced a resolution honoring the goals of National Adoption Day and Month to draw awareness to adoption issues  and it is expected tonight to pass by unanimous consent  Fifteen additional Senators have cosponsored the bill  Sen  Landrieu said    I wanted to come to the floor to speak with my colleague from Minnesota to talk about a very important issue that we try to remember and reflect on through the whole month of November  and particularly on November 17  which is National Adoption Day  It reminds us of the importance of family as well as the importance of rules and laws that we try to pass here in Congress and at the local level to encourage families to be strengthened and expanded through the miracle of adoption    Many members of congress  including myself  are adoptive parents  We ve personally experienced the joy of building our families through adoption  and we are proud promoters of this practice that is not uniquely American but it is really embraced by Americans in a way that it is not embraced in most countries in the world  and we re proud of that  In America we like to believe that it s not the color of the skin that makes a family or even being from the same part of the world  It s just a bond  a love that can be shared between people and families and children  even if those children are of a different race  a different background  It s a very unique part of America that s quite open and quite extraordinary    In America we adopt thousands of children  The numbers have increased each year over the past decade  in good measure because of work that s been done right here in the United States  right here in Congress    Our hope  our wish ultimately is that all children could stay with their birth families  In an ideal world  Mr  President  you would want all children born in the world in every country every day and every year to be born in a families that want them  that can care for them  nurture them  families that will stay whole and permanent  But we know in the reality of the world in which we live  that is not possible  War  famine  disease  addiction  violence and gross neglect separate families  separate children from their birth parents every day    It s one of our primary responsibilities as governments  as responsible functioning governments  particularly democracies  to do what we can to connect those children who are separated from that so special bond with a birth parent  to reconnect that child as quickly as possible to another nurturing  loving adult to be raised    It would seem the most natural thing in the world to understand that a child without a parent is very vulnerable  Even children with parents  even children with parents who are educated and able to navigate through life still have great challenges  So you can imagine the vulnerability of a child with no parent to protect them  Alone to raise themselves  And children don t do that very well  And governments don t raise children  Human beings do  parents do    We re working at it  Mr  President  We have a long way to go  And so that s why every November our presidents    President Clinton and before him President Bush and our current President    takes a minute to acknowledge that November in America is National Adoption month    We can focus our country and our efforts to congratulate ourselves on our progress  but there is still the gap  We have 514 000 children that have been removed from their birth families and placed in the care of the community  in foster care  About 115 000 of these children are waiting to be adopted  and the majority of their parents have terminated their parental rights  These children are waiting to be placed in a permanent family through adoption  whether kinship or regular  and long term guardianship    I come to the floor today to recognize some of these children that are waiting  to say that while we re making progress  we have some beautiful children who are still waiting to be adopted  and misconceptions exist about some of the children that are in our foster care system  It s not the children who are delinquent in foster care  The problem really was at the parental end    the parents somehow failed to step up  These children are not damaged goods  They are doing beautifully in school  Many of them grow up to be quite successful  But they need  just like all children need  parents and protection    We have tens of thousands of children of all ages waiting to be adopted right here in the United States  We have millions of orphans around the world  I am proud of the laws that we have tried to pass here on the floor of the Senate giving appropriate tax credits and providing other opportunities for children to move into loving and permanent families
