of Operation Mend a Heart  a joint partnership between Tulane University Hospital and Clinic  TUHC  and the United States Military  at a press conference in New Orleans   Operation Mend a Heart will provide humanitarian medical assistance to underprivileged children of war torn foreign countries who would otherwise not have access to pediatric medical and surgical care               The people behind Operation Mend a Heart know that one way we can support our troops is by supporting the people they are fighting for  the children of Iraq   explained Landrieu   Operation Mend a Heart will help provide the humanitarian medical assistance to the underprivileged children of Iraq who would otherwise not have access to the pediatric medical and surgical care they need               Baher  a nine year old boy from Iraq  will be the first to receive medical care thanks to Operation Mend a Heart   He and his mother are scheduled to travel from Baghdad to New Orleans later this week where the young boy will undergo on operation to correct a ventricular septal defect  commonly referred to as a  hole in the heart    While in New Orleans  both Baher and his mother will reside at a Tulane residential facility  He is expected to be in the hospital for about for about five days  and will remain in New Orleans for recovery for an additional four weeks              According to program founder Karen Troyer Caraway  a vice president of TUHC   Most Americans think of our military in combat roles   Many Americans do not realize that our military mission also includes humanitarian assistance  rebuilding communities and investing in the future   Operation Mend a Heart is ordinary Americans helping the U  S  military accomplish their mission    Below are Senator Landrieu s complete remarks as prepared for delivery at this morning s press conference   Sen  Landrieu said   Earlier this year  I visited Baghdad and saw firsthand the difficult challenges our troops face there everyday   And I was struck by the strength and courage our young men and women on the ground had when facing those challenges     But I was also struck by something else   I was struck by the strength and courage of the Iraqi people   For years  that strength and courage allowed them to persevere under the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein     That strength and courage is what also led the Iraqi people to the ballot box in January even when faced with countless terrorist threats   And today  that strength and courage is helping the Iraqi people overcome the dangerous insurgency that has gripped their country     Unfortunately  these are hard times for the Iraqi people   But they still persevere   Perhaps there is no better example of this strength and courage than a little Iraqi boy named Baher   Baher is only 9 years old  too young to have to face the ravages of war    yet that is exactly what he has to do     But Baher s story does not end with the war   He faces another challenge     Baher has a hole in his heart   If this hole is not closed  Baher faces congenital heart disease and death   If Baher hopes to see adulthood  his heart requires advanced medical treatment   But in a time of war  Baher cannot get that medical treatment at home   Thankfully  the good people of Louisiana are willing to help   Even though Baher cannot get the medical treatment he needs in Iraq  he can get it right here in New Orleans     And thanks to a new project named Operation Mend A Heart  Baher will get the treatment he needs   Operation Mend a Heart will provide humanitarian medical assistance to underprivileged children of war torn countries who would otherwise not have access to pediatric medical and surgical care    It will help Iraqi children who are facing enormous odds by bringing them here to New Orleans where they can receive the medical attention they deserve     And today  I am pleased to announce that Baher will be the first Iraqi child to benefit from this ground breaking program     The people behind Operation Mend a Heart understand that one way we can support our troops is by supporting the people they are fighting for  the children of Iraq   And I am honored to stand here with them today   The people of Louisiana may be divided over whether or not going to Iraq was the right decision   But we are united in the belief that we must do all we can to support our troops   And we are united in our compassion for the Iraqi civilians caught in the crossfire     I am overjoyed to know that the good men and women at Tulane Hospitals have taken the lead by creating Mend a Heart  the first program of its kind in the entire nation     I hope Operation Mend a Heart is only the beginning   So far  Tulane has already identified 50 underprivileged Iraqi children who require immediate medical attention  and I challenge every state to follow Louisiana s lead   If each state were to adopt just one child  we will have made an incredible difference in saving the lives of these innocent children   It takes a great deal of strength and courage for a 9 year old boy to undergo surgery  much less travel half way around the world   But that is exactly the kind of strength and courage this young boy possesses     Together  the people of New Orleans will welcome Baher and his mother to our city and our country   Together  we will mend that young boy s heart   And together  we will make the world a better place for all our children    one heart at a time     For more information on Operation Mend a Heart
