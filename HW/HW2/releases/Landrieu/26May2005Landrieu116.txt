Sen  Landrieu Statement on the Nomination of John Bolton         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 26 2005    Sen  Landrieu Statement on the Nomination of John Bolton     WASHINGTON    The following is a statement by U S  Senator Mary Landrieu  D La   regarding the nomination of John Bolton as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations  Sen  Landrieu said   As member after member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee shed light on some very troubling aspects of John Bolton s relationships with his peers and subordinates  it became increasingly clear to me that he may very well be the wrong choice for this important post   However  he is President Bush s choice   At a time when international cooperation is more essential than at perhaps any other time in recent memory  it is indeed unfortunate that the president would select a nominee that scores of former diplomats have petitioned this body not to confirm   Now is the time when America must reach out and strengthen its relationships with other nations    not choose as its Ambassador a man who not only once refused to even acknowledge the body in which he is nominated to serve  but who is also alleged to have jeopardized peace talks through his own inflammatory remarks   Further  his total disregard for international institutions raises concerns that he does not grasp the spirit in which lasting peace is achieved   In light of this pattern of poor judgment and inappropriate behavior  I intend to vote against his confirmation as Ambassador to the United Nations   But while I share the concerns of many of my colleagues regarding the White House s refusal to share documents relating to his alleged mishandling of intelligence information  I believe the debate on Mr  Bolton s nomination has been thorough and complete   It is time for it to come to an end   As such  I voted tonight for cloture on his nomination
