House Passes Domenici LandrieuOil and Gas Revenue Sharing Plan         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 08 2006    House Passes Domenici LandrieuOil and Gas Revenue Sharing Plan President Truman s offer  accepted  37 5 percent to go to La  and Gulf Coast states     WASHINGTON    The U S  House of Representatives today passed final legislation that includes the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711  which opens substantial new areas to oil and natural gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and shares billions of dollars in revenues with Louisiana and other energy producing Gulf Coast states for coastal wetlands restoration  hurricane protection and flood control projects  An additional share will be used to build parks and preserve green spaces in all 50 states  The package also includes several key tax provisions  including a two year extension of the Gulf Opportunity  GO  Zone tax incentive that provides strong motivation to invest in the Gulf Coast   A mighty hurdle was cleared for Louisiana and the Gulf Coast today when the House passed the Domenici Landrieu plan as part of a final legislative package   Sen  Landrieu said   After almost 60 years  Louisiana will finally receive a fair share of the oil and gas revenues produced off our shores  This dedicated revenue stream is necessary to restore our coastal wetlands  build levees and construct an effective flood control system    all of which will fend off hurricanes rising in the Gulf    This victory for Louisiana demonstrates how successful we can be when we work as a team and keep our focus  The Louisiana congressional delegation and Governor Kathleen Blanco  Lt  Governor Mitch Landrieu and many local officials  business leaders and civic groups never stopped working to achieve this goal  Numerous groups have been essential to this effort  including America s WETLAND Campaign to Save Coastal Louisiana  Parishes Against Coastal Erosion  Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana  Women of the Storm  Levees org  Coast Guardians as well as national groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers  the American Chemistry Council  the Consumer Alliance for Energy Security  the Agriculture Energy Alliance and countless others   Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act Sen  Landrieu and Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   coauthored the plan to open 8 3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico and share 37 5 percent of the new revenues  dedicated to coastal protection  with Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama  An additional 12 5 percent will be dedicated to the state side of the Land and Conservation Fund  which funds the acquisition of parks and green spaces across the country  The White House endorsed the bill in late July   The plan is essential for the recovery and long term economic vitality of South Louisiana from Venice to Cameron because it will help us defend against hurricanes while at the same time protecting one of America s most vital ecosystems   Sen  Landrieu said   It s also vital for the nation because it increases energy production along America s only Energy Coast and restores the wetlands that protect some of our nation s most critical energy infrastructure  It further serves the Louisiana economy by creating jobs and stimulating business activity  and does so in a fiscally responsible manner without raising the federal budget deficit   In the last decade  the price of natural gas has shot up  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that more than 3 million U S  jobs have been lost since 2000  The Domenici Landrieu plan allows for increased domestic energy production for the first time in 25 years  and geologists expect to find significant oil and natural gas reserves  The area is projected to produce enough natural gas to sustain more than 1 000 chemical plants for 40 years  and enough oil to keep 2 7 million cars running and 1 2 million homes heated for more than 15 years   The Domenici Landrieu plan is a significant step toward solving South Louisiana s coastal erosion  as Louisiana is projected to receive more than  13 billion over the next 30 years  Coupled with that  the state is expected to receive  12 billion in the next 10 years from the regular budget process and other previous legislation  such as The Breaux Act  the Coastal Impact Assistance Program  and supplemental appropriations bills  which Sen  Landrieu helped to craft from her position on the Senate Appropriations Committee  Bonding programs will also allow the state to begin taking immediate action to restore and protect the coast by relying on future funds  Tax Extenders The legislative package the House passed along with the Domenici Landrieu plan would extend tax breaks benefiting Louisianians  Most important among these is the Gulf Opportunity  GO  Zone tax incentive  which the whole delegation has been pushing Congress to extend  The GO Zone incentive passed in 2005 has allowed hundreds of businesses to invest in areas impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and to take a 50 percent tax reduction for new facilities or equipment  jumpstarting recovery by giving businesses an incentive to quickly invest  Current law requires that businesses put new facilities or equipment in place by the end of 2008  but the package will extend the benefit until 2010    The recovery effort resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in my state and other Gulf states is beyond what the country has ever seen before   Sen  Landrieu said   Many businesses need incentives  such as the GO Zone tax breaks  to encourage redevelopment in very difficult circumstances  which is essential to strengthening our economy and rebuilding our communities   Also included in the tax package are extensions for college tuition deduction  a research and development credit and a deduction for teachers  out of pocket expenses   The Senate  which passed the Domenici Landrieu bill with a strongly bipartisan 71 to 25 vote in August  is expected to pass the combined revenue sharing and tax extender package this weekend and send it to the President for his signature
