Landrieu Asks FEMA to Fix Housing Assistance Program         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 11 2007    Landrieu Asks FEMA to Fix Housing Assistance Program Sends letter to FEMA director urging change of recertification process     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison requesting that the agency change its policy regarding its housing recertification process   FEMA recently extended its housing program through March 2009 and expanded the role of the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  in the administration and management of its rental assistance program  Despite their housing policy changes  FEMA is requiring assistance recipients to go through a recertification process  putting program recipients at greater risk of losing housing assistance   I am writing to express my urgent concern about FEMA s latest effort to recertify households participating in its rental assistance program   Sen  Landrieu wrote    Even in light of FEMA s recent extension of the disaster housing program and the new program improvements  including management activities by HUD  the failure to clean up the recertification process exposes program recipients to undue stress and complication  and also puts them at greater risk of losing their housing assistance   FEMA s letters  are confusing  threatening  and may ultimately result in eligible households having their benefits interrupted or cut  Some households have received two different and conflicting letters   Sen  Landrieu continued in her letter    I am increasingly concerned that FEMA s recertification process is more burdensome than necessary  The prior two recertification efforts were waived after much confusion and low compliance  and this recertification effort seems destined for a similar ending   Sen  Landrieu urged Paulison to make the following changes to FEMA s housing program  Eliminate information that is not required to determine recertification   Requesting such information under penalty of perjury is the least effective way to obtain such information  Include in the recertification form only such questions as are necessary to ensure that the household remains in need of housing assistance  Post on FEMA s website a description of the steps needed for a household to recertify for assistance and include a copy of the simplified recertification form  Ensure that all FEMA operators understand and are fluent in the requirements for households to recertify  Prepare public service announcements on the recertification program and distribute to radio and television stations in areas that have the most evacuees  and Hold a one day recertification event in cities with large evacuee populations  allowing evacuees a central location to obtain the recertification form and assistance with completing the form  The full text of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
