Daily Advertiser Backs Push to Make Road Home Whole         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 28 2007    Daily Advertiser Backs Push to Make Road Home Whole Landrieu and Vitter  standing strong  in face of  pressure to increase flood insurance premiums     WASHINGTON    In an editorial published today  the Lafayette  La   Daily Advertiser supported efforts by U S  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and David Vitter  R La   to free up  1 17 billion from bureaucratic red tape and make it available to augment the Road Home program and help homeowners elevate their homes    The legislation appeared headed for passage in the U S  Senate    with 99 of 100 Senators consenting to its approval    in the days before the Christmas holiday   However  a last minute objection blocked the bill s consideration until late January at the earliest   Senator Richard Shelby  R Ala   said he held up the bill because of both Louisiana senators  opposition to legislation that would dramatically increase flood insurance premiums for Louisiana homeowners and businesses  The Daily Advertiser wrote today that it favors  the elevation funding bill and  is  leery of the Shelby premium increase    The paper urged readers to  play a role in passing a measure beneficial to our state  and help lobby in support of the Landrieu Vitter effort  The full text of the Daily Advertiser editorial appears below  Alabama Louisiana battle is under way Louisiana and Alabama lawmakers have locked horns in the U S  Senate  The battle pits Louisiana Sens  Mary Landrieu  a Democrat  and David Vitter  a Republican  against Sen  Richard Shelby  an Alabama Republican  It all began when Shelby submitted a bill calling for the overhaul of the nation s flood insurance program  Landrieu and Vitter objected to the Shelby bill because it would raise insurance premiums by 25 percent on businesses  second homes and homes that repeatedly flood   The legislation  the senators said  would price many Louisiana homeowners and businesses out of the program  Rather than risk a vote on the measure  they put a hold on it  That blocks it from being considered  Then the plot thickened  Landrieu and Vitter are championing a bill that would free another  1 2 billion for Louisiana s Road Home program  The funds would provide grants of up to  30 000 apiece to Louisiana residents whose homes were battered by Hurricane Katrina  The grants would be used to elevate the homes  Under current Federal Emergency Management Agency rules  property owners must make the improvements first and then be reimbursed  The proposal by the Louisiana senators would simply allow the state to begin making allocations to the homeowners before they begin elevating their homes  We support the measure  Shelby probably would support such legislation for his Alabama constituents  but he is angry  Just before adjournment for the holidays  he put a hold on the Landrieu Vitter legislation to keep it from being considered  Both sides are standing strong  Shelby asked that his bill be allowed to come up for unanimous consent of the Senate  avoiding a vote  Landrieu said he offered her  a deal with the devil  that she could not accept  The Landrieu Vitter legislation has been moving well through the process  The  1 2 billion is already there  waiting to be doled out to those in Louisiana who want to protect their homes from flooding  State officials have already applied for the money on behalf of eligible Road Home recipients  If enacted  the Landrieu Vitter bill will complete Louisiana s application process for federal Road Home money  Last month  Congress approved  3 billion to cover the outstanding shortfall in the program  It could all be going into effect now had Shelby stood aside and let it pass  Before Shelby erected the barrier  the Louisiana senators expected the legislation to clear the Senate by unanimous consent  When the Senate returns in January  Landrieu and Vitter believe they can get it before their colleagues and win approval  The response from other Senators has been positive thus far  We favor the elevation funding bill and are leery of the Shelby premium increase  At this time  Landrieu and Vitter could probably use some moral support in the form of letters or phone calls  Consider providing that  Play a role in passing a measure beneficial to our state
