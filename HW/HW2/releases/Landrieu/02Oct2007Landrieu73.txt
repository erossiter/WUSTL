Landrieu Inspired Program Launches to Provide No Cost Microsoft Software to Hurricane Affected Small Businesses         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 02 2007    Landrieu Inspired Program Launches to Provide No Cost Microsoft Software to Hurricane Affected Small Businesses Businesses eligible for one year software license reimbursement     WASHINGTON    Louisiana small businesses struggling to rebuild from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the subsequent levee breaks are now eligible for one year of Microsoft software licensing at no cost  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   announced today   The 2005 storms impacted 125 000 small and medium sized businesses across the Gulf Coast  and in Louisiana alone  more than 18 000 businesses were totally destroyed     Small businesses are a key economic backbone of our recovery   said Sen  Landrieu  who proposed the unprecedented approach in a letter to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates last year    This landmark partnership will help provide the tools these business owners need to rebuild their businesses stronger than ever despite their limited financial resources   Under the program launching this week  hurricane affected businesses can purchase licenses for Microsoft software  including the popular Windows and Office products  through any authorized Microsoft reseller with payments spread over three years   Eligible business owners would then bring the first year s invoice to any Louisiana Small Business Development Center  LSBDC  and Microsoft will pay it on the business  behalf   For a typical small business of 50 employees and 25 computers licensing Microsoft Windows Vista and the Office 2007 suite of programs  the free year will result in savings of about  12 000    Microsoft was proud to play a role in helping the people of the Gulf Coast rebuild following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and we are committed to contributing to the ongoing community recovery efforts   said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer  who met with Sen  Landrieu to begin crafting the program earlier this year   In particular  we believe very strongly that small businesses are a vital engine of economic growth and opportunity and we will continue to support small business owners in Louisiana as they work to rebuild and revive their communities     Technology is critical to the success of a small business   said Mary Lynn Wilkerson  State Director of the Louisiana Small Business Development Centers     It allows Louisiana businesses to develop customers worldwide  This agreement with Microsoft will assist small businesses with their cash flow by saving them the first year s licensing fees   LSBDC applauds Senator Landrieu for initiating and negotiating this important agreement with Microsoft   Senator Landrieu has been such a champion for small businesses   The LSBDC offers high quality  no cost business consulting and low cost training for small business owners and potential owners through nine centers statewide  and will provide additional free Microsoft software training for businesses participating in the licensing program   The LSBDC also offers business management training on topics ranging from e commerce to small business accounting    Since Hurricane Katrina  LSBDC Greater New Orleans Region has counseled nearly 2 600 small business owners  LSBDC is a partnership program supported by the Small Business Administration  Louisiana Economic Development  and the host universities for the nine service centers   This novel approach reflects just one good way big business can step up and use its might to help an entire region get back on its feet  and I commend and thank Microsoft for its leadership   Sen  Landrieu said    Their commitment is made even stronger by their smart partnership with Louisiana s Small Business Development Centers  who under Mary Lynn Wilkerson s leadership have been a tremendously helpful guiding hand to thousands of businesses working to recover   To be eligible for the licensing program  businesses must  have been in business prior to August 29  2005  the date of Hurricane Katrina s landfall  or September 24  2005  the date of Hurricane Rita s landfall  depending on which region the business was located in  had been based at the time of the storms in one of 30 federal disaster designated Louisiana parishes  Acadia  Ascension  Assumption  Calcasieu  Cameron  E  Feliciana  East Baton Rouge  Iberia  Iberville  Jeff Davis  Jefferson  Lafourche  Livingston  Orleans  Plaquemines  Pointe Coupee  St  Bernard  St  Charles  St  Helena  St  James  St  John the Baptist  St  Martin  St  Mary  St  Tammany  Tangipahoa  Terrebonne  Vermillion  W  Baton Rouge  W  Feliciana  or Washington  businesses may have relocated out of the 30 parish area since the hurricanes   have fewer than 200 employees  have applied for small business assistance through at least one federal or state government program  though the application need not have been approved  and purchase a three year Microsoft Open Value License for business software  the first year will be paid for by Microsoft with proof of purchase   Sen  Landrieu also today commended Microsoft for their continued commitment to helping Gulf Coast communities rebuild  for supporting workforce development and for increasing their commitment to supporting future disaster relief and recovery efforts   Microsoft s disaster response team will be working closely with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  which Sen  Landrieu chairs  to seek out new and effective ways for the company to assist following a disaster   This effort isn t just a strong corporate commitment to the community   Sen  Landrieu said    It is smart business  Microsoft has recognized that the businesses that survive disaster today are the successful customers of tomorrow   I hope their leadership inspires other companies to take similar proactive steps to help their customers rebuild when disaster strikes
