Landrieu Presses Case for Revenue Sharing in Hill Op Ed         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 09 2006    Landrieu Presses Case for Revenue Sharing in Hill Op Ed     WASHINGTON    As part of a special report on energy and environmental issues  The Hill  a Washington newspaper  this week published an opinion column by United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   In it  she makes the case for allowing Gulf Coast states to keep their fair share of the oil and gas revenues generated off their shores  SECURE THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY SUPPLY Consider for a moment what would happen if the District of Columbia were washed away in a matter of hours  if overnight our nation s capital simply slipped into the Potomac  Surely the mere threat of such a calamity would cause us to spring into action  taking every step imaginable to ensure that this disaster would not occur  Unfortunately  one similar already has  Land lost along the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita totals more than 118 square miles  an area nearly twice the size of Washington  D C  Louisiana alone has lost an area roughly the size of Delaware or two Rhode Islands since FDR was president  with the equivalent of a football field slipping away every 38 minutes  When our coastline erodes  buried pipelines that carry the nation s oil and natural gas are left perilously exposed  Refineries that produce gasoline for Americans across the country are compromised  as are the power plants that convert natural gas into electricity to heat homes in dozens of states  And the ports that take in nearly a fifth of the nation s imported crude oil are left increasingly isolated and susceptible to further hurricane damage  As we debate the need to reduce our dependence on foreign energy supplies  we must not forget that the Gulf Coast is our nation s only energy coast  Americans depend heavily upon the oil and gas produced off the shores of Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama to light their homes  heat their schools  fuel their cars and run their businesses  In fact  these coastal states do more to fuel our nation than any foreign country  Yet this vital coast is being washed into the sea  leaving vulnerable the infrastructure behind a quarter of the oil and gas we consume each day  There is an urgent need for action  and unfortunately there are no cheap  easy or quick fixes  Meeting this clear and present danger to our economy and energy security requires integrated policymaking and  perhaps more than anything  national will  It also requires many billions of dollars over many years  That s why I ve introduced the Gulf Coast Protection Act of 2006 and have worked with my Gulf Coast colleagues to integrate its concepts into other legislation  Our plan would create a long term  reliable and fiscally responsible revenue stream to fund coastal protection  flood control and wetlands restoration along the Gulf Coast  It is perhaps the only way to address these national problems prudently  First  it s a matter of intelligent planning  For years the federal government has tried a piecemeal funding approach for levees  flood control and coastal protection  and it has failed dramatically  But if just half of the  6 billion to  8 billion in federal revenue generated each year by energy production on the Gulf s Outer Continental Shelf were reinvested into protecting the coast it would provide the funding source we now lack  Second  it is far less expensive for the federal government to prevent flooding than it is to deal with the damage after it occurs  To date  Congress and private insurers have directed more than  100 billion to post hurricane rescue  relief  recovery  rebuilding and insurance claims  costs that in many  if not most  cases could have been avoided had the levees held and a more substantial wetlands system still flourished  And third  it s fair  Inshore states receive 50 percent of the royalties from minerals produced on federal lands with the help of their state infrastructure  Why shouldn t Gulf Coast states receive the same share for providing the same support to production off their coasts  There is no fair  logical reason why they should not  For years  our government has been penny wise and pound foolish when it comes to protecting our national energy supply  That s why solving these problems the right way  by providing a fair and reasonable reinvestment in our coastline  makes fiscal  as well as common  sense for the long term  This plan does not ask for more federal money to solve one state s problems  It asks America to solve a national problem  It asks the nation to make a commitment  once and for all  to protecting a vital coastline that fuels every corner of our country  This plan makes that commitment  and does so responsibly  It s a matter of will  and commitment  It s about saving lives and securing both our economy and security  It s that basic  Landrieu is a member of the
