Report  Feds Ill Prepared for Katrina  or Rita Scale Disaster         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 06 2007    Report  Feds Ill Prepared for Katrina  or Rita Scale Disaster Landrieu  DHS FEMA shows  no urgency  to improve as agency meets benchmarks only marginally better than the Iraqi government     WASHINGTON    The U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has yet to demonstrate a capacity to adequately respond should another Katrina  or Rita sized hurricane strike the United States  the investigative arm of Congress today reported   The 320 page analysis of the agency s attempted reforms since 9 11 and the 2005 hurricanes was prepared by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  at the request of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee   I am not at all surprised by the findings of this report   said Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   a committee member and chairman of its Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  which oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA     As I have noted time and again    there has been no sense of urgency demonstrated by Secretary Chertoff or any other high ranking member of this Administration to learn the lessons of Katrina and Rita and implement a better  smarter approach    After Katrina  it is no surprise that GAO finds weaknesses in the area of emergency preparedness and response   said Sen  Joseph Lieberman  ID Conn   the full committee chairman    With the second anniversary of Katrina just behind us  we know we must redouble our efforts to correct those shortcomings   The report found that the DHS has failed to meet 18 of 24 essential criteria for emergency preparedness and response   Among these  the GAO identified a general lack of achievement in DHS initiatives to  ensure the capacity and readiness of disaster response teams  develop plans and capabilities to strengthen nationwide recovery efforts  develop the capacity to provide needed emergency assistance and services in a timely manner   and  provide timely assistance and services to individuals and communities in response to emergency events    DHS did not provide us with concrete evidence to demonstrate that the response teams  readiness and capacity have improved since hurricanes Katrina and Rita   the GAO reported   Although DHS has tested its response team capabilities in several small scale disasters  they have not been tested in a large scale disaster    We don t know when or where the next disaster    natural or manmade    will strike   said Sen  Landrieu  noting that 2007 has been the first year in which two Category 5 hurricanes have made landfall along the Gulf of Mexico in the same season    How many more close calls need to be dodged before DHS and FEMA take the necessary steps to get ready   Sen  Landrieu also noted that in substantially meeting only five of 24 assessed criteria  the Department of Homeland Security s performance is only marginally better than the Iraqi government s 3 of 18 performance in meeting key benchmarks of another GAO report released this week  Today s report was officially released by Comptroller General David M  Walker  who heads the GAO  at a hearing of the Homeland Security committee entitled  A DHS Status Report  Assessing Challenges and Measuring Progress    Paul A  Schneider  the DHS Undersecretary for Management  was also called to testify  Last week  Sens  Lieberman and Landrieu also requested that the GAO conduct a thorough analysis of what the federal government has done  is doing and still can do to help hurricane victims rebuild their lives  The two senators asked the agency to specifically examine how the government can further help those still receiving federal disaster aid  as the Katrina and Rita hurricane recovery  sputters along    GAO has also documented the difficulties DHS has had in forging a unified department from its many component pieces   Sen  Lieberman said today    This is difficult  unglamorous work but goes to the very core of why we created the Department  If the component agencies of DHS continue to operate as disconnected entities  we will have gained little in exchange for the effort that creating this Department entailed    There are few responsibilities of our government greater than the protection of our people and the response when our nation is imperiled by disaster   added Sen  Landrieu  who has announced plans to introduce legislation that will further reform federal disaster response through improvements to the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act     Second rate preparedness and response is simply unacceptable  and our national preparedness and recovery infrastructure must be dramatically improved    from top to bottom  start to finish   I will not give up this fight  and will continue to urge drastic change until we have the first class system of readiness and response our nation requires
