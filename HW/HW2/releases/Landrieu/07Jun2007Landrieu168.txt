Landrieu  Immigration Bill Falls Short on Essential Reform         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 07 2007    Landrieu  Immigration Bill Falls Short on Essential Reform Votes no on controversial immigration bill     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement after voting against cloture on S  1348  the immigration bill   The procedural motion  which would have limited further debate and allowed a final vote on the bill  required 60 votes to pass but failed by 34 for to 61 against  Sen  Landrieu said   I voted no today because the floor debate and amendment process have failed to produce a balanced bill   I had last month voted to move forward with a debate on the legislation in hopes that it would be improved by amendment  but despite a good effort  that has just not happened     The guest worker program proposed in the bill is virtually unenforceable and its structure does little to help employers short on skilled workers  instead encouraging overstaying and more illegal behavior   The legalization rules laid out give greater preference for those in the country illegally than they do for authorized guest workers or family members of U S  citizens   This is not fair   If we are to provide a path to earned citizenship  the first people in line should be those who have played by the rules and followed the law   Finally  we have seen since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that the Department of Homeland Security is either unwilling or unable to implement quick and effective reform when it is needed or directed by Congress   This bill calls upon the agency to absorb yet another a hefty responsibility with little consideration for the resources  accountability and realistic timeline necessary to make it happen   During the debate on S  1348  Sen  Landrieu voted for amendments which would have eliminated or cutback the bill s temporary guest worker program and  Z Visa  legalization measures   She voted for the Dorgan Amendment to eliminate the temporary guest worker program and for the Bingaman amendment to cut the number of temporary guest workers from 400 000 to 200 000 per year  which passed the Senate  Senator Landrieu also supported an amendment to eliminate the legalization measures in the bill and two amendments that would have strengthened the border security triggers that must be in place before the temporary guest worker program can begin
