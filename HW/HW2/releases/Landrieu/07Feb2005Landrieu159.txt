Sen  Landrieu  President s Budget Falls Short for Louisiana and the Nation         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  02 07 2005    Sen  Landrieu  President s Budget Falls Short for Louisiana and the Nation     WASHINGTON    Following is a statement from Sen  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   regarding the today s release of the president s fiscal year 2006 federal budget request to Congress   The president s budget request today demonstrates his unwillingness to come clean on the true costs of his agenda   A penny saved is not a penny earned if at the end of the day you still owe a quarter   This plan rewards a select few  but at an unacceptable cost to future generations and our state and local governments   In these times of record deficits  tough choices must be made   But we cannot allow short term thinking or misguided allegiances to stand in the way of the best interests of our nation    In particular  I believe this budget reflects the wrong choices in   underfunding education at a crucial time of reform for our schools  shortchanging our National Guard and Reserve while asking them to bear more of the burden in the War on Terror  pulling the rug out from states who are trying to help our nation s 44 million uninsured   failing to fully support Louisiana s coastal restoration  hurricane protection  flood control and navigation needs  and  going back on our promise to rural America by neglecting the struggles of our farmers and shrimpers in the global economy   Sen  Landrieu will discuss the budget in more detail in a report to be released later this week
