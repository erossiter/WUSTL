Landrieu  Homeland Security Committee Consider Nomination of FEMA  2         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 12 2007    Landrieu  Homeland Security Committee Consider Nomination of FEMA  2 Admiral faces questions on formaldehyde in trailers  fake press conference  Backs Landrieu school recovery plan     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs today held a hearing on the nomination of Vice Admiral Harvey E  Johnson  Jr   to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA    Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   a member of the committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery  informed Admiral Johnson that she is not prepared to support his nomination without a clear commitment that he will reform FEMA and ensure that it is prepared for future catastrophic disasters   I am not prepared to support either nomination at this point until I am confident that you are both the agents of change that you claim to be   Sen  Landrieu said  referring to Admiral Johnson and Jeffrey William Runge  President Bush s nominee for Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs and Chief Medical Officer for the U S  Department of Homeland Security    The country desperately deserves a new FEMA   It s not ready to handle a catastrophic disaster   This senator is not going to support business as usual   Sen  Landrieu questioned Admiral Johnson on FEMA s recent decision to postpone formaldehyde testing of the agency s temporary trailers that are currently being used to house victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Earlier this month  Sen  Landrieu and Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Ranking Member Ted Stevens  R Alaska  sent a letter to FEMA Administrator R  David Paulison asking the agency to resume testing to ensure that the trailers are safe   Admiral Johnson testified today that the agency has plans to begin testing a sample of their trailers   Your department has issued rulings that the only time you have a problem is if the trailers are locked up   Sen  Landrieu said   but in cold weather  people don t leave their doors and windows open   Sen  Stevens and I sent a letter to FEMA urging you to resume testing   I hope that FEMA and HUD and this Administration are ready to deal with the results  If these trailers are dangerous  then this government is required to come up with an alternate plan   During her questioning of Admiral Johnson  Sen  Landrieu asked if Admiral Johnson supports language that she inserted into the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill that allows school districts impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to receive a single FEMA payment to rebuild schools  School districts have had to go through FEMA s complicated Public Assistance process on a building by building basis   Are you testifying that you are supportive of that new approach that is approved by this Committee  and are you willing to push it through   Sen  Landrieu asked   Absolutely   Admiral Johnson answered    One of our highest agenda items of all the PWs is to focus on education   I think we have done that with your urging  and I think we have got some good results with the State to show for that   During the hearing  Sen  Jon Tester  D Mont   questioned Admiral Johnson on his participation in a staged October news conference in which he took questions from his own staff pretending to be reporters   Homeland Security Department Secretary Michael Chertoff referred to the incident as  one of the dumbest and most inappropriate things I ve ever seen    If I had a press conference and walked in and my staff was asking me one question  red flags would go up   Sen  Tester said    Your resume indicates you re a leader   Your history    38 years in public service    indicates you re a leader   Why didn t you just say   hold it  what s going on    In October  Sen  Landrieu sent a letter to FEMA Administrator R  David Paulison seeking an explanation for the press conference   It has come to my attention that a member of your staff  Vice Admiral Harvey E  Johnson  this week held a press conference on the Federal Emergency Management Agency s  FEMA  response to the wildfires engulfing southern California   Sen  Landrieu wrote    I am disappointed to learn that Adm  Johnson misled the press and the public by taking questions from his own staff pretending to be reporters and that the agency did not disclose this misrepresentation   During today s hearing  Sen  Landrieu relayed to Admiral Johnson a survey recently conducted by the University of New Orleans that indicates overwhelming disapproval of FEMA throughout the country   We have a long way to go   Sen  Landrieu said    There s some good news and bad news in this survey   The bad news for FEMA is that more than 80 percent of the people surveyed nationwide have a very negative impression of the leadership under Michael Brown  and they are not that familiar with the new leadership   In their mind  it s the same old FEMA  and they don t like it and want it changed   The other interesting information in this survey is that more than 62 percent of people around the country are willing to do more   Despite the fact that more than  110 billion has been spent this survey indicates that people are willing to do more because they recognize that it was the Federal Government primarily that failed   The full report is available online at    I appreciate your willingness to serve  but my vote will hinge solely on whether you both are agents of change or whether you re just there to continue the status quo   Sen  Landrieu concluded
