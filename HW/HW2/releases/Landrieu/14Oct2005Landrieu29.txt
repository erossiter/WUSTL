Sen  Landrieu Responds to Sen  Craig s  Hurtful  Comments         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 14 05    Sen  Landrieu Responds to Sen  Craig s  Hurtful  Comments Urges critics to rid own house of corruption and cronyism     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   responded today to comments attributed to Senator Larry Craig  R Idaho     Fraud was in the culture of Iraqis   said Sen  Craig  according to the Lewiston  Idaho Morning Tribune    I believe that is true in the state of Louisiana  It is really the Big Easy    Regarding the devastated lower 9th Ward of New Orleans  he added   I m not humorous when I suggest we should turn it back to what it was  a wetland     In the McCall Star News Sen  Craig is quoted as having said   Louisiana and New Orleans are the most corrupt governments in our country and they always have been A rookie cop on the ground in New Orleans  they pay him or her  17 000 starting pay and then wink and say you better make the rest of it on the street   Sen  Landrieu said today   The good  hardworking and tax paying people of the 9th Ward  New Orleans and all of Louisiana deserve better than old stereotypes and ignorant remarks   This is especially true of the brave police officers who have worked so valiantly these past six weeks  even as many of their own homes have been flooded and their families separated   The thought that the people and neighborhoods of the 9th Ward are any less deserving of our humanity is absolutely offensive   Those who wish to go back home deserve a home to go back to   I have worked with Senator Craig for many years and had come to respect him  particularly through our work together on the Congressional Coalition on Adoption   And so  I remain hopeful that these hurtful remarks were not reported as he intended   But what makes them especially insulting to the people of Louisiana is not that they came from a friend  but that they are simply not true   Yes  Louisiana s political history is marred with corruption  and it is a shameful legacy that I and other state leaders have worked to overcome   As State Treasurer  I stood up to the bond lobby and fought for reform despite strong obstacles   Spearheaded by the current generation of leaders  including our Governor and Lieutenant Governor  Louisiana s sunshine laws and ethics codes are some of the most comprehensive in the country   And according to the U S  Department of Justice  public corruption in Louisiana is in decline     Louisiana has made great strides  and will continue to do so   But we are not alone in having this important work to do   In the past ten years  governors from Connecticut  Rhode Island  Arizona  Illinois  Ohio and Alabama have been charged with offenses including conspiracy  fraud  bribery and other ethical violations   The House Majority Leader  Rep  Tom Delay  R Tex   was this month indicted for conspiracy and money laundering   And just last week  five indictments were handed down against the Bush Administration s chief procurement officer   We do need to rid our government of corruption and cronyism   I support Governor Blanco s commitment to hiring one of the country s top accounting firms to monitor transactions related to the relief efforts   No one should be above accountability   And so  I urge my colleagues to clean their own house before using Louisiana s overcome past as an excuse for failing to help in our present hour of need     30
