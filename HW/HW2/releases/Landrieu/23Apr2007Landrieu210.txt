Senate and House Agree on Emergency Supplemental Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 23 2007    Senate and House Agree on Emergency Supplemental Bill  2 38 billion included for Katrina Rita recovery     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and other Senate and House Appropriations Committee members today completed a conference report on the Emergency Supplemental Spending bill  H R  1591  which will dedicate  2 38 billion to the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   This Supplemental addresses the critical aspects of the ongoing recovery in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast   Sen  Landrieu said   Most of the key provisions for our communities were retained when the Senate and House worked out their differences today   Unfortunately  the President has threatened to veto the bill because of  excessive and extraneous non emergency spending   But I do not view the  2 38 billion for Louisiana and the Gulf Coast in this bill to be excessive or extraneous  There is a very real  domestic emergency going on where Katrina and Rita struck  and I will continue the fight to keep these provisions in the bill if the President chooses to veto it    FAIR Funding Sen  Landrieu secured language in the bill that would waive for Katrina  and Rita affected communities provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Act that require localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  This provision has been waived 32 times since 1985 when per capita rebuilding costs have been excessive  Levee Funding Sen  Landrieu secured  1 3 billion for east and west bank levee projects in the New Orleans area  When cost overruns created a  1 3 billion shortfall in the projects  originally authorized by the 3rd Supplemental bill passed last year  the Bush Administration sought to shuffle the money away from other levee projects authorized in the 4th Supplemental bill  The funds secured by Sen  Landrieu would address the shortfall with direct funding  rather than simply borrowing funds and creating a shortfall in another set of levee projects instead  Disaster Loan Forgiveness Sen  Landrieu secured language in the bill that would make Katrina  and Rita affected Gulf Coast states eligible for the same Community Disaster Loan forgiveness option made available to all other disaster stricken communities  The Stafford Act has historically required forgiveness of such loans when independent audits determine the fiscal recovery of affected local communities is insufficient to repay the loans after a three year grace period  Shortly after the hurricanes  Sen  Landrieu proposed making  1 billion in unspent FEMA funds available for Community Disaster Loans under the same terms as had been afforded to other communities   But the version that was passed in October 2005  sponsored by Senators David Vitter  R La   and Bill Frist  R Tenn   specifically prohibited the federal government from ever forgiving the loans if communities were unable to pay them back  Education Sen  Landrieu also secured  30 million to recruit teachers and principals to K 12 schools in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and another  30 million to assist colleges and universities recovering from the storms
