Landrieu Urges La  Legislation to Prosecute Racial Intimidation         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 19 2007    Landrieu Urges La  Legislation to Prosecute Racial Intimidation In wake of Jena 6 incident  sends state congressional report outlining approach of other states to racial symbols     WASHINGTON    Noting that Jena  La   officials were precluded from prosecuting students who hung nooses in a school tree because the state lacks any law criminalizing the act  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today urged state leaders to enact broader racial intimidation legislation   She also released a report prepared at her request by the Congressional Research Service  CRS  outlining statutory approaches in other states to criminalizing such displays   Sen  Landrieu chairs the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee  which oversees CRS   There is literally no law on the books that a responsible district attorney might have used to prosecute the obvious threat that the students  in Jena  hanging the nooses were expressing   Sen  Landrieu wrote in a letter today to Governor Kathleen Blanco  the leadership of the Louisiana House of Representatives and Senate and each of the candidates running for Governor   It is my hope the  CRS  report will help you and your legislative team identify and share with the incoming administration new legislation that reaffirms Louisiana s commitment to justice for all of her citizens   I believe such a step would send the proper message to citizens of our state  the American people and visitors from around the globe that Louisiana does not condone racism  tacitly or otherwise   It will also present us with the opportunity to create something positive out of the pain that the Jena 6 situation has caused   The United States Senate this week passed the Commerce Justice Science Appropriations bill  which includes a Landrieu provision requiring the hiring of at least three new community conciliators for the Louisiana region  The Department of Justice s Community Relations Service works with local leaders and community groups to facilitate reconciliation during periods of racial or ethnic tension  The Service will now be directed to spend  2 million on the expansion of this and other regional offices  The Service did not arrive in Jena until nine months after the hanging of a noose in a tree on the grounds of Jena High School and six months after the charging of six African American students  Region 6    which includes Louisiana  Texas  Oklahoma  New Mexico and Arkansas    currently only employs three people  but the Landrieu amendment doubles their manpower   The students responsible for hanging the nooses in September 2006 could not be prosecuted by the LaSalle Parish District Attorney because state law prohibits only cross burning   Sen  Landrieu s letter urges a much broader statute that could incorporate similarly intended symbols such as nooses  swastikas and other emblems of intimidation   Louisiana has no criminal statute that would cover the sort of intimidation that the display of nooses on school property was intended to convey   Sen  Landrieu wrote     Last month  Sen  Landrieu wrote to the Department of Justice asking for a thorough review of what happed in Jena to establish a comprehensive public record of the facts   Full text of the letter to state leaders is available  and the CRS report is available
