Sen  Landrieu  After Urging Against Filibuster  Votes No on Alito         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  1 31 06    Sen  Landrieu  After Urging Against Filibuster  Votes No on Alito     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   who yesterday voted to ensure an up or down confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Samuel A  Alito  Jr   released the following statement today after voting against his confirmation to succeed Associate Justice Sandra Day O Connor   Sen  Landrieu last week urged her colleagues to oppose a filibuster  saying  we simply cannot afford to bring the Senate to a halt at a time when we need its action the most  on hurricane recovery issues along the Gulf Coast  Sen  Landrieu said today    The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of whether the laws of our land conform to the Constitution   Once confirmed  Justices serve for life  beholden only to the Constitution and the rule of law   It is an awesome responsibility  and for such an important event  we must have a confirmation process fitting of that responsibility  Too often in recent years  we have not   Though the judicial branch of our government is supposed to be independent of politics  the nomination and confirmation process has become far too political to the point that it no longer serves the nation s interests  regardless of partisan or philosophical differences    While Samuel Alito has solid qualifications to become a Supreme Court Justice  it is our duty to look deeper   It was never intended that the Senate be a rubber stamp  approving everyone the President nominated simply because he sent them to us   The framers expected Senators to bring wisdom and understanding to the task  not to simply check off boxes on an application form   Judge Alito s record gives me cause for concern   And his testimony during the confirmation hearings unfortunately did very little to lessen that concern  His opinions and dissents on the bench leave open very serious questions as to how he views the individual rights of American citizens    especially when they are threatened by powerful forces  including the government itself      I have voted for conservative judges many times      John Roberts was the most recent    and was ready to do so again   But I expected a nominee who would serve to protect the fundamental civil rights of all Americans       I want my vote against confirmation to help send a signal to all who care that the Supreme Court nomination process has become far too political and far too removed from the original purposes set forth by the framers of the Constitution   It is time for all of us  Republicans and Democrats  of every possible philosophical persuasion  to stand up against a process that so poorly serves the people of the states we represent in this great body     30
