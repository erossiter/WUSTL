Sen  Landrieu Opposes I 10 I 12 Toll Proposal         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  8 10 2006    Sen  Landrieu Opposes I 10 I 12 Toll Proposal     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today released the following statement regarding a request by the state to implement tolls on Interstate Highways 10 and 12 in Louisiana  Sen  Landrieu said   Commerce and trade are the lifeblood of the Louisiana economy  with our highways and rivers serving as its main arteries   The individuals and businesses  large and small  who drive our state s economy rely on these routes and have already been hit hard by the hurricanes and unusually high gas prices    Louisiana is certainly in great need of new revenues to invest in rebuilding our state s infrastructure   But putting tolls on the interstates does not appear to be a wise step   I am opposed to this proposal  and hope the state will find other ways of satisfying our needs
