Statement by Sen  Landrieu Regarding BRAC         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 13 2005    Statement by Sen  Landrieu Regarding BRAC     WASHINGTON    The following is a statement by Sen  Mary Landrieu  D La   regarding the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Recommendations by the U S  Secretary of Defense     Sen  Landrieu said   While today s announcement by the Secretary of Defense is less than what we had hoped and fought for  it is not beyond what we had prepared for    and many states and communities have been hit far worse   This recommendation closes facilities that have been important members of our community  but it also opens new doors of opportunity for the New Orleans region and our state as a whole     Our years of hard work and investment have paid off   The Federal City project is still very much alive  with the Marine Corps Reserve Headquarters staying in the area and the 8th Coast Guard District Headquarters providing a significant Homeland Security presence  possibly as a Federal City tenant   I also spoke this morning with Admiral Vern Clark  the Chief of Naval Operations  who informs me that in addition to new opportunities at Belle Chase  there will be  110 million in new construction as a result of facilities that need to be added   From my seat on the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee  we ve directed  275 55 million in new federal investments at Fort Polk and  63 million at Barksdale Air Force Base over the last three years  and have helped keep these bases off the list of losses entirely   BRAC remains an important part of our national military strategy and planning process   We live in a new world with new rules  and our military needs to adapt to the global challenges it now faces   Our facilities present innovative approaches to meet these challenges  and it is disappointing that despite our gains at Belle Chase and Barksdale  the Secretary did not fully appreciate the vital resources Naval Support Activity provides   And with 70 000 troops returning from overseas  it just doesn t make sense to be closing facilities at a time when they could be welcoming these troops home   This is why I voted with 46 of my colleagues to delay this round of domestic BRAC by two years until the overseas process could be completed   This recommendation is not the end of the BRAC process  but still very much a beginning   We know that our Louisiana military assets and the New Orleans Federal City are vital to our long term national defense and homeland security needs  and will proudly continue our fight to demonstrate this value to the BRAC commission
