Landrieu Opens Series of Disaster Recovery Hearings          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 12 2007    Landrieu Opens Series of Disaster Recovery Hearings  GAO testifies on long term recovery efforts in Gulf Coast     WASHINGTON    The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  chaired by United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today held the first in a series of hearings on disaster recovery  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  testified on its analysis of the disaster response and long term recovery efforts of federal  state and local governments   This committee is going to focus its energy on catastrophic disasters   Sen  Landrieu said  She added that government at every level was not prepared for the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  which devastated much of the Gulf Coast    It s about time we start doing a better job right here at home after catastrophes   she said  The two federal witnesses who testified were  Stanley Czerwinski  Director of Strategic Issues for GAO  and Chairman Don Powell  Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding   The GAO s analysis  Czerwinski said  found that the federal government provided billions of dollars to the Gulf Coast  but that much of it was for short term needs leaving little for long term recovery   It s not getting into the hands of those who need it fast of enough   he said  On the second panel  urban planners and local officials from Louisiana testified  including  Donna Fraiche  Chairman of the Louisiana Recovery Authority s Task Force on Long Term Community Planning  Mayor Tommy Longo of Waveland  Miss   Dr  Edward J  Blakely  Executive Director of Recovery Management for the City of New Orleans  and Ernie Broussard  Executive Director of the Cameron Parish Planning and Development Authority  The officials from Louisiana cited the 10 percent match requirement as one of the major impediments to recovery in Louisiana  The State of Louisiana has been required to provide a 10 percent match for every dollar made available through FEMA s public assistance program spent in the aftermath Katrina and Rita and the catastrophic floods that followed  The administration has waived the 10 percent match for less expensive disasters  per capita  such as Hurricane Andrew and the September 11 terrorist attacks  But President Bush has refused to waive the match for Katrina and Rita  which were far more devastating per capita  He has also threatened to veto the emergency appropriations bill Congress is considering  in part because it includes a match waiver   The 10 percent match waiver is one of the examples of government red tape that I am working to remove legislatively so that our communities can rebuild and thrive   Sen  Landrieu said    The GAO s analysis shows us that the current government mechanisms for dealing with disasters cannot handle a disaster with the scope of Katrina and Rita  My committee will continue to examine the government s immediate response to the hurricanes and the ongoing recovery efforts so that the mistakes made will never happen again
