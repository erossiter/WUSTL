Landrieu  FDA Must Ensure Safety of all Imported Seafood         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 29 2007    Landrieu  FDA Must Ensure Safety of all Imported Seafood     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on the Food and Drug Administration s  FDA  decision yesterday to ban importing five types of farm raised Chinese fish and shrimp because of the unsafe drugs they contain  China has been increasingly exporting shrimp to the United States  Sen  Landrieu  an Appropriations Committee member  has long fought for tougher FDA inspection of shrimp  catfish  shellfish and other farmed seafood products imported from overseas   Some Asian seafood has been found to be tainted with chloramphenicol  which has been banned in the United States   The FDA inspects less than two percent of shrimp being imported into the United States  Since 2004  Sen  Landrieu has inserted language in the Agriculture Appropriations bill stating that the FDA should make it a priority to inspect imported shrimp  and each year  she has requested  3 million for such increased inspections  The fiscal year 2008 bill is currently pending    Sen  Landrieu said   The FDA made a commonsense decision yesterday when it banned potentially dangerous  imported seafood from China  Some Chinese farm raised seafood  including shrimp  was found to contain chemicals that could cause serious health problems in humans  and are rightly illegal for use in the United States    I have been pushing for years to get the FDA to actively pursue more stringent inspections of imported seafood  and I hope the agency is on notice that this safety precaution is crucial for our public health
