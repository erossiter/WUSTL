Senate Passes Landrieu Amendment to Restore Children s Mental Health Funding         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 18 2007    Senate Passes Landrieu Amendment to Restore Children s Mental Health Funding Funding cut had been subject of Times Picayune editorial today     WASHINGTON    The United States Senate tonight unanimously passed an amendment by U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to restore priority grant funding to centers that provide mental health services to children affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita   One such program    the Louisiana Rural Trauma Services Center  managed by Louisiana State University    had received funding for four years to aid children faced with traumatic stress  but recently lost their federal funding    The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   which awards the grants  decided to determine this year s grantees by selectively picking and choosing among recommended scoring methods in a bill passed by the Senate last year   By including some of Congress  intent  while ignoring a Landrieu backed directive to give priority to programs that help children in the hurricane affected area  the agency excluded the Louisiana program from being chosen   Never before has the need for child mental health services been greater in Louisiana and other areas hard hit by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   Sen  Landrieu said    One year after the storms  41 percent of 4th through 12th graders in Orleans  St  Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes met the clinical definition for mental health service need   But yet  this is the time that SAMSHA decided this vital program    by their own account  a model program    was no longer worth funding     It s truly inexplicable   So much so  in fact  that when pressed for an explanation  the agency stumbled through three or four different answers before saying the program simply didn t score high enough    falling just three points shy on a 100 point scale   Sen  Landrieu s amendment to the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill would give first priority for Child Trauma Stress Network grant funding included in the bill to established grant recipients  like LSU  who provide assistance to Katrina  and Rita affected children   The full bill must now be passed by the Senate and reconciled with a similar House bill before being sent to the President for his signature   This amendment will finally set SAMHSA s priorities straight  where they should be    making sure that the children faced with the most severe trauma get the mental health support they need   Sen  Landrieu said  The funding cut had been the subject of recent editorials by the New Orleans Times Picayune and the Lafayette  La   Daily Advertiser   The Times Picayune editorial  published today  appears below  EDITORIAL  Put suffering children first Times Picayune  Oct 18  2007 Hurricane Katrina has left a mark on children who lived through the emotional stress and trauma of the storm and its aftermath  and providing mental health services to those youngsters should be a priority for the U S  Department of Health and Human Services   But the agency rejected an application by a Louisiana State University program that evaluates and treats children in hard hit areas  despite a congressional directive to make mental health services in the Gulf Coast a financial priority   That s a dreadful decision  and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  which awards the grants  hasn t offered a good explanation for it   Initially  officials said that language making mental health a priority wasn t available to them because Congress failed to adopt the appropriations bill that contained that directive  Instead  Congress passed a continuing resolution that maintained 2006 financing levels through fiscal 2007   But that doesn t explain why the agency honored another priority that was in the appropriations bill    providing mental health services for children and families of deployed troops   Officials have dropped that argument  But now they say that the application submitted by the Louisiana Rural Trauma Services Center didn t score high enough to make the cut    even though the program has been held up by the federal government as a model   Sen  Mary Landrieu s office  which has obtained the scores  says the program was just three points away from the cutoff  If the Gulf Coast had been given a higher priority  as Congress wanted  that should have bumped it up   Sen  Landrieu plans to offer an amendment to the 2008 appropriations bill to get the  400 000 that the program is seeking  And Sen  David Vitter has written a letter to Mike Leavitt  secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  and the administrator of the mental health administration urging them to restore funding  That must happen  It s incomprehensible to cut this program now  when the need has never been greater  Dr  Howard Osofsky  chairman of the psychiatry department at LSU Health Sciences Center  says that children here are the most traumatized in the country  He s seen an increase in depression  post traumatic stress disorder  bullying and risky behavior since the storm   These young people need help  and this program  which helps identify those children who are hurting and get them the services they need  is not expendable
