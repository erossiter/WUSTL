Landrieu Meets with White House Budget Director as Hurricane Funding Faces Potential Second Veto         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 11 2007    Landrieu Meets with White House Budget Director as Hurricane Funding Faces Potential Second Veto     WASHINGTON    As press accounts suggest a potential second presidential veto of an emergency appropriations bill that includes significant hurricane recovery measures  U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on her meeting yesterday with White House budget director Rob Portman   Mr  Portman and I had a productive discussion of the immense challenges currently facing Louisiana and the Gulf Coast as we work to recover from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastating failure of the federal levee system   Sen  Landrieu said following the meeting in her Capitol Hill office   I specifically expressed to him the immense roadblocks to recovery created by the Administration s opposition to waiving the 10 percent local match that has been waived for numerous other communities   The resulting red tape alone  created by mismatched federal paperwork requirements  has tremendously slowed the pace of rebuilding   I urged him to reconsider the White House s position  as well as their insistence on borrowing  1 3 billion from one set of levee reconstruction projects to fund another   Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not smart leadership  and each of the failed federal levees should have their rebuilding fully funded   Finally  we also discussed the importance of other key recovery measures in the vetoed supplemental appropriations bill  including funds for crime prevention  historic preservation and small business  education and other economic assistance    Mr  Portman and I will continue this dialogue over the coming days and weeks   While no commitments were made today  I am hopeful that with a greater understanding for the challenges Louisiana and the Gulf Coast face  he will take another look at what this Administration can do to relieve those burdens instead of cementing them
