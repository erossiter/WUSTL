Landrieu Comments on Senate  Progress as Year Draws to End         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 07 2007    Landrieu Comments on Senate  Progress as Year Draws to End Landrieu votes against energy bill that overtaxes Louisiana industries   Farm Bill procedural vote postponed in Senate     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today made the following statement after voting against proceeding to the energy bill and after a procedural vote on the 2007 Farm Bill was postponed   I voted against proceeding to the energy bill this morning because Louisiana industries would be faced with draconian new taxes  and ultimately  that cost would be born by American consumers  The energy package does  however  contain some positive provisions  including reasonable fuel efficiency standards and the promotion of renewable fuels made from agricultural waste that will benefit our farmers  I remain committed to working with my colleagues to develop a compromise that achieves these goals without unfairly taxing our industries and consumers   I am encouraged that the Senate is working to overcome the partisan stall that threatened to kill the 2007 Farm Bill for the year  I will be very clear with my colleagues  this bill is absolutely critical to Louisiana farmers who have united behind the new legislation  We must work to get this bill done before Congress recesses for the holidays  or our farmers could end up empty handed      With only a week or two left during this congressional work period  it is also our constitutional duty to pass all of the appropriations bills before leaving Washington  As part of this process  Congress must give the troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan the funds they need for their mission  While it is clear we need a new strategy in Iraq  I cannot support cutting funds for the troops as a political tactic to forcing a hasty result
