Okla  Sen  Unclear on Facts While Blocking La  Hurricane Protection         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 13 2006    Okla  Sen  Unclear on Facts While Blocking La  Hurricane Protection Sen  Landrieu sends letter to Sen  Coburn  calls on Congress to fulfill promise to Terrebonne  Lafourche     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today sent a letter to U S  Senator Tom Coburn  R Okla   in which she questioned the Oklahoma senator s mistaken justification for blocking in the final hours of the 109th Congress a multi million dollar authorization for hurricane protection projects in Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes    Sen  Landrieu and other members of the Louisiana delegation had worked unsuccessfully though the early hours of December 9 to overcome Sen  Coburn s procedural  hold  on legislation  passed by the House  that would authorize substantial parts of the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project   When complete  the proposed series of levees  locks and other systems would serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina     I am extremely disappointed that you refused to lift your hold on H R  6428  the legislation that was pending passage in the Senate on Saturday morning   Sen  Landrieu wrote today    I was also puzzled by the reason your spokesman provided to the press for your continued objection   In yesterday s New Orleans Times Picayune  a spokesman for Sen  Coburn was quoted as saying the reason his boss blocked the vital bill was because the senator  believes Congress needs to do a better of job keeping the promises we ve already made to the region before we make new promises and new commitments   He  rejected this request because he did not believe supporters of this provision could substantiate their request or demonstrate how the funds would be used   In her letter today  Sen  Landrieu noted that Congress  in effect  already promised the Morganza project to Louisiana in the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2000   Totaling  841 1 million with 65 percent  or  546 3 million  intended to be funded by the federal government  the authorization included the requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31 of that year   The Corps eventually submitted its report more than a year late  causing the authorization to expire despite the Corps  favorable recommendation  Though repeated attempts have been made  Congress has been unable to deliver a new WRDA bill since  with the latest negotiations for a bill breaking down in recent weeks   I agree 100  that Congress must keep the promises already made to the region    which is just the point   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter    In 2000  Congress authorized the Morganza to the Gulf project and effectively made a promise to the people of the region that it would be built at a 65 35 cost share As a result of your objections  Congress is not  in fact   keeping the promises  it has made to the region    it is breaking them     The specific bill Sen  Coburn blocked had been passed shortly after midnight December 9 by the House of Representatives after having been introduced Friday by Congressmen Charlie Melancon  D La   and Richard Baker  R La   The Baker Melancon bill  H R  6428  would have authorized more than half of the project  including two reaches of levees  totaling 76 000 feet  tying into the already existing system from Larose to Golden Meadow  as well as a lock complex on the Houma Navigation Canal to protect against devastating storm surges  In addition  Houma would be protected from salt water intrusion in their drinking water  Sen  Landrieu  accompanied by staff members from the Environment and Public Works Committee and the office of Senator David Vitter  R La   made a final push to secure support for the Baker Melancon bill in a 4 30 a m  Saturday meeting with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   Despite phone calls from Sen  Landrieu and other colleagues  Sen  Coburn refused to release his  hold     a procedural tactic nearly impossible to overcome with mere minutes left in the Congressional session  Sen  Landrieu had earlier introduced S  4105  a Senate bill to fully fund the Morganza to the Gulf project  and had secured both the unanimous support of her Democratic colleagues as well as the endorsement of key Republican leadership   The key point here is that the Morganza to the Gulf flood control project is the only project in the WRDA bill that had already won authorization from Congress   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter   It was on this basis that members of the Louisiana House and Senate delegation felt justified moving forward with legislation to authorize this project at the end of the session when it became apparent that WRDA was not going to pass   I intend to work with our colleagues to push legislation through the 110th Congress that will reauthorize this project and allow the Army Corps of Engineers to finally move forward on it  I admire your tenacity to eliminate unnecessary  unwarranted  and unwise government spending   However  this project is does not fall in any of the above categories   A copy of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
