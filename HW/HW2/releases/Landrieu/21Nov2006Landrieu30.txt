Landrieu Urges FEMA to Keep Promise to New Iberia Elementary School         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  11 21 2006    Landrieu Urges FEMA to Keep Promise to New Iberia Elementary School Asks FEMA Director Paulison to support prior pledge to rebuild the school in a safe location     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to keep its promise to Iberia Parish s Peebles Elementary School  which FEMA pledged to fund rebuilding outside the flood zone after it was destroyed by Hurricane Rita  The agency told the Iberia Parish school system in May that it had approved  3 2 million for the school s relocation to a safer site  Based on FEMA s commitment  the school s new site has been purchased  and Peebles students continue to share space with Belle Place Middle School   Reversing course  John Connolly  a FEMA official recently assigned to the region  said this month that FEMA can no longer meet its commitment because the school does not qualify under his new interpretation of the agency s relocation funding rules  It can  however  rebuild in the same location within the flood plain  with half the promised funding   FEMA s pledge to fund part of Peebles  relocation was a model for cooperation between local leaders and the federal government in times of catastrophe    a symbol of how things can be done right when we look toward forward thinking solutions rather than short term patches   Sen  Landrieu said    In their reversal  FEMA has instead reduced the situation to yet another model of their own failed bureaucracy  and a short sighted symbol of promises broken  All the while  350 children are without a permanent place to go to school 14 months after Hurricane Rita  FEMA must keep its word to any school it pledged to help relocate to higher ground   Sen  Landrieu  who was appointed this month to the Senate Homeland Security Committee  which oversees FEMA  today sent a letter to FEMA Director David Paulison asking him to intervene   I am extremely concerned about FEMA s gross mishandling of the Peebles Elementary School in Iberia Parish as well as any other affected school systems   Sen  Landrieu wrote   Accordingly  I encourage you to take swift and decisive action on this matter so that further damage is averted and the innocent school children will have a safe  permanent place to get an education   Sen  Landrieu visited the devastated Peebles Elementary School site in August while on her  Hope and Recovery Tour  of South Louisiana  a trip commemorating the first anniversaries of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  Sen  Landrieu had worked to expedite FEMA s relocation approval process  A full copy of the letter sent to FEMA Director Paulison is available at
