As bin Laden Releases New Tape  President Blocks Bill Prioritizing Terror Leader s Capture         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 29 2007    As bin Laden Releases New Tape  President Blocks Bill Prioritizing Terror Leader s Capture  Pocket veto  also stalls increases to troop pay  veterans  health care     WASHINGTON    President George W  Bush yesterday  pocket vetoed  a bill that includes a provision by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   to make the primary mission of U S  counter terror operations the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri and other leaders of al Qaeda and the destruction of their terrorist network   The provision  passed unanimously in the Senate  was an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill which the President rejected without signing within the 10 day window required by the Constitution  The White House decision to reject the bill was followed by news today of a new audiotape of Osama bin Laden making continued terrorist threats towards western nations and U S  forces in Iraq   Our priority must be to hunt down the men responsible for the attacks of September 11th and many of the insurgent strikes on our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan   Sen  Landrieu said    The unanimous call by the Senate to recalibrate our sights on bin Laden and the al Qaeda hierarchy clearly pinpoints the need to focus our fight where it needs to be    less on policing a civil war and more on destroying those who continue to pose the greatest threat to the United States     Today s tape demonstrates that bin Laden remains on the run and in significant enough control of his network to incite violence against Americans   It is a mistake for the Administration to lose sight of this threat in the fog of a political fight with Congress   The Landrieu amendment to H R  1585  the Defense Authorization Bill  states that  it should be the policy of the United States Government that the foremost objective of United States counterterrorist operations is to protect United States persons and property from terrorist attacks by capturing or killing Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri and other leaders of al Qaeda and destroying the al Qaeda network   Also included in the Defense Authorization Bill vetoed by the President was an across the board pay increase for U S  service members and enhancements to veterans  medical care
