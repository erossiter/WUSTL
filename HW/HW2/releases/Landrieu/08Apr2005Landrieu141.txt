Sens  Baucus  Landrieu    Nelson to Treasury Don t Tax Potential Disaster Victims         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 08 2005    Sens  Baucus  Landrieu    Nelson to Treasury Don t Tax Potential Disaster Victims Sen  Lott Joins Fight to Reverse IRS Decision toTax Property Owners for Receiving Flood Mitigation Grants    WASHINGTON    After having received inadequate responses to previous inquiries  U S  Senators Max Baucus  D Mont    Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Bill Nelson  D Fla   today sent a formal request to Treasury Secretary John Snow seeking assurances that all families who have received federal disaster mitigation assistance will be protected from being taxed on the aid they received   The House of Representatives recently passed H R  1134  a bill that would make this aid non taxable  and Sen  Christopher Bond  R Mo   has introduced a Senate version  S  586  with the co sponsorship of both Louisiana senators    But neither H R  1134 nor S  586 requires this protection to be afforded families receiving aid before the law s enactment date  potentially leaving out thousands of flood vulnerable homeowners who received aid since the IRS first ruled in 2004 that the payments could be taxed     We are concerned about how the Treasury Department will treat  Federal Emergency Management Agency  mitigation payments received prior to the enactment of this legislation   Sens  Baucus  Landrieu and Nelson wrote   As a general matter  the absence of statutory language providing retroactive relief creates a negative inference that payments received prior to the date of enactment are included in income   On March 9  Sen  Landrieu introduced S  583  a bill that also provides this tax relief to affected families  but requires the IRS to do it retroactively and protect all families    not just those receiving payments in the future   I was pleased to work together with Senator Landrieu to get Louisianans the disaster mitigation assistance they need and deserve   Sen  Baucus said    It s important that those receiving assistance are not faced with unnecessary taxes     Ever since the Department of Treasury decided these grants were taxable  Senator Landrieu has worked tirelessly to provide tax relief to property owners who participate in this program  I ll continue to work together with Senator Landrieu and members of Congress to get Louisianans the assistance they need and to protect them from burdensome taxes   In their letter  Sens  Baucus  Landrieu and Nelson recognized that some supporters have suggested the IRS would act retroactively without direction from Congress   If the position of the Department of Treasury is to provide retroactive relief absent legislation  what specific authority is the Department of Treasury relying on to allow this action   they asked    Please indicate whether the legislation requires a modification to ensure that taxpayers who received FEMA mitigation payments prior to the date of enactment are not unfairly taxed on these payments   Sen  Landrieu also announced today that another member of the Finance Committee  Sen  Trent Lott  R Miss    will be a co sponsor of her retroactive bill  About 20 percent of Louisiana s coastal zone lies below sea level  including 80 percent of New Orleans  and 377 000 Louisiana property owners participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency s National Flood Insurance Program   The program provides flood mitigation assistance in the form of grants to local governments    grants which may then used by homeowners in risk areas to raise their homes above the base flood elevation  Sen  Landrieu has fought to ensure the non taxable status of these grants since last  having offered her measure for inclusion in the omnibus appropriations bill and more recently in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act   She has also sent letters to President Bush and Secretary Snow on the matter  and has urged quick passage of the relief with the April 15th tax deadline looming only a week away  These efforts were inspired in part by the plight of an Avondale couple who received federal assistance to protect their home from flooding   To qualify  the family was required to raise  20 000 on their own  which they did through refinancing their home   Jefferson Parish used National Flood Insurance Program grant funds to pay the remaining  45 000 to the contractor who performed the work   Neither the family or parish government knew at the time that the assistance would be classified as income by the IRS  and the resulting tax increase places a significant financial burden on the family    All the people in my state ask for is an opportunity to protect themselves  their homes  and their loved ones from these disasters   Sen  Landrieu said last month   But by making these payments taxable  the IRS has turned this valuable disaster preparedness and prevention program into a financial disaster for responsible property owners   A copy of today s letter to Secretary Snow is attached and available from Sen  Landrieu s web site at    Adobe Reader required
