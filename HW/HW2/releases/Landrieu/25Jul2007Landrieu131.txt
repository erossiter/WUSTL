Landrieu Pushes to Reform SBA Disaster Assistance Program         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  07 25 2007    Landrieu Pushes to Reform SBA Disaster Assistance Program Senate Small Business Committee holds hearing on Katrina Rita disaster response     WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate Small Business Committee  of which Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   is a member  today held an oversight hearing on the Small Business Administration s  SBA  Disaster Assistance Program  Sen  Landrieu pressed for quick passage of a disaster loan reform bill she and Small Business Committee Chairman John Kerry  D Mass   are sponsoring   The SBA did not have a handle on the catastrophic nature of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   said Sen  Landrieu  who chaired part of the hearing in Sen  Kerry s absence   The testimony today corroborates what has already been abundantly clear from the struggles of my constituents    that the agency was more concerned about impressing the press and Congress with the number of loans closed than about working with disaster victims to help them get back on their feet   Administrator Preston has committed to reform  and I will continue working with him and the committee to make sure the agency s response to the next disaster is quick  efficient and responsive to disaster victims  needs  As part of this necessary reform  Senator Kerry and I are working to pass our critical disaster loan bill that is being held up by the objections of just one Senator  Our bill will greatly improve the experience of both business owners and homeowners following a disaster  be it natural or manmade  and we must move it forward   Sens  Landrieu and Kerry s bill  S  163  will create an expedited disaster assistance loan program  strengthen agency coordination and increase loans from  1 5 to  2 million   Despite bipartisan support and the backing of the Bush Administration  the bill has been blocked from Senate passage by one objecting Senator  The legislation also creates a new  elevated level of disaster declaration that triggers nationwide economic injury disaster loans for adversely affected small businesses   The hearing included testimony from SBA Inspector General Eric Thorson and former SBA loan officer Gale Martin about the Buffalo  N Y   Customer Service center that cancelled approximately 8 000 loans after applicants were not reached within 24 hours  Thorson said that  in many cases  SBA only made one attempt to reach the borrower before canceling the loan   Martin testified that SBA staff were pressured to cancel  decline and withdraw loan applications in September 2006 or face losing their jobs  If these borrowers were later reached  they were forced to resubmit all required paperwork and still were not able to get their loans reinstated   Thorson and Martin testified on the first panel along with William Shear  director of Financial Markets and Community Investment Issues at the Government Accountability Office  SBA Administrator Steven Preston testified on the second panel   I m gravely concerned both by the allegations made by Ms  Martin and her colleagues and by Mr  Thorson s findings   Sen  Kerry said   We need to ensure that no victim falls through the cracks  that no one who was relying on the government for a loan to rebuild a business or a home was left wondering why the government let them down  That includes victims of Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma still to this day  victims of fire and floods in my own state of Massachusetts  and victims of future disasters  I believe that Administrator Preston has made big strides to right the sinking ship of the SBA s disaster program  but we can always do better  and we must take action to put the tools in place that will prevent another Katrina like response to a disaster
