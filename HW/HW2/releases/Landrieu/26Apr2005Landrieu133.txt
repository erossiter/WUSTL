U S  Senators and Reps Introduce Bipartisan Breast Cancer Treatment Bill         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 26 2005    U S  Senators and Reps Introduce Bipartisan Breast Cancer Treatment Bill Lifetime Network Instrumental in Raising Awareness and Building Support      Washington  D C      U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  and Mary L  Landrieu  D LA  and U S  Representatives Sue Kelly  R NY  and Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today introduced legislation to ensure that all breast cancer patients receive appropriate medical treatment   The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005 would improve access to second opinions  lumpectomy  radiation therapy  and inpatient care so that women are not forced to undergo medically unnecessary mastectomies or settle for insufficient treatment   More than 10 million Lifetime viewers have voiced their support for this legislation by signing a petition at lifetimetv com as part of the network s Stop Breast Cancer for Life advocacy campaign   At some point in their lives  nearly every American will have a family member or friend who battles breast cancer   said Snowe    Our bipartisan legislation  introduced in the Senate and the House  empowers women and their doctors to make treatment decisions based on need  not short term cost   The stress of a cancer diagnosis is debilitating   But to compound that stress  to leave a woman with the knowledge that she must undergo a disfiguring procedure due only to her financial position  is unconscionable    It is time for lawmakers to take a stand to ensure that women who suffer from breast cancer receive the care they need to survive   said Landrieu    Buoyed by the committed efforts of Lifetime TV  patients  advocates and concerned individuals from around the country  Senator Snowe and I are working diligently in the Senate to build upon past bipartisan support and pass this legislation   It will go a long way toward protecting the rights of breast cancer patients in their most vulnerable times                We need to do everything possible to make life easier for a woman as she copes with the fear and reality of breast cancer   said Kelly   This bill will help put some necessary treatment and coverage requirements in place to ensure women are not forced to fight breast cancer and red tape at the same time  We have joined together in a very important and cohesive effort to help relieve some anxiety for breast cancer patients during their time of greatest need                I first supported this legislation after a breast cancer surgeon in Connecticut came to me  concerned that women are forced to go home from the hospital before they are physically or emotionally ready   said DeLauro    This bipartisan  common sense legislation would put medical decisions back where they belong   between patients and their doctors   It has been propelled in the 109th Congress by the bipartisan  bicameral support of my colleagues and the grassroots momentum generated by Lifetime TV   Today a woman in the United States has a 1 in 7 chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime   Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women in America and just this year  over 216 000 women will receive a life altering diagnosis of invasive breast cancer   Yet current standards of health care coverage have created a situation in which thousands of women have undergone mastectomies needlessly  and women have even undergone such critical surgery as an outpatient    the  drive through mastectomy     to be sent home without critical support for their recovery  The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005 addresses these problems through creation of a set of crucial measures to ensure appropriate treatment   The legislation assures that reasonable inpatient care will be provided when a woman undergoes invasive treatment for breast cancer  This bill further removes the coverage inequities which cause many women to undergo surgery that might not be the most appropriate for them  The bill s protections for those facing breast cancer include  A second opinion   This legislation assures a patient of a second opinion for any cancer diagnosis   A cancer diagnosis must be reliable  Inpatient coverage    The legislation provides that a health care provider cannot limit hospital stays for mastectomy or breast conserving surgery to less than 48 hours  and also assures a 24 hour stay for lymph node dissection   While some patients may choose a shorter stay  this choice should be one in which doctor and patient concur   No woman should be forced to undergo invasive treatment on an outpatient basis  Support for lumpectomy treatment   This bill requires coverage for radiation therapy for patients undergoing lumpectomy   Together with the assurance of inpatient care  this Act removes the economic incentive for a woman to select mastectomy simply to reduce the immediate cost of treatment    This bill will not only provide a higher standard of care  but will achieve long term cost savings as well   Lumpectomy followed by radiation is the preferable treatment for most women with early stage breast cancer   but many women have undergone mastectomy because a lack of coverage    yet the costs of breast reconstruction are often not considered   In fact  the finding that breast implants often entail additional surgeries and may pose health additional risks demonstrates one reason why long term costs are greater for mastectomy   Yet thousands continue to be subjected to unnecessary surgeries   This legislation will remedy this problem  and ensure women receive the most appropriate treatment to preserve their health
