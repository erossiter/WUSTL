Sen  Landrieu s statement on the establishment of an 8 29 Commission to investigate Katrina levee failures          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  08 09 2007    Sen  Landrieu s statement on the establishment of an 8 29 Commission to investigate Katrina levee failures       Since the early days following Hurricane Katrina  I have joined with Levees org in calling for a comprehensive  independent 8 29 commission to take a targeted look at the collapse of the levee system and examine the steps we must to take to prevent another storm from drowning us  That is why I introduced an amendment to Water Resources Development Act to create the necessary congressionally sanctioned investigative commission   There have been numerous studies about Katrina  without any clear direction of how to prevent a flood control system failure in the future  These studies have not adequately zeroed in on the crucial question of how our levees failed us  and the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force chaired by the Corps itself did not provide the completely independent examination that is required    An analysis similar to that by the 9 11 Commission is the only route to uncovering how 1 071 lives were lost and 786 372 people were displaced when the federal government s levee system failed to protect us  While my WRDA amendment was met by partisan objection  I will continue to push for a thorough and independent analysis of the events leading up to August 29  2005
