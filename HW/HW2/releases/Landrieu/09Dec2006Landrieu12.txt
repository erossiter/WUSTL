U S  Senate Passes Domenici Landrieu  Fair Share Plan in Early Morning 79 to 9 Vote         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 09 2006    U S  Senate Passes Domenici Landrieu  Fair Share Plan in Early Morning 79 to 9 Vote President Truman s offer  accepted   sent to President in final vote of 109th Congress 37 5 percent of offshore revenues to go to Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states     WASHINGTON    In its last roll call vote of the 109th Congress  the United States Senate at 1 49 this morning passed by a 79 to 9 vote final legislation that includes the Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  S  3711   The bill opens substantial new areas to oil and natural gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and shares billions of dollars in revenues with Louisiana and other energy producing Gulf Coast states for coastal wetlands restoration  hurricane protection and flood control projects  An additional share will be used to build parks and preserve green spaces in all 50 states  The package also includes several key tax provisions  including a two year extension of the Gulf Opportunity  GO  Zone tax incentive that provides strong motivation to invest in the Gulf Coast  The measure will now go to President Bush for his signature  after the House overwhelmingly passed the bill with a 367 45 vote Friday afternoon   Today the Senate confirmed its strong support for Louisiana and the entire Gulf Coast by passing the Domenici Landrieu fair share bill  which after nearly 60 years  provides for Louisiana a significant share of oil and gas revenues produced off our shores   Sen  Landrieu said   In August  71 Senators agreed to the bill because they recognized that a dedicated stream of revenue is necessary for Louisiana to protect itself from future storms  Katrina and Rita showed us what devastation can ensue if our communities remain vulnerable    The Louisiana congressional delegation and Governor Kathleen Blanco  Lt  Governor Mitch Landrieu and many local officials  business leaders and civic groups never stopped working to achieve this goal   Sen  Landrieu said after today s House vote  Numerous groups have been essential to this effort  including America s WETLAND Campaign to Save Coastal Louisiana  Parishes Against Coastal Erosion  Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana  Women of the Storm  Levees org  Coast Guardians as well as national groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers  the American Chemistry Council  the Consumer Alliance for Energy Security  the Agriculture Energy Alliance and countless others   Domenici Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act The fair share legislation passed by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate is identical  word for word  comma for comma  to the Domenici Landrieu bill the Senate passed by a 71 25 vote on August 1  and reflects President Truman s support    offered more than 50 years ago    for coastal states to receive a 37 5 percent share of the revenues they generate offshore  Coauthored by Sen  Landrieu and Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici  R N M   and endorsed by the White House in July  the plan opens 8 3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to new oil and natural gas production and shares 37 5 percent of the new revenues with Louisiana  Texas  Mississippi and Alabama   The funds are specifically dedicated to coastal wetlands restoration  hurricane protection  levee and flood control projects in the four energy producing states  An additional 12 5 percent is dedicated to the state side of the Land and Conservation Fund  which funds the acquisition of parks and green spaces across the country   The Domenici Landrieu fair share bill is essential for the recovery and long term economic vitality of South Louisiana from Venice to Cameron because it will help us defend against hurricanes while at the same time protecting one of America s most vital ecosystems   Sen  Landrieu said after Friday s House vote   It s also vital for the nation because it increases energy production along America s only Energy Coast and restores the wetlands that protect some of our nation s most critical energy infrastructure  It further serves the Louisiana economy by creating jobs and stimulating business activity  and does so in a fiscally responsible manner without raising the federal budget deficit   In the last decade  the price of natural gas has shot up  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that more than 3 million U S  jobs have been lost since 2000  The Domenici Landrieu plan allows for increased domestic energy production for the first time in 25 years  and geologists expect to find significant oil and natural gas reserves  The area is projected to produce enough natural gas to sustain more than 1 000 chemical plants for 40 years  and enough oil to keep 2 7 million cars running and 1 2 million homes heated for more than 15 years   The Domenici Landrieu bill is a significant step toward solving South Louisiana s coastal erosion and hurricane protection challenges  as Louisiana is projected to receive more than  13 billion over the next 30 years  Coupled with that  the state is expected to receive  12 billion for hurricane protection  wetlands restoration and navigation projects in the next 10 years from the regular budget process and other previous legislation  such as The Breaux Act  the Coastal Impact Assistance Program Sen  Landrieu championed last year  and Katrina  and Rita related supplemental appropriations bills which Sen  Landrieu helped to craft from her position on the Senate Appropriations Committee  Bonding programs will also allow the state to begin taking immediate action to restore and protect the coast by relying on future funds  Tax Extenders The legislative package the House passed along with the Domenici Landrieu plan would extend tax breaks benefiting Louisianians  Most important among these is the Gulf Opportunity  GO  Zone tax incentive  which the whole delegation has been pushing Congress to extend  The GO Zone incentive passed in 2005 has allowed hundreds of businesses to invest in areas impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and to take a 50 percent tax reduction for new facilities or equipment  jumpstarting recovery by giving businesses an incentive to quickly invest  Current law requires that businesses put new facilities or equipment in place by the end of 2008  but the package will extend the benefit until 2010    Many businesses need incentives  such as the GO Zone tax breaks  to encourage redevelopment in very difficult circumstances  which is essential to strengthening our economy and rebuilding our communities   Sen  Landrieu said after the House vote  The package also includes some extensions for expiring trade benefits to countries including Vietnam
