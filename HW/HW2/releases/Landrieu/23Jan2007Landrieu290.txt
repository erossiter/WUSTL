Sen  Landrieu Responds to the State of the Union Address         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  01 23 2007    Sen  Landrieu Responds to the State of the Union Address     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   released the following statement in response to the State of the Union Address delivered by the President tonight  Sen  Landrieu said   I will work with the President and Members of Congress from both parties to find common ground on an agenda that moves our country forward  opens doors of opportunity for all and effectively fights the war on terror   Many of the President s themes in tonight s speech are things that we can all agree on  Balancing the budget  empowering local communities to turn around failing schools  opening new options for small business health care and working toward energy independence  are all vital initiatives  But we need to move beyond the words and deliver decisive action   I support the President s call for sharing Iraqi oil revenues with the Iraqi people so that they may use the funds to rebuild their nation  But the President again fell short of setting specific mileposts for evaluating his troop surge plan s success and completion    With nearly 6 000 words about the nation s priorities  not one single word was devoted to the rebuilding and protection of affected areas of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast that were hit by the two most brutal hurricanes in American history  It was a glaring omission   Much of the vast devastation left by Katrina and Rita remains  and the job of recovery is far from finished   We need the President s leadership and partnership to meet these challenges  and we needed to hear his commitment tonight   Sen  Landrieu s reaction to the State of the Union is available   For a fact sheet comparing how the President has prioritized hurricane recovery in the last two State of the Union addresses  click   Adobe Acrobat required
