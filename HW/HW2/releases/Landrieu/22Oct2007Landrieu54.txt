A Letter from Senator Landrieu re  Internet Taxation         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  10 22 2007    A Letter from Senator Landrieu re  Internet Taxation     Dear Friends  In recent days  you may have received an email or read online claims suggesting that I support taxing Internet access and usage   This is simply not true  The current moratorium on Internet taxation    a measure I supported    is set to expire on November 1st  and the House of Representatives has passed a four year extension of it   I expect a similar measure will come to a vote in the Senate and allow us to keep the Internet free of access taxes well past next week s deadline  Partisan operatives in Washington  however  are hoping to prey on Americans  unfamiliarity with Senate procedure in an attempt to distort my record and my position  Last Thursday evening  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky asked the Senate to consider S  2128  a bill to make permanent the current Internet tax moratorium   Through a vibrant floor debate  I believe we can reach common ground on this issue and I do not object personally to the Senate considering this bill    At the time of Senator McConnell s request  I was on the Senate floor in a fight to save funding for an important children s mental health program in Louisiana   I am proud to say that fight was successful   But my holding the floor also meant I had a procedural duty to voice the objections to the Internet tax bill of a colleague not on the floor   The Congressional Record reflects that I objected on behalf of Senator Tom Carper of Delaware  Let me be clear  I do not object to this legislation coming to the floor for consideration   I have consistently supported extensions to the Internet tax ban  and will continue to do so   In fact  I believe a five  or ten year extension may be more appropriate than the four year plan passed by the House   But in a policy area so affected by rapidly changing technologies  Congress should review its Internet policies at least once a decade   A permanent ban does not ensure Congress makes an effort to keep in step with technological advancements    Today s Internet should not be taxed  and I will keep fighting to make sure it isn t   I will also continue my fight to dramatically reduce the estate tax and to provide much needed middle class tax relief   I will not allow petty partisan attacks and untruths to deter me from this effort   These distortions simply distract from the important work at hand  In congratulating Governor elect Bobby Jindal on his victory this weekend  I observed that we may campaign as Democrats and Republicans  but our highest responsibility is to serve as Louisianians   When we speak with one strong voice  we greatly enhance our chances for success in championing our state and her interests    With warmest regards to you and your families  I remain Sincerely  Mary L  Landrieu United States Senator
