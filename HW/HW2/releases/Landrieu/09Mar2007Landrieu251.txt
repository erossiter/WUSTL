Landrieu to Hold Hearing on FEMA s Faulty Decision Making on Housing Program         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 09 2007    Landrieu to Hold Hearing on FEMA s Faulty Decision Making on Housing Program Asks FEMA Director to hold up agency s questionable process pending oversight     WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   yesterday sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison to express disappointment with the agency s handling of the Alternative Housing Pilot Program  AHPP   which was funded in last year s fourth emergency supplemental appropriations bill   The AHPP was developed to encourage FEMA to provide more permanent and more innovative housing alternatives to trailers in the aftermath of future disasters  but the agency s methods of allocating the funds have been met by significant criticism  In her letter  Sen  Landrieu requested that FEMA hold off on granting rewards under the program until Congress can get clearer answers on the process and announcing that the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery  which Sen  Landrieu chairs  would hold a hearing on the decision making process   With lingering questions still unanswered  this selection and awards process must be reviewed and revisited by the Congress   Sen  Landrieu wrote    That is why I request that FEMA immediately take the following action  Hold the final AHPP disbursements until the Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery can thoroughly examine the process used by FEMA    The goal of the AHPP was to both provide immediate housing for victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and to allow FEMA to look beyond its existing model  which only allows for temporary housing projects   Instead  FEMA allocated  74 5 million for Louisiana and  281 3 million for Mississippi  despite the fact that the 2005 hurricanes destroyed more than 205 000 homes in Louisiana and 61 386 in Mississippi   Also  the largest funded project in Mississippi is to build more trailers rather than the sort of innovative alternative housing solutions intended by Congress    In both the selection and funding allocation processes for this program   FEMA  has not only wasted a superb opportunity to do right by the residents of the Gulf Coast  but also to fully test out innovative new approaches for more permanent construction options following catastrophic events   Sen  Landrieu wrote  Sen  Landrieu  along with the entire Louisiana Congressional delegation  wrote a letter to Paulison on January 5  2007  to raise concerns with FEMA s process   In response  the agency briefed Landrieu staff and Homeland Security Committee staff on January 17   FEMA then delayed until February 28 their response to information requests made at that meeting   I also understand that my staff met with FEMA officials to relay these multiple concerns on January 17  2007  but that FEMA only responded with the information requested by staff in that meeting on February 28  2007   Sen  Landrieu continued    Given that this vital information was only recently provided  I would be concerned if FEMA proceeded with disbursing the program funds before my staff  and other Congressional aides  have had a chance to thoroughly review these materials   The full text of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
