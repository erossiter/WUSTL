Landrieu Chairs Hearing on Disaster Host Communities         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 03 2007    Landrieu Chairs Hearing on Disaster Host Communities     WASHINGTON    United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee Chairman Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today held a hearing on the role of host communities that take in evacuees of major disasters and catastrophes   I have convened this Subcommittee to underscore one of the most significant challenges during and after any disaster    the role and needs of communities that take in disaster evacuees   Sen  Landrieu said    In the aftermath of the 2005 storms  citizens of the Gulf Coast were shipped all over the country   More than 200 000 found immediate refuge here in Baton Rouge  and evacuees nearly doubled Baton Rouge s population to 700 000 in the last two years   More than 304 000 people were evacuated to Houston  Texas and more than 80 000 to Jackson  Mississippi   Many communities took in storm victims during and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005  but the Federal Government was unprepared to aid those communities as they spent resources on feeding  clothing and housing evacuees   Section 403 of the Stafford Act  which authorizes most of the Federal Government s disaster assistance programs  offers aid to regions and residents in a designated Presidential declared disaster area   Sen  Landrieu said    Individuals and households who flee the disaster area remain eligible for assistance  but the communities that take in evacuees are left without resources to provide for those evacuees   The Stafford Act does not appropriately account for their critical role or their burgeoning needs   The Stafford Act restricts much of the disaster response and recovery funding to areas affected by the disaster  but does not provide sufficient resources for communities that take in disaster evacuees   My experience is that the Stafford Act is too restrictive in limiting funding to areas that have suffered physical damage   said Melvin L   Kip  Holden  Mayor of Baton Rouge  La    Our city was significantly affected by a tremendous population shift  with our service providers strained to serve human needs  Yet we are faced with fighting for funds because we have for the most part recovered from the physical damage but still face serious problems caused by the aftermath   Housing disaster evacuees for extended periods of time often has economic implications for host communities   The population influx affects housing and transportation needs  and it often places undue burdens on host community resources   Many expenses to a host community are not eligible for reimbursement  such as regular salaries and wages of public service employees   said Robert A  Eckles  former Harris County  Texas Judge    Had we contracted with private companies for security  health care and social services these expenses would have been eligible for reimbursement  But the private sector cannot provide many of these services as they do not have police powers or the capacity to respond to a large scale disaster  Federal law should be changed to fully and rapidly compensate host communities in a disaster of a national or regional scale   Sen  Landrieu focused today s hearing on developing innovative strategies for assisting communities that host evacuees in the event of a future catastrophe   I am committed to increasing awareness of the impact of catastrophes on the host communities that generously step forward to help evacuees in need  and to ensuring that the federal government recognizes their sacrifice and partners with them to help re settle evacuees and adapt to changes in their community infrastructure and population   Sen  Landrieu said  Testifying before the Subcommittee were Baton Rouge Mayor Melvin  Kip  Holden  Lake Charles  La  Mayor Randy Roach  Hammond  La  Mayor Mayson Foster  Madison  Miss Mayor Mary Hawkins Butler  Iberia Parish Sheriff Sid Hebert  Harris County  Texas County Judge Robert Eckles  Louisiana Family Recovery Corps Chief Executive Officer Raymond Jetson  Louisiana Recovery Authority Health Care Committee Chair Kim Boyle and Cajundome Commissioner Greg Davis
