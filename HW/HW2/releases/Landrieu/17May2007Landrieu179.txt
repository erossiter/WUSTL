Landrieu on Faulty NOLA Water Pumps  No Fraud Found  But Work Remains Before Communities Safe         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 17 2007    Landrieu on Faulty NOLA Water Pumps  No Fraud Found  But Work Remains Before Communities Safe GAO investigation reveals that Corps rushed process  lacked comprehensive testing plan when it installed pumps     WASHINGTON    The Government Accountability Office  GAO  today briefed United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   on a report she requested on faulty pumps that the Army Corps of Engineers installed in New Orleans drainage canals last year  The GAO  which will deliver its final report next week  found that the Corps was hasty in installing the pumps in advance of the 2006 hurricane season  This action was taken despite warnings of factory tested problems with the pumps and the lack of a comprehensive test plan for the pumps  The GAO also told Sen  Landrieu that they did not find any existence of fraud or impropriety in how the Corps chose MWI  a politically connected company  to be the pumps installation contractor    The biggest mistake the Corps made was that it was not honest with the public about the quality of the pumping system in the New Orleans region for last year s hurricane season   Sen  Landrieu said   It lacked any kind of comprehensive test plan for pumps the city relies upon for draining flood water out of the city and basically made its specifications and test procedures up as it went along   The Corps had no assurance that the pumps would operate  and more troubling  they did not make public the compromises made  Thankfully  the 2006 hurricane season did not put these pumps to the test   The good news  the GAO told me  is that the Corps appears on track to reach its pumping capacity in the next week  in advance of the 2007 hurricane season that begins June 1  Also  the pump testing has shown that the repaired pumps have had a minimal failure rate  They will not be at the capacity we need  but this is an encouraging step forward   By June 1  the GAO told Sen  Landrieu  the Corps plans to have completed reinstallation of 40 pump systems that have each been tested for 45 minutes to two hours  By mid August  the Corps will expand temporary pumping capacity at the 17th Street and London Avenue canals with an additional 19 pumps   The agency also informed Sen  Landrieu that due to weaknesses in some canal walls  the city s pumping system will pump about 69 percent of maximum capacity   The pumping system in our city is a work in progress   said Sen  Landrieu  chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery subcommittee   While we are at a much better place than we were last year  I still do not have full confidence that we can keep flood waters out of our community  My committee will continue working with the Corps to ensure the pumping system is capable of handling a Category 5 storm  And we will continue to keep the Corps honest  holding its leaders accountable for their decisions  and making sure the public is fully informed regarding the safety of their communities
