Sens  Landrieu  Brownback Reintroduce Bill to Ban Human Cloning         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 17 2005    Sens  Landrieu  Brownback Reintroduce Bill to Ban Human Cloning     WASHINGTON    U S  Sens  Mary Landrieu  D La   and Sam Brownback  R Kan   today announced the reintroduction of the Brownback Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act  which would ban all human cloning   The bill had been previously introduced in the 108th Congress as S  245 and referred to the Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions in January 2003   Human Cloning is like an unmarked and unchecked interstate system  with scientists racing as fast as they can under no restrictions whatsoever   Sen  Landrieu said    It is up to Congress to impose speed limits before we have any casualties   Sen  Landrieu also said the bill has received a broad coalition of support  from Republicans and Democrats alike    Our reasons may vary slightly   she said   but our conclusion is the same  creating human life simply for the purpose of destroying it through experimentation is immoral  unethical and should be illegal   Since the breakthrough involving Dolly the sheep  the Congress has grappled with the many ethical questions posed by the practices of science in its pursuit of greater power over human disease and death   Through this debate  Senator Landrieu has sought to understand all aspects of these issues at their most basic levels so that she may strike the appropriate balance between medical progress and human dignity  As such  while Sen  Landrieu feels a ban on human cloning is the only way to preserve the dignity of the human body  she continues her strong support for adult and embryonic stem cell research   The bill will now be referred again to the Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions   I am increasingly confident we ll be able to pass this measure   Sen  Landrieu said    As technology continues to advance and we continue to discuss the issue as a nation  the likelihood of passage only increases   We need only to turn on the evening news to see that cloning is a very real and present concern
