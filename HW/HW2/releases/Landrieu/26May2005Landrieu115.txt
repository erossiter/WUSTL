Energy Bill Passes Committee Louisiana Gets Coastal Funding         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 26 2005    Energy Bill Passes Committee Louisiana Gets Coastal Funding  500 million in coastal assistance  offshore energy assessment both included in bill     WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources passed today an energy bill that allows for hundreds of millions of dollars in coastal impact assistance of Louisiana s coast   The bill also includes an amendment sponsored by Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   a member of the committee  which allows for an assessment of our natural energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS    The American people have a right to know how rich they are and how much more energy independence they could be   said Sen  Landrieu    With young men and women sacrificing their lives everyday in Iraq  it would be unconscionable for us to not look into our own domestic energy supply to reduce our growing dependence on Mid East oil    The energy bill authorizes  500 million annually for the next five years to the five coastal energy producing states without drilling moratoria off their coasts  the largest ever such authorization   The distribution to these states    Alaska  Texas  Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama    would be based on the level of the state s energy production   Currently Louisiana s share of production is 80 percent   A similar provision at  50 million a year was also included in the version of the energy bill that was passed by the House last month    For years  inland states that produce oil and gas on federal lands have received their fair share of royalties   Coastal states have not   said Sen  Landrieu    The entire Louisiana delegation has worked to convince the Administration and our colleagues that this is unfair and unsustainable   Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  Sen  Pete Domenici  R NM  echoed Sen  Landrieu s remarks  saying   I m happy to secure what we did in the bill   I look forward to working with Sen  Landrieu as the bill goes to the floor and to conference to continue our efforts to do more for energy producing states   I think she has an excellent idea   I think she s right on this issue and I am committed to helping our producing  coastal states keep more of the revenues they help generate   The amendment sponsored by Sen  Landrieu directs the Secretary of the Interior to assess what energy resources exist on the 1 67 billion acre Outer Continental Shelf  which is the next frontier for America   Today only 43 million acres of the OCS is being explored  which is less than 2 6 percent of the total OCS  The energy bill must now be debated and passed on the Senate floor  where Sen  Landrieu  along with other coastal Senators  will fight to include and improve the revenue sharing provisions that have been previously discussed   Last month  Sen  Landrieu introduced the Stewardship for our Coasts and Opportunities for Reliable Energy Act  SCORE  which calls for coastal producing states without moratoria off their coasts to share 50 percent of the OCS revenues from production within each state s boundaries   This energy bill is an important win for Louisiana and for the nation as a whole   said Sen  Landrieu    Securing this inventory and coastal funding was a significant hurdle  and through years of hard work and perseverance  we are changing minds and building new alliances to make this a reality   There is still work to be done and challenges ahead  particularly in convincing the Administration that OCS revenue sharing is something that is fair and affordable   We will continue this battle on the floor
