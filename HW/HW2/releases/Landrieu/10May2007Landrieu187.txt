Landrieu Grills Sec  of State on Rejected Hurricane Aid          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 10 2007    Landrieu Grills Sec  of State on Rejected Hurricane Aid      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today questioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice regarding the U S  State Department rejection of nearly  1 billion in foreign aid offered following to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the devastating failure of the federal levee system   On April 29  the Washington Post reported that the United States turned down  854 million in offers of foreign assistance from 151 countries  and only  126 4 was accepted    The people that I represent were not able to take advantage of this aid because there were obviously serious problems   Sen  Landrieu said  One example Sen  Landrieu cited was an offer on Sept  5  2005  of medical and relief supplies from Switzerland  FEMA did not vet the offer until Sept  14  2005  With the delay  the Swiss had to cancel the entire shipment  In another example  a German company offered a  3 million integrated satellite and cellular telephone system  capable of handling 5 000 calls at once  The State Department did not act to implement the system until the military assets an the ground demanded it  In response to testimony that in Secretary Rice s view  much of the offered aid was unusable  Senator Landrieu reminded her that the United States not only turned down food and diapers  but  generators and communications supplies and medical supplies   all of which could desperately have been used by storm victims    Sen  Landrieu also read from an email exchange between top level State Department employees about a destroyed shipment of medical supplies from Italy  One email stated   I think  that we need to come clean with the Italians  tell them we blew it  deeply appreciate and regret handling of this  and let them know about disposal  The flip side is just to dispose of it and not come clean  I m willing to be persuaded    Sen  Landrieu submitted for the record hundreds of similar examples of rejected aid  including search and rescue personnel  communications equipment and water pumps   Secretary Rice  who was testifying on the State Department budget before the Senate Appropriations State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee  of which Sen  Landrieu is a member  said that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were an  unprecedented event   which was why the aid was turned away and not distributed to hurricane victims in need  Secretary Rice testified about the budget for the U S  Agency for International Development  USAID   the State Department s vehicle for distributing international aid to other nations when they experience disasters  However  she did not address why this infrastructure and the United States  long experience in distributing international aid could not be directed to help in a domestic crisis   It was unprecedented for the United States to receive offers of help at that level   Secretary Rice said   In the Administration s own February 2006 report   The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina  Lessons Learned   nine recommendations were made on how to improve the management of foreign assistance offers  Sen  Landrieu pressed Secretary Rice on when the State Department would implement these recommendations  but Secretary Rice would not commit to a specific date   I will send you a letter   she said  The White House report had originally set a June 31  2006  deadline for implementation   It is important that we get to the bottom of the botched State Department response to foreign aid offers following the devastating 2005 storms that wreaked the Gulf Coast   said Sen  Landrieu  chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Disaster Recovery Subcommittee  later today    I will be working with my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee to get more answers and ensure that when the next disaster strikes  be it natural or manmade  we can creatively and effectively distribute much needed aid and avoid another embarrassing  needless breakdown of response and initiative   Audio from Sen  Landrieu s exchange with Secretary Rice is available here    A transcript of the exchange is available
