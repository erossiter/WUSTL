Energy Chairman Praises Sen  Landrieu on SCORE Act          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  05 13 2005    Energy Chairman Praises Sen  Landrieu on SCORE Act  Anticipates Incorporating Some Ideas in Energy Bill    WASHINGTON    U S  Senate Energy   Natural Resources Chairman Pete V  Domenici  R N M   today released the following statement regarding Sen  Mary L  Landrieu s  D La   Stewardship for our Coasts and Opportunities for Reliable Energy Act   SCORE   Chairman Domenici said    I appreciate Senator Landrieu s hard work and outstanding service on the Energy Committee  She has been a passionate voice for her state and a strong advocate for a common sense approach to our nation s energy needs  Senator Landrieu recognizes the vital interest coastal states have in offshore energy production and she has introduced legislation that seeks to address those concerns while increasing domestic energy supply  I look forward to an extensive discussion of her bill in committee and hope we can incorporate some of her ideas in the energy bill   The SCORE Act  S  1026  would automatically reserve 50 percent of offshore oil   gas revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  and distribute it to the five coastal energy producing states without production moratoria off their coasts   The distribution to these states    Alaska  Texas  Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama    would be based on each state s energy production  with 35 percent of each state s allocation directed to coastal political subdivisions   From fiscal year 2006 to 2010  OCS revenues would be authorized by Congress to be appropriated to these states   Then  beginning in FY 2011  OCS revenues would be automatically distributed each year and not be subject to the traditional appropriations process   Returning a portion of OCS revenues to Louisiana and other coastal producing states is a crucial first step to restoring and preserving our vital wetlands and the billions of dollars in energy investments they protect   Sen  Landrieu said when announcing the bill earlier this month   It was formally introduced in the Senate yesterday  The legislation would also direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish seaward lateral boundaries for all coastal states to explore the possibility of offshore energy development  and would allow states with moratoria in place off their coasts to petition the Secretary for a resource assessment of energy sources within their boundaries   With these assessments in hand  state legislatures could then request that any or all of the area within their boundaries be made available for energy leasing    Finally  SCORE would provide the opportunity for innovative  alternative uses of the OCS    including renewable energy projects such as wind  wave and solar     A portion of revenues from this production would be shared with the state off whose coastline the production took place
