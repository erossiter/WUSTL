Landrieu Comments on New Osama bin Laden Tape         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 07 2007    Landrieu Comments on New Osama bin Laden Tape Continues to urge fresh focus on terror leader s death or capture     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today commented on reports that as Sahab  the media propaganda arm of the al Qaeda terrorist network  has released new video purportedly of Osama bin Laden   If authentic  the tape would represent the first visual confirmation in three years that the terror leader is still alive   As the anniversary of September 11th draws near  it again appears that the man responsible for the horrific attacks of that day remains alive and well  on the run in the blind spot of a distracted White House   Sen  Landrieu said    With recent intelligence estimates indicating that al Qaeda s strength has returned to levels not seen since 2001  and with the vast majority of our military might policing a civil war in Iraq  it is clear that our nation s priorities are misdirected   Sen  Landrieu in July offered legislation  blocked by Senate Republicans  to refocus the U S  mission in the Middle East on hunting down bin Laden and dismantling the al Qaeda organization   Her proposal states that  it shall be the policy of the United States Government that the foremost objective of the United States in the Global War on Terror and in protecting the United States Homeland is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden  Ayman al Zawahiri  and other members of al Qaeda and to destroy the al Qaeda network   The Landrieu plan would appropriate additional funding for the CIA to reestablish its bin Laden task force  known as Alec Station  The al Qaeda hunting group was disbanded by President Bush after the administration determined that bin Laden no longer posed a threat to the United States   As the U S  draws down combat forces in Iraq  the Landrieu proposal would also increase military  security and anti drug resources dedicated to dismantling al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan   I will not give up my fight to refocus our nation s attention on breaking the back of al Qaeda and bringing its leaders to their just fate   Sen  Landrieu said    We need to hunt down bin Laden where he s hiding  and he s clearly not in the streets of downtown Baghdad   I urge my colleagues to drop the partisan political objections and put the necessary priorities of the War on Terror in the proper perspective
