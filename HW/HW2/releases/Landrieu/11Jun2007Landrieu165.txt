Landrieu and Nelson Seek Quick Hearing on Aging Hurricane Tracking Satellite         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  06 11 2007    Landrieu and Nelson Seek Quick Hearing on Aging Hurricane Tracking Satellite     WASHINGTON    U S  Sens  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and Bill Nelson  D Fla   last week sent a letter to the Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee asking for a hearing on replacing an aging satellite  QuikSCAT  which is key to tracking hurricanes and tropical storms   As Senators from hurricane prone states  we are very concerned about the potential harm that could occur if the QuickSCAT satellite fails in the near future   the Senators wrote   Simply put  reduced hurricane forecasting ability will put lives at risk   In light of that danger  we urge you to schedule a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the role of weather satellites in hurricane forecasting as soon as possible   Sens  Landrieu and Nelson along with Mel Martinez  R Fla   and John Kerry  D Mass   last month introduced legislation to replace the satellite  which is five years past its three year lifespan  The Improved Hurricane Tracking and Forecasting Act of 2007  S 1509  authorizes  375 million to the National Oceanic   Atmospheric Administration for the design and launch of an improved QuikSCAT satellite  which forecasts hurricanes  coastal winds  storm surges  and other weather related disasters  such as  El Ni  o   Rep  Charlie Melancon  D La   and Rep  Ron Klein  D Fla   introduced companion legislation in the House   This bipartisan legislation would provide NASA and NOAA with the authority to develop a replacement for the failing QuikSCAT satellite   Sens  Landrieu and Nelson wrote   Due to the urgency of the situation  we are currently reviewing appropriate legislative vehicles to further debate and expedite Senate consideration of replacing QuickSCAT      The new  next generation satellite would maintain weather forecasting and warning capabilities and improve data capabilities for future weather related disasters   The bill also requires that the NOAA provide annual reports on the status of the satellite    NASA launched the current QuikSCAT satellite in 1999  and it was expected to remain in service until 2002  It was built in just 12 months because a previous satellite was lost in 1997  An instrument on the satellite sends pulses of microwave energy through the atmosphere and measures the energy that bounces back from the wind roughened ocean surface   The energy of the microwave pulses changes depending on wind speed and direction  allowing scientists to monitor wind around the world     Bill Proenza  Director of the National Hurricane Center  has said that without QuikSCAT  hurricane forecasting would be 16 percent less accurate 72 hours before hurricane s landfall and 10 percent less accurate 48 hours before hurricane s landfall    Sen  Nelson is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Space  Aeronautics  and Related Agencies  and Sen  Kerry also sits on the Commerce Committee  The House bill  H R 2531  was referred to the Science and Technology Committee  on which Rep  Melancon sits  A full copy of the letter is available
