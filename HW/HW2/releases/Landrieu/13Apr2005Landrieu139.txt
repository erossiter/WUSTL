Senate Passes Tax Relief for Potential Disaster Victims         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 13 2005    Senate Passes Tax Relief for Potential Disaster Victims Landrieu Sponsored Amendment Guarantees All Louisiana Homeowners Will Be Covered     WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate tonight passed a measure that will ensure that homeowners and businesspeople who have received disaster mitigation grants will not be taxed on them  regardless of when they were received   Senate bill S  586  originally passed by the House of Representatives as H R  1134  did not afford this protection to families receiving aid before the law s enactment date  but an amendment offered tonight by Sens  Max Baucus  D Mont    Chuck Grassley  R Iowa   and Mary L  Landrieu  D La   added retroactivity to the bill  ensuring that thousands of flood vulnerable homeowners who received aid in 2004 and other years will not be taxed on their grants   The Senate tonight chose to guarantee Louisiana homeowners what the House and IRS would not    that they will not be left out   Sen  Landrieu said    Our amendment provides retroactive relief to homeowners who received disaster mitigation grants in 2004 or any other year  and leaves no room for IRS misinterpretation   Sen  Grassley is the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee  which had jurisdiction over the bill  and Sen  Baucus is its Ranking Member  The bill and retroactivity amendment passed with the Senate s unanimous consent and the bipartisan support of several other co sponsors   It will now be referred back to the House for their immediate action   I appreciate Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus  efforts to forge this bipartisan solution  and urge the House to pass this bill as soon as possible   Sen  Landrieu said    I am glad we will now be able to give homeowners the confidence and peace of mind they deserve as tax day nears   About 20 percent of Louisiana s coastal zone lies below sea level  including 80 percent of New Orleans  and 377 000 Louisiana property owners participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency s National Flood Insurance Program   The program provides flood mitigation assistance in the form of grants to local governments    grants which may then used to protect at risk homes   The IRS ruled in June 2004 that these grants were legally taxable  even though they are usually paid directly to the contractor performing the mitigation work  and not the homeowners themselves  Sen  Landrieu has fought to ensure the non taxable status of these grants since last year  having offered her measure for inclusion in the omnibus appropriations bill and more recently in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act   On March 9  she introduced S  583  a standalone bill that would also have provided this relief retroactively   She later co sponsored S  586  introduced by Sens  Christopher Bond  R Mo   and David Vitter  R La    although she and others expressed reservations regarding its lack of retroactive protection   It s important that those receiving assistance are not faced with unnecessary taxes   Sen  Baucus said   Ever since the Department of Treasury decided these grants were taxable  Senator Landrieu has worked tirelessly to provide tax relief to property owners who participate in this program   With Sens  Baucus and Bill Nelson  D Fla    Sen  Landrieu also co wrote a letter last week to Treasury Secretary John Snow questioning whether the IRS could act retroactively without direction from Congress  as supporters of the un amended bills had suggested   We owe it to these homeowners to make sure we pass a bill that includes everyone   Sen  Landrieu said later   and not simply trust their financial security to a wink and nod promise from the IRS   Tonight she added   I am proud that as a direct result of our amendment  the IRS will finally be able to deliver on their promise   A copy of the amended bill is available from Sen  Landrieu s web site at
