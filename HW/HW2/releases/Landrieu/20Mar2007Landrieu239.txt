White House Formally Opposes Levee Spending  Fair Hurricane Recovery Funding Rules         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 20 2007    White House Formally Opposes Levee Spending  Fair Hurricane Recovery Funding Rules Promises veto of Supplemental Appropriations bill     WASHINGTON    President Bush intends to veto an emergency spending bill currently being considered by Congress and specifically opposes funding in it for Louisiana levee repairs and measures to extend fair hurricane recovery funding rules to the state  according to an official Statement of Administration Policy released late yesterday and available on the White House web site  http   tinyurl com 2ovv84    The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill drafted in the House of Representatives includes  1 3 billion to cover a shortfall for east and west bank levee projects in New Orleans and surrounding parishes  The projects were originally authorized in the 3rd supplemental in 2005 but have exceeded original cost estimates due to post hurricane labor and material shortages  It also includes a waiver of the 10 percent cost share required of Hurricane Katrina   Rita  and Wilma affected communities for disaster recovery projects  After Sen  Landrieu s FAIR Funding Amendment to the 9 11 Commission bill  which waived the 10 percent match  was blocked by Republicans from an up or down vote  she secured a commitment from the Senate leadership that the waiver would be included in the Senate version of the supplemental as well   President Bush made what sounded like substantive promises to Louisiana and the Gulf Coast when he spoke in Jackson Square after Hurricane Katrina   Sen  Landrieu said   Today  he s threatening to veto an emergency spending bill  which he asked for  if it includes provisions that would advance the recovery of the region and increase levee funding     We need to make sure that the levee and flood protection projects in the region are fully funded to protect our communities  Yet the president opposes funding needed for these levee projects   The scope of devastation from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is unlike any natural disaster in our history  Communities collapsed  and to date  many Louisianians have yet to be able to return home  The President could wipe away much of the red tape involved in the recovery effort by waiving the 10 percent match on public assistance with a stroke of his pen  Yet he has refused to waive it  and opposes Congress doing it legislatively    Despite the President s opposition  I will fight to ensure that these provisions remain in the Supplemental so that the region can recover and our communities can rebuild    Administration opposition to  1 3 billion   The Administration opposes the  1 3 billion in unrequested funding the bill provides to address increased costs for certain ongoing levee restoration projects that were provided in supplemental funding in P L  109 234   In the President s fiscal 2008 budget  he sought to shuffle  1 3 billion from one set of levee projects to another  simply moving the shortfall to other levee projects   Sen  Landrieu is seeking to fund the shortfall in the supplemental so that the Army Corps of Engineers can continue with its levee and flood control projects for both the West Bank and East Bank  without undermining one to fund the other  Administration opposition to 10 percent match waiver   The Administration opposes a waiver of the State match requirement   The Robert T  Stafford Act requires localities to match 10 percent of the cost for disaster recovery projects before the remaining 90 percent is filled by the federal government  With local tax bases devastated by the hurricanes and the provision s excessive paperwork requirements for each of the 23 000 public assistance projects in Louisiana alone  the match has become a significant obstacle to Gulf Coast recovery    President Bush has the authority to waive the onerous requirement without legislation when per capita rebuilding costs become excessive    a presidential authority that has been exercised 32 times since 1985  In 1992  President George H  W  Bush waived the requirement when the per capita recovery cost of Hurricane Andrew reached  139  It was also waived for New York City following the attacks of September 11th  where the per capita cost totaled  390  But despite a  6 700 per capita recovery cost following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the Administration has thus far refused repeated requests for such a waiver  prompting Sen  Landrieu s efforts to waive the requirement legislatively  Administration veto threat   Because of the excessive and extraneous non emergency spending it contains  if this legislation were presented to the President  he would veto the bill
