Landrieu Responds to Oklahoma Senator s Comments Regarding Hurricane Protection Project         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  12 15 2006    Landrieu Responds to Oklahoma Senator s Comments Regarding Hurricane Protection Project     WASHINGTON    The office of U S  Senator Mary L  Landrieu  D La   today issued a  Fact Check  analysis to clarify recent statements by U S  Senator Tom Coburn  R Okla   regarding his reasons for blocking a vital Louisiana hurricane protection project in the last hours of the 109th Congress  Sen  Landrieu and other members of the Louisiana delegation had worked unsuccessfully though the early hours of December 9 to overcome Sen  Coburn s procedural  hold  on legislation  including a bill passed by the House  that would authorize all or part of the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project   Both the Democratic and Republican Senate leadership supported such authorization  as the project had been already been fully authorized by Congress in 2000   That authorization lapsed following delays in the federal bureaucracy    Meanwhile  the people of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes in southeast Louisiana have waited nearly six years for the promise to be fulfilled by a new water bill that has yet to pass through Congress   When complete  the proposed series of levees  locks and other systems would serve to protect about 120 000 people and 1 700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricane Katrina    SEN  COBURN  A spokesman said   Coburn couldn t get a reliable cost estimate for the project    AP  as published at  on Dec  15  2006  THE FACTS  The Morganza to the Gulf project has been thoroughly vetted through all the same procedural channels as other fully funded Army Corps of Engineers projects nationwide  including any in Oklahoma   The Corps completed its favorable feasibility study and cost benefit analysis more than five years ago  and continues to update its cost estimates on a web site       The standards used for the Corps  estimates are consistent across the nation  and have been accepted as the  official  estimates used by Congress in evaluating projects  SEN  COBURN   A spokesman for Coburn says the reauthorization includes work that wasn t previously authorized    AP  as published at  on Dec  15  2006  THE FACTS  To be fair  the bill passed by the House  H R  6428  would add authorization for dredging the Houma Navigation Canal an additional five feet to a depth consistent with the new infrastructure added to it by the Morganza to the Gulf Project   But Sen  Coburn also informed Senate floor staff and other senators that he intended to block any legislation that would authorize the project   This includes S  4105  a bill introduced by Sen  Landrieu which had no other Senate objection   The Landrieu bill would have fully authorized the project elements approved by Congress in 2000  and did not include any additional components whatsoever                                                              In Tuesday s New Orleans Times Picayune  a spokesman for Sen  Coburn was quoted as saying the reason his boss blocked the vital bill was because the senator  believes Congress needs to do a better of job keeping the promises we ve already made to the region before we make new promises and new commitments   He  rejected this request because he did not believe supporters of this provision could substantiate their request or demonstrate how the funds would be used   Responding in a letter Wednesday  Sen  Landrieu noted that Congress  in effect  already promised the Morganza project to Louisiana in the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA  of 2000   Totaling  841 1 million with 65 percent  or  546 3 million  intended to be funded by the federal government  the authorization included the requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31 of that year    The Corps eventually submitted its report more than a year late  causing the authorization to expire despite the Corps  favorable recommendation  Though repeated attempts have been made  Congress has been unable to deliver a new WRDA bill since  with the latest negotiations for a bill breaking down in recent weeks   I agree 100  that Congress must keep the promises already made to the region    which is just the point   Sen  Landrieu wrote in her letter    In 2000  Congress authorized the Morganza to the Gulf project and effectively made a promise to the people of the region that it would be built at a 65 35 cost share As a result of your objections  Congress is not  in fact   keeping the promises  it has made to the region    it is breaking them     Accompanied by staff members from the Environment and Public Works Committee and the office of Senator David Vitter  R La   Sen  Landrieu made a final push to secure support for the project in a 4 30 a m  Saturday meeting with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   Despite phone calls from Sen  Landrieu and other colleagues  Sen  Coburn refused to release his  hold     a procedural tactic nearly impossible to overcome with mere minutes left in the Congressional session            A full copy of Sen  Landrieu s letter is available
