Landrieu  Vitter  Melancon Announce Levee Funding         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  04 11 06    Landrieu  Vitter  Melancon Announce Levee Funding  30 million for non Federal levees in Terrebonne Parish    WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Mary L  Landrieu  D La   and David Vitter  R La   and U S  Congressman Charlie Melancon  D Napoleonville  announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  30 million in funding for repairs for non federal levees in Terrebonne Parish   The funding is contingent upon the Administration making the same request     While I remain committed to getting Morganza to the Gulf fully authorized and appropriated  this provision is a step forward in providing the protection the citizens of Terrebonne Parish need and deserve   said Sen  Landrieu  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee    Our hard work and perseverance has brought us one step closer  and I will continue to fight until Morganza to the Gulf is fully protected from future hurricanes    Since coming to the U S  Senate  I have worked closely with local Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection experts like Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District Executive Director Jerome Zeringue  Board President Tony Alford and others to make this crucial project a reality  I am excited that my constant pushing and prodding of Chairmen Cochran and Domenici has paid off with the inclusion of this funding in the Senate Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  This is another important step towards full implementation of the Morganza project   I am hopeful that the full Senate will pass this legislation immediately after Easter   said Sen  Vitter    Unfortunately  this funding was not included in the House version of the emergency supplemental   I will continue to work closely with local leaders in prodding the leadership in Congress to include this funding in the final bill   It is critical that we keep this momentum alive and get this important funding this year    I commend the hard work of our Louisiana Senators and Chairman Cochran for the people of south Louisiana   said Rep  Melancon    I would also encourage the President to make the same request to protect Terrebonne Parish and surrounding areas   One of the biggest hurdles in rebuilding is getting this government to understand the problems we face  I will continue that effort in the House     30
