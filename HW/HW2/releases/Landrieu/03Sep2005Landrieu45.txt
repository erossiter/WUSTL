Senators Reid and Landrieu Call on President to Take Immediate Action to Support Katrina Victims         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  09 03 2005    Senators Reid and Landrieu Call on President to Take Immediate Action to Support Katrina Victims     WASHINGTON    Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   and Senator Mary Landrieu  D La   today called on President Bush to take a number of actions that the president is empowered to take to provide immediate relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina   Under current law  the Senators wrote  President Bush has the authority to make available a wide array of services and benefits to the disaster victims   The Senators called on Bush to immediately use such powers to provide relief to the victims in the Gulf region    The full text of the letter appears below    30   September 3  2005 The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  one of the worst natural disasters in our nation s history  it is critical that all Americans come together to address the emergency needs of millions of our fellow citizens   We want to thank you for your efforts since the hurricane hit  and to express our strong interest in working cooperatively with you in the days ahead on additional measures we believe are needed to address this crisis   At the same time  we are concerned about the serious problems and chaos that have marked the Federal government s initial response to date   We believe it is essential that you fully use the significant legal authority you possess under current law to better respond to the absolutely critical needs of victims who are undergoing unspeakable hardships  As you know  beyond the thousands who apparently have lost their lives  countless numbers of others have lost their homes and possessions  and now are suffering with nowhere to live  few  if any  resources  and nowhere to turn   These increasingly desperate people are struggling to find food and water and to ensure their survival   It is absolutely critical that the Federal government immediately do everything in its power to meet their needs and minimize unnecessary suffering as this crisis continues   We know that thousands of dedicated federal workers and many others are doing all they can to address this crisis  often in the face of enormous logistical problems that are an inevitable consequence of such a disaster   Yet we are concerned that rescue and recovery efforts appear to remain chaotic and that many victims remain hungry and without adequate shelter nearly a week after the hurricane struck   Clearly  strong personal leadership from you is essential if we are to get this effort on track   Fortunately  as you know  the Stafford Act gives you broad legal authority to address the needs of Katrina s victims   Under that law  for example  the Administration can provide cash benefits to individuals who have been stranded without financial resources   Yet we have heard reports that some victims who have contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been told that FEMA is not accepting applications for financial assistance   This is deeply troubling  and we urge you to address it immediately   Only the federal government can adequately address the basic needs of our fellow Americans suffering from this disaster and they deserve a better response from their government   Current law also gives the President broad authority to use Federal facilities in an emergency in order to provide housing and food for those in need   We urge you to use your existing authority to ensure that all victims have at least enough food to survive  and to immediately identify military bases and other federal facilities that can house these victims on a temporary basis   Current law also grants the President broad authority to provide transportation assistance in a disaster   Yet many of those displaced from New Orleans and other Gulf Coast regions have no ability to relocate to other areas where they may have family and friends available   Providing such transportation assistance also should be a priority   Finally  we urge you to join with us to ensure that our nation makes a strong and absolute commitment to rebuilding New Orleans   The City of New Orleans is a national treasure with a special atmosphere and a unique culture that could never be replaced   It is unthinkable that some in Washington have suggested that the city  in effect  be abandoned   We urge you to speak out in strong opposition to such defeatism and to make clear to all the people of New Orleans that we will never  ever abandon them or their remarkable city
