Sen  Landrieu Hosts Open Forum on Social Security         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  03 11 2005    Sen  Landrieu Hosts Open Forum on Social Security     BATON ROUGE    U S  Sen  Mary L  Landrieu  D La   hosted more than 200 constituents for  A Louisiana Conversation on Social Security  at the Old State Capitol building here today   The vibrant discussion gave Louisianians an opportunity to share their thoughts on Social Security reform and ask questions of a panel of experts representing multiple points of view   The free event was open to the public and took place within minutes of President Bush taking the stage before a ticketed audience in Shreveport to present his plan for privatizing Social Security  Sen  Landrieu was joined on stage by economist Dean Baker  Co Director of the Center for Economic Policy Research  Ken Grossinger of the AFL CIO  Craig Eichelman of AARP  and a former New Orleans Councilman  Republican Scott Shea  now of Generations Together  an advocacy group supporting the President s privatization plan   Louisiana Lt  Governor Mitch Landrieu  Rep  Charlie Melancon and State Treasurer John Kennedy also attended   Fear is a very effective motivator  but just because it is effective doesn t mean it s right   Sen  Landrieu said after the event  referring to the President s comments that the Social Security system is  in crisis  and  flat bust     She added   Today  panelists from both sides of the debate explained a lot of these big numbers we keep hearing tossed around  and a lot of people left with more clarity and understanding    Good decisions are based on facts and discussions like those we ve shared today  not on hype and fear  I hope the ongoing debate on Social Security will be one that casts more light than heat  as we ve shown to be possible here   In her opening remarks to the forum  Sen  Landrieu also said   The President has described Social Security as  bankrupt    But that is not what the Congressional Budget Office or the Board of Trustees for Social Security tell us   According to a non partisan group of CBO economic analysts  the system will remain solvent for 47 years into the future    when President Bush will be 106 years old   There is a problem on the distant horizon  however  and the beneficial part of the President s call for privatization is that it has riveted the nation s attention on Social Security at a time when incremental steps taken today could have significant payoffs in the future  In fact  there have been minor and major amendments to Social Security all along the way  including most recently an effort led by President Reagan and Senators Dole and Moynihan in 1983    This afternoon  we will discuss whether we should essentially continue down this tried and tested road of making incremental changes that strengthen Social Security  or whether we should take the more radical    and some would say risky    approach that the President has laid out
