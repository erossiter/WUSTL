SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON FAA DECISION TO START SPOT CHECKS OF AIRLINE SAFETY LOGS
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security released the following statement regarding the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) decision today to commence spot checks of airline safety logs.  
   "The revelations surrounding the FAA's oversight of Southwest Airlines have thrown a cloud over the agency's safety work. I strongly support the FAA's decision to implement spot checks of airline safety logs as a first step to rebuild public confidence. Congress is also moving forward with a comprehensive review of the FAA's safety operations and will likely take additional steps to make sure our aviation system remains the safest in the world."
   Last week, Rockefeller announced that he was moving a previously planned subcommittee hearing on aviation safety issues scheduled for the end of April to earlier in the same month.
