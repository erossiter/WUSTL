SEN. ROCKEFELLER DISAPPOINTED BY PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH BILL
  Senator Jay Rockefeller issued the following statement in response to President Bush's veto of legislation reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program.  
   "Doing what's right by our children speaks to our deepest humanity as Americans. That is why we all should be disappointed, perplexed, angry, and mystified, that the President has vetoed a bill that would give children health insurance. His actions stand in total opposition to the will of Congress and his own campaign pledges that children deserve health insurance and the chance to start life healthy. 
   "West Virginia's congressional delegation has stood shoulder to shoulder to do what's right for our children - even in the face of a massive misinformation campaign orchestrated by the Bush Administration. For weeks, the President has been telling anyone who will listen that our bill spends too much money, and that it will take kids out of private insurance and enroll them in a massive, government-run health care program. That's simply untrue, and he knows it. 
   "The reality is that ninety percent of kids currently enrolled in CHIP are in families making $41,300 or less a year - that's 200% of poverty. These same families cannot afford private health insurance. 
   "The President's plan to simply maintain the status quo for uninsured kids is not an option. Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate labored long and hard to come up with the best possible bill that will do the most good for our nation's children. 
   "In the weeks ahead, Congress will continue to fight for health insurance for millions more of our nation's children and work to override his veto."
