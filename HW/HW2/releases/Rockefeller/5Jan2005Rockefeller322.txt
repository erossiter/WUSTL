SEN. ROCKEFELLER CHALLENGES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE NOMINEE TO FIGHT FOR ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WEST VIRGINIANS
  In a Senate Commerce Committee hearing today on the nomination of Carlos Gutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) insisted that, if approved, the nominee put in place policies to protect West Virginia jobs and workers.
   Rockefeller told Gutierrez that United States trade laws need to be aggressively enforced. Rockefeller also told the nominee that trade remedies should be strengthened and enforced to address the negative impact of trade policies on West Virginia and American workers. 
   "We need a renewed dedication to preserving strong trade remedies for U.S. companies and workers," Rockefeller said. "I hope that you will do everything in your power to not allow the administration to negotiate away our existing trade remedies." 
   Rockefeller pointed out that only 6 percent of the displaced workers and retirees eligible for the Trade Assistance Adjustment Act's 65 percent tax credit for health insurance have taken advantage of this break. Rockefeller said, "I look forward to your thoughts about how we can improve this low participation rate."
   On steel, Rockefeller reminded Gutierrez that former Commerce Secretary Don Evans "stated unequivocally" that the import monitoring program "would be expanded to include additional steel products and made 'indefinite' in duration."
   "Time is running short to fulfill this commitment, something that is vital to the industry and that will provide valuable information to all market participants," Rockefeller said. "I would hope that you would commit yourself to a permanent import monitoring program and put it in place before the existing program expires in March."
