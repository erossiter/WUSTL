SEN. ROCKEFELLER SUPPORTS REAUTHORIZATION OF WELFARE REFORM
  To build on the historic 1996 welfare reform, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is supporting a Senate Finance Committee welfare reauthorization bill that would continue to help families move from welfare to work. The PRIDE (Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone) bill reauthorizes the welfare reform law that fundamentally transformed the old system of dependency into a new program focused on moving families into jobs and self-sufficiency. An essential part of this transition to work for many individuals and families is child care, and the bill Rockefeller supports adds $6 billion in new child care funding over the next five years, including $30 million for West Virginia. 
   "Child care is critical for families moving from welfare to work. Having access to safe, reliable child care is often the difference between being able to enter the workforce or not," said Rockefeller. "This bill makes important investments in child care." 
   The PRIDE bill helps West Virginia individuals and families move into the workplace in other ways. The bi-partisan bill continues special work rules for mothers with children under 6, so that they have a more flexible 24-hour per week work requirement. The House Republican welfare bill would eliminate the special work rules for mothers with young children and impose a 40 hours work requirement on all parents. 
   The bill also helps move people off the welfare rolls by: 
   * Authorizing $100 million for job creation and job placement programs. 
   * Creating a Parents as Scholars program, allowing up to 10% of recipients to attend college.
   * Expanding Transitional Medicaid Assistance from 1 year to 2 years.
   * Providing publicly-available research on children's well-being data for West Virginia and al l states. 
   * Strengthening child support enforcement to encourage states to give families more of the money collected from non-custodial parents so that families can leave welfare.
   In the 107th Congress, Rockefeller was a leader in welfare reform efforts that supported these ideas, and throughout his career he has been recognized as a leader on welfare reform. During negotiations on President Clinton's landmark 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, Rockefeller served as one of the Senate conferees.
