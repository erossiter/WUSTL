SEN. ROCKEFELLER WORKS TO CORRECT UNFAIR TAX TREATMENT OF SOLDIERS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is pushing for legislation that would make a key tax benefit for low-income American soldiers and their families permanent. Congress has made permanent many tax benefits for American military personnel and their families, but Republicans have refused to extend a provision for greater Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) eligibility beyond two years. The EITC offers tax relief for low-income Americans. Unless the Tax Relief for Americans in Combat II (TRAC II) is passed, starting in 2006, some soldiers could lose as much as $4,500 per year. 
   "This bill would make sure that low-income soldiers do not face a tax increase in two years," said Rockefeller, the most senior Democrat on the Veterans Committee. "We demand extraordinary sacrifices of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and they deserve to be treated fairly. Fixing this current inequity in the tax code is one way that we can show them our appreciation for their service."  
   Because combat pay is not subject to federal income tax and therefore not counted as earned income, some service personnel have found themselves ineligible for the EITC. Legislation recently passed by Congress rectifies the situation for two years, but the same legislation made eligibility for other tax credits permanent. TRAC II would make soldiers' combat pay eligible to be counted toward the EITC each year. Without the passage of TRAC II, soldiers serving in combat zones could face a higher overall tax burden beginning in 2006.
   Rockefeller has been a longtime advocate of the EITC. In the 1980s, he chaired the National Commission on Children, which recommended a significant expansion of the EITC. In 2002, the EITC provided over 142,000 low-income West Virginians with a total of $236 million in tax refunds.
