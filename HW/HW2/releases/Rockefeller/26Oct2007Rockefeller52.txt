SEN. ROCKEFELLER INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PATIENT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today introduced the "Pre-existing Condition Exclusion Patient Protection Act of 2007," legislation which would close gaps that currently allow health insurance companies and employers to deny coverage to millions of individuals for the conditions for which they need that coverage the most.  
   "This legislation is critical for the nearly 600,000 West Virginians who will likely suffer from chronic, disabling, and life-threatening conditions in their lifetime," said Rockefeller. "Because of gaps in the law, many of these patients are currently denied - or at serious risk of being denied - access to affordable, comprehensive, and meaningful health insurance coverage."
