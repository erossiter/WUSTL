SEN. ROCKEFELLER CRITICIZES ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE
  As part of an annual report released this week by the Trustees of Social Security and Medicare, the Bush Administration announced Monday that West Virginia seniors and individuals with disabilities will be paying almost $120 a year more for their Medicare Part B premiums in 2007. This 11 percent increase comes on the heels of the double-digit premium increases Medicare recipients have experienced in each of the last two years.  
   "The Medicare premium increases of the last three years are really an unfair penalty against our seniors," said Rockefeller. "The Administration claimed the Medicare prescription drug law would save seniors money. Instead, our seniors are paying more and getting less than they should.
   "In West Virginia, our seniors are already struggling to balance medical bills and prescription drug bills, with their transportation, food, and home utility needs. Our seniors simply cannot afford this increase. Burdening our seniors with additional costs must not be an option." 
   For the third year in a row, Medicare recipients will experience a significant increase in their Medicare Part B premiums. On January 1, 2005, seniors across the country saw an increase of 17.4% in their Medicare part B premiums. Premiums rose $11.60 per month - from $66.60 to $78.20 - or $139.20 for the entire year. On January 1, 2006, Medicare part B premiums increased an additional 13%. Premiums rose an additional $10.30 per month - from $78.20 to $88.50 - or $123.60 for the whole year. 
   In 2007, the monthly Part B premium for seniors will climb from $88.50 to $98.20. That means that seniors will pay an additional $116.40 for their insurance premiums. 
   Rockefeller has Senate legislation that would roll back this drastic increase in seniors' Medicare Part B premiums. The Keep the Promise of Medicare Act would limit the Medicare Part B premium increase to the annual Social Security cost of living adjustment (COLA). For 2006, that adjustment was 4.1%. Unless Rockefeller's bill is passed, the higher Medicare premiums are set to begin on January 1 next year.
   Medicare serves about 43 million people, including 35.8 million who are 65 or older. Medicare also pays for health care for people with disabilities, including severe mental illness and kidney disease.
