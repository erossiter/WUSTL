SEN. ROCKEFELLER SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO SECURE OVER $11.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO IMPROVE WEST VIRGINIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE
  As part of their efforts to secure and rehabilitate the state's bridges and highways, Senator Rockefeller joined Senator Byrd in supporting an amendment that would provide over $11.5 million for West Virginia's infrastructure.  
   "For far too long, this administration has neglected much of our growing infrastructure problems at home, leading to dangerous levels of deterioration across our country," said Rockefeller. 
   Rockefeller cosponsored an amendment to the Senate Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Bill that will provide $1 billion to improve our country's infrastructure. The amendment, which passed the Senate with a vote of 60-33, will increase federal bridge funding by nearly 20 percent - an historic increase. 
   "The silver lining in the Minnesota bridge tragedy is that it has highlighted the dilapidated state of many of our nation's bridges and highways and the need to rehabilitate these critical throughways," Rockefeller continued. "It's been decades since many of West Virginia's bridges were built and inadequate federal funding has prevented our state from keeping up with repairs. This federal funding is a big step in the right direction." 
   The funds allocated in the THUD bill will be used for the replacement, rehabilitation, and maintenance of bridges. The West Virginia Department of Transportation will be able to allocate the funds based on its priority projects. 
   The bill must now be passed by the full Senate and conference with the House's version.
