SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEVASTATION OF HURRICANE KATRINA
  "My heart goes out to all those who are suffering the ravages of Hurricane Katrina.  
 Sadly, many West Virginia communities are familiar with the tragic loss of life and property that can result from massive flooding. I know that West Virginians join me in extending our prayers and offers of support. We stand ready to help our fellow Americans in any way we can. 
   "Congress and the President must work together, quickly, to bring needed help to affected families and to prevent nationwide problems. As a result of damage to Gulf Coast refineries, we are now seeing gas prices rise even higher. I support President Bush's decision to release part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, which should take some of the pressure off rising gasoline prices. We must also be aggressive at every level in preventing and punishing instances of gasoline price gouging. And we should move quickly to pass legislation to help families meet rising gas prices and rebuild our national oil and gas infrastructure. 
   "In addition, I have been in touch with West Virginia industry officials to assess their fuel needs and reserves, which could be affected in the coming days and weeks. Our West Virginia industries are dependent on oil, gasoline, and natural gas, and it will require a coordinated national effort to make sure the supply of energy to our industries continues uninterrupted."
