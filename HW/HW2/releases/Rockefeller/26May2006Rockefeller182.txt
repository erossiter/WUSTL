SEN. ROCKEFELLER COMMENTS ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF GEN. HAYDEN AS NEXT DIRECTOR OF CIA
  Sen. Rockefeller's statement on Senate Confirmation of General Michael Hayden as the Next Director of the CIA: 
   "General Hayden is the right person to lead the CIA out of a period of turmoil and controversy. He will take over the helm of the CIA at a time of rapid expansion of the workforce and following a period of dramatic decline in employee morale. 
   "Under his predecessor's tenure the CIA lost many of its most experienced and talented officers. He will need to move quickly to convince the current workforce that the days of political litmus tests are over, and experienced professionals will be in charge rather than political cronies. 
   "Based on his past performance I am sure that General Hayden will stand up to blatant attempts to influence intelligence judgments. I also believe he has the character to speak out when he believes the intelligence process is being misused by senior policy makers. 
   "General Hayden also will need to regain the trust of the Congress. The Administration's repeated refusal to allow effective oversight of some the most important intelligence programs has endangered critical intelligence capabilities and alienated the intelligence committees when their support is most needed. 
   "I cannot overstate the importance of the job General Hayden is undertaking. The CIA and our other intelligence agencies are the front line of our defense. The CIA must find better ways to penetrate targets such as Iran and North Korea while continuing to adapt to the ever changing tactics of the international terrorist movement."
