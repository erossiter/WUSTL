SEN. ROCKEFELLER OUTLINES CONGRESSIONAL PROPOSAL FOR INTERIM FISA FIX
  Senator Jay Rockefeller, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said today that he is working closely with Senators Reid and Leahy and their House counterparts, along with top officials in the Bush Administration, to craft a temporary legislative fix to FISA.  
   Rockefeller and Democratic congressional leaders are proposing a 6-month interim fix before Congress adjourns for the August recess with the expectation that the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees will work together on long-term FISA modernization when Congress returns in September. 
   "Given the continued threat environment, and some recent technical developments, I have become convinced that we must take some immediate, but interim step to improve collection of foreign intelligence in a manner that doesn't compromise civil liberties of U.S. citizens. 
   "The Administration has offered a proposal that would instead permanently grant the Attorney General excessive surveillance powers by giving him sole authority to direct surveillance while completely removing the FISA Court from the process. That is simply unacceptable. 
   "The FISA Court must continue to play an essential role in authorizing surveillance and overseeing its execution. They are the trusted steward of FISA, and they can and must be a part of any new streamlined approach. The proposal we put forward maintains the essential role of the FISA Court while also giving our intelligence officials additional tools to strengthen their hand against terrorists. We need the Administration to act quickly if we are going to pass this critical piece of legislation in the next few days," Rockefeller said. 
   The interim fix proposed by Senator Rockefeller and others seeks to: 
   * Reinforce that foreign-to-foreign collection is not covered by FISA, consistent with current law; 
   * Ensure that the FISA Court, not solely the Attorney General, has an oversight role where foreign target surveillance touches on individuals inside the U.S.; 
   * Grant FISA Court new authority for court orders covering certain aggregated foreign collection while protecting rights and privacy of U.S. persons; 
   * Ensure continued FISA Court approval of guidelines and procedures for minimizing U.S. identities and determining the point at which initial foreign collection transitions to cover U.S. persons of interest (thereby triggering individual probable cause warrant requirements); 
   * Maintain FISA Court authority to compel compliance from telecommunications companies; and 
   * Set forth a firm legislative sunset date to ensure continued action on more lasting comprehensive FISA reforms. 
   Earlier this year, the Senate Intelligence Committee began work on the issue of modernizing FISA with the overarching goal of improving foreign intelligence collection, protecting civil liberties, and preventing this or any future President from ever abusing surveillance laws again. 
   Unfortunately, the Committee has been hampered in its ability to address FISA modernization because the Administration has refused to provide key documents at the heart of the warrantless surveillance program: the Presidential orders authorizing the program and the Department of Justice opinions on the legality of the program. 
   The interim fix proposed by Senator Rockefeller and others would allow for improved intelligence collection, along with sufficient oversight, until a long-term solution is achieved.
