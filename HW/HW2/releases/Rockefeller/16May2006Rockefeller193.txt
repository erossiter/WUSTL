SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO BRIEF FULL INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES ON NSA SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Vice Chairman Rockefeller's statement on the Administration's decision to brief the full Intelligence Committees on the NSA Surveillance Program: 
   "I've fought for this step since the beginning and while it took us way too long to get to this point, what's most important is that we're finally here. 
   "The White House, for the first time, is showing signs that they are serious about oversight of this program. 
   "They appear to have recognized that we cannot fight the war on terror without the full confidence of the American people. 
   "The way to earn that confidence is to allow careful scrutiny of the program in a classified setting. Only then will we be able to assure the American people that our counterterrorism programs are both legal and effective."
