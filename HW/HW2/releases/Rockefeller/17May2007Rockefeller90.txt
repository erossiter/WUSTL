SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON REOPENING OF SOUTH CHARLESTON STAMPING PLANT
  Following today's announcement that the South Charleston stamping plant is resuming production, Sen. Jay Rockefeller has issued the following statement:  
   "This is tremendous news for South Charleston, and for the entire Kanawha Valley. The announcement that the South Charleston stamping plant is set to re-open means that these good-paying jobs will return to the area for hard-working West Virginians. 
   "My hope is that this facility returns to its former place as a dependable and long-standing economic engine for South Charleston. I know the closure of this plant was difficult on those who worked there - and today's announcement will bring the promise of good jobs and opportunities for the Valley."
