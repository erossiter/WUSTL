SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS FOR SECURITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE
  With time running out to reauthorize a number of provisions of the 2001 PATRIOT Act, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Vice-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a bipartisan group of Senators last night successfully fought for the Senate to pass a six-month extension of the PATRIOT Act. The extension averts a lapse in the expiration of key provisions of the PATRIOT Act, including the sharing of intelligence between law enforcement agencies, one of the reasons cited for the 9/11 attacks.  
   After the House of Representatives agreed today to a one-month extension, which was later agreed to by the Senate, Senator Rockefeller made the following comments: 
   "The good news is that the House of Representatives and the White House have come to agree with us on a short-term extension of the PATRIOT Act. We need to achieve a consensus bill that protects our citizens' constitutional rights and gives our law enforcement and intelligence officials the tools they need to protect our nation from the threat of terrorism." 
   "I have some concern that one month may not be enough time, but if we negotiate in good faith, on a bipartisan basis, I believe we can get it done. My priority from the outset has been to get the best bill possible, whether it takes one month or six." 
   Before the vote yesterday, Rockefeller and 51 other Senators, including 8 Republicans, wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, calling for an extension of the Patriot Act. Until yesterday afternoon, the White House had refused to go along with the extension. 
   Below are some of the main provisions of the PATRIOT Act that were set to expire on Dec. 31:
   * (Sections 201, 202) Wiretap predicates. Added terrorism and computer fraud and abuse to the list of crimes that are "predicates" for obtaining a wiretap, which means a court can give government agents permission to tap telephones when they are investigating such crimes. 
   * (Section 203, Parts B and D) Information sharing. Allowed law enforcement to share foreign intelligence information obtained through wiretaps or electronic surveillance with law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration or national defense or national security personnel.
   * (Section 204) Tracking. Clarified that the use of pen registers and trap-and-trace devices, which can be used to track telephone calls and Internet communications, are included in the intelligence agency exception to the criminal prohibition on wiretaps. The exception has to be amended each time federal law is changed to give law enforcement new wiretap powers, as the PATRIOT Act did.
   * (Section 206) Roving wiretaps. Allowed the use of "roving" wiretaps by investigators working under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) when a court finds that the actions of a suspect may thwart traditional wiretaps. In those cases, investigators can obtain a court order allowing them to tap whatever telephones a suspect may use, rather than getting a court order for each telephone. 
   FISA (PL 95-511) is the law authorizing wiretaps of suspected foreign criminals or spies. 
   * (Section 207) Intelligence investigations. Increased to 120 days court orders for FISA investigations against people considered to be agents of a foreign power and who are not U.S. persons, up from 90. After that period, a court could extend the order anywhere from 90 days to a year. Search warrants in such cases are good for 90 days, up from 45. 
   * (Section 209) Voice mail seizure. Allowed the government to seize voice mail messages with a warrant. Allowed investigators to get one warrant that is good nationwide, rather than requiring a separate warrant for each jurisdiction. 
   * (Section 212) Emergency information disclosure. Allowed Internet service providers to show the government a subscriber's electronic communications when they believe there is a risk of immediate danger, death or serious bodily injury. With a court order or search warrant, law enforcement agents also could require providers to disclose such information. 
   * (Section 214) FISA wiretaps. The law broadened the authority of the government to get court orders under FISA for using pen registers and trap-and-trace devices. Instead of showing that the person under surveillance is an "agent of a foreign power," investigators must show the information is "relevant" to an ongoing investigation aimed at protecting against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. 
   * (Section 215, Parts 501 and 502) Business records. Allowed courts to issue a FISA order allowing investigators to obtain business records, but only in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence investigations. The kinds of business records that can be obtained with the FISA court order were broadened to include "any tangible thing," such as books, records, documents and other items. Twice a year, the attorney general must report to Congress on how many times such a court order has been requested and the outcome of each request. 
   * (Section 217) Computer hacking interception. Allowed law enforcement agents to intercept electronic communication if the owners of a computer system or network believe someone is attacking their system from the outside. The agents' actions must be part of an ongoing investigation and involve only communications to or from the suspects. 
   * (Section 218) Broadening intelligence authority. Allowed FISA investigations in those cases where obtaining foreign intelligence information is a "significant" purpose of the investigation. Such surveillance previously was permitted only when obtaining foreign intelligence information was "the primary purpose" of the investigation.
   * (Section 220) Nationwide electronic search warrant. Allowed courts with jurisdiction over the crime under investigation to issue a nationwide federal search warrant, good anywhere in the country, for e-mail and other electronic information. 
   * (Section 223) Civil suits for disclosure of information. Allowed the United States to be sued in civil court if anyone unlawfully discloses information obtained through the law's wiretap authority. If the court found the disclosure to have been unlawful, there is a minimum fine of $10,000 plus litigation costs. If the court found a government employee guilty of unlawfully disclosing the information, the government was required to investigate whether administrative action against the employee was also warranted. 
   * (Section 225) Immunity. Provided immunity from civil liability for communications service providers and others who assist the United States in the execution of various FISA orders.
