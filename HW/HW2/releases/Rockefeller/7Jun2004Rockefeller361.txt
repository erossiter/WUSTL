SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES $36,000 GRANT TO WESTOVER VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has announced that the Westover Volunteer Fire Department is being awarded $36,000 in grants through the first round of the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Program. 
   "AIt is important that these men and women who are fighting our fires in West Virginia have the resources necessary to do their jobs," Rockefeller said. "They are the backbone of first-responders in emergency situations, and the general safety of our communities depends on them. I am pleased to see these funds awarded."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered through the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP). For the 2004 program, Congress appropriated $750 million in direct assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness for firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States.
   Fire departments seeking information regarding the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program should contact the fire grants help desk toll free at 1-866-274-0960, or e-mail them at firegrants@dhs.gov.
