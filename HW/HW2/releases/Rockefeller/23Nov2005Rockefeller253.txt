SEN. ROCKEFELLER WINS FIGHT TO HELP WEST VIRGINIA FOSTER CARE AGENCIES MEET NEEDS OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
  At the White House yesterday, President George W. Bush signed legislation sponsored by Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) that will ensure that additional WV foster care agencies can participate in the federal foster care program. Under the new law, for-profit therapeutic foster care agencies will be able to receive federal money to help recruit and train families that accept children with special medical, psychological, emotional and social needs.
   "This legislation is truly something to give thanks for," said Rockefeller. "These agencies are doing important work in preparing families to help foster children who have special needs. 
   "Now, they will be able to be able to receive the resources they need, so that they can continue their good work in making life that much better for children."
   Therapeutic foster care is foster care for children with special medical, psychological, emotional, and social needs. In West Virginia, agencies contract with the state government to place the children in appropriate homes and support families after the placement. These agencies receive funding from federal foster care. 
   Before the Fair Access Foster Care Act of 2005, federal funds could only be distributed to non-profit therapeutic foster care agencies. 
   Rockefeller worked with Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) on the bill. 
   Senator Rockefeller has long led the charge to promote adoptions and improve services to children at risk of abuse and neglect. In 1993, Rockefeller fought for child abuse prevention programs, and four years later the program was expanded to include adoption and reunification services as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. Since the passage of that act, the number of adoptions from foster care has doubled nationwide, including more than 900 adoptions from foster care in West Virginia.
