SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTION TO SUPREME COURT DECISION TO HEAR FCC APPEAL
  Senator Jay Rockefeller IV (D-WV) made the following statement today regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear the appeal of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) concerning their ability to enforce fines for "fleeting expletives" on broadcast television. 
   "It's essential that the FCC have the ability to enforce its own regulations aimed at protecting children and families from obscene language and indecent programming during family hours.
   "I would hope that the Supreme Court will agree with families across the country, that we must be doing more, not less, to protect our children from indecent and violent television."
