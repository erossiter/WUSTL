SEN. ROCKEFELLER'S REACTION TO DECLASSIFICATION OF THE FISCAL '07 INTELLIGENCE BUDGET
  "Releasing the top line of our intelligence budget is long overdue.  
   "Congress was right to force this disclosure, and we must demand a greater dialogue about intelligence programs in a way that doesn't endanger national security. 
   "Intelligence is one of our greatest national security tools - whether it's fighting terrorism, understanding the intentions of rogue countries, or planning a military operation. 
   "While the intelligence activities themselves are necessarily done in secret, the American people have a right to know what their government's priorities are and whether we're spending too much or too little on intelligence matters."
