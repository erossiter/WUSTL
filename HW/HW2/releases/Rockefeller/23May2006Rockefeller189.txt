SEN. ROCKEFELLER VOTES IN SUPPORT OF GEN. HAYDEN FOR NEXT CIA DIRECTOR
  Today, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted to approve (12-3) the nomination of General Michael Hayden to become the next Director of the CIA replacing outgoing CIA Director Porter Goss. The full Senate may act on the nomination by the end of the week. Sen. Rockefeller, who voted by proxy, was unable to attend the vote in person due to recovery from back surgery. The following is Senator Rockefeller's statement:  
   "In my view, General Hayden is the right person to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to having a strong record of experience, he has shown the necessary independence that is essential to restoring the CIA's credibility and stature. 
   "More than any other time in history, the CIA needs a Director who is an intelligence professional and a proven leader. General Hayden is credited with turning around the NSA and I'm confident that he'll bring in qualified professionals and take the necessary steps to get the CIA back on track. 
   "General Hayden's statement and answers during his confirmation hearing convinced me that he will defend the CIA in the inevitable bureaucratic turf battles, including standing up to the Pentagon when necessary. He also demonstrated a commitment to working with the Congress to ensure that we can carry out our constitutional responsibilities to oversee intelligence programs. 
   "I am confident that General Hayden understands his role and the importance of intelligence that is timely, objective and independent of political pressure."
