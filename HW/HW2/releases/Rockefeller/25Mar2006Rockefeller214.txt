  Statement of Sen. Rockefeller on passing of Erma Ora Byrd: 
   "I am deeply saddened by the passing of Erma Byrd this evening.
   "For nearly 69 years, Erma stood by her husband's side. She was an ever present and constant source of support for Senator Byrd in public and in private. Never a day went by that she didn't share in his joy and honor to serve the great people of West Virginia.
