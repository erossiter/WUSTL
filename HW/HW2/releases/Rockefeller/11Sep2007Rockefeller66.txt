SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS TO PROTECT FUTURE OF WEIRTON STEEL
  Senator Jay Rockefeller today met with top executives, including CEO Lou Schorsch, of Arcelor Mittal Steel to discuss their Weirton operations. At the conclusion of the meeting, Rockefeller called the discussion frank and direct.  
   "I am very concerned about the recent events and future of Mittal's Weirton facility," said Rockefeller. "Weirton is a steel mill town, built and shaped by the industry. However, the declining employment and lack of investment has had severe effects on the community." 
   Rockefeller, who recently visited Weirton and met with community leaders to discuss Mittal and the area's economy, urged Arcelor Mittal to reinvest in the Weirton mill and fulfill their obligation to the workers and members of the community. 
   "I encourage Mittal to reconsider the closing of the strip mill - its one of the more productive mills in Mittal's system," Rockefeller noted. "It also remains in the interest of Mittal and the community to sell Weirton's usable assets when there are willing buyers." 
   In addition, Rockefeller noted that a tremendous amount of developable land in Weirton is owned by Arcelor Mittal and the company should not ignore the local requests to allow development on this land when feasible. Arcelor Mittal has recently indicated a willingness to part with some of the land, which Rockefeller says is a "good start." 
   "Mittal needs to accept responsibility and be a good corporate citizen - it has an obligation to the Weirton community, workers, and families." Rockefeller concluded. 
   Rockefeller has closely monitored the situation to ensure that the interests of steel workers and their families are paramount in any business decision. Rockefeller, the Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, has worked tirelessly to advocate for the needs of the Northern Panhandle steel industry.
