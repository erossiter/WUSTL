SEN. ROCKEFELLER DENOUNCES CORPORATE TAX BILL FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS, COMPANIES MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today opposed a corporate tax bill that began as an effort to help domestic manufacturing companies but ballooned into a giveaway for special interests and companies that have moved jobs overseas. Sen. Rockefeller voted for an earlier version of the bill when it included real relief for the American economy. But he refused to vote for the bill's final passage after a Republican-led conference committee eliminated key economic incentives that would have helped West Virginia workers and companies.  
   "This bill is not the balanced package of tax incentives for manufacturing that I supported in the Senate bill," Rockefeller said. "The final deal that the Republicans have put together has virtually nothing for struggling domestic manufacturers, while it provides billions of dollars in tax breaks for companies that moved jobs overseas.
   "Right now, workers in my state are worried about being laid off, and we had an opportunity to help American companies and American workers," said Rockefeller. "But this flawed bill actually does more to reward companies for moving jobs overseas than it does to help companies who are struggling to keep their American factories open." 
   The bill:   
   * Provides Corporate Tax Holidays - Companies that have moved jobs overseas and kept profits offshore will now enjoy a $3.5 billion tax break. 
  * Promotes Outsourcing - The final bill ignores a provision in the Senate bill to prevent the federal government from outsourcing contracts to foreign workers. 
  * Refuses to Provide Relief to Guard and Reserves or their Employers - Republican leadership refused to include a provision that would have given employers a tax credit of up to $15,000 if they continue to pay their activated Guard and Reserve employees.  
   * Eliminates Help for Domestic Manufacturers - The final bill removes Rockefeller-supported measures included in the Senate bill that would have allowed struggling steel companies and manufacturers to reclaim taxes paid on previous earnings. 
   * Protects Tax Shelters - The final bill doesn't include $40 billion in tax loophole closures approved in the earlier Senate bill. Such loopholes include tax shelters used by Enron to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, and allowing companies to avoid taxes if they move their headquarters overseas. 
   * Drops Responsible Energy Initiatives - The bill dropped tax incentives to develop clean coal technologies and increase natural gas production in Appalachia. 
   * Undermines Captive Shippers - The bill's repeal of a 4.3 cent excise tax on railroads' diesel fuel rewards monopolistic practices at the expense of West Virginia captive industries. 
   * Eliminates Broadband Technology Tax Incentives - The final bill dropped a broadband tax incentive Rockefeller authored that would have encouraged the deployment of high-speed Internet access across the country.   
  * Undermines Overtime - The bill fails to roll back new Labor Department rules that essentially eliminate the right to overtime pay for an estimated 6 million workers.  
  "My decision on whether to support this legislation came down to a very simple test. Will this bill help West Virginia manufactures and improve our state's economy?" Rockefeller concluded, "I cannot support this bill because it decidedly fails that test."
