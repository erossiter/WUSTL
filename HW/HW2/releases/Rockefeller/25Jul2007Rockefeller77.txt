SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF BILL AIMED AT IMPROVING SERVICES TO RETURNING SOLDIERS
  The U.S. Senate this morning has given final approval to legislation cosponsored by Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) that will improve the treatment and care for West Virginia's returning wounded soldiers. Passage of the legislation came on the same day that the President heard from a Blue Ribbon Panel on how to improve the delivery of care for soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital. 
   By voice vote, the Senate passed the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act of 2007, legislation that addresses many of the problems soldiers faced when transitioning from the active duty to veteran's health care system. The bill was crafted by Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) in the wake of the Walter Reed Army Medical Scandal. Senator Rockefeller, the senior member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and a cosponsor of the bill, helped shepherd it through the committee. 
   "Our soldiers are coming home with deep and debilitating wounds - both physical and mental. This can make their transition back into civilian life a truly difficult challenge," said Rockefeller. "The last thing they need when returning home is a cumbersome paper process not worthy of their sacrifice. We're determined to fix it, and this legislation will go a long way toward giving our wounded soldiers the support they've earned and deserve."
   The bill requires the Pentagon and the VA to develop a comprehensive policy by the end of this year on the care, management and transition from the military to VA or civilian life for service members with combat-related injuries or illnesses. West Virginia's veterans will benefit from several key features of the bill including:
   * Improving the delivery of services to veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by developing a comprehensive plan for prevention, diagnosis and treatment with these service connected disabilities. Also, two national centers of excellence (one for TBI; one for PTSD) will be established to further scientific and medical research. 
   * Adoption by the military of the VA presumption that a disease or injury is presumed to be incidental to service when the member has six months or more of active duty -- and the disability was not noted at the time the member entered active duty. 
   * Requiring military departments to use VA standards to make disability determinations, and prohibit deviation from VA standards except to give the service member a higher disability rating. 
   * Establishing a board to review disability determinations of service members who are or were separated between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2009, with a disability rating of 20% or less. 
   * Increasing severance pay for service members separated with less than 30% disability: 
   * Requiring the Secretary of Defense to establish uniform standards for military medical treatment facilities, specialty medical care facilities, and military quarters housing patients. 
   ROCKFELLER HEARS FROM EXPERTS ON HOW TO IMPROVE VA FUNDING
   Also this morning the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee heard testimony on the importance of providing a stable, reliable stream of funding to meet the health care needs of veterans. 
   Rockefeller heard from a noted health care economist who said that the VA health care system outpaces Medicare as a leader in the delivery of quality and efficient care. However, funding for the VA is growing at a slower rate than other U.S. health care programs because of the inability of the previous Republican Congress and the Administration to pass the agency's annual budget on time. That resulted in a number of temporary funding measures that were unable to meet the demands of veterans and their families. Senator Rockefeller is committed to reversing that trend. 
   "West Virginia's veterans have come to rely on the VA health care system for its constant level of care and support. But that care has been jeopardized by the past failures of the Republican Congress to get pass budgets done in a timely manner and the Administration insists on nickel-and-dime increases," Rockefeller said. "We all want the VA to get more money to care for our soldiers. The budget realities in Washington make it tough, but it's time to put our veterans first." 
   In the past few years, the VA has also suffered from a number of miscalculations and roadblocks that have shortchanged the delivery of health care and caused delays in important services. Two years ago, the VA budget was over a billion dollars short and required a supplemental grant because the Bush Administration failed to take into account that the health care system is absorbing a large number of young veterans with serious mental and physical health needs that require specialized care, such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Disorder (TBI), while also trying to meet the long-term care needs of older veterans. 
   It was only after repeated questioning by Senator Rockefeller in February of 2004 that the VA Secretary honestly testified to the real funding needs. As a result, Congress filled the gap swiftly. 
   This year's funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs will run out on September 30. The full Senate is expected to begin debate next week on the fiscal year 2008 Veterans Affairs budget - which takes effect October 1. Senator Rockefeller said he is optimistic that the Democratically-controlled Congress will be able to complete work on the VA Budget in time.
