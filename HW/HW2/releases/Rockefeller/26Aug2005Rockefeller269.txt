SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES GRANT TO TRI-STATE AIRPORT FOR IMPROVED AIR SERVICE
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WW), Ranking Member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, today announced that Huntington's Tri-State Airport has won a $500,000 Department of Transportation grant to improve its air service.  
   "Reliable and affordable air service is critical for making sure that our airports continue to be gateways for the economic development of our state," said Rockefeller. "My role is to do everything possible to help our airports receive what they need to compete and grow." 
   Tri-State Airport is receiving a Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCADSP) grant for a comprehensive marketing and fare rebate program to increase the use of air service now being provided by U.S. Airways and Delta Airlines. The grant will also be used to recruit additional airline services. 
   "Tri-State has shown that it has been innovative in finding new ways to improve themselves and expand their service, and I am pleased to be able to help in that process," Rockefeller said.
   Rockefeller was instrumental in establishing SCADSP as part of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21). Senator Rockefeller also secured an increase in funding for the program in the 2003 Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. Rockefeller's action reauthorized the program through 2007. 
   6 of West Virginia's 7 commercial airports have now received SCADSP grants.
