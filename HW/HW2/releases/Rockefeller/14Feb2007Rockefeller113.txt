SEN. ROCKEFELLER MEETS WITH WEST VIRGINIANS TO DISCUSS SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller met with West Virginians yesterday representing the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) State Association (Coalitions for a Better West Virginia) and the West Virginia Teen Court Association, to discuss substance abuse issues.  
   "The volunteers that I met with are on the front lines of an effort to turn the tide of substance abuse in West Virginia through education and developing stronger communities," Rockefeller said. "Their successes should serve as an example to others that West Virginians will not give in to the insidious effect of substance abuse in our communities." 
   The network of West Virginians, who represented Mercer, McDowell, Wyoming, Greenbrier and Nicholas Counties, were in DC for the national CADCA forum. Mercer and Monroe Counties were recognized this year by America's Promise Alliance for Youth as two of the top 100 communities for their work with young people. 
   In meeting with the organizations, Rockefeller said, "My message to you all is simple: keep fighting for your communities and West Virginia." 
   In the 1980s, Rockefeller helped to create the Safe and Drug Free Schools program, which has helped to achieve a 23 percent overall decline in youth drug use over the past five years. It has served 37 million students nationwide. President Bush's 2008 budget proposes a decrease in funding for the state grants portion of this program, which funds drug prevention education, by $255 million. 
   "Understandably, many West Virginians have serious concerns about substance abuse in their areas. The challenges in our communities are proof that we need local organizations and grassroots efforts like these, and the funding to back them, more than ever before," said Rockefeller. "They are critical to our children, our families, and each of our communities - and I will do everything I can to support them."
