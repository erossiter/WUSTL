SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS FOR ADDRESSING FRAUD, ABUSE IN NONPROFITS
  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing aimed at cracking down on potential abuse and fraud in non-profit organizations, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) on Tuesday called on Congress to take steps to protect taxpayer money by separating "legitimate organizations" from "bad actors." 
   "I abhor abuse in the nonprofit sector because it does so much damage," said Rockefeller. "Many of the proposals that the Committee is considering will dramatically improve the transparency of nonprofit organizations. Allowing more sunshine in is the best way we can guard against abuse and fraud at foundations and charities.
   "By requiring nonprofit entities to file more complete information with the Internal Revenue Service, and by making more of this information available to the public, the government, media, and donor community can ensure that organizations are truly fulfilling their charitable missions.
   "I know from personal experience that foundations and charities do a tremendous amount of good work across the country," said Rockefeller. "Since the time I was governor of West Virginia, I have worked with a number of excellent organizations that bring social services and development to the neediest parts of rural America. West Virginia is fortunate to have many excellent charities and community organizations. I've met with a number of West Virginia nonprofits lately, and I've been very impressed with the great things they are doing." 
   Today's hearing was held to consider the interim report provided by a Panel on Non-Profit Sector established by the Finance Committee. Legislation on addressing nonprofit fraud and abuse is expected to follow the Panel's full report in June.
