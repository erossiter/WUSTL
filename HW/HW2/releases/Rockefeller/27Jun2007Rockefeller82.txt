SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON CHIP REAUTHORIZATION TALKS
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement in response to comments made earlier by President Bush earlier this afternoon on the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Senator Rockefeller co-authored the legislation that created CHIP in 1997. Earlier this year, he submitted legislation that would reauthorize that program for another 10 years.  
   "For the last several weeks, Senators Baucus, Grassley, Hatch and I have been working together on a proposal that will not only reauthorize CHIP, but also cover more of the children who today are falling through the cracks of our health care system. The discussions have been thorough and productive, and it's clear that we're going to need the recess to hammer out a final plan. But our fundamental goal is the same and I commend my colleagues for their commitment and determination. 
   "I take great exception to President Bush's remarks on children's health care this afternoon. Congress has already categorically rejected the President's plan because, according to the CBO, it would kick 1.4 million children off of CHIP. 
   "There are millions of children in America today who cannot afford or do not have access to health insurance. Health care is not a luxury, it is a moral imperative. 
   "If the President is serious about addressing this enormous national need, then he will set aside partisan games and work with Congress to quickly pass a new bill that covers millions more uninsured American children."
