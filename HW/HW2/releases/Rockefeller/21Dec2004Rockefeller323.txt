SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS FOR QUICK RELEASE OF HEATING ASSISTANCE FUNDING
  With freezing temperatures descending on West Virginia during the week before Christmas, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today joined a bi-partisan group of more than 20 Senators requesting President Bush to release emergency heating assistance funding for lower-income households. 64,000 West Virginians participated in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) last year. 
   "Home heating in winter is a basic human necessity, like food, water, clothing, and shelter," said Rockefeller. "We know that there are families in West Virginia who are already struggling to provide heating for their families and themselves. But with this recent cold snap, some people will face even greater challenges in keeping their families warm and safe.
   "Without this assistance, lower-income families, disabled Americans, and seniors may have to make devastating choices between heating and food or heating and prescription drugs. The President should make this emergency money available quickly because many of our households need assistance now." 
   Under the pressure of record-high crude oil prices, the costs of heating oil and propane have spiked. The national average price for residential heating oil is 54 cents higher per gallon now than it was at the same time last year. The average residential propane price nationally is more than 35 cents higher per gallon. 
   The federally-funded LIHEAP was set up to assist needy families, especially families that have small children, seniors, or people with disabilities. If a household meets certain income guidelines, then LIHEAP may be able to pay home heating bills. In West Virginia, LIHEAP is administered through the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. West Virginia residents can call the department toll free at (800) 642-8589 to find out if they are eligible and how to apply.
