SEN. ROCKEFELLER OPPOSES SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller expressed his opposition today to the Senate passed immigration reform bill (62-36) noting that it provides amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants and does not meet tough border security standards.  
   Unfortunately, Senator Rockefeller is still recovering from extensive back surgery and was unable to vote on the measure, however he closely monitored the debate from home and shared his concerns with his colleagues. 
   "There is no question we have a real problem with illegal immigration and we need to get it under control," Senator Rockefeller said. "But the bill that passed the Senate isn't the answer. The solution must be a combination of tougher border security measures and incentives for legal immigration not amnesty for immigrants who break the law. At the end of the day we must hold every individual accountable and do what's right for the American taxpayer." 
   Rockefeller added, "I've always opposed a blanket amnesty because I believe it undermines the rights and opportunities of our law-abiding citizens."
