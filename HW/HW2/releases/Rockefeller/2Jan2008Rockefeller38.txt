SEN. ROCKEFELLER'S REACTION TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DECISION TO OPEN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO DESTRUCTION OF CIA TAPES
  "Attorney General Mukasey has made the right decision to begin a criminal investigation and place it in the hands of a career prosecutor.
   "We, however, have an obligation to continue our own congressional investigation and that is exactly what we will do.
   "Our negotiations with the CIA and DOJ over the scope of our investigation are ongoing. I fully expect their continued cooperation, including relevant testimony and documents, so that the Committee can thoroughly review and publicly report on all actions related to the destruction of the tapes."
