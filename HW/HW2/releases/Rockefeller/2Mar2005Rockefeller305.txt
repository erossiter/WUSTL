SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS FOR GOVERNORS TO STICK TOGETHER, PREVENT CUTS TO MEDICAID
 Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) this week participated in a closed-door meeting with the National Governors Association (NGA), including West Virginia Gov.  
 Joe Manchin, on Medicaid reform. Sen. Rockefeller, Ranking Member on the Senate Subcommittee on Health Care, was invited to meet with the governors and share his expertise on Medicaid. The meeting was held as governors deal with growing pressure by the administration to accept what has been reported as $60 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next ten years in exchange for fewer federal Medicaid requirements. 
   At that meeting, Rockefeller urged the governors to move with great caution on proposals to change Medicaid. "We have an opportunity to improve the program, but we must also be careful about not doing great harm," Rockefeller said. "We must band together in opposition to Medicaid cuts and spending caps." 
   Rockefeller also told the governors, "As a former Governor, I understand the budget constraints you are under, and I understand the need for improvements in the Medicaid program. But we must focus on enacting Medicaid solutions that benefit both the states and federal government, not just proposals that shift greater costs to the states.
   "We need to fully understand that Medicaid not only affects children, families, and the elderly who receive benefits, but the hospitals, doctors, and nursing homes who deliver critical care in West Virginia."
   West Virginia has more than 354,000 Medicaid enrollees. 50 percent are children, 17 percent are between 18-64, while 9 percent are 65 or older. More than 23 percent of West Virginia enrollees are blind and disabled.
