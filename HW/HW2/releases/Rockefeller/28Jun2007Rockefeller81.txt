SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO MSHA INTERNAL REVIEWS OF SAGO AND ALMA MINE TRAGEDIES
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) released the following statement in response to the findings contained in the Mine Safety and Health Administration's report on the agency's internal failures associated with the Sago and Alma Mine disasters last year.  
   "With the release of MSHA internal reviews, the agency had an opportunity to be forthright and honest about their mistakes and demonstrate that they learned something from this hard look at themselves. While I appreciate that this type of analysis by the agency must have been difficult, no matter how hard MSHA tries to spin it, clearly the violations that their inspectors failed to find - or ignored - at Alma contributed to the disaster. And, at the very least MSHA should have done more to end the slow-walk of the Sago mine operators towards compliance." 
   "The jury is still out as to whether or not MSHA's new recommendations will make a difference moving forward. But one thing remains perfectly clear - inspectors who knowingly ignore problems at a mine, not only jeopardize miners, but violate the trust that miners place in MSHA to stand up for their interests."
