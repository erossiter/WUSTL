  SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEWS OF DEATHS OF TWO BOONE COUNTY MINERS
   "We are still fresh with grief from the tragedies at Sago and Alma, and today brings more heartbreak. My thoughts and prayers go out to those families and communities who have lost loved ones today. The heart and soul of all West Virginians has been - and continues to be - tested, but we will prevail.
   "Today's accidents scream for change. We will make the mine safety legislation introduced today by the West Virginia congressional delegation Priority One for Congress."
