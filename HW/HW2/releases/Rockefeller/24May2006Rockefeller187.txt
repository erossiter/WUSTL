SENS. ROCKEFELLER, BYRD PRAISE SENATE PASSAGE OF MINER ACT
  In an effort to bring about the most significant mine safety legislation in a generation, the Senate today passed The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act. As co-authors of The MINER Act, West Virginia Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) said the legislation would usher in significant safety changes that could potentially have helped save miners' lives during recent tragedies at Sago, Alma - and in Kentucky, where six miners have died in the last 4 days. Among its key features, The MINER Act would require each miner to have at least 2 hours of breathable air and additional stores of self-rescuers every 30 minutes along escape routes, as well as at the working face of the mine. 
   After months of intense negotiations, The MINER Act was passed out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee last week by a unanimous vote of 20-0, and Rockefeller and Byrd pushed the Senate leadership to immediately pass this bill this week. Today, the Republican and Democratic leadership joined together to allow the bill to be passed by unanimous consent. The bill now will be considered by the House of Representatives where Representatives Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Nick J. Rahall (D-WV), and Alan Mollohan (D-WV) have introduced the MINER Act. 
   "We have a duty and a responsibility to make mining safer for the thousands of miners who risk their lives every day to make sure that Americans have the electricity they need," said Rockefeller. "We've done that today, and we do not have a moment to waste as we now push for action in the House and for the bill to be signed into law. Last weekend's accident in Kentucky, as well as the miner who perished today, are only the most recent reminders of how dangerous coal mining is.
   "The MINER Act will make mining not free of danger, but less dangerous," Rockefeller said. "Its call for improved oxygen supplies, new electronic tracking systems, and local rescue teams - all of which will enable miners and their families to have some greater peace of mind about the work they do every day. Coal mining in West Virginia and across the country continues to be on the rise, so safety must be too."
   "By passing the MINER Act, the Senate will save lives," Byrd said. "It will save more coal mining families the heartache of losing their loved ones in a mining disaster. Many, if not all, of the coal mine deaths this year were preventable, if only miner safety were a higher priority.
   "We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to put an end to the safety crisis in our mines. This MINER Act is the best hope to begin fixing obvious problems that, if left unaddressed, would continue to cost lives," said Byrd.
   The MINER Act reflects new agreements between mine workers and industry officials on a number of issues critical to mine safety. In addition to the increase in oxygen supplies, the bill requires coal operators to submit plans detailing their mine's use of the most current communications, tracking, and breathing apparatus technologies - and they must, upon acceptance of their new safety evacuation plans, continue to introduce and use the best technology that works in their mines. Within three years, all mines would have state-of-the-art two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place. 
   The bill also demands quicker incident notification, more local rescue teams, stricter fines, and tougher fine enforcement. 
   A 1-page summary of the MINER Act follows.
   THE MINER (MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE) ACT 
   BREATHABLE AIR: Miners will have more emergency breathing devices to help them survive a disaster. The bill:
   * Requires each miner to have at least 2 hours of breathable air and stores of breathing devices every 30 minutes along escape routes for miners trying to evacuate.
   * Emergency supplies will be carefully monitored for reliability.
   BETTER COMMUNICATIONS AND TRACKING: State-of-the-art technology. The bill:
   * States that all mines will have state-of-the-art two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place, as soon as technologically feasible, but not later than three years.
   BETTER RESCUE EFFORTS: Mine rescue team response will be faster and better. The bill: 
   * Requires rescue teams to be located close to the mines they cover and be familiar with those mines. 
   * Includes special provisions for small mines that are realistic, but also provide a higher level of protection for their miners than under current law.
   * Clarifies that neither rescue team members nor their employers are liable for any injuries or deaths that occur as a result of rescue activities.
   STEEPER FINES: The Secretary will have new enforcement powers. The bill: 
   * Sets substantial new minimum penalties for serious violations.
   * Gives the Secretary clear authority to shut down a mine for noncompliance with Department orders.
   ENCOURAGES NEW INSPECTORS: The bill encourages technological advances and a new generation of skilled miners and safety inspectors. The bill:
   * Focuses the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s mine safety activities and creates an interagency working group to facilitate development of new technologies.
   * Directs expert study on belt-air and flammability of belts and field tests of refuge chambers.
   * Creates a grant program to improve safety training.
   * Creates a scholarship program to increase the skilled workforce for mining operations, the inspector corps, and more safety research for institutions of higher learning.
    ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BILL: 
   All mines will have flame resistant lifelines to guide miners out in an emergency.
   Seals for abandoned sections of mines will be stronger. Within 18 months, the Secretary must issue a higher standard for sealing off abandoned areas of mines to prevent dangerous explosions.
