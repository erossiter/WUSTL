SEN. ROCKEFELLER PRESERVES SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FUNDING FOR WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS
  As part of his ongoing effort to help with repairs and renovations of West Virginia's aging schools, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced that Congress has passed legislation that will mean millions for West Virginia's schools. The bill, which passed in the last hours of the 109th Congress, will extend interest-free construction loans for two more years for West Virginia's school systems.  
   The bill also includes key education tax deductions for teachers who spend their own money on teaching supplies and for families who have college tuition expenses.
   "Studies show that students in new, up-to-date facilities are more likely to learn," said Rockefeller. "I have long fought for federal funding to help improve existing schools and build new ones, so that our students are given the best environment possible to learn and grow." 
   The passed by Congress extends the Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) program, which enables qualified schools, that partner with the private sector to borrow money without any costs or at nominal interest rates. 
   Rockefeller fought to make sure that the access to this funding for rural areas was not compromised. He pushed for the local matching requirement to be very flexible and to include in-kind contributions. In-kind contributions can include the transferal of land, educational software, or even the donation of tutorial time. 
   The bill also extends for two years the $250 tax deduction available to teachers who use their own money for classroom supplies. 
   Additionally, the bill extends for 2 years the tax deduction for college tuition expenses. That provision will enable working families to deduct up to $4,000 in qualified higher education expenses. 
   "Communities and teachers throughout the state will greatly benefit from this legislation," said Rockefeller.
