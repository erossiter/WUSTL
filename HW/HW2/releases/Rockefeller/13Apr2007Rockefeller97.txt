SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO NAMING OF WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY'S NEW PRESIDENT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller issued the following statement today following the announcement of West Virginia University's new president, Mike Garrison.  
   "I'm sure Mike Garrison knows better than anyone that filling the shoes of a university president like David Hardesty will be an enormous challenge. But David passes on a strong, stable and thriving institution, and the best way forward is to join together and focus on WVU's important future. Mike Garrison is a Mountaineer through and through, and as we begin a new era under his presidency, I know WVU can and will see continued growth and success."
