VICE-CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO HOUSE'S AGREEMENT TO EXTEND PATRIOT ACT
  After the House of Representatives today agreed with the Senate on the need to extend the Patriot Act, Sen.  
 John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, Vice-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, made the following comments: 
   "The good news is that it appears that the House of Representatives and the White House have come to agree with us on a short-term extension of the PATRIOT Act. We need to achieve a consensus bill that protects our citizens' constitutional rights and gives our law enforcement and intelligence officials the tools they need to protect our nation from the threat of terrorism. 
   "I have some concern that one month may not be enough time, but if we negotiate in good faith, on a bipartisan basis, I believe we can get it done. My priority from the outset has been to get the best bill possible, whether it takes one month or six."
