SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS FOR PARENTS' RIGHTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM INDECENT, VIOLENT TELEVISION IMAGES
  As part of his effort to address the pervasive and increasing excessive and gratuitous violence that plagues television programming, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) told a Senate hearing today that parents needed more effective tools to help them control what their children are watching. Rockefeller told officials from the cable industry, broadcast networks, and industry groups that many West Virginia parents and educators are worried about the negative impact television may be having on the well-being of children.  
   "The importance of protecting our children from indecent and violent images grows with each passing year," said Rockefeller. "Each day, and for hours and hours every day, broadcast, cable, and satellite television outlets indiscriminately barrage our children and families with indecent and violent images. I cannot tell you how many West Virginia parents and educators have told me that children's behavior is becoming more aggressive and that television is to blame for some of the problem."
   "I do not advocate censorship, but I do advocate government and media and parents working together to clean up television. I think a lot of kids see a lot of really damaging things. The American Psychological Association conducted a 15-year study showing that men and women who watched a lot of violent content as children were more likely to exhibit violent behavior toward their spouses and were 3-4 times more likely to be convicted of a crime."
   Rockefeller said that Congress must act on this issue, regardless how difficult decency and violence are to define: "I understand that these are hard lines to draw, but just because they are difficult doesn't mean that we should sit by and do nothing. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we have a moral obligation to tackle television violence and arm our parents with the tools to make their children safer."
   Rockefeller (D-WV) has introduced the Indecent and Gratuitous and Excessively Violent Programming Control Act of 2005 to reduce violent and indecent programming, while also giving parents and local broadcasters more tools for blocking offensive programs. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has cosponsored the bill. 
   Key features of Senator Rockefeller's legislation include: Providing the FCC with the authority, for the first time, to address graphic and gratuitous violence on television; directing the FCC to address violence and indecency on all TV programming, including cable and satellite; increasing fines for indecent content; doubling children's programming from 3-6 hours per week; and giving greater flexibility to local broadcasters and parents to reject offensive programming. 
   At the forum today, a number of officials applauded the Rockefeller-Hutchison bill, including Roberta Combs, of the Christian Coalition.
   Senator Rockefeller has been a long-time supporter of legislation to address indecency. He voted for the Children's Television Act of 1990, which limited the amount of advertising during children's television shows. Rockefeller has also been an advocate of steeper fines for broadcasters who transmit indecent programming. In 2004, he supported the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which would have sharply increased the amount of fines for these broadcasters.
   BACKGROUND STATISTICS ON TELEVISION INDECENCY 
   * Instances of violence on TV have risen significantly in recent years. In 2002, depictions of violence were 41 percent more frequent during the 8 p.m. "Family Hour" and 134.4 percent more frequent during the 9 p.m. hour than in 1998. 
   * The National Television Violence Study conducted the most comprehensive scientific assessment of television violence ever undertaken in 1998 which cited that 60 percent of TV shows include violent acts. 
   * The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a study in 2004 that found that two-thirds of parents want the government to place tighter controls on sex and violence on television. The Kaiser study also found that only 15 percent of all parents surveyed have used the V-chip, which allows parents to block specific programs. 
   * Indecency complaints filed at the FCC have surged in recent years: 111 indecency complaints filed in 2000 to 2,240,350 in 2003. 
   Fact Sheet on Senator Rockefeller's Indecency Legislation
   1) Seeks to Combat Violence on Broadcast Television 
   * Provides the FCC with the authority - for the first time - to address graphic and gratuitous violence on television.
   2) Addresses Violence and Indecent Programming on Cable and Satellite 
   * Directs FCC to address violence and indecency not just on broadcast television, but on all programming, including cable and satellite. 
   3) Gives Parents Better Tools to Protect Children from Violent and Indecent Television 
   * Requires the FCC to identify a more effective means of protecting children from indecency and gratuitous violence on television, after a 60-day review of the V-Chip and other blocking technologies.
   4) Gives Parents Clear and Timely Warning of Offensive Programming
   * Mandates more meaningful labeling of violent and indecent programming to include a full-screen, 30-second warning every 30 minutes on broadcast, cable, and satellite programming.
   5) Increases Children's Programming
   * The bill doubles from 3 hours to 6 hours per week the amount of children's programming that broadcasters must offer. 
   6) Increases Fines from $27,500 to $500,000 
   * The bill increases the maximum fine for a single incident or violent content to $500,000, subject to a cap of $3 million. FCC will also be given latitude to double fines for egregious cases, such as incidents in which the offensive material has been scripted in advance, and to reduce fines as appropriate for small and locally-owned broadcasters. 
   7) Gives Local Broadcasters the Power to Reject Indecent and Violent Programming
   * Allows individual and local broadcasters to refuse to air programming that violates the standards in their own communities, and protects them against fines for decisions imposed on them by national networks.
   8) Re-examines Voluntary Ratings Standards
   * Directs the FCC to assess and report to Congress on the effectiveness of the TV Parental Guidelines, which are used to rate upcoming programming. Also requires the FCC to assess and report to Congress on the feasibility of applying more rigorous ratings systems from non-industry sources (i.e., advocacy organizations). 
   9) Encourages Broadcasters to Reinstate the Voluntary Code of Conduct
   * Affirms a Sense of Congress Resolution that each television and radio licensee, cable and satellite distributor, or other programming service should reinstate or adopt - and faithfully comply with - the provisions in the "Television Code of National Association of Broadcasters."
