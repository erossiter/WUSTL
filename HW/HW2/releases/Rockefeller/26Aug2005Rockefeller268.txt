SEN. ROCKEFELLER DECLARES VICTORY FOR 130TH AIRLIFT WING
  Following today's unanimous decision by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission to preserve the 130th and keep the unit's C-130 planes in Charleston, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement: 
   "Today's historic decision shows that truth is always the best argument. Over the last few months, numerous West Virginians have given their time, energy, and resources to educate the BRAC Commission about what we knew all along - that the 130th is one of the finest units in the Air National Guard and, indeed, all of the armed services. All we had to do was share with the BRAC Commissioners the record, performance, and current vital missions of the men and women of the 130th. That's why it was a unanimous decision.
   "I celebrate today with all of the people who have been instrumental in making sure that a fully-functional 130th remains in Charleston. I want to thank Major General Allen Tackett, Colonel Timothy Frye, Major Kevin Ray, Col. Bill Peters of Keep 'Em Flying, and all of the members of the 130th for their hard work. I especially applaud Senator Byrd's exemplary leadership in uniting the entire West Virginia congressional delegation behind this effort. Thanks to today's decision, the 130th will continue to serve as a vital part of the defense of our great country and a critical component in the response to natural and man-made disasters."
