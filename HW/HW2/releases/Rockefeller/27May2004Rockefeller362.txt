SEN. ROCKEFELLER INTRODUCES HOMELAND SECURITY BILL TO HELP FIRST RESPONDERS AT LOCAL LEVEL
  With local law enforcement fighting to secure every dollar possible from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) introduced legislation last week to help West Virginia's first responders get the money they need to respond to a natural disaster or terrorist attack. Rockefeller outlined the legislation for the first time last night to the Association of Public Safety Communications Officers 2004 East Coast Regional Conference in Charleston. Under Rockefeller's bill - the Community Security Act - local first responders would receive federal assistance through a two pronged approach: new tax incentives for volunteer responders and their employers, and through federal grants. The Community Security Act would also provide students, teachers, and school administrators with counseling in the event of a terrorist attack. 
   "One of the most immediate lessons of 9-11 was that we need some pretty profound changes in the way we prepare for large and small emergency response," Rockefeller said. "But those changes have been fairly slow, and the funding even slower. We have to make sure the money, the incentives to provide emergency assistance, and the equipment are readily available to the men and women who make up our front line of defense." 
   In November 2003, Rockefeller co-hosted a Homeland Security Summit in Shepherdstown, which drew first responders from throughout the state to discuss what improvements were needed to be made to make the Mountain State safer. The Community Security Act is based on several concerns that were raised by West Virginia emergency personnel during that event and during a series of first responder roundtable discussions that Senator Rockefeller hosted beginning in the fall of 2001. 
   "The Community Security Act is based upon the recommendations made to me by West Virginia first responders, and I believe it will provide some of the essential tools needed to help them keep our communities safe," Rockefeller added.

   Under Rockefeller's legislation, local first responders would receive federal assistance on several fronts. It would: 
   * Create Tax Incentives To Recruit and Retain Volunteer First Responders. In order to make sure West Virginia communities have the emergency personnel needed, Rockefeller's legislation would change the tax code to allow volunteer first responders an above-the-line deduction for training costs that are not currently reimbursed.
   * Provide A Tax Credit To Businesses Who Employ Volunteer Emergency Personnel. The bill extends a 50 percent tax credit to compensate businesses for costs incurred by extending extra time off to employees for volunteer first responder training or duties.
   * Establish Grant Program To Provide Basic Protective and Communications Equipment. This competitive grant program would focus on the unmet needs of local first responder teams. The funds could be used to improve operation center technology or to buy safety and communications equipment. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would also create a standard for first responder units that will guide grant awards. 
   * Offer Mental Health Programs To Help Students Cope. Under this provision, two programs would be created to help students cope with terrorist attacks or school-related violence. The programs would pay for in-school mental health counseling for 13 months during and following a disaster or terrorist attack and refund schools that hire mental health professionals to help the students cope.
   * Develop A Competitive Grant Program for Research and Development. This section guarantees that homeland security professionals are evenly distributed across the country by creating a program in DHS that is similar to the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program or the National Institutes of Health(NIH) Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program.
   EPSCoR promotes the development of the states' science and technology resources through partnerships involving a state's universities, industry, and government, and the federal research and development enterprise. The IDeA program was first established to broaden the geographic distribution of NIH research funding to institutions located in states that do not ordinarily receive significant funding from NIH. 
   * Creates A Merit-Based Program To Address Gaps in Homeland Security. In order to make sure there are no gaps in the nation's homeland security efforts, this provision would authorize research on first responder group dynamic and citizen response to disaster. The DHS Secretary would then report the finding to Congress so that members can help shape more effective policy.
