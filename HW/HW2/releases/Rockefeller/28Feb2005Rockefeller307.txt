SEN. ROCKEFELLER RECEIVES AWARD FOR EXCEPTIONAL SUPPORT OF AVIATION INDUSTRY
  In recognition of his significant contributions to the aerospace industry, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has been awarded the Wings of Liberty award by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA). The award is presented annually to one or two Members of Congress who have shown a commitment to fostering and advancing America's aerospace industry. 
   In its commendation, AIA noted that Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, "has served with distinction and characteristic leadership in supporting the national security of the United States and a robust civil aviation industry." 
   "The American aerospace industry is one of our most innovative industries, and I appreciate being recognized by them," Rockefeller said. "We will continue to work together to make sure that this industry - and our country - remains at the forefront of innovation and technology." 
   "In West Virginia, the aerospace industry has been an important part of our economic development. In recent years, we have seen many companies locate in West Virginia, and I believe that our state will continue to be a good home to these companies."
   West Virginia is home to more than 10 aerospace-related companies, employing more than 1200 workers. Rockefeller has been instrumental in attracting many of these companies to the state. On several occasions, he has led international aerospace executives considering expanding to West Virginia around the state. 
   The Wings of Liberty award is named after a 1919 description of aviation's early years by the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce, AIA's precursor.
