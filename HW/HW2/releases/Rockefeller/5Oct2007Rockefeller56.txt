CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER REACTION TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S CLAIMS CONGRESS FULLY BRIEFED ON CIA DETENTION, INTERROGATION PROGRAM
  "The Administration can't have it both ways. I'm tired of these games. They can't say that Congress has been fully briefed while refusing to turn over key documents used to justify the legality of the program.  
   "The reality is, the Administration refused to disclose the program to the full Committee for five years, and they have refused to turn over key legal documents since day one. 
   "As I have said from the beginning, Congress has a constitutional responsibility to determine whether the program is the best means for obtaining reliable information, whether it is fully supported by the law, and whether it is in the best interest of the United States."
