SEN. ROCKEFELLER VOTES FOR TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) on Thursday night worked to pass a sensible tax relief package that will benefit hundreds of thousands of West Virginia families. The Working Families Tax Relief Act extends three critical tax cuts for working Americans through 2010: marriage penalty relief, an expanded 10% tax bracket, and a $1000 child tax credit. The bill also includes a provision Sen. Rockefeller introduced last year that increases the child tax credit by up to 50% for millions of low-income working families across the country. 
   "The Working Families Tax Relief Act is a good piece of legislation," said Rockefeller. "So much of the Administration's focus has been on helping the wealthiest people in America. I'm glad that Democrats were finally able to get some cooperation in helping average working families. Virtually every West Virginia worker who pays income tax will benefit from this package."
   "Last year, I introduced legislation to provide low-income working families 50% more benefit from the child tax credit. Because Congress has finally acted on my proposal, the families of 57,000 West Virginia children will receive a more valuable tax credit." 
   Rockefeller was disappointed that Senate Republicans defeated Democratic efforts to pay for the package through the elimination of corporate tax shelters, including loopholes that Enron used to avoid paying its fair share of taxes: "We ought to pay for tax cuts so we don't mortgage our children's future." At the same time, he expressed appreciation that so many West Virginia residents would be helped in the coming months. "I am glad that the Working Families Tax Relief Act will protect West Virginians from higher taxes next year," Rockefeller said.
   The Senate passed the bill 92-3. It now goes to the President, who is expected to sign it into law.
