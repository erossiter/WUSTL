SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF AL-ZARQAWI
  The following is a statement by Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV on the death of the al-Qaeda leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  
   "This is a remarkable achievement for the men and women of the armed forces and intelligence agencies. I commend them for their relentless and successful pursuit of Abu Musab al Zarqawi. He was a ruthless murderer and we can only hope his death will bring about change in Iraq. While this is a significant accomplishment, it will take some time before we know the full impact of removing Zarqawi, and we must be realistic about expecting a reduction in the overall level of violence.  
   "There is no question that Zarqawi was a visible symbol of the violence. He was known for both sadistic attacks and trying to provoke a civil war between the Sunnis and Shias.    
   "At the same time, he and his organization, al Qa'ida in Iraq, are only a part of the violence there. The foreign jihadists make up a very small percentage of the broader insurgency, and al Qa'ida is one group within that jihadist movement. The bulk of the insurgency is comprised of former regime elements and others who want to drive the United States out of Iraq. The next largest group contributing to the violence is the sectarian militias loyal to radical factions such as that of Muqtada al-Sadr. The jihadists are the smallest component with the least support among the Iraqi population.   
   "As Zarqawi's attacks have been indiscriminate and especially vicious, we can only hope that his death will result in a reduction of some of the most deplorable acts we have witnessed.   
   "Zarqawi's death combined with the announcement of the completion of the Iraqi government means this is a good day for Iraq, but there is a long way to go."
