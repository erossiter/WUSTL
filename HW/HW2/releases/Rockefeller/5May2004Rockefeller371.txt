SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS FOR WEST VIRGINIA WORKERS, SUPPORTS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has cosponsored legislation to provide a gradual increase to the national minimum wage over the next three years. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2004, if passed by Congress, would boost the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7 over three years and would be the first raise in the minimum wage in seven years.  
   "Hard-working West Virginians should be able to support themselves by earning an income that reflects the needs of today's economy. Wages have been too low for too long and West Virginia workers deserve better," Rockefeller said. "By increasing the minimum wage to $7 an hour, West Virginia workers have the potential of increasing their annual income by $3,800." 
   Under the bill, the minimum hourly wage would increase by $0.70 two months after the legislation is signed into law. One year later, it would increase again by $0.60, and in the third year the minimum wage would increase by $0.55. Currently, working a 40 hour work week, 52 weeks a year at the present minimum wage level earns a worker $10,700, which is $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. 
   Noting that West Virginia's working families could greatly benefit from this increase, Rockefeller explained, "For a low-income family of three, that's enough money to buy more than a year of groceries, pay over nine months of rent or even finance full tuition for a community college degree. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty." 
   While Congress has considered increasing the minimum wage several times over the years, it has not taken action since 1996. Rockefeller refuted opponents of the increase by saying, "Some in Congress believe that raising the minimum wage will hurt the economy and job creation. But that just isn't the case when you consider that 11 million new jobs were created between 1997 and 2001 following the last increase of the minimum wage."
