SEN. ROCKEFELLER RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE COMMENTS
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement in response to comments made by President Bush earlier this afternoon on reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Senator Rockefeller co-authored the legislation that created CHIP in 1997. Earlier this year, he submitted legislation that would reauthorize that program for another 5 years.  
   "It's no surprise to anyone that our nation's health care system is broken. But, whatever your view is on how best to reform the system, I believe that one thing is perfectly clear - our children should come first and their healthcare must be protected. 
   "For a decade, CHIP has succeeded in meeting the health care needs of millions of children. Through the CHIP program, states are provided with the resources they need to take care of one of our most vulnerable populations. As a result, millions of children have received routine healthcare checkups, immunizations, and screenings to give kids a healthy start in life. You can't duplicate that kind of security through the tax code, despite the President's wishful thinking. 
   "It's time for the President to get serious about children's health care and work with Congress to give families the peace of mind that they deserve."
