SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES $6.2 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MID-OHIO VALLEY REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced today that the Mid-Ohio Valley Regional Airport in Parkersburg will receive $6.2 million in federal funding through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These grants will enable the airport to make improvements to its runway and to install a new guidance system for aircraft.  
   "Airports are essentially gateways for new businesses and new jobs," said Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee. "That's why I've fought throughout my Senate career for improvements to our local airports. 
   "This grant will help the airport repair its runway and make other necessary upgrades, making air travel safer for our residents and visitors. With the $6.2 million, the airport can begin to make much needed improvements immediately." 
   The airport's grant was awarded through the FAA's Air Improvement Program (AIP), which provides significant funding to local airports, helping them modernize the air traffic control system and expand airport runways and other facilities. Senator Rockefeller was instrumental in securing a substantial increase in the AIP reauthorization in 2003 as part of the VISION 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act.
