SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO PRESIDENT BUSH COMMENTS ON CHIP REAUTHORIZATION
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) Chairman of the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, issued the following statement in response to President Bush's press conference today on CHIP. 
   "The President is clearly out of touch with most Americans, including the majority of Congress, who are working to extend CHIP to 4 million more children living in poverty.
   "I'm tired of the double talk that comes from the Administration when it comes to CHIP. They say they want to cover more children, and they have a history of allowing states to expand their programs, yet when we offer them a bill that does exactly those two things - they oppose it.
   "The reality is that CHIP is one of the most cost-effective and successful programs in existence. Coupled with the fact that it provides health insurance to a vulnerable population - our children - it makes supporting this deal a no-brainer.
   "Congress is going to do its job and will send the President a CHIP bill by September 30. It will be up to him, and him alone, to decide if he wants coverage for millions of children to lapse.
   "And, let me just say one final thing - I'm tired of hearing the President say that our bill covers children in families making $80,000 a year. That is flat out untrue. The fact is, our bill is capped at 300% of poverty - that's $60,000 for a family of four. The only state that could have gone up to $80,000 was New York, given their higher cost of living, but the President knowingly killed that with an unachievable mandate on the states. Hopefully, we'll be able to reverse the Administration's short-sightedness and given states the flexibility they need and deserve."
