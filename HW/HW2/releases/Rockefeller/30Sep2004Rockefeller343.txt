SEN. ROCKEFELLER CRITICIZES BUSH ADMINISTRATION, SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP FOR FAILING TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE
  With $1.07 billion set to revert back to the U.S. Treasury tonight, Sen.  
 John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) expressed frustration that the Bush Administration and the Republican-controlled Senate refused to pass legislation that would have preserved the funding. As a result, 200,000 American children could now lose health insurance over the next three years. 
   "We had an opportunity to secure this funding for the coming years. It is irresponsible to allow 200,000 children to lose their health care coverage. These children and their families were depending on us in Congress, and we've let them down," Rockefeller said.
   Rockefeller and a group of bi-partisan colleagues have been calling for the passage of Rockefeller's Children's Health Protection and Improvement Act, which would have prevented the $1.07 billion in unused CHIP funds from reverting back to the Treasury. The secured funding would have been used to target states with insufficient federal funding for children's health care coverage.
   Senator Rockefeller remains hopeful that Congress will pass the Children's Health Protection and Improvement Act prior to adjournment next week. He is committed to fighting to make sure that children in West Virginia and all over America have a healthy start in life.
   In 1997, Rockefeller authored the CHIP program with the late Senator John Chafee (R-RI). Last year, CHIP provided health insurance to 35,000 West Virginia children and 5.8 million children nationwide.
