SEN. ROCKEFELLER COMMENTS ON CIA IG EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ON CIA FAILURES PRIOR TO 9/11
  Today, the CIA released an unclassified version of their executive summary of the agency's 9/11 accountability review. For over two years, Senator Rockefeller has been part of a bipartisan group of Senators seeking the full public release of the CIA IG report. The following is Senator Rockefeller's reaction. 
   "Sadly, the CIA's 9/11 accountability review serves as a sobering reminder that the Bush Administration policies for the past six years have failed to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the person responsible for 9/11. Nor have the Administration's policies deprived Osama bin Laden and other senior al Qaida leaders of the safe haven they need to plot against the United States. 
   "The fact is, al Qaida's terrorist sanctuary has re-emerged along the Afghan-Pakistan border region while our country's military and intelligence resources have been largely devoted to the violence and civil war in Iraq. 
   "On the other hand, under new leadership, I believe the CIA has learned much from the past and has corrected many of these shortcomings in the months and years following 9/11. There remains, however, additional work to be done to bolster our counter-terrorism efforts, including addressing unrealized goals in the areas of agent and asset recruitment, information-sharing, and the collection, processing and reporting of intelligence."
