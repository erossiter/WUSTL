SEN. ROCKEFELLER HAILS PASSAGE OF STIMULUS BILL WHICH WILL SEND REBATE CHECKS TO WEST VIRGINIANS
  Late this afternoon, the U.S. Senate agreed by a vote of 81-16 to provide rebate checks to most West Virginia's families, seniors, and disabled veterans who struggling to make ends meet in the wake of rising prices at gas stations and supermarkets. The legislation provides $600 for most individuals, $1,200 for couples and $300 for each child under 17. 
   "Hopefully these rebate checks will give West Virginia families some relief from increasing gas prices, food and heating costs. We've acted quickly to get this relief to those who need it the most, and who will spend it to help boost our economy," Rockefeller said. "It would have been wrong to exclude West Virginia's seniors and veterans from the economic stimulus package. I'm pleased we were able to include them in the final bill."
   Key features of the bill that passed this afternoon include:
   * A rebate of up to $600 (up to $1,200 for married filing jointly) for all West Virginians who paid federal income taxes last year and made less than $75,000 ($150,000 in the case of joint returns) in adjusted gross income. For those taxpayers who made more in income, the rebate will be lowered according to a sliding scale.
   * An additional rebate of $300 per child if a West Virginian received $1 of the above tax rebates.
   * A $300 rebate to West Virginia seniors and disabled veterans who had $3,000 in qualifying income last year. Qualifying income includes self-employment income, veterans' disability payments (including payments to survivors of disabled veterans), and social security benefits.
   * Enhanced expensing and depreciation tax breaks that are meant to encourage West Virginia's small businesses to purchase new equipment.
   * A provision to allow the Federal Housing Authority, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to insure larger home mortgages so fewer families would lose their homes to foreclosure.
   Rockefeller expressed his disappointment that the final compromise bill didn't include expanded unemployment insurance compensation, food stamp relief, more funding for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program or state fiscal relief which would stave off cuts to Medicaid.
   The compromise Senate measure must be approved by the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the President for his signature.
