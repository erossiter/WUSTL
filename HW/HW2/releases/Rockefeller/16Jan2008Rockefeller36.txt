SEN. ROCKEFELLER MEETS WITH MITTAL EXECS TO REVIEW WEIRTON LAND SALES
  Senator Jay Rockefeller issued the following statement following a meeting yesterday with officials from ArcelorMittal Steel who unveiled their plans to sell unused land at their Weirton facility to spur economic development in the region. Last year, the community approached the Senator to get his help in urging the company to create a plan to develop the unused land in the city.  
   "Today's announcement by Mittal is great and welcome news for all of us who have been looking to attract jobs and investments to the Northern Panhandle. Given the breadth and depth of the land that's available for sale, it will clearly make it easier for us to continue to market and promote Weirton as great place to do business. 
   "As we've seen across the country in other steel communities, the possibilities for this land are endless. While this economic renaissance in Weirton won't happen overnight, I'm confident that working together we'll be able to find the right projects that will benefit fromour hard working and productive workforce.
   "Let me also be equally clear, this is not the end of steel in West Virginia. Quite the contrary, tin remains very valuable and changes within the industry are providing new opportunities for West Virginia steel workers. This is not the end, it's a new beginning."
   Rockefeller noted that the Discover the REAL West Virginia Foundation is planning on hosting a summit to discuss the redevelopment options in Weirton this spring. The Foundation is currently working to coordinate the schedules of all the stakeholders so that we can have a productive and frank discussion about our development options.
