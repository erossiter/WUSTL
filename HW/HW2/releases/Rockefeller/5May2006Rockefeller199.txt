SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO RESIGNATION OF CIA DIRECTOR GOSS
  Sen. Rockefeller made the following statement today in reaction to the resignation of CIA Director, Porter Goss.  
   "Regrettably, Porter Goss's tenure as Director of the CIA was a tumultuous one. His chief mission was to reform the operations of the CIA and to lead the agency with foresight and vision, yet his tenure was marked by an exodus of talented and respected intelligence officers and a demoralized staff. 
   "The management problems hindering the effectiveness of our intelligence programs are not limited to the CIA however. There are red-flags throughout the intelligence community. The Department of Homeland Security has fallen well-short of its mandate to protect our borders. The FBI continues to struggle with meeting its national security and counterterrorism responsibilities. Even the Director of National Intelligence, an office created by Congress to be a strong and independent leader, has failed to live up to its promise under pressure from the White House and the Pentagon. 
   "With respect to the CIA, which remains the foundation of our intelligence, we must have a leader with strong credentials, a demonstrated track record of independence and objectivity, and the ability to bring much needed harmony within the ranks. 
   "As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Community, I can say that this has been an enormously frustrating time within both the Intelligence Community and Congress. 
   "We are faced with an Administration that is less than forthcoming about its actions. I worry about our oversight functions, and remain concerned that there is more of an effort made to protect the Administration than to protect the American people. 
   "All of this only reinforces the need for a rock-solid CIA Director - a strategic thinker whose only interest and mission is to improve our intelligence capabilities."
