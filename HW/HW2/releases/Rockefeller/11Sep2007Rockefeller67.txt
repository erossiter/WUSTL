SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTION TO REPORTS OF WOMAN TORTURED IN WEST VIRGINIA
  Rockefeller reaction to reports of woman tortured in West Virginia: 
   "I was angry to hear about the unspeakable violence and hatred that occurred in Logan County. My heart and prayers go out to Ms. Williams and her entire family. No one should ever have to endure what she was put through, and I know that all West Virginians share in my sense of outrage and sadness. 
   "Those who did these things deserve to be punished. We must send a message to the world that these types of heinous crimes have no place in our society. In West Virginia, we will join together as a community to help begin the healing process and to take action so this can never happen again."
