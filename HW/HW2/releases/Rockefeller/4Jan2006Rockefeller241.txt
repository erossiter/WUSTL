SEN. ROCKEFELLER MOURNS LOSS OF 12 UPSHUR COUNTY MINERS
  Following a communication breakdown at Upshur County's Sago Mine that gave family members a false impression that rescue teams had found 12 of 13 miners alive, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement this morning:
   "There are no words to express the deep sadness and anger I feel today for the families of the miners, their friends, and for all of West Virginia. Last night, I joined with them in celebrating when MSHA confirmed to my office that the miners had been saved. 
   "Now, in the full light of day, it's clear that what we thought was a miracle is, in the end, a terrible tragedy. We thank God that Randal McCloy, Jr. has survived, and I rejoice for his family and him. But our anguish and frustration are overwhelming. 
   "In the days and weeks ahead, we must continue to come together to support the friends and families of these men who have had their lives stolen. We must figure out what went wrong in the Sago Mine itself and where the company must answer for its safety record. We must also take action to be sure that the reckless communication that added to these families' pain never happens again."
