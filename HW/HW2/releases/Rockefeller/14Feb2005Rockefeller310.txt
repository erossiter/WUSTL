SEN. ROCKEFELLER SPONSORS BILL TO HONOR TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
  Honoring veterans who overcame racism to serve their country, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has co-sponsored a bill that would authorize the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen, whose ranks included fourteen West Virginians.  
   "This honor is long overdue," said Rockefeller. "These men stepped forward to defend our nation against the horrors of Hitler's Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, they found themselves battling racist treatment by their own countrymen along the way. To their great credit, these men fought through this unjust treatment because their sense of duty to their country was so great.
   "I believe the Congressional Gold Medal is an appropriate and well-deserved expression of the appreciation Americans have for their courage and service."
   Several of the West Virginian Tuskegee Airmen attended West Virginia State University, which has a rich history of creating military leaders. More military generals have graduated from West Virginia State than any other non-military college in the nation.
   The 1000 black pilots who graduated from Tuskegee inspired revolutionary reform in the armed forces, paving the way for integration of the United States armed services. Of those pilots, 450 served in combat, 66 died in combat, while another 33 were shot down and captured as prisoners of war. The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with destroying 261 aircraft, damaging 148 aircraft, flying 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy and North Africa. They destroyed or damaged over 950 units of ground transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing missions. 
   Members of the Tuskegee Airmen have been awarded three Presidential Unit Citations, 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses and Legions of Merit, along with The Red Star of Yugoslavia, 9 Purple Hearts, 14 Bronze Stars and more than 700 air medals and clusters.
