SEN. ROCKEFELLER OUTLINES SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE FALL AGENDA
  Today, the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, outlined an aggressive fall agenda continuing the Committee's efforts to conduct proper oversight of the nation's intelligence programs, while also giving the Intelligence Community the tools they need to do their job effectively. 
   "The next few months are going to be extremely busy as the Committee examines a series of issues that are critical to our national security," Rockefeller said. "It will also be a time for action, as the Committee is poised to fix the shortcomings in the recently enacted FISA reform legislation, assess the future of U.S. detention facilities, and implement necessary intelligence reforms."
   In the next two months, the Committee will hold hearings on the recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, U.S. detention facilities including the future of Guantanamo Bay, interrogation policies, counter-terrorism programs, Iran, acquisition reform, and the FBI. The Committee also will craft legislation modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
   Later in the fall, the Committee will continue its examination of terrorist ideology, and will hold hearings on the DNI's authorities and intelligence collection architecture.
   Given the sensitive nature of intelligence, most of these hearings will take place in closed session.
   Finally, over the next few months, the Committee will work toward the passage of the fiscal year 2008 intelligence authorization bill and the completion of the remaining Phase II reports on Iraq pre-war intelligence.
