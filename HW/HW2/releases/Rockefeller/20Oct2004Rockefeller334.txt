SEN. ROCKEFELLER CRITICAL OF BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR NOT ACTING TO PREVENT FLU VACCINE CRISIS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today criticized the Bush Administration for ignoring warning signs for several years about the possibility of a flu vaccine crisis. As a result of the administration's inaction, at least 30 million Americans who are considered at high-risk for the flu will likely not receive the vaccine and could face potentially devastating consequences.   
   "What the Bush Administration has done to our nation's most vulnerable citizens is unnecessary," Rockefeller said. "The administration had numerous warnings about the potential for a vaccine shortage but at every turn failed to take steps to remedy this problem. They didn't move quickly enough to find new suppliers, and they continue to mislead the American public about the severity of the shortage. Now, we have millions of Americans who risk contracting influenza this winter. The administration's response to this crisis has been unconscionable." 
   Rockefeller is particularly concerned about press reports indicating that the Bush Administration missed a number of opportunities to prevent the vaccine shortage. According to the reports, in June 2003, FDA regulators visited the British plant of Chiron, which is responsible for producing half of U.S. flu vaccines. On that inspection, say the reports, officials identified significant quality control problems and bacterial contamination. The problems continued into this year. In August, according to the reports, Chiron notified the FDA that at least several million doses were tainted, but still no new suppliers were found. Chiron's announcement on October 5 that as many as 48 million doses were contaminated meant that more than half of the Americans at-risk would not receive a flu vaccine this year. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from flu complications and approximately 36,000 people die from flu.  
   "I am especially concerned about the people of West Virginia because our state has the highest median age with a substantial number of residents over the age of 65," Rockefeller said. "I believe the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources understands the vulnerability of our population, and I commend the Department for its efforts to get the vaccine to individuals who need it. I also applaud the residents of West Virginia who have shown great strength and a strong commitment to making sure that those who need the doses receive them." 
   FLU VACCINATION GUIDELINES FOR WEST VIRGINIANS 
   Who Should Receive a Flu Vaccination? 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control, the following individuals are considered at high-risk for the flu. They should be given the highest priority for flu vaccination: 
   * All children aged 6-23 months; 
  * Adults aged 65 years and older; 
  * Persons aged 2-64 years with underlying chronic medical conditions; 
  * All women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; 
  * Residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities; 
  * Children aged 6 months-18 years on chronic aspirin therapy; 
  * Health-care workers involved in direct patient care; and 
  * Out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged 6 months. 
   Where Can High-Risk Individuals Go To Be Vaccinated? 
   First, West Virginians should contact their primary care physician to see if he/she has doses (providers often order vaccine supplies independent of public health agencies). 
   If your physician does not have vaccines, West Virginians should contact their county Department of Health and inquire about the availability of doses locally. 
   If county Departments of Health are not able to provide doses, local pharmacies may have vaccines on hand. 
   West Virginia Bureau for Public Health 
   All West Virginians can contact the Bureau for Public Health for continuing updates on the availability of the flu vaccine statewide by calling (304) 558-7899 or by visiting http://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/.
