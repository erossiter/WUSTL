SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO PENTAGON IG REPORT ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES WITHIN OFFICE OF UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY
  Sen. Rockefeller reaction to Pentagon IG report on intelligence activities within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy: 
   "The Inspector General's report makes it clear in plain language that the actions of the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy were inappropriate. 
   "Individuals in that office produced and disseminated intelligence products outside of the regular intelligence channels. These intelligence products were inconsistent with the consensus judgments of the Intelligence Community. This office did this without coordinating with the Intelligence Community and as a result policy makers received distorted intelligence. 
   "Section 502 of the National Security Act of 1947 requires the heads of all departments and agencies of the U.S. government involved in intelligence activities 'to keep the congressional oversight committees informed.' 
   "The IG has concluded that this office was engaged in intelligence activities. The Senate Intelligence Committee was never informed of these activities. Whether these actions were authorized or not, it appears that they were not in compliance with the law. 
   "In the coming days, I will carefully review all aspects of the report and will consult with Vice Chairman Bond to determine whether any additional action by the Senate Intelligence Committee is warranted."
