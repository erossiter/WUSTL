SEN. ROCKEFELLER MEETS WITH MITTAL STEEL USA CEO, EXPRESSES DEEP ANGER, CONCERN ABOUT CLOSING OF HOT END PLANT
  Today, Sen. Jay Rockefeller had a meeting with Mittal Steel USA Chief Executive Officer Louis Schorsch in his Washington office to discuss the recent closing of Mittal's hot end plant in Weirton. Sen.  
 Rockefeller was extremely frustrated by the lack of consultation by executives at Mittal and made his views explicitly known.
   "I'm extremely frustrated by Mittal steel's decision to close the hot end plant, and I made absolutely sure that the U.S. CEO, Mr. Schorsch, knew exactly how I felt. Had Mittal been willing to reinvest in Weirton and our workers, we would have proved once again that we could be more than competitive on a global scale," Rockefeller said. "Instead, the closing of the hot end plant has dealt an enormous blow to the Ohio Valley and those who depend on Mittal Steel for their livelihood."
   Rockefeller added, "During today's meeting, I pressed for a commitment on the future of the tin plate facility. I told Mr. Schorsch that Mittal must make a commitment to keeping our tin plate operations strong and running full speed. Weirton produces first-rate, high quality tin plate, and these operations must continue to prosper - and I hope expand - in the coming years. While Schorch said the company intends to try to make the tin side more profitable, I made sure that he knew I would hound him every day, wherever I had to go around the world to find him, until we get a firm commitment about the future.
   "I will not stand by while Mittal plays with the lives of the finest steelworkers in the world. Weirton deserves better."
