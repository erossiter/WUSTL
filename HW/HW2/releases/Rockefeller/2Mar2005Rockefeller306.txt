SEN. ROCKEFELLER URGES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION TO PROTECT STEEL INDUSTRY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMPORTS
  In a hearing before the International Trade Commission (ITC), Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today strongly urged Commission members to maintain tariffs on hot-rolled steel from Japan and Brazil and continue the suspension agreement with Russia. Since the tariffs were enacted five years ago, West Virginia steel has made a comeback, thanks in great part to the enormous sacrifices that steelworkers have made. Unless the ITC extends those tariffs, the domestic steel industry may not be able to "rebuild," according to Rockefeller. 
   "If the ITC doesn't extend these tariffs, importers will come in again and dump their steel onto the American market," said Rockefeller. "We've seen this dumping devastate our steel industry before."
   In the year before the ITC order took effect, Brazil, Japan, and Russia dumped 7 million tons of steel on the American market. In the first year after the order, the number declined dramatically to 126,000 tons.
   As a result of a series of cases like this and the limited Section 201 relief provided to the industry, the steel industry has finally been able to reach a level of profitability, but any failure to extend the order, Rockefeller said, would reverse these efforts: "We cannot let our guard down on this basic remedy against unfair trade. With the industry now finally on its way to recovery, maintaining fair trade conditions is critical."
   Rockefeller told the ITC that they had full authority to extend the illegal dumping order: "You have the authority to continue the relief, and it is the only fair decision to honor the courageous steelworkers and companies who have regained their footing and put people back to work. Our steel industry needs a chance to rebuild itself for the future. You have the power to give them that chance."
