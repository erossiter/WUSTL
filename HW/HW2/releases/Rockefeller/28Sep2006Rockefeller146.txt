SEN. ROCKEFELLER DONATES COMPUTERS FROM SENATE TO WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS
  As part of a U.S. Senate program that sends computers to local schools, Senator Jay Rockefeller has designated 25 Internet-ready computers to be sent to schools throughout the Mountain State. The West Virginia systems receiving the computers are: Doddridge County Schools, Grant County Schools, Lincoln County Schools, Logan County Schools, and Taylor County Schools.  
   "Our students deserve the best technology equipment possible," said Rockefeller. With these new computers, more young West Virginians will be better able to access the extraordinary wealth of information available through the Internet. The more cutting-edge equipment our students have today, the more likely our students will become the high-tech workers of tomorrow."  
   The donation was part of the U.S. Senate's Computers for Schools Program. Each year, as part of the program, Rockefeller designates computers to go to different school systems around West Virginia. Senate officials established the program to help public schools take advantage of information technology.
   Rockefeller has been a national leader on education technology. He and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) created the E-Rate program as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. E-Rate is a federally funded grant program that provides money to classrooms and libraries. Today, over 85 percent of classrooms in West Virginia are linked to the Internet connecting school children to vast amounts of data and educational resources never before possible in rural America.
