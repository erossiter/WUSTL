SEN. ROCKEFELLER SPONSORS BILL TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE 17.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN MEDICARE PREMIUM
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has cosponsored legislation that would roll back most of the unprecedented 17.5 percent increase in seniors' Medicare Part B 2005 premiums.  
 The Keep the Promise of Medicare Act of 2005 would link the Part B premium increase to the yearly Social Security cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA). For example, in 2005, the premium increase would be only 2.7 percent. Seniors would save $9.80 a month and nearly $118 for the entire year.
   "West Virginia seniors are already struggling to balance medical payments, including the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, with their transportation, food, and home utility needs," said Rockefeller. "Burdening our seniors is not an acceptable option.
   "Never in the history of the Medicare program has the annual dollar increase in premiums been this great. Nearly 20 percent of this year's Part B premium increase will go toward payments to Medicare HMOs. But Medicare HMOs don't serve West Virginia, and West Virginia seniors should not bear the burden of paying for them."
   Medicare Part B covers supplemental medical insurance for doctor services, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equipment, and a number of other medical services and supplies. Part B is financed through a combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues. 
   Starting January 3, seniors across the country saw their monthly Medicare Part B premiums increase from $66.60 to $78.20. The Keep the Promise of Medicare Act would make the adjustment retroactive to the beginning of the year, so that the new lower premium would be in place for January and would continue throughout 2005.
