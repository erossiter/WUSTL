SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS AGAINST TAX BURDENING LOW-INCOME SENIORS
  In an effort to bring about fairness and equity for seniors who have to drain their life savings to qualify for Medicaid nursing home care, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) yesterday offered an amendment to a budget reconciliation bill to eliminate the "Medicaid estate tax." While wealthy Americans are allowed to shield up to $2 million in assets from federal taxes - the so-called "estate tax" - low-income Americans have no ability to protect their savings against high long-term care costs. They are required to impoverish themselves before they can receive the nursing home care they need. 
   "It's not fair," Rockefeller said of the gross inequity. "People talk about the death tax - I talk about the [Medicaid] estate tax. It is badgering to death, so to speak, people who are in nursing homes and have lost everything and have nothing except their houses." 
   Rockefeller's amendment in the Senate Finance Committee budget reconciliation hearing would have made Medicaid estate recovery optional. It also would have created a floor of protection against impoverishment for people with long nursing home stays - $20,000 in assets (excluding homes) for individuals and $40,000 for couples.
   Recognizing that the amendment would fail on a party-line vote because Republicans had voted down every amendment along party lines during the eight-hour hearing, Rockefeller pulled the amendment from a committee vote. But he vowed to continue to fight against this unfair tax against seniors and disabled Americans.
