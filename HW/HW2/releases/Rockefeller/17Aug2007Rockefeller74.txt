SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON COLGAN AIR'S DECISION TO CEASE OPERATIONS AT MERCER COUNTY AIRPORT
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) released the following statement regarding Colgan Air's recent decision to cease air operations out of Mercer County Airport effective November 12, 2007.  
   Senator Rockefeller, who serves as Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee on the Senate Commerce Committee, has been working on legislation that would increase funding for the Essential Air Service program - an important DOT subsidy that offsets the costs of providing air service to rural areas. 
   "Our local airports are important gateways to West Virginia, and reliable air service is critical to continued economic development. That's why the news that Colgan Air is ceasing operations at Mercer County Airport is disappointing. 
   "The lack of funding for the essential air service program over the last several years means more and more communities are losing their air service across the country. And, I know that the Airport Authority has worked hard over the last year to increase the number of passengers flying in and out of the airport even after the Department of Transportation terminated their essential air service subsidy. 
   "Moving forward, I remain committed to working with the airport and the community to make sure that Mercer County Airport remains connected to the national aviation system."
