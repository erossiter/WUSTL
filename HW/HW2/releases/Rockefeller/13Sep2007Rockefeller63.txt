SEN. ROCKEFELLER COMMENTS ON ASSAULT IN LOGAN COUNTY
  "As additional details emerge about this horrific case, I am even angrier and more disgusted that this terrible crime could happen to anyone in our state. It hurts me to my soul that a young West Virginian has suffered this appalling and awful sequence of events.
   "Even as our thoughts and prayers go first to the victim, I know the West Virginia way is to reach out in our communities and protect each other, and this will help to heal the wounds left by this vicious attack."
