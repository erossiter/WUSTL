  SEN. ROCKEFELLER STATEMENT ON THE LOSS OF THE MELVILLE MINERS 
   "Today, West Virginia endured another unthinkable tragedy. 
   "We have known tragedy before, but the heartbreak of the last few weeks has had an enormous impact on the lives of all West Virginians. 
   "My thoughts and prayers are with the Bragg and Hatfield families, and I know that the rest of the state and the country mourns with you. 
   "We are in pain, but we are also angry, and this anger will change the future of mining. 
   "I join Governor Manchin, and the rest of the delegation, in stating that these miners - the miners of Melville and Sago - will not have died in vain. 
   "We will spend every day making sure that there are new guidelines, new technology and new ways of doing things to protect miners in their workplace."
