SEN. ROCKEFELLER SAYS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE SHOULD INCLUDE VITAL FUNDING FOR STATES
  Today, Senator Rockefeller called on congressional leadership and the President to include $10-$15 billion in state fiscal relief in any economic stimulus package.  
   "As our economy slows, states are really beginning to feel the squeeze," Rockefeller said. "Just like in 2001, states are revising their budget forecasts to respond to the economic slowdown with substantial cuts to health care and education. However, unlike 2001 when property taxes held firm, local government revenues are now plummeting because of falling property tax revenues - which means that this economic downturn could have a much more dramatic impact on states than the past recession." 
   "Millions of working families depend on the health and education services provided by their state and local governments. We cannot afford to provide relief for multinational corporations without providing relief for the businesses in our own backyards - our state and local governments," Rockefeller stated. "Any economic stimulus package should include $10-$15 billion in temporary state fiscal relief, with half of the funding targeted to Medicaid." 
   In 2003, when states were facing similar budget deficits, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation authored by Senator Rockefeller to provide $20 billion in state fiscal relief over 18 months, with $10 billion going directly to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and $10 billion in targeted grants to states and local governments. 
   FMAP is the equation used to allocate money for the federal share of Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the states and the federal government. 
   Senator Rockefeller is Chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health.
