SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO GATE'S ORDER TO SEND 3200 MARINES TO AFGHANISTAN
  "While long overdue, it is a very welcome step that the Administration is finally showing a renewed focus on the resurgence of the Taliban and Al Qaida in Afghanistan. 
   "Afghanistan and its border with Pakistan is the region where terrorists have safe havens. Today, right this moment, they are expanding their operating zones there and training and planning to hit us and our allies again. Not maybe, not in the future - today they have safe havens and are increasing their strength.
   "This is where Al Qaida's senior leadership is. This is where the threat of terrorism comes from. 
   "This region is and has always been the 'central front' in our fight against terrorists. It is long past time that we put our eye back on the ball and focus our counter-terror strategy on Afghanistan and Pakistan."
