SEN. ROCKEFELLER PUSHES TO PRESERVE OHIO VALLEY STEEL INDUSTRY
  At the conclusion of a meeting today to discuss the future of the Northern Panhandle steel industry, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) said that he had a frank and productive conversation with Mittal Steel CEO, Louis Schorsch.  
   "Steel has helped to shape and build the communities of the Ohio Valley," said Rockefeller. "Following last month's decision by the Department of Justice it is time to make a real commitment to preserving the livelihood of West Virginia's steel industry and investing in our future." 
   "I encouraged Mittal to reinvest in Weirton and demonstrate that they believe in our workers and the contribution they can make," Rockefeller added. 
   Earlier this year, Mittal Steel entered into agreements with Esmark to sell the company's tin assets in Weirton. However, last month the Department of Justice decided, after its antitrust review of Mittal Steel's merger with Arcelor, that Mittal Steel would be required to sell its Sparrow's Point facility in Baltimore instead of Weirton Steel's mill. 
   Rockefeller has closely monitored the situation to ensure that the interests of steel workers and their families are paramount in any business decision. Rockefeller, the Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, has worked tirelessly to advocate for the needs of the Northern Panhandle steel industry.
