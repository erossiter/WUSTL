SEN. ROCKEFELLER CONGRATULATES LANE ON CONFIRMATION AS INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSIONER
 Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today congratulated fellow West Virginian Charlotte Lane on her confirmation as a Commissioner on the United States International Trade Commission (ITC).  
 Lane was appointed by President Bush in a recess appointment in August 2003. Because it was a recess appointment, her term was scheduled to expire at the end of the 108th Congress unless the Senate approved her nomination. At Rockefeller's urging, the Senate confirmed Commissioner Lane late Saturday night. 
   "I am pleased that Charlotte Lane was confirmed because I know that her broad perspective on government, law, and economics will serve the commission well," Rockefeller said.
   "I am confident that Charlotte will strictly enforce our trade laws at the ITC. The decisions made by this commission are critical to the success of basic manufacturing, and particularly the steel industry. 
   "The ITC has an important role to play in West Virginia's economic future and having Charlotte Lane on the commission will only benefit our citizens and our industries. I congratulate her on her confirmation." 
   In 2002, Rockefeller chaired a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Lane's nomination. Over the last few years, Rockefeller has directly intervened with his Senate colleagues to personally persuade them to move Lane's nomination.
