SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES $1.6 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR BRAXTON COUNTY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
  In a move that will save hundreds of existing jobs and create hundreds more, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today announced $1.6 million in United States Economic Development Authority (EDA) funding for the Flatwoods-Canoe water treatment and distribution systems. The water infrastructure improvements for a facility that is overworked are expected to spur industrial investment, including Weyerhauser's $30 million investment to its Oriented Strand Board (OSB) manufacturing facility. 
   That plant expansion will not only save the 400 existing jobs, but it could add 200 new wood harvesting supply jobs in the surrounding region. 
   Officials also expect the modernization project at Flatwoods-Canoe to generate 100 new commercial and educational-related positions.
   "This is extraordinary news for the people of Braxton County and the people of West Virginia," said Rockefeller. "This grant will help Braxton County meet its water needs and provide the infrastructure necessary to maintain jobs. 
   "Today represents a down payment on a bright future for the people of Braxton County and central West Virginia."
   The EDA grant represents half of what is needed for a $3.2 million upgrade to Braxton's County's water system. For the local match needed for the EDA project, Weyerhauser has already agreed to pay $700,000. 
   In October, Rockefeller led nine French wood companies and a sales representative from a Japanese homebuilding company on a statewide tour of West Virginia's wood products industry.
