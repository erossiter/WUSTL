SEN. ROCKEFELLER HELPS PRESERVE FUNDING FOR WEST VIRGINIA FIRST RESPONDERS
  In the face of an effort by some big-state Senators to reduce homeland security grant funding for West Virginia and other small states, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) cosponsored a successful amendment to the FY 06 Senate Homeland Security Appropriations bill to preserve the current formula funding. The amendment will mean that West Virginia first responders will receive $8 million more next year than the state would have under the big-state proposal.  
   The Senate passed the Homeland Security bill last night, with Rockefeller voting for the bill. 
   "The threats posed by al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups are real, and we have no way to accurately predict when or where they will attempt to attack us next," said Rockefeller. "We cannot not afford a reduction in our homeland security funding. In West Virginia, our first responders, police, and firemen need more resources, not fewer. They are the backbone of our emergency preparedness, and we need to do more to help them help us." 
   The amendment means that West Virginia and all other states will continue to receive either a base share of .55 percent of funds appropriated for state and local first responder programs or a base allocation derived from population and population density, with remaining funds distributed based on risk assessments. Under this formula, which was included in the Senate bill, West Virginia will receive approximately $10 million during FY 06. The proposal from big-state Senators would have reduced West Virginia's base share of the overall homeland security grant funding to .25 percent, leaving West Virginia first responders to divide less than $2 million. 
   Rockefeller also supported a number of other successful amendments in the bill that will improve West Virginia's homeland security, including: 
   * $52.6 million nationally for the U.S. Fire Administration
   * $50 million more nationwide for SAFER act grants to help communities hire additional firefighters and $20 million to improve interoperable communications. Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) introduced this amendment. 
   * Requiring localities throughout the country to use funds awarded through state and local grants, Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention grants, and Urban Area Security Initiative grants to be used according to each state's approved State Homeland Security Plan, as has been the policy of West Virginia since the first homeland security grants were made to states.
   * Requiring the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a formal survey of state and local emergency officials to assess federal agency performance, local need, and coordination efforts. The survey would enable adequate feedback from police, fire, medical, and emergency planners on the municipal, county, regional, and state levels.
   While he voted for the bill, Rockefeller also expressed concern that the Senate did not pass an amendment he cosponsored along with Senator Byrd to expand federal efforts to ensure rail and transit security by increasing federal funding in these areas by more than $1.4 billion. Another amendment that Rockefeller supported would have dramatically improved the safety of all Americans through the development of a Global Positioning System-based security system to monitor trucks that transport hazardous materials.
   "Particularly at a time when we are still vulnerable to terrorism, we need to do more to make sure that we are as prepared as we can be," said Rockefeller.
