SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO PRESIDENT BUSH SPEECH AT NSA
  "Congress is well aware of the threats facing this country, and that is why we tried to work with the Administration to update FISA to improve collection, while also protecting American's privacy rights.  
   "For over five years, the President carried out a warrantless surveillance program that ignored the law and the role of court oversight. 
   "Today, the President continues to seek unchecked surveillance powers that many of us in Congress cannot support. 
   "The fact is, the Protect America Act did provide authority for collection, but it did not include sufficient protections for Americans. There's no reason we can't do both. 
   "The Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, along with our House colleagues, have all undertaken an intensive review, on a bipartisan basis, of the collection problems identified by Director McConnell. 
   "We all understand that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act needs to be updated. But in that process we must maintain FISA's fundamental purpose - protecting the rights and liberties of Americans while allowing for legitimate intelligence collection. 
   "The President needs to step up to the plate and show that he is willing to work with Congress to get this important legislation passed. Political speeches deriding Democrats will not help get us closer to that goal."
