SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT NSA SURVEILLANCE WILL BE BROUGHT UNDER FISA
  "The announcement today is welcome news, but it is also confirmation that the Administration's go-it-alone approach, effectively excluding Congress and the courts and operating outside the law, was unnecessary.   
   "The President could have and should have worked with the Congress immediately following September 11, 2001, to fashion a surveillance program that was in compliance with all existing statutes.   
   "I intend to move forward with the committee's review of all aspects of this program's legality and effectiveness.   
   "Unfortunately, our efforts continue to be hampered by the Administration's unwillingness to provide the committee with relevant documents such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's orders, the Administration's legal briefs filed with the court, and the President's authorization orders.   
   "The President has decided that he will cooperate with the court to put this program on sounder legal footing. I encourage him also to cooperate with the Congress to build the broad support that our counterterrorism programs deserve."
