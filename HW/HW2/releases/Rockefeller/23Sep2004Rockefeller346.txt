SEN. ROCKEFELLER, SENATE COLLEAGUES CALL ON MAJORITY LEADER TO PROTECT $1.07 BILLION FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) demanded action from Senate leadership today to prevent $1 billion in Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funding from reverting back to the U.S. Treasury.  
 To save the money and help the 200,000 children who could lose coverage over the next three years, Congress must take action by September 30.  
   In a bi-partisan letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), Rockefeller, Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), Senator Lincoln Chaffee (R-RI), and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) urged passage of their Children's Health Protection and Improvement Act, which would preserve the money and target states with unmet funding needs. 
   "I call on the Republican Majority Leader and the Bush Administration to preserve the $1 billion in CHIP money so that we can continue to make basic health care available to America's neediest children," said Rockefeller. "We need this money because CHIP has greatly reduced the number of uninsured children in West Virginia and throughout the nation. Without this money, we will not be able to enroll every child who is eligible for CHIP. Nationwide, that means that 200,000 children over the next three years could lose coverage. The Senate must pass this bill in the next week." 
   In 1997, Rockefeller, authored the CHIP program with Senator Chafee's father, the late Senator John Chafee (R-RI). Last year, CHIP provided health insurance to 35,000 West Virginia children and 5.8 million children nationwide.
