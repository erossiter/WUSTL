SEN. ROCKEFELLER COAUTHORS COMPREHENSIVE AVIATION SECURITY BILL
  Continuing his efforts to improve the nation's aviation security, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) has co-authored bipartisan legislation aimed at strengthening commercial aviation security.  
   "Improving our nation's aviation security system is a continuous process," Rockefeller said. "Today's legislation will go a long way toward making air travel even safer by requiring the TSA to implement the outstanding 9-11 recommendations regarding the screening of 100 percent of cargo shipped on passenger aircraft, and addressing the unique security needs of the general aviation industry. Terrorists will always seek to exploit the weakest links of our transportation infrastructure - and we have a responsibility to close the remaining gaps in aviation security." 
   Senator Rockefeller, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security, joined with his colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to co-author S. 509, the Aviation Security Improvement Act. Some of the highlights of the bill include: 
   * Requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop and implement a system, similar to the one employed for checking passenger luggage, within three years to screen 100 percent of the cargo contained on commercial passenger aircraft; 
   * Remove the statutory cap on the number of TSA screening personnel that can be hired, and authorizes several new research-and-development programs to deal with emerging threats to aircraft; 
   * Establishes an Office of Appeals and Redress within the Department of Homeland Security for passengers who believe that they were unfairly detained or delayed as a result of the "no-fly" list or "Selectee" watch list; and, 
   * Requires security rules be put in place at overseas aircraft repair facilities to ensure the safety of the trans-continental flying public. 
   In addition to air cargo security, the bill also improves general aviation security by requiring the TSA to develop a standardized threat assessment program that could be used to award federal grant dollars to airports to fund security projects, such as new runway fencing, improving lighting and installing security systems. Also, the legislation requires foreign-registered general aviation aircraft to submit their passenger manifests to the TSA so they can be checked against appropriate watch lists - this is similar to a program already in place at many of the nation's major ports for cruise ships and foreign-flagged ships. 
   Senator Rockefeller was joined in co-authoring the legislation by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senators Daniel Inouye (D-HI) and Ted Steven (R-AK) respectively, and Senator Trent Lott (R-MS) Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security.
