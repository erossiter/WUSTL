SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANGRY THAT REPUBLICANS AGAIN BLOCK SENIORS FROM GETTING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY NEED UNDER NEW MEDICARE DRUG PLAN
  As part of the tax reconciliation bill, Senate Republicans tonight blocked an amendment that would have helped hundreds of low-income seniors victimized by the flawed Medicare prescription drug program. The amendment, offered by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL), included portions of Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV's Requiring Emergency Pharmaceutical Access for Individual Relief (REPAIR) Act (S.2183).  
   Today's vote marked the latest opportunity for bipartisan action to address a crisis that has been in the news for several weeks. But on every occasion, Republicans have consistently thwarted legislative efforts to fix this crisis. 
   "I simply don't understand why Republicans are turning their backs on people who cannot get the prescription drugs they need," said Rockefeller. "We had a chance today to make a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of seniors. But clearly, the heartbreaking stories we've heard over the last few weeks are not enough to sway Republicans to follow our lead and take action to fix this crisis."
   Today's amendment would have: 
   * Required all prescription drug plans to provide new enrollees with at least 30 days of prescription drugs during their transition to Medicare. 
   * Provided federal reimbursement for states, pharmacies, and beneficiaries for out-of-pocket costs because the Medicare prescription drug benefit has failed to cover their costs.
   * Extended the open enrollment period for six months to give beneficiaries more time to consider their options. 
   Rockefeller and other Senate Democrats had warned about an impending crisis for several years, particularly for low-income seniors and the disabled. As far back as 2003, when the Medicare drug bill was being debated, Rockefeller and other Senate Democrats fought to put safeguards in place for low-income seniors, but those efforts were rejected. Last year, Rockefeller introduced the Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription Drug Coverage Act to postpone the start of the transition for low-income seniors by six months to ensure prescription drug coverage for all Medicaid recipients. Every Republican in the Senate voted against this legislation. 
   Rockefeller even asked the President personally in 2003 to honor his pledge that all seniors, including the low-income seniors suffering now, would have access to their prescription drugs at all times.
