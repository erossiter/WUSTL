SEN. ROCKEFELLER PUSHES FOR AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR WEST VIRGINIA SENIORS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who has long fought to lower the cost of prescription drugs, today pushed for the Medicare prescription drug program to be able to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Sen. Rockefeller noted the importance of price negotiation for seniors, particularly those on fixed incomes.   
   "For the seniors in West Virginia, prescription drug affordability is not a political issue, it is an issue of survival," said Rockefeller. "And for many seniors in our state, especially those who struggle financially, Medicare's current prescription drug program is simply not meeting their needs." 
   Current Medicare law expressly prohibits the federal government from negotiating with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices, and Senator Rockefeller believes that the federal government should have the opportunity to get the best deal possible for seniors.  
   "The 43 million people who participate in the Medicare program depend on the federal government to seek the lowest prices possible and to get the most for their hard-earned dollars," Rockefeller said.  
   Senator Rockefeller, the new Chairman of the Finance Health Care Subcommittee, has been a long-time advocate of protecting seniors from high prescription drug costs. He believes that government price negotiation will be an important tool in reducing overall costs.  
   "Price negotiation has been enormously successful for the Department of Veterans Affairs and state Medicaid programs," said Rockefeller. "And if price negotiation can help to shield our seniors from the costs they struggle to pay, then we must do everything in our power to help them."
