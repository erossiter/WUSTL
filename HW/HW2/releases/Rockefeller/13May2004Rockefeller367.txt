SEN. ROCKEFELLER HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced this week that the Senate passed legislation that would make it easier for disabled children in West Virginia to access health care.  
 Under the Family Opportunity Act, Medicaid services would be extended to disabled children who qualify under federal standards for disability coverage, but whose family income currently exceeds the federal Medicaid income limits. The House of Representatives is considering similar legislation. 
   "The Family Opportunity Act makes health care more affordable for disabled children and their families," said Rockefeller, a cosponsor of the bill. "The current law effectively punishes working parents for their children's disabilities. Right now, in order for lower-income families to maintain Medicaid coverage for their disabled children, many parents are forced to make the unfair choice of either remaining in poverty or giving up caring for their children at home." 
   The Family Opportunity Act would provide families with disabled children the opportunity to purchase coverage under the Medicaid program. Medicaid offers more comprehensive benefits for less money than most private health plans. However, under current law, parents must take steps, like passing up promotions and raises, in order to keep their incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
   "The Senate's action could help more than 50,000 disabled children in West Virginia alone," Rockefeller added. "Many parents, even those who work more than one job, are struggling to meet the exceptional demands of raising a child with disabilities." 
   If signed into law, the Family Opportunity Act would provide disabled West Virginian children with comprehensive Medicaid coverage that includes physical therapy, mental health services, durable medical equipment, and respite care.
