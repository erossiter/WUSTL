SEN. ROCKEFELLER ENCOURAGED BY CREATION OF INDUSTRY GROUP TO FOCUS ON COAL AND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS
  Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV today said that he was encouraged by the creation of an industry group - representing 40 U.S. companies - who joined forces today to address the future of coal and climate change. The group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE) - includes national and West Virginia companies from electricity generation, transportation, coal production, energy technology, and equipment manufacturing. The companies announced today that they are committing themselves to support an integrated solution to climate change concerns, including potentially a mandatory cap and trade program. 
   Senator Rockefeller's statement is below:
   "Today's announcement by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE) is a strong and necessary step in the right direction. 
   "ACCCE's principles and mission statement make clear that this group of key stakeholders is serious about harnessing both the challenges and benefits of responsible climate change measures. These companies clearly recognize the importance of deploying technologies that will achieve long-term sustainability for clean coal, the nation's most abundant energy resource. And, they recognize the need to address economic concerns facing both citizens and elected officials in implementing carbon control strategies.
   "I think we have more talking to do, but I look forward to working with ACCCE, and members of Congress, to build consensus around responsible and viable climate legislation. I am confident that, together, we can craft legislation that will achieve the universal goals of protecting the environment and our economic prosperity."
