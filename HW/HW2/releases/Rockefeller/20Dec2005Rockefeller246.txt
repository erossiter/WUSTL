SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON NSA PROGRAM
  VICE CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER STATEMENT ON NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON NSA PROGRAM  
   "My 2003 letter to the Vice President speaks for itself. 
   "The real question is whether the Administration lived up to its statutory requirement to fully inform Congress and allow for adequate oversight and debate. 
   "The simple answer is no. 
   "From the first day I learned of this program, I made my concerns known to the Vice President and to others who were briefed. The White House never addressed my concerns. 
   "By prohibiting discussion of the program with any additional members of Congress or counsel, the White House took away all of the legislative remedies that would normally be available, even in a classified context. 
   "Now is the time for the Senate Intelligence Committee to conduct thorough, bipartisan hearings on the program and all of its implications."
