SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD
  Sen. Rockefeller's statement on the Resignation of defense Secretary Rumsfeld: 
   "Secretary Rumsfeld's war plans in Iraq have failed. The country is on a dangerous course, and the Administration has finally recognized the need for drastic, immediate change. 
   "The next Secretary of Defense will play a critical role in changing the course in Iraq, but will also have an enormous responsibility in addressing the global war on terror.  
   "Democrats stand ready to work with this Administration and its new leadership to begin to chart the right course.  
   "Robert Gates is a career intelligence and national security official. The president's choice may signal that he is searching for a realistic and pragmatic approach in Iraq and the war on terror, rather than continuing on a course driven by ideology."
