SEN. ROCKEFELLER WORKS TO IMPROVE AVIATION SECURITY
  A strong advocate for improving aviation security, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) won another legislative victory when the Senate Commerce Committee approved his bill, the Aviation Security Advancement Act.  
   "Improving aviation security is a continuous process, and much more work remains," said Rockefeller. "By standardizing our federal screeners, tightening our cargo security, strengthening our baggage screening system, and bolstering the Federal Air Marshal program, we will make it more difficult for terrorists to infiltrate our aviation system," said Rockefeller.
   The Aviation Security Advancement Act would strengthen aviation security by (1) requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop staffing standards for screeners so that passengers are not subjected to long delays; (2) increasing research funding for new technologies that can be used to screen cargo; (3) ensuring that newly-issued pilot licenses use new technologies to make them tamper-proof; and (4) establishing a process for persons that lease or charter aircraft to the public to be able to use government resources to quickly verify the identity of a user.
   In addition, the bill also increases funding for the Federal Air Marshal program and authorizes a $20 million biometric technology program for precise identification of passengers and workers.
   Recently, the 9/11 Commission announced its recommendation for cargo and air security improvements, many of which are addressed in the Rockefeller bill.
   The bill will now be considered in the full Senate and is expected to be widely-supported.

  Fact Sheet on Aviation Security Advancement Act (ASAA)
   Purpose: ASAA seeks to improve on the current system of aviation security and increase the efficiency of air travel by closing loopholes that continue to exist regarding security staffing, cargo security, baggage screening, and airport perimeter security. 
   To accomplish this, the bill proposes:
   * The Development of Screener Staffing Standards B Standardizes the Federal screener workforce to properly address staffing needs and promote more efficient and effective screening at airports. Requires TSA to develop standards based on the appropriate level of security with an average of ten minutes per passenger screening with an independent analysis of the proposal. 
   * Integrating Airport Workforces and Aviation Security B Requires Department of Homeland Security to consider coordinating aviation security related functions to improve efficiency and effectiveness of passenger screening. 
   * Tightening Air Cargo Security B Increases funding for all-cargo aviation security to establish an enhanced security program and to promote the use of improved technology for cargo screening. To do so, the bill authorizes $600 million for FYs 2005-07 to fund cargo security initiatives, and creates a Next-Generation Cargo Security Grant program authorized at $300 million through FY07 to fund research and development (R&D) and deployment of advanced technology. 
   * Providing Additional Funding for LOIs B Authorizes $450 million for FY 2005-07 to provide long-term funding (letters of intent B LOIs) to fund priority capital security projects at airports. 
  * Increasing the Efficiency of Baggage Screening B Develops a streamlined baggage screening system by requiring a schedule for the in-line placement of Explosive Detection Systems (EDS), and provides more funding for screening technology R&D by authorizing $350 million to fund next-generation EDS, and portal detection systems technology. The bill establishes a pilot program at ten airports to test portal detection systems and requires bi-annual reports to Congress on the status implementing this advanced technology. 
   * Bolstering the Federal Air Marshal (FAM) Program B Authorizes increased funding to allow the FAM program to be funded at up to $700 million, and studies cross-training proposals for the FAM workforce. 
   * Strengthening Information Sharing B Encourages DHS to improve intelligence information sharing with state and local entities by implementing GAO recommendations. 
   * Improving Passenger Screening B Advances the development of biometric technology for precise identification of workers and travelers, and improves perimeter security at airports by authorizing more than $20 million for TSA to develop biometric technology and fund a biometric center of excellence. 
  * Fortifying Airport Perimeter Security B Authorizes $100 million to pursue technological and other improvements to strengthen perimeter security and control airport access. 
  * Improves General Aviation Security B Mandates that FAA develop new pilot licenses so that newly issued pilot licenses must be tamper resistant and have photo and biometric identifiers. The bill also provides aircraft charter and leasing operators the ability to cross-check suspect passengers against TSA watch lists while requiring that privacy protections be instituted.
