SEN. ROCKEFELLER DISCUSSES EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY AT WEBSTER COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL
  Senator Jay Rockefeller today visited students and teachers at Webster County High School to discuss the importance of education technology. His visit came following the President's proposal to eliminate Education Technology State Grants - which fund hardware and software for schools - in his budget.  
   "I love walking into classrooms or computer labs like the one here in Webster County, and seeing young people absolutely enthralled by what they're learning online," Rockefeller said. "Technology promises our students endless possibilities and unique opportunities to learn. And that's why we must make sure our young people have the tools they need. It isn't just about textbooks and chalkboards anymore - it's about giving them the high-tech tools they need to learn, to grow and to succeed."
   Rockefeller is a long-time supporter of technology in the classroom. Twelve years ago, he authored the E-Rate program - which has provided West Virginia schools and libraries with nearly $90 million over the last decade to help pay for the cost of wiring to the Internet.
