SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO IRAQ NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT; SAYS U.S. SHOULD FOCUS ON AL QAIDA, NOT IRAQ CIVIL WAR
  "The national intelligence assessment confirms what we feared the most: the U.S. has become deeply embroiled in Iraq's civil war.  
   "At every stage, the President has made promises that deeper involvement in Iraq would bring about greater security. In reality, we've bogged ourselves down and allowed Al Qaida to flourish in the region. 
   "The question we need to be asking ourselves is, what is in the best interest of the United States? Is it a mission that focuses on eliminating Al Qaida first? Or is it pouring the majority of our resources - both human and financial - into policing Iraq's civil war? 
   "As most Americans now understand, our soldiers can provide temporary security in certain areas, at great cost, but they cannot solve Iraq's internal political, societal, and religious disputes. 
   "The course we take over the next year and half will greatly impact the national security of the United States. The President has to start making the tough decisions, and if he does not, then Congress should force his hand."
