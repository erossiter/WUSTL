SEN. ROCKEFELLER VOTES FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROTECTING AMERICAN FLAG
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today voted for a constitutional amendment that would have empowered Congress to ban the desecration one of our country's most sacred symbols. Rockefeller sponsored the amendment. 
   With a constitutional amendment needing two-thirds of the Senate (67 votes) to pass, the amendment failed when it received only 66 votes. The final vote was 66-34.
   "Throughout the history of our country, our flag has given the brave men and women serving in uniform the strength to persevere and protect the freedoms that are a foundation of our way of life," said Rockefeller. "We owe them - and we owe all Americans - an amendment that would guarantee the preservation of the honor, integrity, and history represented in that flag.
   "That's why I supported the constitutional amendment to ban the desecration of the American flag. I am - and will always be - strongly opposed to demonstrations at the funerals of members of our Armed Forces. I also strongly support - and always will - the criminalizing of anyone so callous to undertake such an action.
   "But today, we were forced to make a choice. In the past, we have tried to enact a federal law to protect the flag, but courts have struck them down. By attempting to make this a constitutional amendment, we were trying to take the first step to truly protect our flag."
