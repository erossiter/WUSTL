SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON CIA DECISION TO DESTROY TAPES OF EARLY DETAINEE INTERROGATIONS
  "Our Committee must review the full history and chronology of the tapes, how they were used and the reasons for destroying them, and any communication about them that was provided to the courts and Congress.  
   "While we were provided with very limited information about the existence of the tapes, we were not consulted on their usage nor the decision to destroy the tapes. And, we did not learn until much later, November 2006 - 2 months after the full committee was briefed on the program - that the tapes had in fact been destroyed in 2005. 
   "The Senate Intelligence Committee will continue its through examination of the CIA's detention, interrogation and rendition program, and we are determined to answer all relevant questions about the legality and effectiveness of the Administration's actions."
