SENS. ROCKEFELLER, BYRD URGE SENATE TO PASS MINE SAFETY LEGISLATION THIS WEEK
  Following another mine tragedy over the weekend - this one killing five miners in Harlan County, Kentucky - Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Sen. Robert C. Byrd (both D-WV) are pressing hard to make sure that Congress expedites comprehensive, bipartisan mine safety legislation currently pending before both houses of Congress. Sens. Rockefeller, Byrd, and several other Senators last week introduced the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act, which represents the most groundbreaking development in mine safety legislation in a generation. Among other things, the MINER Act calls for miners to carry double the amount of oxygen they now carry and calls for mines to situate pre-positioned oxygen supplies throughout the mine.
   "Obviously we're still learning the details of this tragedy, but one thing that seems to be clear is that several of the miners who died needed more breathable air," said Rockefeller. "I can't guarantee that if the MINER Act were enacted, the miners would have lived, but I believe that they would have had a much greater chance." 
   "Each day that goes by without mine safety solutions enacted into law is another day when miners' lives are at risk. This weekend's tragedy at the Harlan County mine underlines that very real truth. The MINER Act is a major step toward saving lives and preventing future tragedies. The Congress ought to pass this legislation now, and not let more lives be put at risk because of a broken safety regimen in our coal mines," Byrd said.
   The MINER Act, which passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee last week by a 20-0 vote, reflects new agreements between mine workers and industry officials on a number of issues critical to mine safety. The bill requires each miner to have at least 2 hours of breathable air and additional stores of self-rescuers every 30 minutes along escape routes, as well as at the working face of the mine. The bill also requires coal operators to submit plans detailing their mine's use of the most current communications, tracking, and breathing apparatus technologies - and they must, upon acceptance of their new safety evacuation plans, continue to introduce and use the best technology that works in their mines. Within three years, all mines would have state-of-the-art two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place. 
   The bill also demands a quicker incident notification, more local rescue teams, stricter fines, and tougher fine enforcement. 
   "The time for talk is over. It is time for the federal government to get serious about mine safety. This MINER Act will save lives. Coal mining families shouldn't worry whether, when their loved ones go to work, those miners will come home again at the end of that shift," Byrd stated. "There is a moral imperative to send this legislation to the President's desk right now."
   "How many accidents have to occur before we pass comprehensive mine safety legislation?" Rockefeller said. "We need to move quickly to pass this legislation before we go into the Memorial Day recess. As we've seen this weekend, any delay jeopardizes the lives of our miners."
   Rockefeller and Byrd are working with the Republican Senate Leadership, including Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate's Majority Whip, to urge that the MINER Act be a priority in the next few days before the Senate recesses for Memorial Day. 
   In the House of Representatives, Representatives Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Nick J. Rahall (D-WV), and Allan Mollohan (D-WV) introduced the MINER Act on Friday, and the West Virginia Senators have praised their efforts on leading the charge for mine safety in the House.
   A 1-page summary of the MINER Act follows.
   THE MINER (MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE) ACT 
   BREATHABLE AIR: Miners will have more emergency breathing devices to help them survive a disaster. The bill:
   * Requires each miner to have at least 2 hours of breathable air and stores of breathing devices every 30 minutes along escape routes for miners trying to evacuate.
   * Emergency supplies will be carefully monitored for reliability.
   BETTER COMMUNICATIONS AND TRACKING: State-of-the-art technology. The bill:
   * States that all mines will have state-of-the-art two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place, as soon as technologically feasible, but not later than three years from enactment.
   BETTER RESCUE EFFORTS: Mine rescue team response will be faster and better. The bill: 
   * Requires rescue teams to be located close to the mines they cover and be familiar with those mines.
   * Includes special provisions for small mines that are realistic, but also provide a higher level of protection for their miners than under current law.
   * Clarifies that neither rescue team members nor their employers are liable for any injuries or deaths that occur as a result of rescue activities.
   STEEPER FINES: The Secretary will have new enforcement powers. The bill: 
   * Sets substantial new minimum penalties for serious violations.
   * Gives the Secretary clear authority to shut down a mine for noncompliance with Department orders.
   ENCOURAGES NEW INSPECTORS: The bill encourages technological advances and a new generation of skilled miners and safety inspectors. The bill:
   * Focuses the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s mine safety activities and creates an interagency working group to facilitate development of new technologies.
   * Directs expert study on belt-air and flammability of belts and field tests of refuge chambers.
   * Creates a grant program to improve safety training.
   * Creates a scholarship program to increase the skilled workforce for mining operations, the inspector corps, and more safety research for institutions of higher learning.
    ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BILL: 
   All mines will have flame resistant lifelines to guide miners out in an emergency.
   Seals for abandoned sections of mines will be stronger. Within 18 months, the Secretary must issue a higher standard for sealing off abandoned areas of mines to prevent dangerous explosions.
