SEN. ROCKEFELLER INTRODUCES STRENGTHENING AMERICA'S TRADE LAWS ACT OF 2007
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller this week introduced comprehensive new trade legislation to help level the playing field for American manufacturers and to crack down on unfair foreign trade practices.  
   "American workers can compete with anyone in the world when it's a fair fight. Our domestic and international trade laws were set up to establish a level playing field, but unfortunately some of our trading partners have repeatedly found ways to circumvent these laws in order to gain an unfair advantage in trade with the United States," Rockefeller said. 
   "In West Virginia alone, well over 10,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2001. My legislation will close some of the existing loopholes in our trade laws and give our businesses and workers a fair chance to compete," Rockefeller added. 
   The Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act will (1) bolster the U.S. position in World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes and give Congress more authority to respond to adverse WTO decisions; (2) tighten restrictions on unfair trade practices such as "dumping" goods at below-market prices on the U.S. market and subsidizing exports to the United States; (3) expand the reach of countervailing duties to include countering China's currency manipulation, and also to push the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate the end of unfair treatment of tax rebates that put U.S. producers at a disadvantage; and (4) make the International Trade Commission's recommended remedies the final word in cases regarding surges of imports from China, by removing the President's discretion to ignore these recommendations, as President Bush did in a recent steel import case. 
   Senator Rockefeller reiterated his commitment to American workers, "We must do everything we can to level the playing field for West Virginians and all Americans whose livelihoods are endangered by unfair foreign trade practices."
