SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PROBLEMS AT BECKLEY VAMC
  Following a story that was broadcast yesterday on West Virginia Public Radio regarding the state of veterans' care in West Virginia, Sen. Jay Rockefeller has issued the following statement.  
   The segment on VA healthcare was produced by reporter Suzanne Higgins who hosts the public radio program, "Aging with Grace & Dignity." The following is a link to the 1-hour broadcast: http://www.wvpubcast.org/av/wg&dapr.mp3 
   "The problems at the Beckley VAMC have been a concern of mine for some time. The chronic understaffing and low morale has created difficult working conditions for the doctors, nurses and physician assistants. These clinicians are doing everything they can to meet their veteran patient needs, but they are under enormous strain, and have been for far too long. It's past time to fix the problems. 
   "I have asked Secretary Nicolson to review the staffing levels at the hospital, and I will do so again. The Secretary must be given accurate information about the chronic vacancies and plummeting morale, and I believe an independent review is the only way to get to the bottom of it. 
   "We have an absolute and total moral obligation to our veterans. We must make sure that all of our VA facilities have adequate resources and personnel to meet veterans' needs. And, we must make sure our veteran providers are given the resources they need to do their jobs. To do any less is a dishonor to their service."
