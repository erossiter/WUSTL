SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES $394,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR JACKSON COUNTY AIRPORT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced today that the Jackson County Airport in Ravenswood will receive $394,410 in federal funding through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These grants will enable the airport to acquire snow removal equipment, expand its snow removal equipment building, construct a fuel farm, rehabilitate airport beacons, and update the airport master plan study.  
   "Airports are gateways for new businesses and new jobs," said Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee. "That's why I've fought throughout my Senate career for improvements to our local airports in West Virginia. 
   "This grant will enable the Jackson County Airport to repair its runway and make other necessary upgrades, making air travel safer for our residents and visitors. With the $394,000, the airport can begin to make much needed improvements immediately." 
   The airport's grant was awarded through the Air Improvement Program (AIP), which provides significant funding to local airports, helping them modernize the air traffic control system and expand airport runways and other facilities. Senator Rockefeller was instrumental in securing a substantial increase in the AIP reauthorization in 2003 as part of the VISION 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act.
