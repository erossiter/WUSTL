SEN. ROCKEFELLER, WIFE ANNOUNCE MARRIAGE OF JUSTIN ROCKEFELLER TO INDR? VENGRIS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller and his wife Sharon announce the marriage of their son Justin to Indré Vengris, daughter of Vitolis and Virginia Vengris of Washington, DC. The wedding took place on Saturday, September 9 at the Rockefellers' Washington, DC home. 
   "This is an enormously exciting time for us. We are so proud of Justin and are so glad that Indré is now a part of our family," said Senator and Mrs. Rockefeller. 
   Justin, who was born during Senator Rockefeller's first gubernatorial term, is the co-founder and National Program Director of Generation Engage, a nonpartisan, youth-civic-engagement initiative that attempts to bridge the disparity between the political advantages and access college students enjoy over non-college students.
   Indré is a ballerina. She has performed with professional ballet companies throughout North America and Europe. 
   Justin and Indré met as students at Princeton University. They will reside in New York City.
