SEN. ROCKEFELLER TO ADMINISTRATION: FIX ALL PROBLEMS AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER
  In the wake of last week's reporting by the Washington Post and others, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) urged the Defense Department to address the dismal conditions of out-patient facilities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and to end the needless bureaucratic delays transitioning from DoD to VA medical care.  
   Rockefeller wrote to David Chu, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Military Readiness asking for immediate steps to be taken to repair dilapidated out-patient housing provided to soldiers and their families. He also questioned the transition process for patients from DoD to VA medical care after reports of lost paperwork and personnel files. Finally, Senator Rockefeller criticized Undersecretary Chu for not being candid about the problems facing wounded soldiers during his presentation to the Veterans Affairs Committee hearing last month. 
   "I often meet with West Virginia's veterans to get an unvarnished, from-the-trenches-report of how the VA is helping to meet their needs. Bureaucratic redundancies are just some of the problems they face, along with long-waits to see a doctor or proposals that would increase co-payments," Rockefeller said. "For years, I've shared these concerns with the Pentagon, VA and the Administration, and the response I always receive is we're working on it." 
   "I'm not satisfied with the Pentagon's efforts to address these problems," Rockefeller said, "There is no more important moral obligation than to meet the needs of those who have served so bravely."
