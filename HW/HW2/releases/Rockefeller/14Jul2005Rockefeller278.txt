SEN. ROCKEFELLER PROMOTES GREEN CHEMISTRY
  In an attempt to combine science with good environmental practices, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has introduced the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act. The bill would provide $33 million in research money next year to develop chemical and engineering processes that reduce threats to our air and water. Backed by West Virginia chemical companies, including DuPont, the bill could also provide resources for research programs at West Virginia University and Marshall University. 
   "Green chemistry is not just one of those catchy phrases we sometimes use in Congress to get people to pay attention," said Rockefeller. "Green chemistry is the future. Funding research at our universities and federal agencies to create more environmentally-responsible chemical processes will mean that companies can provide the products our nation wants in ways that are safer for our residents." 
   Rockefeller's legislation would establish a Green Chemistry Research and Development Program under a federal inter-agency working group to promote future research about green chemistry applications, including the use of non-toxic chemical technology. The working group would include the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   The program would also promote partnerships between universities, industry and nonprofit organizations, as well as support research and development at federal laboratories. The legislation would authorize merit-based competitive grants for green chemistry curriculum development. West Virginia University and Marshall could be beneficiaries of these grants. 
   The bill has been endorsed by a number of chemical companies, including DuPont. The American Chemical Society has also endorsed the bill.
