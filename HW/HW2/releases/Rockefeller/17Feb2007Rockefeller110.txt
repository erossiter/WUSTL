SEN. ROCKEFELLER VOTES IN SUPPORT OF RESOLUTION OPPOSING BUSH'S TROOP SURGE PLAN
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement today following a vote by the U.S. Senate that would have allowed for further debate on a resolution opposing the President's plan to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq. A bipartisan majority of Senators (56-34) voted to proceed, yet Republicans blocked the Senate from pursuing further debate. Yesterday, the House of Representatives strongly approved a similar resolution objecting to the President's plan by a vote of 246-182.  
   The following is Senator Rockefeller's statement: 
   "Every member of the House and Senate supports our troops and is committed to ensuring that the troops have the resources they need to continue their courageous work. 
   "However, the role of Congress must be to insist that the President begin to change his failed policy in Iraq by handing the country back to the Iraqis and beginning to bring our troops home. 
   "The American people have asked for us to take a stand when we believe the President is taking the country in the wrong direction. It is time for a clear up or down vote on the simple question: do you support the President's escalation in Iraq or not? 
   "The problems in Iraq require political solutions, not military escalation. Sending in more soldiers will only make it more difficult to establish a lasting peace and will do further harm to our efforts on the larger war on terror. It is time to change course."
