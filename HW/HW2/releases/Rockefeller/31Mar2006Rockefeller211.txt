SEN. ROCKEFELLER RECOVERING FROM SUCCESSFUL BACK SURGERY
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller said today that he is recovering from successful back surgery last week, but that the surgery was more extensive than expected and will require a longer recovery than anticipated. 
   The surgery was to repair a fused disk from a previous operation when the Senator was 27-years old. During last week's operation, his doctors found that the previously fused disk had put additional pressure on the surrounding disks in his back, and that it was best to repair those surrounding disks as well. As a result, the doctors told Senator Rockefeller that he will need to rest his back for 2-3 months before he can resume his normal schedule.
   "I am anxious to get back to work, both in the Senate and at home in West Virginia, but my doctors have urged me to be realistic and carefully give my back time to heal," Rockefeller said. "My recovery is going to take longer than I planned for, but I should be able to do a good deal of my work from home, and that's a big relief."
   Senator Rockefeller has already started working with a physical therapist to help facilitate a speedy recovery.
   "I want to thank all West Virginians who have extended their get well wishes - I'm very grateful for your kind words of support," Rockefeller said.
