SEN. ROCKEFELLER TOURS WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL WITH WEST VIRGINIA VETERANS
  Sharing a solemn moment with World War II veterans from West Virginia, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) accompanied about 100 veterans and their families on a tour of the new World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Monday. The trip was sponsored by the Benwood American Legion and included veterans from around the Mountain State's northern panhandle.
   "Seeing the World War II Memorial was an incredibly special moment for these veterans and their families, and I am honored that I had the opportunity to share it with them," Rockefeller said. "Finally, there is a permanent and public acknowledgement of the bravery shown by the 16 million men and women who fought in World War II, including the 400,000 Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country. About 234,000 West Virginians served in World War II, and they deserve this national tribute."
   After a 20 year fight to have it built, the World War II Memorial was dedicated on May 29, 2004.
   During World War II, 36 percent of the West Virginia's male population served in the war. It was the fourth highest participation rate in the country.
