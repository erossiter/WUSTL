WEST VIRGINIA VETERANS, RESERVISTS SET TO GET ADDED TAX RELIEF
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today announced the U.S. Senate has given final approval to a measure that will help West Virginia's veterans and National Guard and Reservists keep extra money in their pockets.
   "Recognizing the financial strains placed on many veterans, Guard and Reserve families, the Congress took action to provide these heroes with important tax relief," Rockefeller said. 
   The Senate by unanimous voice vote approved the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act which will provide $1.2 billion in tax relief to benefit veterans and military families nationwide. The bill includes tax cuts for members of the military who are receiving combat pay, saving for retirement or trying to purchase a home. It also provides benefits for employers of military reservists and for members of the National Guard who provide assistance to an employee's family when they are called to active duty. The tax incentives will being to take effect next year.
   "The tax relief in this bill will go a long way to helping veterans and the families of West Virginia's National Guard and Reservists save for the future, continue to make their mortgage payments on time, or plan for their children's higher education. Moreover, we've made it even easier for an employer to continue to offer the family of a deployed employee their salary so they can continue to make ends meet," Rockefeller said. "These are enormously important changes for West Virginians who are so bravely serving our nation in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan."
   Highlights of the bill include:
   FOR ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVISTS
   * A permanent allowance for soldiers to count their non-taxable combat pay when figuring their eligibility for the earned income tax credit (EITC). The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit that puts cash in the hands of low-income working individuals and families.
   * The ability for active duty troops to withdraw money from retirement plans, and an allowance of two years to replace the funds without tax penalty.
   * A provision for a soldier's basic housing allowance to be excluded when their income status is being determined for purposes of a developer's eligibility for low-income housing credits and tax exempt bonds.
   * The ability for families of Reservists killed in the line of duty to collect life insurance and other benefits provided by the civilian employer.
   * The ability for families of soldiers killed in the line of duty to contribute up to 100 percent of survivor benefits to retirement savings accounts or to education savings accounts.
   FOR EMPLOYERS
   * A tax cut for small businesses when they continue paying some salary to members of the National Guard and Reserve who are called to duty.
   * An end to cumbersome rules for reporting of income when companies continue paying some salary to members of the National Guard and Reserve who are called to duty. This makes it easier for reservists to file their taxes and simpler for employers to keep contributing to those employees' retirement plans.
   FOR VETERANS
   * Extension of a provision that gives retired veterans more time to claim a tax refund on some types of disability benefit payments.
   * Authority for the IRS to treat gifts of thanks from states to veterans--such as payments of excess state revenue--as nontaxable gifts.
   * A permanent allowance for all veterans to use qualified mortgage bonds to purchase their homes.
   The bill now goes to the House of Representatives for its approval. A similar version of the legislation passed earlier this year by a unanimous vote. Once passed by the House, it will go to President Bush for his signature.
   Senator Rockefeller is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee which drafted the bill that passed last night.
