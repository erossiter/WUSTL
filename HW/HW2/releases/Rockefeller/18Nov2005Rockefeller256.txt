SEN. ROCKEFELLER WINS VICTORY ON PROTECTING U.S. TRADE LAWS
  With World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations set to begin in the next few weeks, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) sponsored a successful Sense of the Senate resolution that makes it clear that the Bush Administration must preserve U.S. trade laws. 
   Up until this point, the administration has shown little willingness to challenge other nation's plans to press for a relaxation of U.S. laws on anti-dumping and countervailing duties. These duties protect domestic producers, such as West Virginia steelmakers and other manufacturers, from unfair trade practices. 
   "I hope the administration hears us loud and clear," said Rockefeller. "The U.S. Senate is saying tonight that any Doha agreement that diminishes our trade laws in any way is unacceptable. 
   "America's trade laws were put in place to make sure that our domestic industries can fully compete on fair terms. Our trade laws help keep the playing field between domestic and international businesses, so that we can keep companies and jobs in our country. Not having these trade laws fully enforced spells trouble for American businesses."
   The vote on Rockefeller's amendment came as part of the Tax Reconciliation Bill. The Doha round of trade negotiations begins in December in Hong Kong.
