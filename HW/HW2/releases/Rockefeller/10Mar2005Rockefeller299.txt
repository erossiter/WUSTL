SENS. BAUCUS, ROCKEFELLER APPLAUD SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE'S OPPOSITION TO UNDERMINING MEDICAID, SHIFTING ADDITIONAL COSTS TO STATES
  After the Senate Budget Committee today agreed to an amendment underscoring the importance of Medicaid and opposing reconciliation instructions that would undermine or cap Medicaid, Sen.  
 Max Baucus (D-MT), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), Chair of the Democratic Working Group on Medicaid and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Health Care, issued the following statement: 
   "Cuts and spending caps would deal a devastating blow to the Medicaid program, which provides coverage for our nation's most vulnerable citizens - pregnant women, children, our seniors, and people with disabilities - and supports the doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes that comprise our health care safety-net. 
   "We applaud the leadership demonstrated by Senators Corzine, Wyden, Murray and Conrad in their support of this amendment to underscore Medicaid's importance to members of the Senate. We are also heartened by its bipartisan acceptance. It is clear that the Senate Republican leadership also recognizes the detrimental effect the President's budget cuts would have on states and their Medicaid programs. 
   "Today's vote gives us hope that Republicans will work with us to pass a stronger Medicaid amendment to the budget resolution on the Senate floor next week. Together, we will do everything possible to preserve and strengthen this vital program."
