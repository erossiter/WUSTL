SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HARRISON/MARION REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced today that the Harrison/Marion Regional Airport in Clarksburg will receive $3 million in federal funding through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These grants will enable the airport to make improvements to its runway safety area.  
   "Airports are essentially gateways for new businesses and new jobs," said Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee. "That's why I've fought throughout my Senate career for improvements to our local airports in West Virginia. 
   "This grant will enable the Fairmont Municipal Airport to repair its runway and make other necessary upgrades, making air travel safer for our residents and visitors. With the $3 million, the airport can begin to make much needed improvements immediately." 
   The airport's grant was awarded through the Air Improvement Program (AIP), which provides significant funding to local airports, helping them modernize the air traffic control system and expand airport runways and other facilities. Senator Rockefeller was instrumental in securing a substantial increase in the AIP reauthorization in 2003 as part of the VISION 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act.
