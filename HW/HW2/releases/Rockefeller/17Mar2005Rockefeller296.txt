SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS ADMINISTRATION'S DRASTIC MEDICAID CUTS
  In a major victory for the nation's most vulnerable citizens, medical providers, and state governments already saddled with enormous Medicaid burdens, the U.S. Senate today passed a bipartisan budget amendment supported by Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) that would restore $15 billion in Medicaid cuts proposed by the Bush Administration. The passage of the amendment was the culmination of weeks of campaigning by Senators, Governors, and health care advocates who argued that these cuts would unfairly shift Medicaid costs to states, resulting in a serious undermining of their health care delivery systems. 
   "Today's vote represents a great victory not just for our children, our elderly, and our disabled, but also the thousands of hospitals, doctors, and nursing homes who care for our most vulnerable citizens," said Rockefeller, who leads the Senate Democratic Working Group on Medicaid.
   "Medicaid is the bedrock of our nation's health care system, and $15 billion in cuts would have dealt a devastating blow to this safety net. Passage of this amendment is an important step forward in preserving access to the most basic health care services for the most vulnerable in our society. This is an issue that cuts across party lines." 
   The House of Representatives is expected to take up debate on a budget resolution today. 
   If the Senate amendment is not agreed to by the House of Representatives, West Virginia could lose as much as $100 million in federal Medicaid matching funds in the next year alone. 
   In addition to striking the $15 billion in Medicaid cuts, the Senate amendment will establish a bipartisan commission to study Medicaid and make recommendations on how to strengthen the program for the future.
