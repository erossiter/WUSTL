SEN. ROCKEFELLER LEADS FIGHT FOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Sen.  
 Mike DeWine (R-OH), joined by a bi-partisan group of 43 Senators, today called for the passage of a number of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety initiatives. The safety standards that Sen. Rockefeller and Sen. DeWine called for include vehicle rollover prevention, side-impact crash protection, occupant ejection prevention, vehicle-to-vehicle crash compatibility, 15-passenger van safety, child safety measures, and improved consumer access to safety information.  
   The provisions are contained in the SAFE-TEA bill, which has passed both the House and the Senate and is now set to be considered by a conference committee to iron out differences in each chamber's bill.   
   "As the highway bill is considered by the Conference Committee, we need to make sure that these vehicle standards are included in the final bill," said Rockefeller. "Our letter highlights the need to include these so that West Virginians and all Americans are safer as they travel on our roads and highways. Lives depend on the passage of these standards."  
   Last year, 42,643 people nationwide and 394 West Virginians died in highway accidents. For Americans aged 1 to 34, traffic fatalities remain the leading cause of death. Senator Rockefeller has been a long-time advocate of vehicle safety. He also has worked to give states the resources necessary to improve safety on their roads.  
   A number of consumer safety groups also support the standards, including the American Public Health Association, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Police Foundation, and Public Citizen.
