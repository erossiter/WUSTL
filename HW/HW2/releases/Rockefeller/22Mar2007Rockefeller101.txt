SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'S NEW FINE STRUCTURE
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement today after the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) issued its final rule on civil penalties.  
   "When Congress passed the MINER Act last year, we sent MSHA a strong message - the status quo will no longer be tolerated, especially when it comes to holding mine operators financially accountable for violations. MSHA's ruling today demonstrates that they're willing to implement the stronger tools that Congress gave them, but the jury is still out on whether they're willing to enforce them. 
   "Stiffer penalties and fines have proven to be an effective tool to protect our coal miners and provide them with the safest working conditions available. 
   "MSHA must now demonstrate that it has the resolve to not only assess, but collect these penalties. To do any less would undermine the dedicated work of their inspectors. 
   "We will be watching MSHA very closely to ensure that they aggressively use their enforcement tools, especially the authority to go after patterns of violations and unsafe company practices."
