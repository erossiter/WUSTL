SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES $93,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR YEAGER AIRPORT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced today that Charleston's Yeager Airport will receive $93,799 in federal funding through a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grant.  
   "This grant will enable the airport to undergo the necessary environmental permitting that is part of the relocation of Taxiway A," said Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee. 
   "As I've always said, airports are essentially gateways for new businesses and new jobs. That's why it's important that we secure the resources that our airports need. Better airports mean better results for our state's economy." 
   The airport's grant was awarded through the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which provides significant funding to local airports, helping them modernize the air traffic control system and expand airport runways and other facilities. Senator Rockefeller was instrumental in securing a substantial increase in the AIP reauthorization in 2003 as part of the VISION 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act.
