SEN. ROCKEFELLER EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER IRAQ MISREPRESENTATIONS, STRESSES NEED TO DECLASSIFY NIE
  Out of growing concern that the Bush Administration continues to misrepresent intelligence, Vice Chairman Rockefeller today sent a letter to President Bush asking that he accurately reflect the gravity and importance of the recent NIE on Iraq.  
 In the letter, Sen. Rockefeller reminds President Bush that the NIE represents the intelligence community's best judgment on the most-likely scenarios, not possible or hypothetical scenarios. Just today, President Bush referred to the NIE as a "report that talks about possibilities, not probabilities.

   Additionally, Senator Rockefeller was joined by all of his Democratic colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee in calling on Acting Director John McLaughlin to publicly declassify the NIE so the American people can judge for themselves the magnitude of the problems we are facing in Iraq.
