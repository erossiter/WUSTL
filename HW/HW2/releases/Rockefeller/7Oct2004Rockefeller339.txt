SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS SENATE PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL A MONUMENTAL FORCE IN IMPROVING NATIONAL SECURITY
  Last evening, the United States Senate passed the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, legislation that will overhaul the nation's intelligence structure by creating a National Intelligence Director and streamlining the operations of 15 separate intelligence agencies. The bill is the most comprehensive reform of the intelligence community since the National Security Act of 1947 established the Central Intelligence Agency and many of our current intelligence practices.  
   "There is no question that our intelligence structure was in desperate need of reform. After years of study and months of debate, today the Senate put its stamp of approval on comprehensive and far-reaching legislation to strengthen our national security both at home and abroad," Rockefeller said. 
   Rockefeller noted that under the current structure, the intelligence community was fragmented with the authority for budgets and personnel spread among various agencies. The senator explained that, "This structure inhibited the sharing of information and prevented coordination of efforts under a single, accountable individual." 
   The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 directly addresses this problem by creating a National Intelligence Director with full authority over budget, tasking and personnel of all 15 intelligence agencies.  
   "The lack of centralized authority has prevented the Intelligence Community from functioning as a true collaborative effort. As a result, America has not been able to effectively harness our intelligence, military, and law enforcement weapons in the fight against terrorists organizations like al-Qaeda," Rockefeller explained, citing why a new National Intelligence Director is critical to fixing this problem. 
   The legislation was drafted by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Joe Lieberman (D-CT), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Government Affairs committee. 
   The leaders of the Government Affairs Committee were tasked with crafting legislation in response to the recent recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. As the Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Rockefeller worked closely with Senators Collins and Lieberman in crafting their proposal. 
   Rockefeller praised the bipartisan efforts of Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman and their staffs, "I am so proud of my colleagues in the Senate for working together, under extremely difficult and challenging circumstances, to produce this landmark legislation that will have a profound impact on the security of the United States."  
   A full description of the key provisions are attached. Several important reforms that were specifically authored by Senator Rockefeller include the: 
   * Creation of an Intelligence Community Ombudsman to serve as an independent, informal, and confidential counselor to those who have complaints about politicization, biased intelligence reporting, or the lack of objective analysis. Additionally, within the office of the ombudsman, an analytical review unit would be created to evaluate intelligence analysis to guard against possible politicization. 
   * Establishment of an Office of Alternative Analysis (Red Teams) under the National Intelligence Director to challenge the analytical process as intelligence reports are being formulated. 
   * Establishment of a National Intelligence Reserve Corps so that we can ready pool of trained experts to help deal with temporary shortages of intelligence managers, analysts, and officers during increased military deployments overseas.  
   Rockefeller noted that there have been no fewer than forty-six significant studies, reviews and commissions on the organization and future of the United States Intelligence Community dating back to 1949. Nearly half of these were completed in the past ten years and most offered suggestions on ways to improve and restructure our intelligence operations. The concept of creating a position like a National Intelligence Director dates back to the Nixon Administration. 
   The House of Representatives is currently debating similar legislation and is expected to pass their bill this Friday. At that point, House and Senate negotiators will work together on a conference committee to reconcile the two versions of the legislation. Senator Rockefeller is hopeful that Congress can pass final legislation by the end of this year so that the president can immediately sign it into law. 
   1-page description of key provisions follows:
   The key features of the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 are: 
   * Creates a National Intelligence Director (NID) and a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). The new NID will serve as the head of the country's intelligence community and the principal adviser to the President. The NCTC will ensure that the various intelligence agencies currently scattered across the Federal Government, will now work side by side, sharing and analyzing critical information. 
   * Allows the NID to create national intelligence centers to integrate capabilities from across the Intelligence Community in order to accomplish intelligence missions. Each center will have primary responsibility for providing all-source analysis of intelligence about specific topics of interest and proposing collection requirements to the NID. 
   * Declassifies the National Intelligence Program's top-line aggregate appropriation figure in order to promote public accountability. The NID will submit a report to Congress as to whether declassifying the top-line appropriations figures for each agency in the Intelligence Community would harm national security. 
   * Creates a Civil Liberties Board to ensure privacy and civil liberties concerns are being protected as the President and executive agencies propose and implement policies related to efforts to protect the Nation against terrorism. The board will also conduct investigations and oversight of the government's implementation of those policies. 
   * Requires the NID to provide intelligence that is independent of political considerations. To this end, the legislation establishes an Analytic Review Unit within an Ombudsman's office to provide an independent and objective evaluation of the quality of analysis of national intelligence. 
   * Requires the establishment of an information sharing network to break down the stovepipes that currently impede the flow of information. The network is to consist of policies and information technology designed to facilitate and promote the sharing of terrorism information throughout the federal government, with state and local agencies, and where appropriate, with the private sector. 
   * Also includes provisions to: Make the country's borders, transportation, and critical infrastructure more secure by investing in more modern technologies and requiring better identification procedures; Promote aggressive outreach to the Muslim world to dry up terrorists' supply of new recruits; Improve communications among federal, state and local law enforcement coast to coast.
