SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO IMPROVE FAA SAFETY PROGRAMS
  Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation Operation, Safety and Security, released the following statement in response to newly proposed FAA oversight and safety measures. They were unveiled this afternoon by U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters. 
   "Today's action by Secretary Peters is long overdue recognition that the safety oversight between the FAA and the airlines isn't working as well as it should. More must be done to get the FAA's house in order, and restore public confidence in our national aviation system. 
   "While this proposal has the right goal, we shouldn't need a DOT commission for the FAA to do its job. With that said, if the Administration moves forward with this plan, it is absolutely critical that they put in place qualified, independent, and accountable individuals.
   "I will be looking at these, and other independent recommendations, to improve aviation safety for inclusion in the FAA Reauthorization bill."
