SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  SEN. ROCKEFELLER'S REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS  
   "Once again, the President has given a good speech full of optimism and ideas. But the real test will be whether his words tonight will have a positive impact on the lives of West Virginians in the future. 
   "America faces enormous challenges. We only have one President and that means we must work together to meet the needs of our families and to make our country stronger. 
   "I was especially glad that the President called for renewed efforts to reduce our dependency on oil. I'm not optimistic that we can solve the oil problems, but I am optimistic about the future of West Virginia coal. Coal already plays a significant role in our nation's energy policy, and as we make coal both safer and cleaner, it will become even more important. 
   "As a United States Senator deeply involved in the issues most important to West Virginians - jobs, health care, veterans, education, seniors - I stand ready to work with the President and Congress to strengthen the state of our union."
