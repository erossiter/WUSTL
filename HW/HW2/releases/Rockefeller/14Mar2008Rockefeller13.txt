SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON SOUTHWEST AIRLINES SAFETY INSPECTIONS
  In the wake of reports that Southwest Airlines grounded 41 planes for failing to pass safety inspections, Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), today announced that the Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Security and Safety, which he chairs, will hold an oversight hearing on FAA Safety Programs the first week of April. 
   "I am deeply troubled by what appears to be a systemic failure in safety inspections and safety oversight at Southwest Airlines," Rockefeller said. "Even more disturbing are the errors, indifference and even perhaps attempts to bury the violations by some of FAA's safety personnel. I intend to aggressively pursue answers to this matter. Making sure the nation's aviation system is as safe as possible is a top priority."
   The Aviation Subcommittee had scheduled an oversight hearing on FAA's safety programs for April 23, 2008. Rockefeller moved this hearing to the first week of April so that the panel could examine how these unacceptable safety lapses occurred and how to go about preventing them from ever happening again. In addition, the hearing will touch on other pressing safety issues such as runway safety and oversight of air carrier maintenance.
