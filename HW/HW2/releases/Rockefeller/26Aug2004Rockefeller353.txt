SEN. ROCKEFELLER URGES CSX RAILROAD TO PROTECT JOBS IN WEST VIRGINIA
  With the jobs, health benefits and pensions of about 250 West Virginia railroad workers on the line, Sen. Jay Rockefeller is urging CSX Transportation President and CEO Michael J. Ward to reconsider the company's proposal to lease over 500 miles of track in the Mountain State.  
   In a letter sent to the executive's CSX offices in Richmond, Virginia, and Jacksonville, Florida, Rockefeller said, "The potential loss of even a single job in West Virginia is of the utmost concern to me. This situation has caused enormous anxiety for the workers and families that might be affected. I share the concern of longtime CSX employees that the policies and business decisions of a successor railroad might adversely affect their hard-earned and fairly bargained-for pension and medical benefits."
   Earlier this month, CSX received nine bids from short-line railroads to lease 530 miles of railroad track serving areas of West Virginia including New Martinsville, Clarksburg, Grafton and Cowen, as well as the Cumberland, Maryland, region.
   Under a lease arrangement, the smaller companies could operate on the tracks while CSX would retain ownership and control of the market for goods shipped on the line. 
   "The average worker on these lines now is in their 50's," Rockefeller said. "A decision by CSX to sell or lease these lines jeopardizes their seniority and their jobs." 
   "If a lease is going to happen, I believe West Virginians would prefer a West Virginia bidder emerge as the winner. But I would ask that CSX carefully consider whether the livelihoods and retirement security of hundreds of West Virginians wouldn't be better secured if CSX just kept these important lines themselves. We don't want to see these jobs in jeopardy or these lines abandoned."
