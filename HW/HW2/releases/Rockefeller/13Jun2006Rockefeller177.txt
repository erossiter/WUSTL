SEN. ROCKEFELLER APPLAUDS DECISION BY TRADE COMMISSION TO CONTINUE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today welcomed the International Trade Commission's (ITC's) unanimous 6-0 decision to continue the strong antidumping measures against Japanese tinplate. The tariffs, which have been in place since 2000, are some assurance that West Virginia's steel industry will not be subject to unfair Japanese trade policies that existed throughout most of the 1990s.  
   "This is a vital decision of enormous importance for our steel industry," Rockefeller said. "Our steel industry has held its own over the past few years in part because the ITC rightly imposed these tariffs by using the legal methods available to it. Today, the ITC made the right decision again by not allowing the Japanese to unfairly dump cheap tin on our market." 
   The measures were imposed following complaints from the Independent Steelworkers Union, the United Steelworkers of America, and American steel companies. Rockefeller, a member of the Senate Steel Caucus, has been particularly active on the issue and was vital in getting the initial regulations placed in 2000. 
   In written testimony before the ITC in April of this year, Rockefeller warned of the dangers of allowing the Japanese tin to flood our markets: 
   "Families lose wages, health care plans, and pensions. College funds are wiped out; bankruptcies and foreclosures increase. Local businesses are devastated by job losses as their revenue plummets," Rockefeller said, adding that "even less tax revenue is available for strapped state and local governments, which are the first line of assistance for these unemployed workers." 
   "Today's decision shows that in this case the commission understands what we in West Virginia have known for years," Rockefeller said. "These tariffs are the last line of defense for thousands of American steelworkers and their families and they work."
