SEN. ROCKEFELLER CONGRATULATES FENTON GLASS ON 100TH ANNIVERSARY
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today congratulated the Fenton Art Glass Company on its 100th anniversary.  
 The Williamstown company continues to succeed through an innovative marketing strategy that has enabled them to reach national and international markets, while still able to manufacture its glass from its West Virginia headquarters. 
   "When a West Virginia company reaches their 100th year in business, it's a tremendous milestone," said Rockefeller. "Fenton has endured and prospered for so long because of their remarkable attention to the detail of the products. People from all over the world and from all walks of life know the craftsmanship and beauty of Fenton glass. Their work is beloved by casual buyers and art collectors alike.
   "Fenton places the same care in their business acumen, and that's why I wouldn't be surprised in people aren't still buying Fenton glass 100 years from now." 
   Rockefeller has been a leader in making sure that West Virginia's small manufacturers have the resources and support they need to be successful. He has also been a leading advocate of expanding broadband access in rural areas, so that West Virginia companies can compete in the global marketplace. 
   "Fenton's success has obviously been good for their company, but it has also been good for West Virginia," said Rockefeller. "Wherever a Fenton product goes in the world, people know that the product was made in our state. I know that they will continue to be a great ambassador for our state." 
   Fenton sells its products in approximately 4500 retail shops worldwide. The Wood County company employs 500 people.
