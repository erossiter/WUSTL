SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS FOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT PROVIDES TARGETED AND EFFECTIVE RELIEF AIMED AT THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST
  The ongoing housing crisis, rising gas prices and the sharply declining stock market have led many economists to believe that the national economy is on the verge of a recession. As a result, Senator Jay Rockefeller is working with congressional leaders and the President to develop an economic stimulus package that will jump-start the economy and put money back in the hands of hard-working West Virginians who will spend it.  
   "Any economic stimulus package has to put money into the pockets of hard-working West Virginians who are struggling to pay for gas to get back and forth to work, heat their homes, and make ends meets. While I can't support more tax cuts for the wealthy, I will fight for targeted tax cuts and other relief to jump-start the economy. This includes tax rebates, small businesses tax cuts, and extensions for unemployment insurance and the food stamp program," Rockefeller said.
   "If we don't act quickly it may be too late," Rockefeller said. "Congress and the White House need to work together to focus our efforts on where we can do the most good and have the greatest impact for states like West Virginia," 
   Along with tax cuts, Rockefeller is also working to include fiscal relief for states that are experiencing declining revenue. In 2003, when states were facing similar budget deficits, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation authored by Senator Rockefeller that gave billions of dollars to state and local governments, which staved off cuts to Medicaid. West Virginia received $125 million to increase the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) - which reduced the pressure on the state to cut health insurance for low-income families and individuals. 
   FMAP is the equation used to allocate money for the federal share of Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the states and the federal government.
