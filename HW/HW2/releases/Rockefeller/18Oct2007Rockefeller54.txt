SEN. ROCKEFELLER COMMENTS ON HOUSE FAILURE TO OVERRIDE CHIP VETO
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) a co-author of the bipartisan, House-Senate, bill to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, issued the following statement after the House of Representatives failed to override President Bush's veto of the bill. 
   Rockefeller commended all three members of the West Virginia Congressional Delegation for putting children, not politics, first.
   "An overwhelming number of West Virginians agreed with our plan for CHIP reauthorization. The vote today in the House of Representatives is certainly not the one so many of us had hoped would occur.
   "CHIP is the most cost-effective program out there for delivering health care to kids. In West Virginia, tens of thousands of children rely on it for basic medical care, such as flu shots, immunizations, and preventative screenings.
   "Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating this bill for the last several months. We've compromised again and again. Months ago, a bipartisan group of Senators reached out to the President to join our negotiations. He refused.
   "Everyone knows what the President and Congressional Republicans are doing, and sadly, our kids and the state governments who take care of these children, are paying the price.
   "Let's stop playing games. Moving forward, we all need to work together to provide our kids with health care."
