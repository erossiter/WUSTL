SENS. ROCKEFELLER, BYRD CELEBRATE BUSH'S SIGNING OF MINER ACT
  Today, following an 11:20 a.m. ceremony, President Bush signed into law the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act, the most significant mine safety legislation since 1977. Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) co-authored the legislation. Sen. Byrd was on hand for the ceremony, along with members of the West Virginia delegation, Gov. Manchin, and miners and their families. Unfortunately, Sen. Rockefeller could not attend the signing ceremony due to his recovery from back surgery. 
   "I'm so proud of what we all achieved today, but it is very much a bittersweet moment," said Rockefeller. "Yes, we are celebrating the greatest improvements to mine safety in a generation. But we would not be here today if we had not suffered such tragic coal mine deaths earlier this year - 19 deaths in West Virginia alone and 33 nationwide.  
   "It saddens me that we had to experience so much tragedy before we could accomplish change. But, we did achieve change - and hopefully the families are somewhat comforted by knowing that their loved ones have made a difference in the future safety of coal mining and that their loss will not be needlessly repeated. Mining will always be a dangerous profession, but the MINER Act will make it less dangerous and most importantly, it will undoubtedly save lives," Rockefeller said.
   "This is a day of smiles and sadness for West Virginia. We are proud of the progress that this new law makes for mine safety, but saddened that it has taken the deaths of 19 of our coal miners to put these commonsense safety improvements into law," said Byrd. "This new law will save lives. It will protect coal miners. It will mean tougher mine safety, better enforcement, and faster rescue in case tragedy strikes. 
   "This new law - the MINER Law - is not the be-all and end-all for mine safety. We have more work to do. But the MINER Law takes important first steps to protect coal miners on the job, and to stop the terrible rash of mining deaths which have touched all of us so deeply this year," Byrd said.
   The MINER Act will: 
   * Double the amount of breathable air that each miner carries on them 
   * Establish additional breathable apparatus' for shelters in place and at 30 minute intervals along escape routes 
   * Create better communication - more telephone lines, new wireless technology, and electronic tracking of every miner 
   * Develop more and better-trained rescue teams - requiring a response within one hour 
   * Create higher minimum fines for serious health and safety violations 
   As the federal MINER Act was signed into law, Congress pushed forward with another important mine safety initiative, clearing more than $35 million for immediate emergency improvements in coal mines and to toughen safety enforcement. Byrd had included the $35.6 million in the national security emergency funding bill.
   The funds will allow many of the core initiatives of the federal MINER Act to begin immediately, such as pre-positioned oxygen supplies in mines and tougher enforcement of safety standards. The funds will also be used to begin to replace the more than 200 inspectors whose jobs have been eliminated by Bush Administration cuts during the past five years.
   "Senate passage of this emergency mine safety funding completes an historic day for mine safety in America. These efforts will work in tandem to bring tighter safety enforcement and better rescue technologies to our mines," Byrd said.
