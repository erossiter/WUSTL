SEN. ROCKEFELLER ADDRESSES WORKERS' RIGHTS IN BANKRUPTCY
  With many West Virginia workers and retirees suffering from the consequences of companies going bankrupt, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has introduced legislation to strengthen employees' rights in bankruptcy. Rockefeller's Bankruptcy Fairness Act, S. 329, would ensure that employees and retirees are able to recover more of what is owed to them in wages and benefits, including critical retiree health coverage. 
   "People work their entire lives under the promise that they will receive certain compensation. Yet, sadly we have seen some companies in the last few years abandon these promises when they declare bankruptcy," Rockefeller said. "Our employees and retirees need better protection." 
   The Bankruptcy Fairness Act would specifically help bankrupt companies' employees and retirees on three fronts. The bill would:
   * Ensure Compensation for Retirees Who Lose Health Coverage. If an employer reduces retiree health care benefits as part of a bankruptcy plan, retirees would be entitled to cash compensation, in addition to the general unsecured claim they receive under current law. The compensation is designed to enable retirees to purchase comparable health insurance for another 18 months.
   * Increase Workers' Priority Claim Against Company Assets. The bill allows employees to recover more of the back-pay, vacation time, severance, or benefit payments that the company owes them at the time it declares bankruptcy. Current law grants an employee a priority claim of $4,925 against the company's assets; Rockefeller's bill would increase the claim to $15,000.
   * Recover Excessive Pay to Executives or Insiders. The bill provides bankruptcy courts the authority to recover company assets in cases where company managers flagrantly paid excessive compensation to favored employees just before declaring bankruptcy.
  "I am offering this legislation so that we can start a dialogue about how to better protect workers whose companies file for bankruptcy. I will push Congress to begin a vigorous debate about the best way to ease the burden that bankruptcy imposes on employees and retirees."
