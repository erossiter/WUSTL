SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO INCREASE TROOPS IN IRAQ
  SEN. ROCKEFELLER STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO INCREASE TROOPS IN IRAQ: 
   "The ongoing war in Iraq has demanded enormous funding and personnel resources which has strained our efforts in the global war on terrorism. 
   "I have seen nothing in my service on the Intelligence Committee, or in any other forum, that suggests sending an additional 21,500 American troops to Iraq will bring about greater security on the ground or lead to a more successful outcome.   
   "There is little reason to believe that the diplomatic, political and economic objectives will be any more successful with 153,000 troops than with the current 132,000 troops. And that's really the crux of the President's new strategy - more troops. 
   "It is an approach that tinkers at the margins of a grave and deteriorating situation. It is not grounded in the realities we face in Iraq and in the region, and it is an unacceptable gamble with additional soldiers' lives. 
   "The President must understand that even as Congress continues to support and fund the brave work of the servicemen and women who are now serving in Iraq, we will push back on an ill-conceived plan to put more soldiers in harms way."
