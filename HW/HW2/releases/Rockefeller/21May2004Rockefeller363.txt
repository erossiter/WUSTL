SEN. ROCKEFELLER TO BUSH: TELL ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO INCREASE OUTPUT
  Two days before a major meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and 37 of his Senate colleagues wrote President Bush, urging him to pressure OPEC members to increase oil production. The letter also requested that the Secretary of Energy, who will be attending the International Forum on Energy with the OPEC representatives this weekend, to aggressively encourage OPEC to increase oil production.
   Rockefeller said, "OPEC does have the ability and means to drive down oil prices, by increasing its output of oil. This president needs to make good on his promises he made in the 2000 campaign and 'jawbone' OPEC members to lower the price."
   "I've heard people say this fight is about politics," Rockefeller added. "It's not about politics - it's about addressing a growing problem that hits the wallets of working Americans harder each month. We need action, and we need it now."
