SEN. ROCKEFELLER RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO BRING CAPTURED AL-QAEDA TERRORISTS TO TRIAL
  Following President Bush's decision today to bring captured al-Qaeda terrorists to trial, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), Vice-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued the following statement: 
   "I support the decision to bring captured al-Qaeda terrorists to trial and make them accountable for their murderous acts. I believe bringing these terrorists to justice is long overdue. The decision to transfer the remaining fourteen detainees from secret CIA detention facilities and to try them for their crimes is a direct result of the Supreme Court's June 29th ruling that found the Bush Administration's rules for trying terrorists were unlawful.  
   "I support the continuation of a CIA detention and interrogation program, but it must be operated in a lawful manner. The truth is that the CIA detention and interrogation program has been beset by legal and operational problems for quite some time that have hampered our ability to collect accurate and timely intelligence. Had the President not withheld details of the CIA detention and interrogation program from the congressional intelligence committees and instead worked with Congress from day one, I believe we could have created a terrorist detention program after 9/11 that would have been effective in obtaining timely intelligence and withstood legal scrutiny. The President's announcement that he wants to now work with Congress, five years later, to craft such a program is belated recognition of this fact."
