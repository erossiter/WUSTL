SENS. ROCKEFELLER SAYS ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET CUTS WILL HURT VETERANS
  In a Senate Veterans' Affairs hearing on long-term care, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) said that he believes veterans are not receiving the long-term health care they deserve and have earned. Rockefeller, the senior Democrat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, said that $3 billion in proposed Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) cuts over 10 years, on top of $10 billion in proposed Medicaid cuts over the next 5 years, will leave veterans with no place to turn for long-term health care. 
   "We have no long-term care policy at all," said Rockefeller of the administration's approach to veterans' health care. "You either get it through Medicaid, which we're cutting, and these cuts last over ten years and are just getting worse."
   Rockefeller also talked about what the VA cuts will mean for West Virginia veterans seeking care at a veterans home in Clarksburg that is under construction. The home, which Rockefeller fought for, is scheduled to open next year. Since the Civil War, the federal government has reimbursed state veterans homes for veterans who seek long-term care. Under the administration's budget this year, however, VA has proposed to pay only for service-connected veterans. Service-connected veterans represent only 20 percent of the veterans in State Veterans Homes nationwide.
   Referring to what is happening to veterans' health care, Rockefeller said, "Put this Member down as someone who is very skeptical, very concerned, and very worried." Rockefeller added that he would fight to reverse the cuts.
