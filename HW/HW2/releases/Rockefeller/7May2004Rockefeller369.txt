SENS. McCAIN, HOLLINGS, ROCKEFELLER LAUNCH EFFORT TO IMPROVE NATION'S AVIATION SECURITY SYSTEM
  Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Fritz Hollings (D-SC), and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) introduced legislation Thursday to help the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) implement higher levels of security in America's airports and skies. The bill would create major changes in the United States' air security system, building upon the legislation Congress passed in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks.  
   "We have much more work to do to make our aviation system secure," said Hollings, Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. "This is another piece of the puzzle." 
   "Our nation got a devastating wake up call on September 11th when terrorists used airplanes as weapons of mass destruction. We responded by overhauling the security in our airports and on our airliners. But, we have to do more," said Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation. "The American people deserve to have a system that is efficient, reliable, and safe. By standardizing our federal screeners, tightening our cargo security, strengthening our baggage screening system, and bolstering the Federal Air Marshal program, we will make it more difficult for terrorists to infiltrate our aviation system." 
   Under the bill - the Aviation Security Advancement Act - vast improvements would be made to the nation's air security system. The bill would: make sure that the needed levels of federal screeners are posted at each facility; require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to consider coordinating aviation security functions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of passenger screening; and, encourage DHS to improve intelligence information sharing with state and local officials. In addition to better coordination, the bill would authorize more than $20 million for biometric technology for precise identification of passengers and workers. 
   Another improvement would be made in the area of air cargo security, with $600 million authorized to fund air cargo security initiatives. The bill would create a streamlined baggage screening system, and would create a grant program to fund research and development of advanced technology. Also, the Federal Air Marshal program would receive increased funding under the bill. Finally, the bill would authorize $100 million to improve and strengthen security and control airport access.

   Fact Sheet on Aviation Security Advancement Act (ASAA) 
   Purpose: ASAA seeks to improve on the current system of aviation security and increase the efficiency of air travel by closing loopholes that continue to exist regarding security staffing, cargo security, baggage screening, and airport perimeter security. 
   To accomplish this, the bill proposes:
   * The Development of Screener Staffing Standards B Standardizes the Federal screener workforce to properly address staffing needs and promote more efficient and effective screening at airports. Requires TSA to develop standards based on the appropriate level of security with an average of ten minutes per passenger screening with an independent analysis of the proposal. 
   * Integrating Airport Workforces and Aviation Security B Requires Department of Homeland Security to consider coordinating aviation security related functions to improve efficiency and effectiveness of passenger screening. 
   * Tightening Air Cargo Security B Increases funding for all-cargo aviation security to establish an enhanced security program and to promote the use of improved technology for cargo screening. To do so, the bill authorizes $600 million for FYs 2005-07 to fund cargo security initiatives, and creates a Next-Generation Cargo Security Grant program authorized at $300 million through FY07 to fund research and development (R&D) and deployment of advanced technology. 
   * Providing Additional Funding for LOIs B authorizes $450 million for FY 2005-07 to provide long-term funding (letters of intent B LOIs) to fund priority capital security projects at airports. 
   * Increasing the Efficiency of Baggage Screening B Develops a streamlined baggage screening system by requiring a schedule for the in-line placement of Explosive Detection Systems (EDS), and provides more funding for screening technology R&D by authorizing $350 million to fund next-generation EDS, and portal detection systems technology. The bill establishes a pilot program at ten airports to test portal detection systems and requires bi-annual reports to Congress on the status implementing this advanced technology. 
   * Bolstering the Federal Air Marshal (FAM) Program B authorizes increased funding to allow the FAM program to be funded at up to $700 million, and studies cross-training proposals for the FAM workforce. 
   * Strengthening Information Sharing B encourages DHS to improve intelligence information sharing with state and local entities by implementing GAO recommendations. 
   * Improving Passenger Screening B Advances the development of biometric technology for precise identification of workers and travelers, and improves perimeter security at airports by authorizing more than $20 million for TSA to develop biometric technology and fund a biometric center of excellence. 
   * Fortifying Airport Perimeter Security B authorizes $100 million to pursue technological and other improvements to strengthen perimeter security and control airport access.
