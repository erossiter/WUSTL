SEN. ROCKEFELLER, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS WIN VICTORY FOR TROOPS
  After a bipartisan group of Senators today refused to allow a Defense Appropriations bill to be turned into an egregious example of special interests benefiting from Congressional legislation, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), longtime Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, made the following comments: 
   "Dragging our military spending bill down with totally-unrelated controversies is an insult to the men and women who have been so brave and selfless in the defense of our country. 
   "Two months ago, the Senate voted unanimously, 97-0, to pass the defense spending bill. But today we were asked to vote on a new bill that uses our troops as pawns for special interests more than it meets the needs of our troops and our national defense. 
   "Two months ago, the Defense Appropriations bill was about better equipment and benefits for our troops, but now, those critical needs were given a backseat to special interests. Our troops deserve to be the focus of this bill. 
   "Fortunately, we also know that our troops will continue to receive the funding even if this debate continues. We have a temporary funding measure in place, and if we need to extend it, we have full assurances from the leadership that we can. The bottom line is that the safety or well-being of our troops will not be compromised at all." 
   By a 56-42 vote, the Senators voted against a cloture motion that would have allowed the Defense bill to come to the floor for a vote.
