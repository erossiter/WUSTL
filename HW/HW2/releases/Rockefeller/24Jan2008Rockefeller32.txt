SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTION OF FISA BILL
  "It's important to set the record straight and make clear that the Republicans and the White House want a political issue, not a solution.  
   "The fact is, the authority to continue monitoring terrorist communications under Protect America Act does not end on February 1. Our government will continue to have authority under the law until at least August of this year, and can even extend that authority until January 2009.
   "What is at stake here, and what we are trying to do, is improve our national security by ensuring that our surveillance programs are strong and effective against terrorists and that American's privacy rights are protected. 
   "Sadly, terrorists are not going to wait to see which party can win on the national security issue. The world is far too dangerous for these games. 
   "I urge my Republican colleagues and the White House to do the right thing for our nation's security and work with us to pass legislation that we drafted together and they are already on record supporting."
