SEN. ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS TO SIMPLIFY EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
  In an effort to help the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) but do not claim it, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has introduced The Earned Income Tax Credit Simplification Act. Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) cosponsored the bill.  
   Experts have repeatedly criticized the EITC filing process, which often results in low-income American families not receiving the help they are entitled to. The Rockefeller bill would greatly simplify the filing process on annual tax returns. The Earned Income Tax Credit Simplification Act would also keep people from abusing the system and filing erroneous claims. 
   "The EITC should not be so complicated that cash-strapped families have to hire an accountant to file their taxes," said Rockefeller. "We created the EITC to ensure that lower-income working families are able to receive much-needed assistance, but hundreds of thousands - maybe millions -- of families are not taking advantage of this credit. It's not their fault - it's that the forms and instructions are so difficult to negotiate. 
   "This bill will greatly simplify the process, so that we can deliver help to these individuals and families. These are common sense reforms that have been endorsed by the Bush administration, and we should move quickly to pass this legislation." 
   In order to simplify the process, The Earned Income Tax Credit Simplification Act would make the following changes to the complicated eligibility criteria: 
   * Simplify the "abandoned spouse" rule so that custodial parents who are separated but not divorced are able to claim the credit. 
   * Allow a taxpayer living in the same house with a child, but not claiming that child for the EITC benefit, to qualify for the EITC benefits available to taxpayers without children. 
   * Eliminate the investment income test for EITC claimants. 
   * Disqualify from EITC anyone with a non-work Social Security number, since the credit is intended only for people eligible to work in the U.S. 
   In 2003, almost 21 million hard-working Americans benefited from the Earned Income Tax Credit, including almost 142,000 West Virginians. 
   In the 1980s, Senator Rockefeller led the National Commission on Children, where he helped create the "Comprehensive Children's Agenda." This agenda set the benchmark for a national dialogue regarding children's education, welfare, and health care legislation. The EITC was created under the Comprehensive Children's Agenda.
