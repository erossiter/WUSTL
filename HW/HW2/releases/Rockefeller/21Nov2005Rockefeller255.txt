SEN. ROCKEFELLER LEADS FIGHT TO STRENGTHEN, IMPROVE SCIENCE, MATH EDUCATION
  With the Bush Administration continuing to underfund federal math and science education programs while studies show that American students remain far behind students in other nations, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is leading a bipartisan group of 42 Senators in demanding more funding for these critical programs. A recent study shows that out of 29 countries, 15-year-old American students rank 19th in science. In math, American students rank 24th. 
   "These numbers are very disturbing," said Rockefeller. "Our country cannot remain at the forefront of a global high-technology economy with a workforce that doesn't have the math and science training that students in other countries are receiving." 
   Over the past several years, the administration has dramatically cut the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Mathematics and Science Partnership Program, the principal federal research program addressing approaches to American science and math education, from $160 million in FY 2002 to a proposed $60 million in FY 2006. Thanks to growing opposition to the administration's approach to math and science education, conference committee members to the FY 2006 Commerce-Justice-Appropriations recently added $4 million to the administration's $60 million request. 
   In the letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Josh Bolten, the 42 Senators called the present funding levels "insufficient." They also requested more funding in the FY2007 budget for both the NSF program and the Department of Education's math and science education programs. 
   "American students will always come out on top if we give them the tools to learn," said Rockefeller. "Math and science is our future, and it's time to get serious about this issue."
