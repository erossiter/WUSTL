SEN. ROCKEFELLER REACTS TO DECLASSIFICATION OF NIE KEY JUDGMENTS ON 'TRENDS IN GLOBAL TERRORISM: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES'
  "As I have been saying for some time, the war in Iraq has made us less safe. The NIE's "key judgments" make it clear that the Intelligence Community - all 16 agencies - believe the war in Iraq has fueled terrorism.   
   "The reality is, the war in Iraq has inflamed Islamic extremism and hatred toward the United States. It has given the terrorists a centralized place to attack and kill Americans, and it has created a training ground for the next generation of terrorists.   
   "It has increased the instability of an already volatile region and increased the influence and opportunities for Iran.  
   "Equally troublesome, it has stretched our military too thin and reduced our readiness while diverting necessary resources from the real war on terror.   
   "In short, the decision to invade Iraq shifted focus away from our efforts to combat the war on terror and destroy al Qa'ida. As a result, the Taliban is reemerging in Afghanistan and al Qa'ida's leaders continue to operate in the region. 
   "There is no question that many of our policies have inflamed our enemies' hatred toward the U.S. and allowed violence to flourish. But, it is the mistakes we made in Iraq - the lack of planning, the mismanagement and the complete incompetence of our leadership - that has done the most damage to our security."
