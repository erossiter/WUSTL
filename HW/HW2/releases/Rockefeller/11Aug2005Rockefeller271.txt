SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES DONATION OF COMPUTERS TO WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS
 A long-time advocate of improving technology access for West Virginia's students, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), as part of the U.S. Senate's Computers for Schools Program, has designated 25 Internet-ready computers to be sent to schools throughout The Mountain State. 
   "It is vital that we give our children the tools necessary to succeed," Rockefeller said, "Providing our schools with computers ensures that young West Virginians will have access to the world of information offered by the Internet. This investment is critical because students with access to technology will be the high-tech workers of tomorrow."
   The West Virginia institutions receiving the computers are the Wirt County High School in Elizabeth, the Mingo County Schools, the Calhoun County Schools, the McDowell County Schools, and the Pendelton County Schools. 
   The computers, which were divided equally among the five recipients, were made available through the Senate's Computers for Schools Program. Senate officials established the program to help public schools take advantage of information technology by providing them with surplus computers.
   Rockefeller has been recognized nationally for his education technology work. Technology & Learning recently honored Rockefeller and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) as part of the "5 That Made Their Mark" for their creation of the landmark 1996 E-Rate program, which over the last decade has provided Internet connections to tens of thousands of American schools and libraries. Rockefeller and Snowe were listed as #4 on the list, with Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak listed as #2 and Bill Gates as #3. Technology & Learning also ranked E-Rate as #2 in a list of "5 Initiatives that Changed History."
