SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS FOR FULL INVESTIGATION INTO DEATH OF WEST VIRGINIA SOLDIER AT MARINE CORPS BOOT CAMP
  In an effort to determine the circumstances surrounding the death of a West Virginia soldier at a Parris Island boot camp last week, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today asked the United States Marine Corps for a full investigation into the matter. The death of the soldier has become national news after a South Carolina television station recorded a Marine drill instructor grabbing and striking the recruit, Private Jason Tharp, one day before his death. According to news reports, the drill instructor and four other Marines have been suspended. 
   In his letter to General Michael Hagee, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, Rockefeller wrote, "Please accept this letter as my request for a full investigation into Tharp's death. I am also requesting that you ask your investigators to question each recruit who served with Jason, as well as each of the drill instructors who were in charge of him when he first arrived in boot camp, to determine any wrongdoing or negligence that may have contributed to his death. 
   "I am confident that your investigation will bring to final summary the actions that led to Pvt. Tharp's death. I am looking forward to receiving a copy of your investigative report in the very near future."
   In a separate letter, Rockefeller expressed his condolences to Tharp's parents, saying, "I want you to know that I have the utmost respect for Jason as he died in service to our nation. I am always proud of the dedication and courage that our young men and women display in signing up for the military, most especially in a time of war. Jason's death seems so tragic and senseless."
