SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON FOILED AIRLINE PLOT
  Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV statement on foiled airline plot: 
   "I have been briefed on the steps taken to date to foil this complicated and coordinated plot and I want to congratulate British and American intelligence and law enforcement officials for their efforts, so far, in this ongoing investigation. As in the past, there has been impressive cooperation between our two countries. 
   "Whether or not this plan is directly linked to al Qaeda, it shows that their message of hatred and violence toward the United States continues to spread around the world. 
   "We must remain vigilant in our efforts to defeat extremism. Unfortunately, I fear many of our policies over the past five years have done more to inflame extremism than to diminish it. 
   "I believe the war in Iraq has diverted resources and undercut the Bush Administration's ability to protect our people against a terrorist attack. 
   "I remain deeply troubled by the lack of progress since 9/11 in securing our nation's airports and seaports. The Administration's record on homeland security is one of insufficient funding and mismanagement."
