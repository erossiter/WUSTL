SEN. ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOSS OF MINE RESCUE WORKERS IN UTAH
  Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) released the following statement following the news that rescue efforts at the Crandall Canyon mine in Utah have been postponed indefinitely following the deaths of three rescue workers attempting to reach six miners who have been trapped since a roof collapse twelve days ago.  
   "Our hearts go out to the families of the mine rescue team members who lost their lives last night in the Crandall Canyon mine in Utah. I've long believed that Americans don't fully appreciate the brave men and women who go underground every day to provide the coal our nation needs. Even more amazing is the bravery shown by mine rescue team members. 
   "Like firefighters who run into burning buildings, mine rescue team members know that the environment they're heading into is dangerous, and may already have cost others their lives. The miners who became rescue team members and were killed last night volunteered for this duty. The MSHA employee was there because he was a dedicated public servant. The three men who died, and the other rescue team members who were injured, are part of a brotherhood that few probably understand, but which Americans should deeply respect. 
   "The whole world has focused on the miners trapped in this mine, and although this new chapter in the tragedy hits home in the canyons of Utah, I hope the families of the original six miners and the families and coworkers of the men who lost their lives can take some solace in the prayers that are coming their way today from the coalfields of West Virginia."
