SEN. ROCKEFELLER PRAISES SENATE EFFORT TO IMPROVE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS
  Within a few days of passing the most comprehensive intelligence community reform legislation in over 50 years, the Senate this weekend voted to overhaul the Senate congressional committees that have direct oversight of the intelligence and homeland security functions of the United States. 
   Senator Rockefeller, the Vice-Chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has been a strong supporter of congressional reform. This summer, after the 9/11 commission unveiled their recommendations dealing with reform of the intelligence community, the executive branch, and Congress, Sen. Rockefeller immediately called on Congress to address their own shortcomings.
   "The 9/11 Commission rightfully understood that we couldn't drastically improve our national security if we didn't address shortcomings in both the executive branch and in Congress," Rockefeller said. "There is no higher priority for government than national security, yet our congressional committees were structured in such a way that it hindered proper oversight. Today, we have made significant improvements to congressional oversight that will have a direct impact on the future security of the United States."
   Key provisions included in Senate Resolution 445 - the Intelligence Committee Reform Resolution are: 
   CREATION OF A NEW SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE THAT IS COMBINED WITH THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. 
   * This new committee would have the responsibility for activities now within the jurisdiction of nine other committees, and the Governmental Affairs Committee will relinquish some responsibilities to other panels.
   SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES OVERSIGHT ON THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE.
   * Creates 2 new subcommittees:1) intelligence oversight under the full Senate Committee on Intelligence and 2) intelligence appropriations under the full Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   * Eliminates the current term limits of eight years for Intelligence Committee members. 
   * Streamlines the process for enacting intelligence legislation that is shared by several committees.
