SEN. ROCKEFELLER INTRODUCES BILL TO PROTECT WEST VIRGINIA SENIORS FROM DECEPTIVE MEDICARE MARKETING PRACTICES
  Senator Jay Rockefeller has introduced legislation that would take critical steps to address the serious problems West Virginia's Medicare beneficiaries have encountered with marketing abuses and poor service by private Prescription Drug Plans and Medicare Advantage plans. 
   Senator Rockefeller, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Health Care, was joined in introducing the bill by Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME). The two Senators recently participated in a series of Finance Committee hearings that examined these issues in depth.
   "I've heard from hundreds of seniors in West Virginia tell me that their complaints about the prescription drug benefit are falling on deaf ears," said Senator Rockefeller. "They wait for weeks and months for a response from Medicare or their prescription drug plans and sometimes get no response at all. That is indefensible. Our legislation creates a new consumer complaint system, modeled after recommendations from the HHS Inspector General, which will ensure that all complaints are tracked and responded to in a timely manner."
   Specifically, Rockefeller has been contacted about a number of deceptive practices targeted at seniors. Some of these include: intense sales pitches by insurance agents who provide inaccurate information, leading seniors to enroll in plans that don't actually provide the benefits or services they were promised; insurance agents who offer seniors a free meal at a local restaurant where seniors are solicited to change their current Prescription Drug coverage; and, repeated deceptive mailings by private insurance plans suggesting that seniors need to re-evaluate their prescription drug coverage.
   Nationwide, 44 million Medicare beneficiaries, including more than 300,000 West Virginians, face overwhelming choices for Medicare prescription drug coverage. In 2007, there were over 66 Medicare prescription drug plans in West Virginia alone. These numerous options have resulted in considerable confusion among beneficiaries. The complexity of choices - coupled with abusive marketing and business practices - has resulted in beneficiaries facing both gaps in coverage and higher costs.
   "Medicare is a public trust, and, unfortunately, that public trust has been abused in recent years. We should not continue to stand by while insurance companies prey on the poor, the elderly and the disabled without consequence. If the health insurance industry isn't ready to accept responsibility for its actions, then Congress must step-in to ensure that seniors, not profits, are the top priority," Rockefeller said.
   The Medicare Beneficiary Protection Act offers immediate solutions to address the serious problems beneficiaries have encountered with plans. Many of these were described in a series of recent hearings of the Senate Finance Committee. Specifically, this legislation would:
   * Ban abusive marketing practices, such as "cold calls" and door-to-door solicitations from both stand-alone prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans.
   * Provide West Virginians with an additional three months to make annual enrollment decisions.
   * Allow dissatisfied West Virginia consumers the opportunity to make a one-time change in Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plan coverage.
   * Prohibit the payment of incentives to enroll, such as free gifts or meals. The bill would require "sales" events to be labeled as such.
   * Require that Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans disclose a list of those doctors and specialists that have refused to serve the plan's enrollees.
   * Establish a system to collect and process consumer complaints regarding Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans.
