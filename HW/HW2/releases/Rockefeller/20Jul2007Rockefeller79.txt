SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES CHILDREN'S HEALTH BILL CLEARS KEY SENATE COMMITTEE
  In the face of a Presidential veto threat, the Senate Finance Committee has approved bipartisan legislation co-authored by Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) that will reauthorize and expand the landmark Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 
   Ten years ago, Senator Rockefeller co-authored the CHIP bill, which is a federal-state partnership aimed at providing health insurance to children whose parents otherwise could not afford it. The program is set to expire September 30, 2007, and without congressional action, more than six million children nationwide would lose their health insurance.  
   "In the decade since we established CHIP, tens of thousands of West Virginia children have received necessary, and sometimes life-saving, healthcare through this program. CHIP makes sure that kids can see a doctor when they get sick, receive necessary immunizations, and get the preventative screenings they need for a healthy start in life. This is a program that works, and works well," Rockefeller said. 
   By an overwhelming vote, the Senate Finance Committee approved a $35 billion bill on Thursday to renew and improve CHIP over the next five years -- bringing the total federal investment for covering low-income, uninsured children to $60 billion over the same period. Earlier this week, President Bush threatened to veto the bill if passed because it expands the program to an additional 4 million low-income children including many who are already eligible but not covered. 
   "CHIP is an enormously successful program nationwide, and especially here in West Virginia. I'm proud to have gotten this bill through the committee process, despite the President's veto threat, and I'm prepared for whatever fight is necessary to get this bill passed into law," Rockefeller stated. 
   In West Virginia, nearly 39,000 children get access to health insurance through CHIP each year. As part of the Rockefeller bill, West Virginia will receive $44 million next year for Governor Manchin's ongoing CHIP expansion. The bill would also allow West Virginia to retain an additional $22 million in federal CHIP dollars currently available to the state that otherwise would have been returned to the federal government. This significant new federal investment means that an additional 4,000 children in West Virginia can be enrolled in CHIP in the next few years. 
   The Senate Finance Committee has been debating the CHIP legislation for several months. Senator Rockefeller fought for a number of provisions, including: giving states greater flexibility in spending their CHIP funds; eliminating the annual shortfalls that are faced by many states; and improving the quality of care offered to children. 
   Senator Rockefeller also fought for the creation of a national demonstration project that would allow states, like West Virginia, to use the information gathered from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, the school lunch program, and other public programs to identify children who are eligible, but currently unenrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. 
   The legislation also includes $200 million in grants that will be provided to states to strengthen and improve access to dental coverage for children. Additionally, states would be required to provide mental health services equal to the level of medical and surgical benefits offered under CHIP. 
   Other key features of the Rockefeller bill that benefit West Virginia include: 
   * An improved CHIP funding formula that takes into account West Virginia's specific health care needs. 
   * Significant new federal funding to allow West Virginia to complete its ongoing CHIP expansion. 
   * A new state option to cover pregnant women through CHIP. 
   * Incentive bonuses for West Virginia to enroll additional Medicaid-eligible children. 
   * Increased funding for the Census Bureau to improve state-specific health care data so that small, rural states like West Virginia are accurately represented in CHIP payment calculations. 
   * New federal resources to help West Virginia implement burdensome and costly CHIP payment reform requirements. 
   This investment in the Children's Health Insurance Program is paid for with a 61-cent increase in the Federal tax on cigarettes, with proportional increases for other tobacco products. 
   The full Senate is expected to take up Rockefeller's CHIP bill next week. The final legislation must still be negotiated with the House of Representatives before it is signed into law.
