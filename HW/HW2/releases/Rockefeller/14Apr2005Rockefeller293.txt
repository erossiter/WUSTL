SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISION 'VICTORY' FOR WEST VIRGINIA STEEL INDUSTRY
  The International Trade Commission (ITC) today voted to extend for 5 years tariffs on hot-rolled steel from Japan and Brazil and continue the suspension agreement with Russia. Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Co-Chair of the Senate Steel Caucus, urged the ITC at a hearing on March 2 to maintain the tariffs. Rockefeller said that the decision would allow West Virginia steelmakers to continue their recovery. In the year before the original ITC order took effect in 1999, Brazil, Japan, and Russia illegally dumped 7 million tons of steel in the American market. In the first year after the tariffs began, the number declined dramatically to 126,000 tons. 
   Rockefeller's statement follows: 
   "In West Virginia, we have experienced first hand the devastating consequences that dumping has had in the past, so we know how vital these tariffs are to the survival and success of our steelworkers and steel companies. Today's decision means that our steel industry can continue its recovery from the years of illegal imports. 
   "I agree with the ITC's decision, and I look forward to working with them in the future to ensure that our steel industry has the opportunity to compete on a level-playing field in the global market. This decision is a victory for our steel industry - it will help protect the livelihood of our steelworkers, their families, and their communities."
