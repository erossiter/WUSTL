SEN. ROCKEFELLER CALLS CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS' REFUSAL TO PASS FISCAL 2007 INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL 'UNPRECEDENTED'
  Working to defend the Senate Intelligence Committee's ability to oversee the nation's intelligence community, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) will offer an amendment today that would force the Senate Majority Leader to bring the Intelligence Authorization bill to the Senate floor for consideration. Until last year, Congress - for 27 straight years - had never failed to pass the annual plan for the nation's intelligence community and certainly never during a war, where intelligence is so integral to the war effort. Yet, this year marks the second straight year that the Senate Majority Leader has not allowed this bill to come before the Senate.  
   "The Senate's failure to pass this critical national security legislation is truly unprecedented," said Rockefeller. "For nearly three decades, since the creation of the congressional intelligence committees, Congress has passed an intelligence authorization bill. Yet for the second straight year, we stand on the brink of depriving our intelligence community of the blueprint they need to effectively carry out their responsibilities." 
   "This is must-pass legislation. Without this legislation, we will see diminished authority for intelligence agencies to do their job in protecting America. We will also see less effective oversight at a time when the intelligence community is undergoing its biggest restructuring in 50 years. 
   "This bill is the primary mechanism Congress uses to provide guidance and support to America's intelligence agencies. It represents the heart of our efforts to protect America from terrorists. At a time when our security depends so heavily on good intelligence and when we are in the midst of reforming and modernizing our intelligence community, the Senate's failure to act on this legislation is inexplicable." 
   Regardless of who has controlled the Senate or the White House, the bill has been considered to be of paramount importance. Recognizing that significance, in May the Senate Intelligence Committee passed the bill unanimously, 15-0. But Majority Leader Frist has refused to bring up the bill for Senate debate, just as he did last year when he allowed an anonymous Republican objection to derail the authorization bill. 
   Among other things, the bill would: 
   * Foster and improve information sharing and information access. 
  * Establish a pilot program giving the intelligence community access to data bases of other non-intelligence agencies for the purposes of collecting intelligence on counterterrorism or weapons of mass destruction. 
  * Increase penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of a covert agent. 
  * Improve of the timely flow of information to the congressional intelligence committees. 
  Demand a report on the implementation of the Detainee Treatment Act. 
  "It is essential that we permit the men and women of the intelligence agencies to continue their critical work on the front lines of the war in Iraq and the war on terror," said Rockefeller. "Without this bill, we are seriously undercutting their efforts."
