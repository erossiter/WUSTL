SEN. ROCKEFELLER ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $750,000 IN TRANSPORTATION GRANTS
  A long-time advocate for developing West Virginia's tourism industry, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today announced $751,336 in federal transportation grants to enhance visitors' experiences when they travel in West Virginia. The grants will fund 11 separate projects ranging from building rest areas to examining how tourists can explore West Virginia's rich history via interpretive signs and audio histories. 
   "West Virginia has always had some of the most beautiful scenery in the country," Rockefeller said. "These grants will enable us to continue to develop the infrastructure needed for tourists to come and discover it for themselves." 
   The grants are provided through the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Scenic Byways Program. Under the program, roads are recognized as National Scenic Byways - "All-American Roads" - based on their archeological, history, and cultural importance, as well as their natural, recreational, and scenic qualities. The program aims to preserve some of America's most beautiful roads and to promote tourism in rural areas.
   Rockefeller has led the drive to develop a national network of scenic byways to because he recognizes the important economic impact that tourism can play. Rockefeller has specifically sought to expand tourism in the Mountain State, both when he was Governor and now as a Senator. In 1992, he authored the Tourism Policy and Export Promotion Act, which established the Rural Tourism Foundation. The Rural Tourism Foundation promotes the development of tourism in states such as West Virginia. 
   "Tourism remains a vital component of our economy," Rockefeller said, "I will continue to do everything that I can to showcase the natural beauty and hospitality of our great state."
