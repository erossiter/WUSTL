SEN. LUGAR CONGRATULATES JEFFERSON AWARD RECIPIENT HOLLY DUNN-PENDLETON OF EVANSVILLE
  Sen. Dick Lugar met with Holly Dunn-Pendleton, an employee at the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence, on Tuesday, June 20, 2006. Dunn-Pendleton was in Washington, D.C., to receive a 2006 Jefferson Award for community and public service and in a surprise presentation was named one of five people to receive the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting Local Communities out of the 74 local winners from throughout the country.  
   Dunn-Pendleton was recognized for her work in educating the community about assisting victims of sexual violence and her personal outreach to victims of sexual assault. 
   Dunn-Pendleton has been actively working to establish a child and adult advocacy center for victims of intimate crimes in Evansville, which is expected to open in early 2007. She has provided eight training sessions for every member of the Evansville Police Department on sexual violence, which decided to name the facility Holly's House, in her honor. 
   The Jefferson Award was founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, U.S. Sen. Robert Taft, Jr. and Sam Beard. The intent was to create a "Nobel Prize" for community and public service. Since its inception, the Jefferson Awards has recognized citizens exhibiting the highest degree of leadership and service within their state and nation. Annually, there are two local winners selected from each state as well as four winners from the nation at-large. 
   Peggy Jo Albertson of Fort Wayne also received a 2006 Jefferson Award for her leadership in Project Linus, an organization that makes blankets for traumatized or sick infants and children. 
   Peyton Manning was recognized as one of four recipients of the 2006 National Jefferson Award. The Indianapolis Colts quarterback received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 or Under.
