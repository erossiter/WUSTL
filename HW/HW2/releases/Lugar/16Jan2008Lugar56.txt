NAACP AND FORT WAYNE AFRICAN/AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM HONOR DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. IN LUGAR COMMUNITY CENTER
  The Fort Wayne African/African-American Museum and the local chapter of the NAACP have honored Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by decorating the windows of the Lugar Community Service Center at Senator Lugar's request.  
  "The NAACP Fort Wayne-Allen County Branch #3049 continues to honor the memory of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by focusing on issues of unity, justice and equality for all citizens. We thank Indiana Senator Richard G. Lugar for the opportunity to educate others with a window display concerning the great works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.," said NAACP Branch #3049 President Rev. Michael Latham. 
  The display includes biographical information on Dr. King as well as other famous African Americans. 
  Monday, January 21, 2008, is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a national holiday commemorating Dr. King's birth date. In 1994, Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act, designating the King Holiday as a national day of volunteer service. With this designation, Congress asked Americans of all backgrounds and ages to celebrate Dr. King's legacy by turning community concerns into citizen action. 
  The Lugar Community Service Center is located in Covington Plaza at 6384-A West Jefferson Boulevard in Fort Wayne. If you are interested in volunteering please stop by or call (260) 422-1505.
  The NAACP is the oldest, largest, most-respected and effective civil rights organization in this nation. The NAACP has improved the social, economic and political conditions for African-Americans and other minorities more than any other organization in the history of America. 
  The African/African-American Museum's mission is to preserve African American history and culture through collections and programs that promote scholarly research and public use. The museum is located at 436 East Douglas Avenue, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46802.
