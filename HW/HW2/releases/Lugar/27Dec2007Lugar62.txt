SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON BHUTTO
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Dick Lugar made the following statement today following the assassination of Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto: 
   "I extend my condolences to Benazir Bhutto's family and supporters. Our thoughts are with all its 165 million people as the nation of Pakistan is once again at a crisis moment.
   "I last met with Benazir Bhutto on September 26 when she came to my office just days before returning to Pakistan. She was aware of her personal danger. She expressed a strong appreciation for President Musharraf's challenges in running the country, and she was hopeful that her return would be a force toward securing a national election and advancing democracy in Pakistan.
   "This is a critical moment for Pakistan, for the region, and for the community of nations as we encourage democracy and stability in Pakistan. I reiterate President Bush's call for continuing with the election on January 8 in honor of Benazir Bhutto's memory."
