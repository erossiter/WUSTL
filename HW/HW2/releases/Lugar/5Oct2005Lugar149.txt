INDIANA RECEIVES MORE THAN $260,000 IN FIRE GRANTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that Indiana will receive $260,034 in firefighter assistance grants from the Department of Homeland Security.  
   The award is among grants made to fire departments throughout the U.S. announced this week in the eighth round of the 2005 Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program (AFGP). 
   "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have reminded us how important it is to equip first responders with the tools and the training they need to perform effectively," Lugar said. "The funds announced today help Indiana fire departments conduct operations, promote fire safety and increase the overall level of service firefighters are able to provide to their communities." 
   For the 2005 program, $650 million was appropriated to provide assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. 
   Applicants were invited to apply for funds in the following three supported program areas: Operations and Firefighter Safety Program, Fire Prevention Program and Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program. 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the AFGP and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. 
   Fire departments with questions about the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program may reach the fire grants help desk toll free at 1-866-274-0960 or firegrants@dhs.gov. For the most current information regarding the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program, visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
