DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AWARDS FUNDS TO INDIANA CRIMINAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute has been awarded $172,627 from the Department of Justice through its Residential Substance Abuse Treatment for State Prisoners Program (RSAT). RSAT assists state and local governments in developing and implementing substance abuse treatment programs and creating and maintaining community-based aftercare services for offenders when they are released. The ultimate goal of RSAT is to reduce the recidivism rate of program participants compared to their non-participating counterparts. 
  The Westville Correctional Facility in LaPorte County and the Lawrence County Jail will each receive a portion of these funds. At the Westville Correctional Facility, 270 beds have been made available in the Therapeutic Community for male substance abuse treatment offenders.
