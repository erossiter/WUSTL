SEN. LUGAR CELEBRATES 'READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY'
  Sen. Dick Lugar joined in acknowledging the National Education Association's Read Across America Day on Wednesday, March 2.  
 NEA's Read Across America is an annual reading awareness program that encourages children across the nation to celebrate reading while marking the national commemoration of Dr. Seuss's birthday. 
   "The ability to read is of utmost importance in an individual's life," Lugar said. "In fact, if I could offer but one helpful hint to young Hoosiers hoping to better their odds for success in life, I would simply note the importance of thoughtful reading." 
   To commemorate Read Across America Day, Lugar encourages Hoosier parents to read to their children. "Today we celebrate reading with children so that it may enhance their learning, challenge their imagination and open their eyes to new possibilities," Lugar said. 
   "As I look back on my journey from schoolboy to senator, I am convinced that the time I spent reading was the most productive," he said. "Drive, imagination, and even luck played a part at various points along the way, but more often than not it was reading that opened my eyes to what was possible and enabled me to take advantage of the opportunities that came my way." 
   Lugar is currently working on an education website that will explore issues faced by parents, teachers and students. The purpose of this EducateIndiana website is to share constructive ideas about education and offer students, parents, teachers and administrators education tools that can be used both inside and outside the classroom. The address for EducateIndiana is http://lugar.senate.gov/educateindiana.
