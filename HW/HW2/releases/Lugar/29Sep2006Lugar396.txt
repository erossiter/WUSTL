FORT WAYNE SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE $3 MILLION FROM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that Fort Wayne Community Schools will receive $3,029,934 from the U.S. Department of Education's Smaller Learning Communities Program (SLC). The award is for the period of October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2009. The grant is for 5 years, although future funding may vary.  
   Funds will be used for Fort Wayne's Smaller SPACES (Students, Parents, Administrators, Community and Educators for Success) project, which will focus on academics and emphasize the need to build a strong foundation of support throughout school community. The project will be implemented in six high schools and will provide homework help, tutoring, mentoring, and a broad range of academic, social and recreational activities for students and families. 
   The SLC program promotes academic achievement through the creation or expansion of small, safe and successful learning environments in large public high schools to help ensure that all students graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to make successful transitions to college and careers.
