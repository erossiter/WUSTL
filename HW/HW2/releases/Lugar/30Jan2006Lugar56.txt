EVANSVILLE PUBLIC TV STATION RECEIVES DIGITAL CONVERSION GRANT
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that public TV station WNIN in Evansville will receive a $283,062 digital conversion grant from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB).  
   This project will allow WNIN to transition existing community programs to a digital multicast service fed from a single control source. A new facility will integrate four individual control units into one digital master control, thereby creating operational and cost reductions for the station. 
   "I am pleased that the CPB is helping WNIN update its technology. This grant will positively impact the station and its viewers as WNIN makes the transition to digital technology," Lugar said. 
   The award is among grants made to 37 local public television stations that the total $9.7 million. These funds are part of the nearly $220 million in funding that Congress has provided to CPB over the last six years to assist both public radio and public television stations to convert from analog to digital transmission. 
   So far, the CPB has distributed grants to 461 public radio stations to complete their digital transition. 
   The CPB is the largest single source of funding for public television and radio programming. It funds diverse and innovative programming, promotes public telecommunications services and invests in more than 1,000 local radio and television stations.
