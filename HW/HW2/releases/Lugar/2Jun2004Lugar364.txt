SEN. LUGAR NOTIFIED THAT INDIANAPOLIS WILL RECEIVE $16.8 MILLION GRANT
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded Indianapolis a Hope VI grant of $16.8 million for the revitalization of Brokenburr Trails. 
   The City of Indianapolis and the Indianapolis Housing Agency are currently undertaking a program to redevelop the area. The structures that once made up Brokenburr Trails have all been demolished. Development of new housing at the site is scheduled to take place soon.
   "I am pleased this project continues to receive support from the Department of Housing and Urban Development," said Lugar. "Earlier this year, I wrote to the agency and expressed my support for the project and outlined why I thought it was needed. Now that the funds have been awarded, I look forward to closely following the progress of this new development."
   The funds are designed to allow for large-scale improvements to occur in public housing. Specifically, the Hope VI money is targeted for physical improvements of facilities, management improvements and social services to address residents' needs.
   The redevelopment is expected to revitalize and attract new investment to the south side of Indianapolis. Utilizing an urban planning technique called Traditional Neighborhood Design, the development, once finished, will have a mixed-use of facilities for low and moderate income individuals. Additionally, the new development will better fit into its surrounding community, with streets that link up with the rest of the neighborhood and alleyways for parking cars and trash collection.
   In 2001, HUD provided a HOPE VI Demolition grant to remove all of the structures from Brokenburr Trails.
