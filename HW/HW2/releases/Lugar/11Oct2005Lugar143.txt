SOUTH BEND AWARDED ALMOST $12 MILLION HUD LOAN
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that South Bend will receive a loan totaling $11,980,000 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
   The loan awarded to South Bend is the Section 108 Loan Guarantee. Section 108, the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, is one of the most substantial public investment tools that HUD offers to local governments. 
   Section 108 allows local governments to transform a small portion of their CDBG funds into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects that can renew entire neighborhoods. Such public investment is often needed to inspire private economic activity, providing the initial resources or simply the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas. 
   Section 108 loans are not risk-free, however, local governments borrowing funds guaranteed by Section 108 must pledge their current and future CDBG allocations to cover the loan amount as security for the loan.
