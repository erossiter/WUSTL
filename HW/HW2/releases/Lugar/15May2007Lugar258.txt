TRIO UPWARD BOUND GRANTS AWARDED TO TEN INDIANA UNIVERSITIES
  Sen. Dick Lugar was informed recently by the U.S. Department of Education that ten universities in the state of Indiana have been selected to receive funding under the Upward Bound Program. The $3.4 million in funding will provide opportunities for approximately 700 participants in their precollege studies and in their higher education pursuits.  
   "It is important that we help more individuals attend and graduate from college," said Lugar. "Upward Bound has been successful in helping many high school students reach that goal." 
   Upward Bound provides fundamental support to participants in their preparation for college entrance. The goal of Upward Bound is to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of postsecondary education. Upward Bound Projects provide academic instruction in mathematics, laboratory sciences, composition, literature, and foreign languages. Tutoring, counseling, mentoring, cultural enrichment, and work-study programs are also supported. 
   Upward Bound serves: high school students from low income families; high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree; and low-income, first-generation military veterans who are preparing to enter postsecondary education. 
   Upward Bound falls under the umbrella of the Federal TRIO Programs, which are educational opportunity outreach programs designed to motivate and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
