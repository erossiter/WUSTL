SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES PRESENTATION OF SERVICE MEDALS
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that Corporal Glenn O. Glover will accept the American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Media, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one silver service star, World War II Victory Medal, and the WWII Honorable Service Label Button for his service during World War II. Corporal Glover served in the U.S. Army from November 4, 1939 to October 18, 1945.  
   Celina Weatherwax, Director of Lugar's Northwest Indiana office, will present the medals on Friday, May 19, 2006, at 1:00 p.m. in the VFW Hall, St. John Memorial Post #717, 10400 W. 93rd Avenue, St. John, Indiana 46373. 
   Celina will also present a letter from Lugar to Corporal Glover in recognition of his service. 
   "It is my pleasure to enclose the medals from the United States Army that you so richly earned during your military service," wrote Lugar. "The sacrifices made by you and all our servicemen and servicewomen during this time in our history are certainly most worthy of recognition for the bravery and heroic deeds performed with their comrades in arms." 
   Lugar wrote to the National Personnel Records Center on behalf of Corporal Glover to obtain the entitled medals. 
   In January 2006, Corporal Glover was interviewed by Lugar staff for the Library of Congress Veteran's History Project, which preserves the oral histories of Indiana veterans for future generations of authors, historians and students to use and experience. To date, more than 6,400 interviews have been collected by Lugar and his staff, and account for nearly one quarter of all the interviews on file at the Library of Congress.
