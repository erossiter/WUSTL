SEN. LUGAR PAYS TRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today joined in acknowledging International Women's Day.  
 In recognition of the inequalities facing women, Lugar co-sponsored a resolution declaring today International Women's Day and introduced the Protection of Vulnerable Populations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005. 
   "On this day we acknowledge the inequities continuing to face women around the globe. In many places in the world, discrimination continues to deny women and girls full political and economic equality. The lives and health of women and girls continue to be endangered by violence that is directed at them simply because they are female," said Lugar. 
   "During many of the humanitarian crises we have witnessed over the last decade, such as Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan, we have learned that women and children are uniquely vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation. Over the course of the past year, the world has observed with horror the accounts of rape of the women living in the camps in Darfur in Western Sudan. Our bill aims to improve our ability to protect women and children, like those in the tsunami-affected region and in Darfur, from the additional dangers they face during a humanitarian emergency," he continued. 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee supported Lugar's bill as an amendment to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. The authorization bill was approved 18-0. 
   As a part of Lifetime Television's 4th Annual "Stop Violence Against Women Week," Lugar is co-hosting a special event to commemorate International Women's Day with Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY).
