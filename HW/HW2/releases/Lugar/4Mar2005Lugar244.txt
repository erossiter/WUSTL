SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES 3RD ANNUAL DICK LUGAR JOB FAIR FOR SECURITY, DEFENSE, NURSING, FIRST RESPONDERS
  Sen. Dick Lugar today announced that he will host the Third Annual Dick Lugar Job Fair for Security, Defense, Nursing and First Responders April 22-23 in Indianapolis.  
 This two-day event will feature dozens of federal, state and local police departments and intelligence and security agencies, as well as nursing schools and hospitals looking to fill available positions. 
   "It is exciting to bring, once again, all of these agencies together in Indianapolis," said Lugar. "I hope that Hoosiers can play an important role in defending our homeland and serving as first responders and healthcare professionals." 
   At the Job Fair, agencies will distribute information and take applications from Hoosiers, with some employers conducting on-site interviews. Hosted by Raytheon and in cooperation with Nursing 2000, Nursing 2000 North Central and the Indiana University Department of Criminal Justice, this year's Job Fair also will include daily presentations focusing on resume building, federal law enforcement careers, nursing careers, and Small Business Administration (SBA) workshops.
