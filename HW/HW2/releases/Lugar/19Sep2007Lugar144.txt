SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES NATIONAL FARMERS UNION AWARD
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was presented yesterday with the 2007 Golden Triangle Award by the National Farmers Union (NFU) for his contributions to American agriculture and his leadership in promoting renewable fuels. 
   The Golden Triangle Award, the highest given by the NFU, is presented to select members of Congress or the administration in recognition of outstanding leadership on issues affecting rural America.
   For more than a decade, Lugar has stressed the strategic importance of energy security and the economic and security risks of dependence on oil. His legislative efforts promote sustainable energy production and use, incentives for renewable fuels like cellulosic ethanol and E85, increased fuel economy in cars and clean coal. The Lugar Energy Initiative at http://lugar.senate.gov/energy highlights the repercussions of America's dangerous dependence on imported oil and provides information on energy legislation introduced by Lugar, commentary by outside experts and information on alternative and renewable energy sources.
   Founded in 1902, the NFU is a general farm organization with a membership of nearly 250,000 farm and ranch families throughout the United States. NFU's primary goal has been to sustain and strengthen family farm and ranch agriculture. The key to this goal is NFU's grassroots structure in which policy positions are initiated locally, followed by possible adoption of the resolutions at the local, state and national levels.
   Lugar is a past recipient of the Golden Triangle Award.
