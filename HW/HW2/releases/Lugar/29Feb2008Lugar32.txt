SEN. LUGAR CELEBRATES READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar joined in acknowledging the National Education Association's Read Across America Day on Monday, March 3. Read Across America Day is an annual reading awareness program that encourages children across the nation to celebrate reading and stresses the role of reading in a child's learning process. The program also commemorates Dr. Seuss's birthday. 
  To commemorate Read Across America Day, Lugar encourages Hoosier parents to read to their children. "Today we celebrate reading with children so that it may enhance their learning, challenge their imagination and open their eyes to new possibilities," Lugar said.
  Lugar's education website, EducateIndiana, explores issues faced by parents, teachers and students. The purpose of the website is to share constructive ideas about education and offer students, parents, teachers, and administrators education tools that can be used both inside and outside of the classroom. 
  Lugar's website also includes an extensive section of education resources at EducateIndiana. EducateIndiana offers information on issues including drop-out prevention and adult education, higher education issues including financial aid assistance, and education resources for students, parents, teachers, and administrators. In addition, Lugar and the Indiana State Teacher Association (ISTA) have started a web-based initiative to recognize teachers and celebrate their vital role in preparing our future leaders.
