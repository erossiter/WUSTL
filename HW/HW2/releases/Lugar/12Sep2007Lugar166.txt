SEN. LUGAR SECURES $200,000 FOR IN RANDOLPH COUNTY CHILDCARE FACILITY
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar voted to secure $200,000 for the construction of an expanded childcare facility in Randolph County. The funding was approved as a part of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill which passed in the Senate today by a vote of 88-7. 
  "Adequate childcare is vital in addressing the needs of working families as well as employers," Lugar said. "The Randolph County YMCA will provide an affordable option for parents."
  Currently the YMCA provides 43 of the 306 childcare spots available in the county. With this funding the Randolph County YMCA would more than double their service to 93 spots.
  The expanded facility will offer licensed childcare and a state accredited preschool curriculum. The YMCA will continue participation in the State childcare voucher program for low-income families.
  Executive Director Ceann Bales wrote to Lugar to request federal funding for this project. Lugar received several letters supporting of the project from Randolph County community leaders, the Chamber of Commerce and children currently enrolled in the YMCA program.
  This project was included by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 12, 2007, at the request of Lugar. The legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. Should projects be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies. The bill then heads to the President for his signature.
