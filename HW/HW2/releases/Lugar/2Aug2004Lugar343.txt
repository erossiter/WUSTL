SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON INDY RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement today on the Indianapolis government-restructuring proposal.  
 Lugar created the original Indianapolis-Marion County Uni-Gov in 1969 when he was Indianapolis mayor. 
   "Mayor Bart Peterson gave me a Sunday evening telephone briefing on budget and local governmental restructuring proposals he will make today. He estimates that his proposals could result in $35 million annual savings for Marion County taxpayers. This would be good news for local taxpayers and for potential investors in jobs and buildings who would note a more competitive tax situation. 
   "The Mayor advised me that he would appoint task force groups to work through the details of the governmental restructuring, and I strongly endorse that idea. Membership of the task forces should be bipartisan, broadly representative of all parts of Marion County, and amply supplied with members who have legal and financial expertise. Ideally, some members of the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee who helped formulate the original Uni-Gov legislative package are still available for current participation. 
   "For many years, Indianapolis and Marion County have provided leadership to city and county government in our nation. Of all the large northern cities in America, we achieved the only successful city-county consolidation and became a magnet for new jobs and modern development. A new burst of energy and optimism is necessary for the present and the future. As always, this will require bipartisan wisdom and stamina to achieve. I would encourage all citizens to examine Mayor Peterson's proposals carefully and then to begin the political process which will lead to important taxpayer savings and better governmental decisions."
