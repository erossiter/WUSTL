SEN. LUGAR CALLS FOR EXTENSION OF ANDEAN TRADE ACT
  In a meeting Monday, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe discussed the importance of extending the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) which expires at the end of this year.  
   Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru currently benefit from the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act. This trade preference program authorizes the President to grant duty-free treatment or reduced tariffs to certain products, with more than half of all U.S. imports in 2005 from the Andean countries entering under these preferences. The provisions were included in the original Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) of 1991 and are to expire on December 31, 2006. In September 2006, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Congress to extend the Andean trade preferences through December 31, 2008. It is unclear if Congress will consider extending ATPDEA before the end of the year in the lame-duck session. 
   "Extending the preference program to all four countries - Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru - will strengthen the growing political and economic relationship between our nations and help bring new jobs and good will to the region," Lugar said. "I hope Congress does not let the act expire." 
   According to the International Trade Commission, in 2006 U.S. exports to the region totaled $8.9 billion, 16 percent above their 2004 level and 40 percent more than in 2001. U.S. exports increased to each ATPDEA country by 5 to 20 percent in 2005 from 2004. ATPDEA countries combined ranked 19th as a U.S. export market. 
   Lugar and Uribe also discussed the Free Trade Agreement between the Unites States and Colombia that will be signed on November 22.
