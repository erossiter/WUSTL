CONNERSVILLE AIRPORT RECEIVES $1.1 MILLION GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar announced that Connersville Mettel Field Airport received a $1,182,056 grant awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The funds will be used for projects to enhance the safety and capacity at air facilities and to help construct a taxiway to eliminate aircraft back-taxiing on the runway.  
   "This grant will further enhance the Connersville airport and compliment the prospects of an intermodal port. With geographic location, Connersville could develop a thriving logistics industry and continue to capitalize on its proximity to several population centers in the U.S.," Lugar said. 
   The award was given as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP). The AIP provides grants to airport authorities for the planning and development of public airports that are included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). 
   On September 12, 2007, Lugar voted to secure $500,000 for a feasibility study of an Intermodal Port in Connersville. The funding was approved as a part of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill which passed in the Senate. The legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. Should the project be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies. The bill then heads to the President for his signature. 
   Funding would be used to complete a feasibility study to create an intermodal facility with rail, air and road capabilities on a city-owned 74 acre site to increase economic development opportunities in the Town of Connersville and East Central Indiana.
