SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES PROGRESS IN NUNN-LUGAR COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION PROGRAM
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar today announced the following progress in the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program for June 2007: 
   * 7 Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) destroyed
   * 1 Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) mobile launcher destroyed
   * 1 Submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) eliminated
   * 3 train shipments of nuclear weapons were sent to safe and secure storage
  In November 1991, Lugar (R-IN) and former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA) authored the Nunn-Lugar Act, which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. This program has provided U.S. funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, related materials, and delivery systems. In 2003, Congress adopted the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, which authorized the Nunn-Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats. In 2004, Nunn-Lugar funds were committed for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to destroy chemical weapons in Albania, under a Lugar-led expansion of the program.
  The Nunn-Lugar scorecard now totals 6,982 strategic nuclear warheads deactivated, 651 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) destroyed, 485 ICBM silos eliminated, 101 ICBM mobile launchers destroyed, 612 submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) eliminated, 436 SLBM launchers eliminated, 30 nuclear submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles destroyed, 155 bomber eliminated, 906 nuclear air-to-surface missiles (ASMs) destroyed, 194 nuclear test tunnels eliminated, 351 nuclear weapons transport train shipments, 12 nuclear weapons storage site security upgrades, and 9 biological monitoring stations built and equipped. Perhaps most importantly, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn-Lugar program. Those countries were the third, fourth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers in the world.
  Beyond nuclear elimination, the Nunn-Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons and biological weapons, and has worked to reemploy scientists and facilities related to weapons of mass destruction in peaceful research initiatives. The International Science and Technology Centers, of which the United States is the leading sponsor, engaged 58,000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work. The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded 750 projects involving 14,000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high-tech jobs.
   Lugar makes annual oversight trips to Nunn-Lugar sites in the former Soviet Union. This August, the visit will include events in Moscow and Astana commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Nunn-Lugar program.
