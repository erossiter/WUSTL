PURDUE CHOSEN FOR REGIONAL UNIVERSITY TRANSPORTATION CENTER
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) that Purdue University is one of ten universities across the country selected to receive a Regional University Transportation Center (UTC) designation by the USDOT. Purdue University was chosen as a Regional UTC as part of a competitive selection process as outlined in the 2005 highway bill (SAFETEA-LU).  
   The UTC Program was initiated in 1987 with the mission "to advance U.S. technology and expertise in the many disciplines comprising transportation through the mechanisms of education, research and technology transfer at university-based centers of excellence." Regional UTCs are expected to work collaboratively with the U.S. Department of Transportation and to provide leadership in making national and regional contributions to solving immediate and long-range transportation challenges. Each Regional UTC is authorized under SAFETEA-LU to receive up to $2 million in each of FY 2007-2008 and $2.225 million in FY 2009, which must be matched dollar-for-dollar with non-federal funding.
