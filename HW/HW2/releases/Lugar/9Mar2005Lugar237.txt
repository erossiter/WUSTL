SEN. LUGAR INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO DESIGNATE 'HOLOCAUST COMMEMORATION WEEK'
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar introduced a resolution today designating the week of May 1, 2005, as "Holocaust Commemoration Week."  
   This legislation would commemorate the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the concentration camps. It would encourage Americans to commemorate the anniversary through reflection, acts of caring and education about the consequences of the Holocaust. 
   "The Holocaust is a horrific reminder to the world of the dangers inherent in racism and prejudice," said Lugar. "I hope this resolution will help promote a sensitivity for diversity and tolerance and an awareness that will prevent similar injustices from happening again." 
   "Holocaust Commemoration Week" coincides with Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, on May 6, 2005. 
   The resolution is co-sponsored by Sen. Evan Bayh (D-IN). Lugar worked with the Jewish Federation of Northwest Indiana, Inc. in drafting this resolution. 
   In January, Lugar co-sponsored a resolution in remembrance of the 60th anniversary of the liberation Auschwitz. This extermination camp in Poland was liberated by Allied Forces on January 27, 1945.
