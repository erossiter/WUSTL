SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRAC HEARING
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement regarding the BRAC Commission's hearing today:  
   "This is an expected request for further study of the optimal number of Defense Finance and Accounting Service sites nationwide. In my July 12 meeting with Secretary Principi, I asked about Secretary Principi's letter to Secretary Rumsfeld requesting more information. 'Is there an unraveling here?' I asked. Secretary Principi replied, 'No, not exactly, but they are thinking that they may reduce from seventeen sites to four or five, not three.' 
   "Today's hearing was apparently a formal suggestion to do that. We will continue to be closely engaged with the BRAC Commission to ensure against choices that might jeopardize the security of our Nation or lead to increased costs rather than savings."
