SENATE PASSES DARFUR PEACEKEEPING RESOLUTION
  The U.S. Senate has passed a resolution, introduced by Sens. Joe Biden and Dick Lugar, urging the President to work with the United Nations and other multinational efforts to increase peacekeeping in Darfur. The passage came yesterday as the United Nations authorized 26,000 troops and police for Darfur. 
   "I commend the United Nations for acting on Darfur yesterday by authorizing 26,000 peacekeeping troops. Also yesterday, the Senate approved Resolution 276, which asks the Bush Administration to urgently request the necessary funding to cover our portion of the costs of this vital mission," Lugar said.
   "We state in the resolution that failure of the international community to take all steps necessary to generate, deploy and maintain United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping forces will result in the continued loss of life and further degradation of humanitarian infrastructure in Darfur. History has shown that peacekeeping success depends on size, resources, mandate, mobility, and command structure of the force. And the mission must be accompanied by a peace-building process among the parties in the conflict. We strongly urge our government, as well as others, to act swiftly and robustly."

   Biden and Lugar also have pending legislation that would enable the Administration to pay more than $100 million in peacekeeping areas to the United Nations.
   Lugar legislation passed last year targets sanctions against parties responsible for continuing the atrocities and war crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan. Lugar is also the author of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act, which was signed by the President on December 23, 2004 (P.L. 108-497).
