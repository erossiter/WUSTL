SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S IMMIGRATION ADDRESS
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement regarding the President's address on immigration:  
   "Immigration policy should be updated in a comprehensive way to provide some realistic resolution to the status of at least 11 million undocumented immigrants. This should include greater border security, some provisions for a guest worker program and a potential plan for citizenship that may require illegal immigrants, who meet appropriate standards and criteria to pay a fine, undergo extensive preparation for citizenship and wait in line behind applications of immigrants who have sought entry and citizenship under legal procedures. 
   "I also support efforts like the DREAM Act. This bill would allow undocumented immigrants who grew up in the United States to earn legal status by obtaining an education and completing national or public service. It would grant conditional legal status to youth who successfully complete high school or its equivalent. They then would have six years to graduate from college or a trade school or join and serve honorably in the military. If successful in one of those areas, the conditional legal status would become permanent and they could then move towards U.S. citizenship."
