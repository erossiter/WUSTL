INDIANA UNIVERSITY - PURDUE UNIVERSITY AT INDIANAPOLIS RECEIVES MORE THAN $700,000 IN HEALTH RESEARCH GRANTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that that the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a $509,091 mental health research grant to Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI). Earlier this month, IUPUI received a cancer biology research grant in the amount of $236,999. Both grants come from offices within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  
   "We have made great strides in treatment for those with cancer and mental disorders, and this funding for IUPUI will assist the talented researches and scientists who work each day to improve treatments and find cures," said Lugar. 
   Senator Lugar has long supported increased funding for the NIH, which serves as the principal biomedical research agency of the federal government and is comprised of 25 separate institutes and centers of research, including the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Mental Health. The NIH seeks to improve the health of the American people by increasing the understanding of processes underlying human health, disability, and disease.
