DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ACCEPTING GRANT APPLICATIONS

   To be eligible for funding, Community Food Projects should be designed to: (1) (a) meet the food needs of low-income people; (b) increase the self-reliance of communities in providing for their own food needs; and (c) promote comprehensive responses to local food, farm and nutrition issues; and/or (2) meet specific state, local, or neighborhood food and agriculture needs for (a) infrastructure improvement and development; (b) planning for long-term solutions; or (c) the creation of innovative marketing activities that mutually benefit agricultural producers and low-income consumers. 
   Interested applicants should visit http://www.grants.gov/search/search.do?mode=VIEW&oppId=12255. Letters of intent must be submitted by Tuesday, February 13, 2007. 
   Lugar is an inaugural member of the Senate Hunger Caucus which provides a forum for Senators and staff to discuss and debate important hunger issues facing the United States and the world. Lugar joined the Hunger Caucus to further promote issues that he has long supported, such as incentives to promote charitable food donation, elimination of childhood hunger, foreign food aid, and health promotion. 
   In 2006, the Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act, which Lugar first introduced in the 106th Congress, became law. The bill allows farmers and small business owners to receive a tax deduction for food products contributed to food banks, pantries and homeless shelters for donations from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007. Previously, this deduction was available only to large corporations, not small businesses.
