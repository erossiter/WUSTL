  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Dick Lugar released the following statement following the death of Rep. Tom Lantos:
  "Tom Lantos was an extraordinary colleague and patriarch of a magnificent family. His fellow members of Congress held deep respect for his remarkable life story, his legislative accomplishments, and his love for the United States. We spent many hours together on the issues facing us, and like so many, I respected his wisdom and spirit. My thoughts are with Annette and his loved ones as they remember and celebrate the life of a dedicated public servant and family man."
