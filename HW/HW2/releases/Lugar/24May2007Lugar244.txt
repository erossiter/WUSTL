SEN. LUGAR SERVES APPLE PIES FROM DAS DUTCHMAN ESSENHAUS TO FELLOW SENATORS
  Sen. Dick Lugar hosted the Thursday Club Luncheon for members of the United States Senate on May 24, 2007, highlighting Hoosier Hospitality with food and gifts donated by Indiana restaurants and businesses to celebrate the 91st running of the Indianapolis 500.  
   This year's Thursday Club meal featured apple pie a la mode donated by Das Dutchman Essenhaus in Middlebury. The family-style restaurant first opened in 1971 and serves Amish and Mennonite home-style cooking including 29 varieties of pies. 
   The lunch hosted by Lugar also featured braised turkey forestier donated by Farbest Foods in Huntingburg and salad with award winning dressing donated by Holly Hock Hill in Indianapolis. 
   This year's Thursday Club also celebrates the Indy Car Series (ICS) decision to power its open-wheel cars on a 100 percent ethanol. At 17 tracks in the U.S. and around the world, ethanol will be show cased as a high-performance renewable fuel. Such visibility has been an important tool in further educating the public about the merits of ethanol and the growing urgency to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. Senators received model Team Ethanol racecars provided by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to commemorate the shift to ethanol. 
   The Thursday Club includes Republican Senators and began as a Wednesday Club with a small group of senators meeting in their personal offices for lunch. Today, senators rotate hosting duties of the weekly lunches, sharing food and gifts that represent their home states.
