INDIANAPOLIS PUBLIC SCHOOLS AWARDED $300,000 TO ADDRESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded Indianapolis Public Schools a $307,183 grant to improve student access to high-quality mental health services by developing innovative approaches that link school systems with the mental health systems. 
  "These funds will ultimately help high-risk students succeed, and I am pleased that Indianapolis Public Schools will have the opportunity to build upon this important program."
  Funds will be used to further develop the "Systems of Care" model for students at the highest risk for mental health issues by creating specialized Community Academic Partnership (CAP) schools that focus on high-need students. CAP will facilitate a change in mindset and supports necessary for the behavioral and academic success of students with social, emotional and behavioral needs. The project will fund the development of building-level leadership teams in CAP schools. Additionally, the district will provide training and technical assistance using a "train-the-trainer" method.
