SEN. LUGAR APPLAUDS FINANCE COMMITTEE'S PLANS TO MOVE ON AFRICA TRADE LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement regarding the Senate Finance Committee's plan to act on Africa trade legislation:  
   "In 2003, I introduced S.1900, African Growth and Opportunity Act III: The United States Africa Partnership Act of 2003. This extension of the successful African trade legislation known as AGOA is a time-sensitive matter. The AGOA provision that allows least developed countries (LDCs) to export capped quantities of apparel, made from third country fabric, to the U.S. duty free expires this September. Without extension before the expiration date, much of the economic progress already achieved by AGOA could be threatened. 
   "I applaud the commitment of Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus to moving on AGOA legislation. Such legislation is critical to further bolster the progress already made under AGOA and to ensure that African development is enabled. It is my hope that after consideration by the Finance Committee, AGOA legislation will receive favorable consideration by the Senate as a whole."
