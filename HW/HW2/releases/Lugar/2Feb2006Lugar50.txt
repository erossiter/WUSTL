FOREIGN RELATIONS DELEGATION TO VISIT UN, FEB. 6
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar will lead a delegation of committee members in a visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York.  
 Members will discuss the status of United Nations reform during meetings on Monday, February 6.
   "Those of us who strongly support the United Nations, and those who don't, find ourselves today in rare agreement: after more than 60 years of business as usual, the United Nations needs to overhaul its operations and modernize its management structure," Lugar said. "During our visit to the U.N., we will also discuss important issues of international energy security, weapons of mass destruction proliferation and Security Council consideration of the Iranian nuclear program."
   Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Norm Coleman (R-MN) and George Voinovich (R-OH) are scheduled to be a part of the delegation.
   The delegation will meet with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and the new U.N. Under Secretary General for Management, Christopher Burnham, who until recently served as the U.S. Department of State's Chief Financial Officer. Committee members will also meet with the Permanent Representatives from various countries including the current members of the Security Council and will have a media availability following the meeting. And they will meet with U.N. General Assembly President Jan Eliasson.
   The Foreign Relations Committee delegation will discuss the need for greater financial oversight and transparency of U.N. operations as well as more modern and streamlined management initiatives. Replacement of the United Nation's troubled Human Rights Commission with a Human Rights Council that is designed to bar the world's most repressive and undemocratic regimes from membership will also be a key topic of discussion.
