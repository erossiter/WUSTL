GRANT AWARDED TO LEBANON FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that Lebanon Fire Department will receive $26,244 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grants Program (AFGP) for operations and safety.  
   "It is essential to Hoosiers that we ensure our fire departments have adequate support, equipment and training," Lugar said. "These brave men and women fill the invaluable role as first responders and are the backbone of our communities." 
   The primary goal of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) is to meet the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the AFGP and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. 
   Fire departments with questions about the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program may reach the fire grants help desk toll free at 1-866-274-0960 or firegrants@dhs.gov. For the most current information regarding the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program, visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
