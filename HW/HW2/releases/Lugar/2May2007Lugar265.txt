SEN. LUGAR'S TEAM WINS AGAIN
  Sen. Dick Lugar's team finished first in the Senate division at the 26th Annual Capital Challenge 3-mile race to benefit the D.C. Special Olympics. It was the 8th time Lugar's team has won the Senate division.  
   Lugar is the only person to have run in all 26 races. Lugar was captain and one of five runners on his official team. Other Senate staffers ran the race as well. 
   Lugar's teams have finished in first place in 1988, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, and 2007. His teams finished second in 1987, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004, and 2005. Lugar was the fastest member of the Senate in 1984 and 1988. 
   The race includes senators, congressmen, executive branch agency heads, judges and the media. Twelve senators entered the race this year. 
   Lugar has been an advocate of physical fitness, health and preventative medicine throughout his career in public life. In September 2006, Lugar hosted the 28th Annual Dick Lugar Community Run, Walk, and Corporate Challenge as part of the Lugar Fitness Festival, which includes a free health fair.
