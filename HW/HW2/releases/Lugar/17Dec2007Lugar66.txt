SEN. LUGAR RANKED 15TH ON SENATE ALL-TIME VOTING LIST
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar today moved into 15th place on the all-time voting list in the Senate. His 11,678th vote was a yea vote in support of moving ahead with debate on S. 2248, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
  Lugar's vote moved him in front of former Sen. John Stennis (D-MS). Stennis voted 11,677 times during his 41 years, two months of service from November 5, 1947 to January 3, 1989.
  During his more than 30 years of Senate service, Lugar has maintained better than 98 percent attendance record. Of the 18 senators who began serving in 1977 with Lugar, no one has a better attendance record. Only one sitting senator who was elected before 1976, Robert Byrd (D-WV), has a better vote attendance record than Lugar.
  Lugar is currently the eighth most senior senator and the third on the Republican side of the aisle. He ranks 35th as the most senior senator in the history of the body and will move into 34th place on December 28, 2007. There have been 1,895 individuals to serve in the United States Senate since it was convened on March 4, 1789. In 1977, Lugar was the 1,705th Senator sworn into the Senate.
  On May 1, 1996, Lugar became the longest-serving Senator from Indiana when he surpassed Daniel Wolsey Vorhees (1877-1897). In 2006, Lugar was elected to an historic sixth term with more than 87 percent of the vote, his fourth consecutive victory by a two-thirds majority.
  Active Senators who have cast more than 11,678 votes include all-time record holder Robert C. Byrd (D-WV), Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Ted Stevens (R-AK), Pete Domenici (R-NM), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Joseph Biden (D-DE).
