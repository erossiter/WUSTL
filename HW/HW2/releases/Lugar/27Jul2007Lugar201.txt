REP. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE PASSAGE OF FARM BILL
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement on today's passage of a farm bill by the House of Representatives: 
   The Farm Bill passed by the House of Representatives is a severe blow to taxpayers, most farmers, rural communities, the environment, and U.S. prospects to export products.
   The House bill fails to reform an expensive and broken farm subsidy system. It will send more money to a few select farmers, while continuing to ignore the vast majority of American farmers. The President is justified in stating that he would veto this legislation.
   When the U.S. Senate considers farm policy later this year, I'm hopeful to build a coalition to advance legislation which allows ALL farmers to assure up to 85 percent of their net farm income through a government backed whole farm insurance program. In addition, ALL farmers would have IRA-type savings accounts to cover the balance of any losses.
   These reforms would also substantially increase rural development, research and deployment of energy from diverse biomass sources, conservation, and nutrition programs, while saving all taxpayers billions of dollars. A broad coalition of humanitarian assistance advocates including Bono, Bread for the World and Oxfam; conservationists such as the Environmental Defense; and obviously taxpayer advocate groups all support ending 70 years of inequitable farm subsidies.
