HUMANITARIAN RELEASE OF FATHER JEAN-JUSTE FACILITATED BY SEN. LUGAR
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar was informed at 11 a.m. today that Father Gerard Jean-Juste had been released from Prison in Haiti and was on his way to Miami for medical treatment.  
 Lugar learned of the release in a phone conversation with Haiti's Prime Minister Gerard Latortue. 
   The release came following a humanitarian request by Lugar in a letter delivered to the Haitian leader last week by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Tom Shannon. 
   "I ask that the Haitian Government grant the immediate humanitarian release of Father Jean-Juste in order for him to receive necessary medical treatment abroad," Lugar said in the letter to Latortue, dated January 19. 
   Lugar noted the international humanitarian call for Jean-Juste release because his advanced leukemia and concern "that if Father Jean-Juste contracts an infection, then the effects could be fatal." Lugar also noted that "Amnesty International designated Father Jean-Juste a prisoner of conscience." 
   Lugar said his we "delighted with the good news of his release" and "thankful that the calls for humanitarian release by Haitians, Hoosiers, many other Americans, and people around the world" had been answered.
