OVER $21 MILLION IN HUD GRANTS AWARDED TO INDIANA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that six Indiana communities will receive multiple grants totaling $21,095,080 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
   The types of grants awarded were the HOME Award, American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI), Community Development Black Grant (CDBG), and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG). 
   The HOME program helps to expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low-income families by providing grants to States and local governments to fund housing programs that meet local needs and priorities. 
   The ADDI is a new initiative under the HOME program that will promote homeownership opportunities by providing necessary resources for downpayment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority households. 
   The CDBG program provides annual grants to States and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, primarily for low-and-moderate-income persons. 
   The ESG program provides annual grants to States, local and private entities to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters.
