SEN. LUGAR, BOY SCOUTS HOST VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT DAY IN SOUTHPORT
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that his office will partner with Boy Scout Troop 120 to interview veterans for the Veterans History Project at the Southport Heights Christian Church located at 7154 McFarland Heights Road on Saturday, May 13 from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Boy Scout Troop 120 will also host a pancake breakfast as part of its annual Cornerstone Campout.  
   The Veterans History Project has already preserved the memories of nearly 6,500 Hoosier veterans in the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. 
   "Most Americans have simply lost touch with what it means to serve in the Armed Forces or to serve a cause greater than self. I believe it is important that veterans communicate to the next generation an understanding of the sacrifices and hardships involved in life in the military, which cannot be gained by reading books or watching movies," Lugar said. "I am pleased to work with Boy Scout Troop 120 to help ensure the memories of Indiana veterans are preserved in this important collection." 
   Veterans interested in participating are encouraged to visit the Southport Heights Christian Church on May 13 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Those unable to attend should contact Senator Lugar's office at (317) 226-5555 or at vetproject@lugar.senate.gov. 
   "The Library of Congress estimates that 1,700 veterans die in this country each day," Lugar said. "That sobering fact was an important reason Congress began the Veterans History Program. I am pleased that we can help Hoosiers record and preserve these powerful oral histories."
