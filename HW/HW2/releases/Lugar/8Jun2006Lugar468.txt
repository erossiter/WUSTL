SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF TERRORIST LEADER AL-ZARQAWI
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following comments today on the successful raid that killed al-Qaida leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq:  
   "The death of Zarqawi is an important break for the Allied Forces. He certainly has been a mastermind for terrorism and the insurgency. His leadership has led to the death of many innocent Iraqis, quite apart from the attacks upon our troops. The significance of Zarqawi is that he was especially insidious and unfortunately successful in the attacks upon Iraqis as well as our forces. This is a real blow to the insurgency. 
   "This will be helpful to the potential success of the new Iraqi government that is trying to establish control over the country. This is good news for the American people but even more so for the Iraqi people. They have been the major victims of Zarqawi."
