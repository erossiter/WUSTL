SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement on today's announcement regarding Ambassador John Bolton:  
 "I join President Bush in expressing deep regret that John Bolton will end his service as Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations. His leadership on the Security Council in recent months has built growing international consensus in meeting the growing dilemmas posed by North Korea, Iran, and Darfur. I appreciated his personal hospitality as he invited members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the U. N. Security Council and introduced us to representatives of other nations who are working with the United States and others who have strong differences. I thank him, in addition, for the many ways he has served our country, over many years, with strong idealism and personal commitment."
