SEN. LUGAR: SENATE RATIFIES TREATIES
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar announced that the Senate has ratified the following treaties:  
   * Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Bangladesh for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (Treaty Doc. 109-5) 
   * Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital (Treaty Doc. 109-4) 
   * Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America and the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances, and Gifts (Treaty Doc. 109-7) 
   * Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Sweden for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (Treaty Doc. 109-8) 
   "The agreements passed today will bolster the economic relationships between the United States and countries that are already close trade and investment partners. As the United States considers how to create jobs and maintain economic growth, it is important that we try to eliminate impediments that prevent our companies from fully accessing international markets. These impediments may come in the form of regulatory barriers, taxes, tariffs, or unfair treatment. In the case of taxes, we should work to ensure that companies pay their fair share, while not being unfairly taxed twice on the same revenue. Tax treaties are intended to prevent double taxation so that companies are not inhibited from doing business overseas. As the U.S. moves to keep the economy growing and to increase U.S. employment, international tax policies that promote foreign direct investment in the United States are critically important," said Lugar. 
   Under Lugar's chairmanship, the Foreign Relations Committee and the full Senate have approved 11 tax agreements including ones with Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Sri Lanka, the Netherlands, and Barbados.
