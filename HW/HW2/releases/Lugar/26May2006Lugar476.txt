FOUR HOOSIER VETERANS' STORIES PART OF NEW DIGITAL ARCHIVE
  Sen. Dick Lugar and the Library of Congress announced that the stories of four Hoosier veterans are included in a newly released digital collection: "Military Intel: The Inside Story." The selection of 22 digitized collections of materials submitted by war veterans who served in military intelligence is located on the Library of Congress' website at http://www.loc.gov/vets/stories/. The following Hoosiers participated in the VHP with the help of Lugar and his more than 230 partners from across the state:  
   * Spiro Cappony, a World War II Navy veteran, served from 1942 - 1945 in Turkey and Greece and earned the rank of Petty Officer First Class. Tim Sanders, formerly of Lugar's staff, interviewed him for the VHP in 2002. Cappony is from Griffith, Indiana. 
   * Robert Springsteen, a WWII Army veteran, served from 1942 - 1946 in Europe and earned the rank of Captain. Vicky Gadd, one of Lugar's VHP partners, interviewed him for the VHP in 2005. Springsteen is from Valparaiso, Indiana. 
   * James Shildmyer, an Army veteran, served from 1951 - 1953 and earned the rank of Sergeant. Phil Shaull of Lugar's staff interviewed him for the VHP in 2002. Shildmyer is from Marion, Indiana. 
   * Rene Defourneaux, an Army veteran, served from 1943 - 1965, including service in Europe and the China/Burma/India theater, and earned the rank of Major. Mark Doud of Lugar's staff interviewed him for the VHP in 2002. Defourneaux is from Indianapolis, Indiana. 
   While not included in the exhibit, Virginia Defourneaux, Rene's wife, served as an Army Nurse from 1943-1965 seeing service in the Pacific Theater and earning the rank of Major. She was also interviewed for the VHP in 2002. 
   In addition, Cappony and Springsteen will participate in the "Memorial Day Salute for Chicago Veterans and VHP Partners" at the National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday, May 27, 2006 from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. The ceremonial speakers include Dr. James Billington, Librarian of Congress. The event is free and open to the public. Tim Sanders, a former Lugar staff member, will attend the event and read a letter from Lugar. 
   Lugar joined with the Library of Congress in the Veterans History Project in February 2002 and has submitted more interviews to the collection on behalf of Indiana than any other state. 
   The more than 6,500 Lugar submissions come from all of Indiana's 92 counties and account for more than 15 percent of the Library's entire VHP collection. In an effort to collect as many interviews as possible, Lugar has partnered with over 230 individuals and organizations, including AARP Indiana and the Greater Indianapolis Chapter of the NAACP. The histories are permanently archived by the Library of Congress and over time will be available for research and study.
