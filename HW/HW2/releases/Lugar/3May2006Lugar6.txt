SEN. LUGAR INTRODUCES BILL TO ESTABLISH ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS AMBASSADOR
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar introduced legislation (S. 2697) yesterday to establish a U.S. Ambassador for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The bill aims to further strengthen ties between the United States and ASEAN.  
   "The United States maintains bilateral relationships with the ASEAN Member countries. However, as ASEAN develops an integrated free trade area and addresses matters of common concern with the United States - ranging from environmental and financial challenges to avian influenza and terrorism - it is appropriate for the United States to enhance its overall relationship with ASEAN. 
   "With this in mind, my legislation establishes the position of U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN, subject to advice and consent of the Senate. I believe this initiative will be an important step in advancing an already positive relationship. In addition, I am hopeful that once the position is established, the U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN will help facilitate ongoing implementation of the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership, announced last November by ASEAN leaders and President Bush," Lugar said on introducing the bill. 
   The bill recommends that a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State serve with Ambassadorial rank. ASEAN is comprised of Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN was originally established in 1967 with five members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
