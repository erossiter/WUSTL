SEN. LUGAR ENCOURAGES VENEZUELA'S NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO INVITE EUROPEAN UNION TO OBSERVE VENEZUELAN RECALL
  In a statement released today, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar stated that more international missions are needed to observe Venezuela's August 15 recall referendum on President Chavez:  
   "Having international observation provides a sure way of guaranteeing transparency in the Venezuelan recall referendum process and outcome. For the United States, Venezuela is too important to ignore. The values and practices that make the United States a beacon of democracy are in jeopardy in Venezuela, a nation with profound economic and cultural ties to our own. The international community as a whole must stand firm to aid democracy in Venezuela and to help ensure that this referendum is a fair and transparent act. 
   "Over the last two years the international community, under the leadership of the Organization of American States and the Carter Center, has been working to find a solution to the political crisis in Venezuela using provisions of its new constitution which provide for a binding recall referendum for certain public officials, including the President. The OAS and the Carter Center will observe the referendum. However, questions still persist regarding missions from Latin American countries, and Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) has not invited the European Union. 
   "The more observation the better. In addition to the OAS and Carter Center we should encourage the CNE to invite more observer missions, especially one from the European Union."
