SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH ACTRESS ANGELINA JOLIE ON U.N. REFUGEE EFFORTS
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar met today with United Nations Refugees Agency Goodwill Ambassador and actress, Angelina Jolie. 
   Ms. Jolie was in Washington to launch World Refugee Day events with Secretary of State Colin Powell.
   Since she was named United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Goodwill Ambassador, Ms. Jolie has worked tirelessly toward building advocacy and support for refugees and their assistance and protection. In 2001, she traveled to Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Cote D'Ivoire, Cambodia, and Pakistan in order to visit refugees. Since then, she has traveled to Namibia, Thailand, Ecuador, Kosovo, Chechnya, Jordan and Sri Lanka.
   Last week Ms. Jolie visited UNHCR's emergency operations in Chad where she assisted in the transport and assistance of the 160,000 Sudanese refugees who have fled the fighting in western Sudan's Darfur region. She stressed the urgency of funding more assistance for Sudanese refugees in Chad after seeing first-hand the situation in the border area.
