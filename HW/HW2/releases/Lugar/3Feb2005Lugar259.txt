SEN. LUGAR CO-SPONSORS FOREIGN LANGUAGE RESOLUTION
  Sen. Dick Lugar has co-sponsored S. Res. 28, which was introduced this week and would designate the year 2005 as a "Year of Foreign Language Study."  
   "Students in America now are not as competitive as we need to be in language skills," said Lugar. "It is my hope that this resolution will help young people to be motivated to study foreign languages." 
   The resolution recognizes the academic, economic and national security benefits of foreign language study by promoting the expansion of foreign language studies in elementary schools, secondary schools, institutions of higher learning, businesses, and government agencies throughout the country. Furthermore, it calls upon the President and Americans to support these initiatives through local ceremonies and other activities. 
   Lugar co-sponsored similar legislation in the 108th Congress.
