SEN. LUGAR FREE PRESS INITIATIVE PASSES CONGRESS
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar announced that Congress passed an initiative yesterday to establish and manage a free and independent network group to coordinate and promote the development of sustainable, free press in the world as part of the 9/11 Commission legislation. This legislation is similar to an initiative proposed by Lugar.  
   The legislation directs the State Department to provide grants to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) "to provide funding to a private sector group." It states the free and independent media network group should: 
   * Fund a clearinghouse to collect and share information concerning international media development and training; 
   * Improve research in the field of media assistance and program evaluation to better inform decisions regarding funding and program design for government and private donors; 
   * Explore the most appropriate use of existing means to more effectively encourage the involvement of the private sector in the field of media assistance; and 
   * Identify effective methods for the development of a free and independent media in societies in transition. 
   "The United States government, through various agencies and programs, long has been involved in helping to train journalists around the world and establish newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations," Lugar explained. "These programs, however, are not centralized in one bureau or agency. Many are orphans to other assistance programs. They are effective in training journalists, but they stop short of ensuring that the media in a developing country has the necessary legal protections, follows basic rules of fairness and equal access, and can sustain itself financially." 
   To better organize and focus these efforts, Lugar proposed his legislation earlier this year that passed the Foreign Relations Committee. Legislative language similar to Lugar's bill was then included in the legislation to implement many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission report. 
   By focusing and organizing new and existing government funded free and open media initiatives at the NED, Lugar said the private media sector can participate. "There is a strong desire by our finest journalism schools, newspapers, broadcasters, and marketing and advertising enterprises to help build free press and open media in the world," Lugar said. "We also need to engage all the new media, like Internet companies and wireless forms of communications." 
   "For more than 20 years the National Endowment for Democracy has been leading American efforts to help build the required democratic institutions of a free society," Lugar explained. "It is important to note that the National Endowment for Democracy has established a reputation in the world for integrity and transparency. They are ambassadors of the best traditions of American democracy, and they have provided continuity to democratization efforts, even as administrations and policies have changed."
