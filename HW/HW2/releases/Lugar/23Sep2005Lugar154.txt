SEN. LUGAR SECURES FUNDING FOR CRANE IN MILITARY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill which passed the Senate 98-0 yesterday included $8,220,000 for Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center\'s Special Weapons Engineering Facility.  
 The bill also includes over $70.7 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
   "The Naval Surface Warfare Center is the largest employer in southern Indiana and this additional funding to construct a new weapons development facility will strengthen Crane's mission capabilities and continue to diversify its portfolio," said Lugar. 
   The Special Weapons Engineering Facility buys existing military hardware and modifies it to suit the mission capabilities of special operations personnel from the Army, Navy and Marine Corp. Each year, they train 150 special operations personnel to effectively use the modified military hardware. 
   The Special Weapons Engineering Facility began as a small 5-man operation in an old warehouse and has grown to 150 employees. Its mission has multiplied, due to the increased needs of special operations since September 11, 2001. 
   The funds secured by Lugar will be used to build a new facility to house the growing operation. 
   The Military Appropriations bill also includes $23.3 billion for medical services for veterans, which includes $1.977 billion to address the fiscal year 2006 shortfall. 
   In April, Lugar and Sen. Bayh (D-IN) wrote a letter to the Subcommittee on Military Construction in support of Crane's project.
