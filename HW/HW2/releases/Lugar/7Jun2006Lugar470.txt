SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES PRESENTATION OF SERVICE MEDAL
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that First Lieutenant Harry Allison will accept the Navy Commendation Medal for his service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II.  
   Celina Weatherwax, Director of Lugar's Northwest Indiana office, will present the medal on Wednesday, June 14 at 9:00 a.m. on the east side of the Historic Crown Point Courthouse on the Square in Crown Point. Crown Point Mayor Dan Klein will assist with the presentation. 
   Lieutenant Allison was awarded a Letter of Commendation for the period of June 30 - September 23, 1943. During World War II, the Letter of Commendation was converted to the Navy Commendation Medal. 
   Celina will also present a letter from Lugar to Lieutenant Allison in recognition of his service. 
   "It is my pleasure to enclose this medal from the United States Marine Corps that you so richly earned during your military service," wrote Lugar. "The sacrifices made by you and all our servicemen and servicewomen during this time in our history are certainly most worthy of recognition for the bravery and heroic deeds performed with their comrades in arms." 
   Lugar wrote to the National Personnel Records Center on behalf of Lieutenant Allison to obtain the entitled medal. 
   In June 2006, Lugar staff interviewed Lieutenant Allison for the Library of Congress Veteran's History Project, which preserves the oral histories of Indiana veterans for future generations of authors, historians and students to use and experience. To date, more than 6,500 interviews have been collected by Lugar and his staff, and account for nearly one quarter of all the interviews on file at the Library of Congress.
