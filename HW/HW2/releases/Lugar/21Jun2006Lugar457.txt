SEN. LUGAR CONGRATULATES JEFFERSON AWARD RECIPIENT PEGGY JO ALBERTSON OF FORT WAYNE
  Sen. Dick Lugar met with Peggy Jo Albertson of Fort Wayne on Tuesday, June 20, 2006. Albertson was named a 2006 recipient of the Jefferson Award for community and public service.  
   Albertson was recognized for her leadership in forming a local chapter of Project Linus, an organization that makes blankets for traumatized or sick infants and children. She organized volunteers aged 8 to 94 years old to make and provide blankets that are warm, colorful and comforting to traumatized or sick youth and serve as a reminder that someone cares about their security. Albertson is also active in the Kids Helping Kids Program, which teaches young people the importance of philanthropy. 
   The Jefferson Award was founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, U.S. Senator Robert Taft, Jr. and Sam Beard. The intent was to create a "Nobel Prize" for community and public service. Since its inception, the Jefferson Awards has recognized citizens exhibiting the highest degree of leadership and service within their state and nation. Annually, there are two local winners selected from each state, as well as four from the nation at-large. 
   Holly Dunn-Pendleton of Evansville also received a 2006 Jefferson Award for her assistance to victims of sexual violence and in a surprise presentation was named one of five people to receive the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting Local Communities out of the 74 local winners from throughout the country. 
   Peyton Manning was recognized as one of four recipients of the 2006 National Jefferson Award. The Indianapolis Colts quarterback received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 or Under.
