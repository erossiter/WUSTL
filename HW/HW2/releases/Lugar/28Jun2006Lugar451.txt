SEN. LUGAR CONGRATULATES PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLAR LAURA MARCUS OF INDIANAPOLIS
  Sen. Dick Lugar visited today with Laura B. Marcus of Indianapolis in his Washington, D.C. office. Laura is one of two Indiana students to be recognized by the Commission on Presidential Scholars and the U.S. Department of Education as a 2006 Presidential Scholar.  
   Laura recently graduated from North Central High School in Indianapolis. Laura is one of 141 students honored this year as a Presidential Scholar out of 2,700 students invited to apply for recognition. Her outstanding performance in the classroom and on standardized tests, leadership activities and contributions to family, school and community earned Laura the distinction as a Presidential Scholar. 
   Lugar congratulated Laura on her achievement and recognized that "this honor is indicative of the dedication and hard work that you bring to your studies." 
   The Presidential Scholars Program has honored graduating high school students since 1964 for their academic excellence, artistic accomplishments and civic contributions. The 141 Presidential Scholars honored annually for their scholarship and service include one young man and one young woman from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and from U.S. families living abroad, plus 15 additional "at-large" Scholars. 
   Neehar Garg from St. Joseph's High School in Granger, Indiana, was the other Indiana student to be recognized as a Presidential Scholar this year.
