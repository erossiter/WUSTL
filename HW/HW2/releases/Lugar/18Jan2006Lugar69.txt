SEN. LUGAR ENCOURAGES HOOSIERS TO CLAIM EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
  Sen. Dick Lugar joined today with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in encouraging Hoosiers to determine if they are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). St. Vincent Unity Development Center, St. Vincent Hospital, Jubilee Center, Neighborhood Christian Legal Clinic, Indiana Business College, Indiana Department of Revenue, Indianapolis Housing Agency, Butler University, Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, Indianapolis Asset Building Company, Eastern Star Church, U.S. Small Business Administration, Citizens Gas, IUPUI, Notre Dame Alumni Club of Indianapolis, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Indiana Youth Institute, Family Readiness Group, and AARP joined Lugar and the IRS at the event.  
   Enacted by Congress in 1975, the EITC is a refundable tax credit available to families with a working member where the family income falls below a certain level. The EITC was designed to decrease the tax burden and supplement wages, as well as provide incentive to work. When the EITC exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax credit for those taxpayers who qualify and claim the credit. 
   According to the IRS, more than 417,000 Hoosiers claimed the federal EITC in 2004 for refunds totaling $735 million. 
   Nationally, the IRS estimates that between 20 and 25 percent of qualified Americans do not claim the EITC. In Indiana, the IRS estimates that 15 percent or more of qualifying Hoosiers do not apply for the EITC. Therefore, the amount of unclaimed funds would exceed $100 million for 2005. In addition, taxpayers who qualify can retroactively claim three years of the EITC if eligible in the previous years. 
   To qualify for the EITC, taxpayers must file a tax return, even if they are not required to file a tax return based on income, and meet ONE of the following income qualifications for 2005: 
   * Have two or more children with earned income less than $35,263 if single or $37,263 if married and filing jointly; 
   * Have one child with earned income less than $31,030 if single or $33,030 if married and filing jointly; 
   * Have no children with earned income less than $11,750 if single or $13,750 if married and filing jointly. 
   In addition to meeting one of the income qualifications, taxpayers must meet ALL of the following requirements: 
   * Must file a tax return; 
   * Must have earned income; 
   * Must be between 25 and 65 years of age, or have a qualifying child; 
   * Cannot be claimed as a dependent by any one else; 
   * Must have a valid Social Security number; 
   * Must be a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident; 
   * Must have lived in the U.S. for at least six months; 
   * Cannot file as married filing separately; 
   * Cannot file Form 2555 or Form 2555-EZ; 
   * Investment income cannot exceed $2,700. 
   For assistance in determining eligibility, taxpayers may use the EITC Assistant, a new web-based tool.
