TELL CITY HEAD START RECEIVES $1.1 MILLION GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded Tell City Head Start a $1,158,387 grant. Funding will be used for handicapped training and technical assistance.
  "Head Start is one of the most valuable programs funded by the federal government," said Lugar. "This program has proven beneficial as it serves to prepare children to start school and emphasizes parental involvement in the development of their children."
  Federal funding from the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families has enabled Head Start programs to provide comprehensive services for low-income Hoosier children and their families for more than 35 years. Head Start programs serve children ages three through five. In 1994, federal legislation was passed to establish Early Head Start services for pregnant women, infant and toddlers (ages birth to three). All programs provide early childhood educational, social, medical, dental, nutritional, and mental health services to the enrolled children.
  According to the organization, the Head Start philosophy is based on the following three key points,
   * Comprehensive child development services. To develop fully and to achieve social competence, children and their families need a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to early childhood development and health services as well as family and community partnerships. 
   * Parent involvement. Parents are encouraged to become involved in all aspects of the Head Start program, including shared governance in policy and program decisions that respond to their interests and needs. Additionally, Head Start programs work in close partnership with parents and other family members to develop and utilize their strengths so that all involved adults may successfully support child, personal and family goals. 
   * Community partnerships and community-based services. Specific models of service provision flow out of the characteristics of different communities. To fulfill program and community goals, Head Start programs build linkages and collaborations with other service providers and leaders in the community.
