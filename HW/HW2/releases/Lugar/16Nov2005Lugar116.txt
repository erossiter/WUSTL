INDIANA UNIVERSITY RECEIVES $1.4 MILLION FOR RESEARCH INSTITUTE
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that Indiana University will receive $1.4 million for the Solar Proton Radiobiology Institute (SPRI) as part of the Science, State, Commerce, Justice and Related Agencies Conference Report that passed the Senate today.  
 The funds will establish the institute and conduct research at the IU Cyclotron Facility at the Bloomington campus and at the School of Medicine at the Indiana University - Purdue University campus in Indianapolis. The Space Hardware Optimization Technology (SHOT) in Greenville, Indiana will partner with IU on the project. 
   The bill now heads to the President for his signature. 
   One challenge to the success of NASA's new vision for human space exploration is the effect of ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar eruptions known as "proton storms" on the space crew. While the agency already has research programs addressing the increased risk of cancer and nerve damage due to galactic cosmic rays, SPRI and IU will research the impact of proton storms and test the vulnerability of crew members after their immune systems are weakened following several months or years in space. 
   IU School of Medicine scientists are among the nation's experts in the fields of immunology and hematology. The IU Cyclotron facility is capable of simulating all of the characteristics of a solar proton storm, and its scientists are experts in proton dose measurement and proton beam control. Together with SPRI, IU scientists will provide NASA research that is expected to lead to effective biomedical countermeasures and improved spacecraft design.
