SEN. LUGAR'S AMENDMENT ADDED TO INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that an amendment to reform the appointment process has been added to the intelligence reform bill being considered by the Senate. The amendment, cosponsored with Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH), is the result of long efforts by Lugar to streamline the appointment and confirmation process.  
   Since 1997, Lugar has argued that one of the biggest problems during an election transition is the lack of personnel in place to appropriately perform the duties of the executive branch. Lugar maintains that the procedures used to fill these offices are too slow and unnecessarily complex, repelling the people they seek to recruit. 
   The 9/11 Commission Report agreed with Lugar's views, especially regarding national security personnel: "Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking for national security appointments. We think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities more quickly." 
   The Voinovich-Lugar amendment calls for multiple reports by the Office of Government Ethics to evaluate the financial disclosure process for executive employees and to review, along with the Attorney General, the conflict of interest laws. The Office of Personnel Management would also be required to provide the new administration within 15 days of coming into office details of all positions that need to be filled by the appointment process. 
   In 2001, Lugar and Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN) introduced a bill to reform the nominations process. Although the bill passed through the Government Affairs Committee, the full Senate never took it up. 
   Lugar's amendment is part of the intelligence reform bill, expected to be completed by the Senate next week.
