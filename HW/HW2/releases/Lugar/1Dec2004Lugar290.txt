SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES $679,000 FOR MUNCIE TRANSIT
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced today that $679,612 in federal funds has been approved for the Muncie Public Transportation Corporation.  
 The transit funds, released by the Federal Transit Administration, will be used to purchase four new 35-foot low-floor buses. 
   "This is good news for the City of Muncie," Lugar said. "I commend Mayor Canan and transit officials in Muncie for their work to identify the needs of the City." 
   The funds were approved by Congress as a special set aside for the Transit Consortium, a number of Indiana transit agencies working together to obtain federal grants. Lugar requested that special funds be set aside for Muncie in the FY 2004 Transportation spending bill.
