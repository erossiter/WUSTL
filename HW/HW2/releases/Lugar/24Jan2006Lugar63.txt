SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PROPOSED TOLL ROAD LEASE
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement today on the proposed Indiana Toll Road lease:  
   "For decades, the problem for Indiana transportation has been insufficient funds to maintain, upgrade and expand our highways. Since 1991, Indiana's U.S. senators and house members have been able to dramatically increase the amount of federal money returned to Indiana by $3.5 billion. Indiana has had the opportunity to prioritize projects to use the funding. However, there has never been a new funding source large enough to complete the projects on the drawing board. Governor Daniels' announcement of the proposed Indiana Toll Road lease is the first innovative approach to highway funding to come along since the original construction of the Toll Road. 
   "Foreign investments coming to Indiana indicate our economic vitality and a bullish view of Indiana by those making the investment and for those we are competing to attract. Foreign-based firms are among the state's leading employers in steel and automobiles. They have stimulated new investment and more better paying jobs for Hoosiers. The same will be true of this new $3.85 billion Toll Road lease. The money will be reinvested into the state, employing Hoosiers in construction jobs, resulting in a tremendous economic multiplying effect. 
   "Also this would not be the first time that a foreign-owned firm managed part of the Indiana transportation system. Britain-based BAA, currently manages the Indianapolis Airport."
