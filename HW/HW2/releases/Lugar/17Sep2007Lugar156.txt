ELKHART COMMUNITY SCHOOLS/WVPE PUBLIC RADIO AWARDED $106,036 GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that Elkhart Community Schools (ECS)/WVPE Public Radio has been awarded a $106,036 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
  "I support the vision of ECS and WVPE to promote lifelong learning throughout the entire community by extending service to residents and improving service for all listeners," said Lugar, who wrote a letter in support of Elkhart's application. "I believe that public broadcasting provides valuable educational, historical and children's programming to a large number of viewers and listeners, as evidenced by the consistent increase in private support over the years." 
  The grant will be used to replace antenna and other systems as part of the digital conversion and improvement of WVPE's coverage. 
  WVPE, now celebrating its 35th year in operation, plans to use this grant funding to expand facilities of the existing station in order to extend service to nearly 55,000 residents of north central Indiana and southwest Michigan who are currently without access to public radio. WVPE, which stands for the "Voice of Public Education," will also establish full digital broadcasting with a new, relocated transmission facility. 
  Please contact the Department of Commerce at 202-482-3663 for more information regarding this grant. Questions regarding the grants process in general may be directed to Kim Preston, Grants Coordinator for Senator Lugar, by phone at 202-224-4814 or by email at grants@lugar.senate.gov
