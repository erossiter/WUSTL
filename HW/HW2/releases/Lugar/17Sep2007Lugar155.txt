WFIU AWARDED $372,765 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the WFIU Public Radio has been awarded a $372,765 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
  "I believe that public broadcasting provides valuable educational, historical and children's programming to a large number of viewers and listeners, as evidenced by the consistent increase in private support over the years," said Lugar. 
  Funds will be used to activate a supplemental digital audio channel to provide a second public radio choice to the WFIU service area. It will also be used to complete DTV conversion of IU's television station, WTIU, by acquiring HD production equipment.
  Please contact the Department of Commerce at 202-482-3663 for more information regarding this grant. Questions regarding the grants process in general may be directed to Kim Preston, Grants Coordinator for Senator Lugar, by phone at 202-224-4814 or by email at grants@lugar.senate.gov
