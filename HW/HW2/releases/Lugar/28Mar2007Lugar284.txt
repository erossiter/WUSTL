SEN. LUGAR INTRODUCES U.S.-BRAZIL ENERGY PACT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar introduced today a bill that would establish cooperation between the United States and Brazil for energy security in the Western Hemisphere, biofuels production, cellulosic ethanol research, and infrastructure improvements.  
   "Our efforts to promote alternative fuels and reduce dependence on oil will have maximum benefit through vigorous partnership abroad. All possibilities for growth in biofuels production must be explored to decrease our 'oil addiction.' President Bush took an important first step in this direction by signing a strategic partnership with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Sao Paulo earlier this month. I strongly encourage the two leaders to consider my broader approach when they meet for a second time this month at Camp David on Saturday," Lugar said. 
   "Giving the United States easy access to foreign ethanol supplies, even as we increase domestic production, is an essential component to meet President Bush's target of 35 billion gallons of renewable fuels use by 2017, which cannot be met by U.S. corn ethanol alone. U.S. corn ethanol production will peak around 14 billion gallons in 2010, experts estimate. Reducing dependence on oil imported from unstable and often hostile regions is a foreign policy imperative," Lugar said. 
   "This legislation could, in short order, create a thriving Western Hemisphere biofuels marketplace that would alleviate poverty, create jobs and increase income, improve energy security, strengthen nations' independence, and protect the environment. If implemented vigorously and expansively, this partnership would signal a transformational change in U.S. policy on Latin America, a true collaboration between North and South on an economic and security strategy that would benefit all," said Lugar. 
   The United States-Brazil Energy Cooperation Pact of 2007 would: 
   * Establish a regional energy forum as a standing but flexible mechanism to advance energy issues and an emergency cooperation mechanism to deter political manipulation of oil trade; 
   * Undertake feasibility studies to assess each Latin American country's biofuel needs and biomass production potential, with particular emphasis on helping the poorest countries in the region that are also dependent on foreign fuel, and attention to food security and the environment; 
   * Establish a grant program for advanced biofuels research collaboration; 
   * Increase international extension services for energy crops and conservation; 
   * Promote a carbon trading system to encourage preservation of tropical rain forests in the face of growing demand for energy crops; 
   * Seek ways to help optimize Mexican oil output, which is lagging to the detriment of the region, and encourage South America to exploit fully its natural gas supplies with new pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities; 
   * Call for a study of political and economic impacts of the tariff on ethanol and the impacts of repealing or modifying it. 
   Authorize to be appropriated $59 million for 2008 to implement this legislation.
