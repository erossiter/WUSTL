SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES $87,152 AWARD TO HUDSON VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that Hudson Volunteer Fire Department will receive a Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant for $87,152. SAFER grants are administered by theU.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program (AFGP) and will allow the Hudson Volunteer Fire Department to hire additional staff. 
   "The brave men and women who serve as first responders are the backbone of our communities. It is vital that we ensure our fire departments and emergency medical services have the support, equipment and training they require," Lugar said. "I encourage Hoosier fire departments to contact me to explore grant opportunities and ways which we may be helpful."
   The primary goal of the SAFER grant is to enhance fire department's abilities to maintain 24-hour staffing and to assure that communities have needed protection from fires and fire hazards.
   The U.S. Fire Administration is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and administers the AFGP and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
   Fire departments with questions about the AFGP program may reach the fire grants help desk toll free at 1-866-274-0960 or firegrants@dhs.gov For the most current information regarding the AFGP, visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
