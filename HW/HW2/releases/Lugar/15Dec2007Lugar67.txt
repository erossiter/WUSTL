SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON REP. CARSON
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement today on Rep. Julia Carson. She died this morning at age 69. 
  "Char and I extend our thoughts and prayers to Julia Carson's family as they remember her remarkable life. 
  "Eight years ago we worked together on successful legislation to expand access to the then underused and not well known Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Cong. Carson's comments at the time exemplified her typical compassion for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable of our community: 
  'Money alone will not solve America's health care challenges. We must maximize our existing resources by being more creative and aggressive in our outreach efforts and making it easier for families to tap into these benefits. We all know that children who do not get routine, preventative health care will not reach their full potential. We simply cannot afford to put our children at that disadvantage.' 
  "Her advocacy will be deeply missed."
