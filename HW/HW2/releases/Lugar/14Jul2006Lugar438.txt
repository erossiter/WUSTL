IRAQ LETTER #14: AMBASSADOR KHALILZAD'S ASSESSMENT
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today sent the fourteenth letter in a series of letters to his fellow Members of Congress to "strive to elevate our debate by studying thoughtful sources of information and embracing civility in our discourse." Below is the text of the fourteenth letter. Each letter and any reports mentioned are available at http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq.  
   Yesterday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held its 32nd hearing on the situation in Iraq since the eve of the war in 2003. Our witness was the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, the Honorable Zalmay Khalilzad, who took over the job in Baghdad approximately one year ago. 
   The statement Ambassador Khalilzad delivered before the Foreign Relations Committee, as well as a copy of the speech he made on Tuesday, July 11th at the Center for Strategic and International Studies are on my website at http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq. 
   The Ambassador emphasized the "positive developments, which give the Iraqi government and friends of Iraq real hope." But he also described "several challenges to Iraq's new government [that] persist or have become more severe and will require adjustments and new efforts to resolve." 
   During his responses to questions from Senators, the Ambassador stated: "I urge that we be patient, because the issues that the Iraqis are dealing with are difficult, complicated issues that will take time to resolve?.I believe that they are moving in the right direction, but there are also countervailing forces, both internal and regional, that would like this Iraq not to succeed." He listed five efforts that he and his Embassy team are pursuing to stem sectarian violence and bring about stability in Iraq. 
   I hope you find the Ambassador's statements helpful as the Congress continues to consider policy options related to Iraq.
