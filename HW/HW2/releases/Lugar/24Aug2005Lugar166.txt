INDIANA RECEIVES MORE THAN $1.8 MILLION IN FIRE GRANTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified today that Indiana will receive $1,894,611 in firefighter assistance grants from the Department of Homeland Security.  
   The award is among grants made to fire departments throughout the U.S. announced this week in the second round of the 2005 Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program (AFGP). 
   For the 2005 program, $650 million was appropriated to provide assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. 
   Applicants were invited to apply for funds in the following three supported program areas: Operations and Firefighter Safety Program, Fire Prevention Program and Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program. 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the AFGP and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
