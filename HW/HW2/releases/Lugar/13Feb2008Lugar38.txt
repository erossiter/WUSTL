COMMITTEE ENDORSES NATO MEMBERSHIP ACTION PLANS FOR GEORGIA, UKRAINE
  The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has unanimously approved a resolution in favor of extending a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia and Ukraine. The resolution was introduced by Sen. Dick Lugar and Chairman Joe Biden. 
  The full resolution can be found at: http://lugar.senate.gov/sfrc/pdf/NATOMAP.pdf.
  "NATO has a long track record of support for continued enlargement of NATO to democracies that are able and willing to meet the responsibilities of membership. The leaders of Georgia and Ukraine have clearly stated their desire to join NATO and both have made remarkable progress towards meeting NATO standards," said Lugar. 
  "MAP implementation is no longer simply an activity that focuses on military and security issues. Inter-ministerial meetings engage other governmental departments in a coordinated and systematic approach with the goal of governmental wide reform and progress. These goals include settling international, ethnic or external territorial disputes by peaceful means; demonstrating a commitment to the rule of law and human rights; and promoting stability and prosperity through economic reform, social equality, and environmental responsibility. Each participant is free to choose the elements of MAP best suited to their own national priorities and circumstances. In other words, if approved at the NATO summit at Bucharest, Romania in April, Tbilisi and Kyiv will set their own objectives, targets, and work schedules."
