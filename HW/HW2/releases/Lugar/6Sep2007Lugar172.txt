SEN. LUGAR WORKS TO REAUTHORIZE TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION ACT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar (R-IN), the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today again joined with the Committee Chairman Joe Biden (D-DE) to further the cause of tropical rain forest conservation and broaden their initiative to protect coral reefs. 
  Lugar and Biden introduced legislation in the Senate to reauthorize the Tropical Rain Forest conservation Act of 1998 (TFCA) for an additional three years. Since Lugar and Biden initiated TFCA, more than 47 million acres of tropical forests around the world have been conserved through country "debt-for-nature swaps."
  With TFCA, the U.S. State Department has reached agreements generating $137 million in long-term commitments for tropical forest conservation. In addition, private donors, including the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and Conservation International, have contributed more than $9.6 million to TFCA swaps, leveraging U.S. Government funds.
  Twelve TFCA agreements have been concluded to date in Bangladesh, El Salvador, Belize, Peru, the Philippines, Panama, Guatemala, Colombia, Paraguay, Botswana, Costa Rica, and Jamaica. With the reauthorization of TFCA, the State Department will be able pursue agreements with Brazil and Indonesia, both of which have threatened coral reefs.
  This legislation authorizes appropriations for debt reduction for eligible countries at $20,000,000 through FY 2008; $25,000,000 in FY 2009; and $30,000,000 in FY 2010.
