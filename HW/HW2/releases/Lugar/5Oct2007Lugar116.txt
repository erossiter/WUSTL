SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM FOR TOMORROW'S LEADERS
  On December 8, 2007, U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will hold the 31st annual Lugar Symposium for Tomorrow's Leaders. Administrators at each Indiana high school are asked to nominate two outstanding juniors to discuss current events and issues at the Symposium, held on the campus of the University of Indianapolis. 
  "Each year, hundreds of Hoosier students gather for our Symposium at the University of Indianapolis, eager to discuss current affairs in our state, country and world," said Lugar. "It's exciting to meet these impressive young people and learn of their interests and passions."
  Schools may nominate their two students by completing the form found at http://lugar.senate.gov/symposium/form.cfm. For more information about the program, visit http://lugar.senate.gov/symposium/ or call (317) 226-5555.
  Lugar will address the students on national and world affairs before they break into small discussion groups. State and national advocates lead the sessions, allowing students to engage in lively discourse. Some of this year's symposium topics include: U.S. leadership in the world, energy security, Iraq, global warming, and media responsibility. Participants often cite the symposium as an important high school achievement.
