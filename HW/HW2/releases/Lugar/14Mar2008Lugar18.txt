LATE NIGHT VOTES MOVE SEN. LUGAR INTO 14TH PLACE
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar moved into 14th place on the all-time voting list in the Senate early this morning. During the overnight vote-a-rama, the longest serving Senator in Hoosier history cast 44 votes on the Budget Resolution debate to record a lifetime total of 11,770 votes, thus passing the 11,753 votes cast by former Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina. The late Sen. Quentin Burdick of North Dakota has a lifetime total of 11,932 votes and is ranked 13th. 
   Lugar has perfect voting attendance for 2008 and, during his more than 30 years of Senate service, has maintained a better than 98 percent attendance record. Of the 18 senators who began serving in 1977 with Lugar, no one has a better attendance record.
   Lugar is currently the eighth most senior senator and the third on the Republican side of the aisle. He ranks as the 34th most senior senator in the history of the body. There have been 1,897 individuals to serve in the United States Senate since it was convened on March 4, 1789. In 1977, Lugar was the 1,705th Senator sworn into the Senate.
   On May 1, 1996, Lugar became the longest-serving Senator from Indiana when he surpassed Daniel Wolsey Vorhees (1877-1897). In 2006, Lugar was elected to an historic sixth term with more than 87 percent of the vote, his fourth consecutive victory by a two-thirds majority.
   Active Senators who have cast more than 11,770 votes include all-time record holder Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) with more than 18,000 votes, Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Ted Stevens (R-AK), Pete Domenici (R-NM), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Joseph Biden (D-DE).
