SEN. LUGAR SEEKS SENATE PRODUCTIVITY AWARD APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Dick Lugar recently announced that nominations for the 2005 U.S. Senate Productivity Award are being accepted with the assistance of the Indiana Manufacturers Association (IMA).  
   The award, established in 1982, enables each U.S. Senator to select a company that achieves extraordinary productivity accomplishments and to publicize the details of those enhanced techniques so that other American organizations might replicate them. 
   A special committee of the (IMA) reviews all nominated companies and finalists receive an on-site visit. A business can self nominate or be nominated by a trade or chamber organization. The first-place winner will be awarded a Medallion. Certificates will be awarded to other finalists. 
   Criteria for the award includes: description of programs in place; effects since implementation; labor costs; safety record; unit costs; number of customer complaints; employee turnover rate; number of grievances; savings generated by suggestions adopted; and the value of programs to other employers, if adopted. 
   To apply, businesses should complete a nomination form and send to IMA no later than June 30, 2006. The form is available at: http://lugar.senate.gov/reports/2005_Productivity_Award_Application.pdf. 
   If you have questions, contact Charlene Hickey of IMA at (317) 632-2474 or Dona Kelley of Lugar's Indianapolis office at (317) 226-5555.
