SEN. LUGAR TO CO-SPONSOR HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION
  Sen. Dick Lugar is a co-sponsor of the Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2005.  
   "Americans of all ages deserve quality end-of-life medical care," Lugar said. "This legislation would improve access to information about individuals health care options and, additionally, promote advance care planning and decision-making." 
   The bill encourages American adults, especially those 65 and older, to prepare advance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care and other purposes. 
   It would also engage health providers in disseminating information about and assisting with the preparation of advance directives by providing funds for the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a public education campaign to raise awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end of life.
