POLL SAYS 93 PERCENT OF IRAQIS INTEND TO VOTE
  The latest poll by the International Republican Institute reports that 93 percent of Iraqis intend to vote in today's elections.  
 This is up from 85 percent who said in a November poll that they would vote. 
   U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar noted earlier this week that results won't be known for three weeks, and the permanent Iraq government won't be fully organized until April. Lugar's full comments can be found in his third letter to colleagues, available at: http://www.lugar.senate.gov/iraq/.
