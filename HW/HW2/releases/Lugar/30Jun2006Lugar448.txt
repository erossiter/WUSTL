REP. BURTON RESOLUTION CLEARS SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar announced that S. Con. Res. 408, the companion to Rep. Dan Burton's (R-IN-05) resolution, cleared the Foreign Relations Committee at yesterday's business meeting. The concurrent resolution commends the Government of Canada for its renewed commitment to the Global War on Terror in Afghanistan.  
   Lugar (R-IN) and Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) introduced the resolution, which is identical to Burton's H. Con. Res. 408. Burton is Chairman of the House International Relation Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and introduced the resolution following Canada's decision to extend its peace and security mission in Afghanistan until 2009, which was due to expire in 2007. The House resolution passed 409-0 on June 13, 2006. 
   The resolution "commends the Government of Canada for its renewed and long-term commitment to the Global War on Terror" and acknowledges the leadership of former Canadian Prime Ministers Jean Jacques Chretien and Paul Martin and current Prime Minister Stephen Harper for their steadfast commitment to democracy, human rights and freedom throughout the world. It commends the Government of Canada for working to secure a democratic and equal Afghanistan and its commitment to reduce poverty and aid counternarcotics efforts.
