  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that Ball State University received a grant totaling $2,520,134 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for emergency public communications training for essential communications personnel. The grant was given as part of the Competitive Training Grant Program (CTGP).

A specially-designed public communications DVD will be provided to nearly three thousand 911 dispatch offices for independent study awareness training. A seven to eight hour electronic independent study module will be used in conjunction with onsite, hands-on-training activities utilizing table top exercises and other techniques. 
   The CTGP awards funds to competitively selected applicants to develop and deliver innovative training programs addressing high priority nation homeland security needs. The program provides funds to support training initiatives that are nation in scope and further incidents of terrorism and catastrophic events.
