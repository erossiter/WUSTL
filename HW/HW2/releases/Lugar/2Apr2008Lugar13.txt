SEN. LUGAR URGES SENATE ACTION ON HIV/AIDS BILL
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar urged action by the U.S. Senate following passage of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership Act Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 by the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday. The Senate companion bill, S. 2731, was introduced by Sens. Joe Biden (D-DE), Dick Lugar (R-IN), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and John Sununu (R-NH). It expands upon the 5-year-old PEPFAR effort to stem the tide of these diseases worldwide. 
   "I commend the House for passing this crucial piece of legislation that will result in the savings of millions of lives throughout the world. Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen deserve credit for maintaining the delicate bi-partisan compromises worked out in the House Foreign Affairs Committee," said Lugar, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed our own version of the bill on March 13, and I hope that we will bring it to the floor soon so that we can complete action on this important legislation and get it to President Bush for his signature."
   The bill includes language directing the Secretary of Treasury to participate in negotiations for advance market commitments to develop vaccines for HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases. The language is similar to Lugar's Vaccine of the Future Act (S. 569). The House companion bill was introduced by Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-IN).
