SEN. LUGAR CO-SPONSORS PREMATURITY PREVENTION BILL
  Sen. Dick Lugar is a co-sponsor of the "Prevent Prematurity and Improve Child Health Act," which was introduced today.  
   "The rise in premature births throughout the country and in Indiana - despite all of our achievements in medicine - is astounding," said Lugar. "Nationally, more than 480,000 babies were born preterm in 2002. Nearly 13 percent of Indiana's infants are born preterm and in half of the cases, doctors cannot identify the cause. Prematurity/low birth weight is the leading cause of infant death in the first month of life. Last year, the infant mortality rate grew for the first time since 1958 due to a rise in preterm births." 
   "Many of these infants will suffer lifelong health problems-such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss-and some will die," Lugar said. "Reducing the number of premature births will improve the health of hundreds of thousands of infants born each year." 
   In addition to these human costs, the March of Dimes estimates that the national hospital bill for infants with a diagnosis of prematurity/low birthweight was $15.5 billion in 2002. 
   This legislation would improve Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) to better reflect current knowledge of preterm birth. 
   "Medical research tells us that smoking is a considerable risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants," said Lugar. "Our bill takes this knowledge and translates it into practice by ensuring that smoking cessation services and pharmaceuticals are available for pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid." 
   Lugar, and his wife, Charlene, have been long-time advocates of the March of Dimes and fully support the group's efforts to successfully combat the difficult problem of prematurity.
