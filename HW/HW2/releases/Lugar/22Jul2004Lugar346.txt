SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON 9-11 COMMISSION REPORT
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement today on the 9/11 Commission report:  
   "The 9/11 Commission report provides a useful historical record. More importantly, the President, the Congress, and all U.S. and international institutions engaged in the war on terror, must focus on the future. The Commission makes many recommendations - including expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program - that will need to be considered, along with steps already taken since 9/11, and recommendations made by others. 
   "Topping our priorities must be to make certain that all weapons and materials of mass destruction are identified, continuously guarded, and systematically destroyed, so to keep them out of the hands of terrorists. Expanding and globalizing the Nunn-Lugar program can help accomplish this. Nunn-Lugar has already destroyed more than 6,000 nuclear warheads and safeguarded many chemical and biological weapons facilities where such weapons are most numerous, namely, in the former Soviet Union. 
   "Additionally, the U.S. must strengthen our public diplomacy and build alliances. We must promote democracy and commerce, thus dampening the desperate economic conditions that frequently lead to political resentment in the developing world and create a climate conducive to terrorist philosophies."
