SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES AWARD FOR DEDICATION TO CIVIC EDUCATION
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was recognized by the Indiana Bar Foundation (IBF) for his commitment to civic education and support of the "We the People" program. Chuck Dunlap, Executive Director of the IBF, presented the award to Lugar, which contains an "original leaf from the Federalist papers first edition, 1778." 
   "We the People," run by the nonprofit Center for Civic Education, is an educational program that provides enriched curriculum from upper elementary school grades to grade 12, focusing on the history and principles of constitutional democracy in the United States. The program also allows high school students throughout Indiana the chance to compete and prove their knowledge of the constitution and the government.
   Lugar served as an honorary co-chair of the Indiana State Summit on Civic Engagement this summer held by the IBF and members of his staff judged the high school civic competitions. Lugar also recognizes the efforts of student participants in the program by signing certificates of commendation.
