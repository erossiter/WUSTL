PURDUE UNIVERSITY RECEIVES RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that Purdue University has been awarded a $349,865 Economic Development Administration grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Funding will be used to provide the framework and tools necessary to help economic development practitioners enhance economic opportunities and prosperity in rural communities. 
  "I congratulate Purdue University's efforts to better understand the role that rural communities play in economic development initiatives," Lugar said. "This funding will ultimately contribute to the growth and prosperity of rural Indiana."
  The grant funds a study that develops insights, data and analytic tools to help economic development practitioners explore the role of rural communities in America's knowledge-based innovation economy. The study includes the development of a framework to measure and asses innovation capacity in rural regions, a framework to identify and map occupational and industry clusters, and a framework to prioritize public investments based on regional competitive advantages.
