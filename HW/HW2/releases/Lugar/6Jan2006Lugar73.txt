SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH CONGRESSIONAL AWARD RECIPIENT BRYAN GROSS
  Sen. Dick Lugar recognized Bryan Gross from Indianapolis, Indiana on December 10, 2005, as a Congressional Award Bronze Medal recipient.  
 The Congressional Award provides a unique opportunity for young people to set and achieve personally challenging goals in four program areas: volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration.
   To earn his Bronze Medal, Gross volunteered for the Society of St. Vincent DePaul by handing out furniture; worked with the Crain House and Joy's House for physically and mentally challenged residents by assisting in custodial and maintenance duties; increased his bench press by 80 pounds; and planned and participated in a weeklong trip covering over 50 miles by land and canoe, which also helped him earn the Eagle Scout Award.
   The Congressional Award was established in 1979 through the Congressional Award Act. It is a public-private partnership created by Congress to promote and recognize achievement, initiative and service of America's youth aged 14 to 23 and is the first and only award for youth legislated by the U. S. Congress. Through this award, the Congress looks to honor and encourage volunteer public service and recognize the unsung and important accomplishments of young Americans throughout the United States.
