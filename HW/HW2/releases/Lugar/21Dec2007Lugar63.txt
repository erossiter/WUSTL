SEN. LUGAR, GLEANERS COLLECT THOUSANDS FOR MEALS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar and Gleaners Food Bank of Indianapolis announced today that they collected 38,768 pounds of food and $35,882.04, a total equivalent of 220,582 meals, at their food drive reception on November 19 and through subsequent collections on Monument Circle November 26, December 3, December 10, and December 17. 
  Channel 13 WTHR, Comcast and WIBC sponsored the food drive along with corporate sponsors Barnes & Thornburg, Schahet Hotels, Inc., Ice Miller, Shiel Sexton, Eli Lilly and Company, Baker & Daniels, and the Scott A. Jones Foundation.
  Lugar has long supported hunger issues, such as incentives to promote charitable food donation, elimination of childhood hunger, foreign food aid, and health promotion. In 2006, the Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act authored by Lugar became law. The bill allows farmers and small business owners to receive a tax deduction for food products contributed to food banks, pantries, and homeless shelters for donations from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007. Previously, this deduction was available only to large corporations, not small businesses. In the current Congress, Lugar has introduced a bill to make this deduction a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code.
  Lugar is also an inaugural member of the Senate Hunger Caucus, which provides a forum for Senators and staff to discuss and debate important hunger issues facing the United States and the rest of our world.
