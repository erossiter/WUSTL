SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH BAINBRIDGE RESIDENT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar met today with Angela R. Timm of Bainbridge, the 2008 Small Business Person of the Year from Indiana. Timm, Founder and CEO of Cottage Garden, Inc. is in Washington, D.C. for the 45th Annual National Small Business Week. In addition to being Indiana's Small Business Person of the Year, she was a runner up for the 2008 National Small Business Person award. 
   Timm's small business, a line of framed gifts and music boxes, earned $5.9 million in sales and is an industry leader. The U.S. Small Business Administration recognizes people like Timm with awards to business owners in each of 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rice and the Virgin Islands. In tandem with Annual National Small Business Week, events are held to celebrate the contributions and accomplishments of the nation's small businesses and their owners.
   In the Senate, Lugar consistently supports small businesses. He is a past recipient of the "Small Business Champion" Award from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Spirit of Enterprise award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for support of pro-business issues.
