SENATE PASSES U.S.-INDIA BILL
  The U.S. Senate has approved the U.S.-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act by a vote of 85-12. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House International Relations Committee will work out the differences between the bills passed in each House. The final version is expected to pass both Houses of Congress in December. The conference of the House and Senate Committees is not expected to be contentious.  
   "This agreement is the most important strategic diplomatic initiative undertaken by President Bush. By concluding this pact and the far-reaching set of cooperative agreements that accompany it, the President has embraced a long-term outlook that seeks to enhance the core strength of our foreign policy in a way that will give us new diplomatic options and improve global stability," U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar said.
   The bill was co-authored by Lugar and the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, Joe Biden (D-DE). The Committee approved the bill by a vote of 16-2 on June 29.
