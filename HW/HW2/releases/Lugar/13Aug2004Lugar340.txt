SEN. LUGAR WELCOMES TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT IN INDIANA
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the United States Department of Agriculture has awarded a $106,785,000 loan to Cinergy Corp. for broadband development. A ceremony check presentation happened today in Greencastle with USDA Deputy Secretary Jim Moseley.  
   The funding, expected to be spread over 16 years, will allow Cinergy to bring broadband access to Bedford, Connersville, Greencastle, Huntington, Madison, New Castle, North Manchester, North Vernon, Seymour, Vincennes, and Wabash. The facilities proposed in this project are expected to reach over 68,000 residences and over 5,000 businesses. 
   Lugar, a member and former Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, has been a supporter of increased technology expansion to rural areas. For example, he has long supported the work of the Landsbaum Center for Health Education in Terre Haute as it increases the services to Indiana rural communities. He last visited the Center in December 2003. 
   "Recent years have witnessed a technological revolution which stands to reshape the lives of Hoosiers in very positive ways and improve the quality of life for all concerned," said Lugar. "Information technology has changed the foundation of most sectors of the American economy: business, manufacturing, transportation networks, government, education and health professions have reworked their basic structures toward a reliance upon computers, information networks and the opportunities for easy and fast communication. It is important that rural Indiana be included in these advances." 
   The funds will be used to: 
   * Construct a complete fiber-optic based broadband network to provide advanced voice, video, and high-speed data services to the communities. 
   * Install a master video capabilities to deliver advanced video services to all the proposed communities. 
   * Install a telephone switch, media gateway, conferencing gateway, and application server to deliver voice services. 
   * Purchase all the necessary equipment to allow for the transmission of data across the fiber network. 
   * Funds to provide this loan are a part of the USDA's annual budget approved by Congress.
