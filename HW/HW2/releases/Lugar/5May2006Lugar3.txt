SEN. LUGAR ENCOURAGED BY NEWS OF WAGE INCREASES
  Sen. Dick Lugar said he was encouraged by today's economic news showing wages for workers grew by 3.8 percent over the last year, the biggest 12-month gain since before September 11, 2001. The average hourly wage in April was $16.61, up half-a-percent from March. This comes as 138,000 people were added to payrolls in the month, including the biggest increase in manufacturing in two years, a net increase of 19,000 employees.  
   Final Indiana specific job numbers for March also came out today. Indiana showed a dramatic drop in unemployment from February to March, falling from 5.5 percent to 4.9 percent. Indiana added 5,500 new jobs in March and 20,000 net increase in payrolls over the last year. Reporting of state specific data trails the national numbers. 
   Indiana's unemployment of 4.9 percent was the lowest in the industrial Midwest. Neighboring rates were: Kentucky, 6.0 percent; Illinois, 5.1 percent; Ohio, 5.0 percent; and Michigan, 6.8 percent. 
   "Employment statistic stories often just focus on the rate of unemployment. But the important news this month was increased wages," Lugar said. "Strong economic and wage growth is vital to families and the opportunities for Indiana. For example, the state has reported that the strengthened economic picture increased Indiana tax revenue by $200 million in the month of April." 
   Lugar has been advocating that Indiana must move aggressively in developing jobs for a future based in biofuels and clean coal. With Purdue University, he will host the Lugar-Purdue Energy Security Summit on August 29. Business, agriculture and governmental leaders will map out growth opportunities for Indiana.
