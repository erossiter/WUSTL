SEN. LUGAR CALLS ATTENTION TO EFFORTS TO STOP SPREAD OF EMERALD ASH BORER
  Sen. Dick Lugar today called attention to efforts to stop the spread of Emerald Ash Borer, an invasive species which threatens Indiana's estimated 300 million ash trees. Gov. Mitch Daniels has declared May 21-27 as Emerald Ash Borer Awareness Week to educate Hoosiers about the insect and its threat.  
   The awareness week precedes the start of summer travel, when campers could unknowingly spread the small iridescent-green beetle across the state through infested firewood. The Emerald Ash Borer is believed to have first entered the state through Borer-invaded firewood from Michigan, where the insect has killed or infested 15 million ash trees since it appeared in 2002 after being imported from Asia in wooden packing crates. 
   "Emerald Ash Borer is a serious threat to Indiana's native ash trees," said Lugar. "The only known control is to completely remove Ash trees within half a mile of every affected tree and almost 90,000 Indiana ash trees already have been cut down. Increased awareness and vigilance at the start of summer season will help prevent its unintentional spread." 
   Emerald Ash Borer was confirmed in Indiana on April 21, 2004, and to date has been found in Steuben, LaGrange, Randolph, Huntington, Adams, Marion, and Hamilton counties. 
   On Thursday, May 25, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) will interview Lugar about Emerald Ash Borer for his monthly cable show. The show is scheduled to be taped in front of a black walnut tree from Lugar's 604-acre farm in Marion County, which was planted on the Capitol grounds on Arbor Day 2005. 
   Lugar is a member and former chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.
