SEN. LUGAR CO-SPONSORS HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL
  Sen. Dick Lugar is a co-sponsor of the Highway Funding Equity Act of 2005, which was introduced yesterday.  
 This bill would increase the amount of highway funding that Indiana receives each year to 95 cents on every dollar Hoosiers pay in gas taxes. 
   The proposal, known as the States Highway Alliance for Real Equity, or the SHARE bill, changes the way the federal government distributes highway funds to the states. Under the SHARE bill, Indiana's annual share of highway dollars could increase by more than $200 million. 
   "This is an important bill for Hoosiers, which will bring more transportation funds to Indiana," Lugar said. "A higher level of funding will help complete many important projects throughout the Hoosier State." 
   Under existing law, Indiana's return on the gas tax dollar is 90.5 cents. This law has been extended several times, but the current extension expires May 31. 
   Lugar cosponsored similar legislation in the 108th Congress.
