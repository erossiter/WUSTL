NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FROM MARTINSVILLE RECEIVE SCHOLARSHIPS AT ANNUAL SEN. LUGAR OATH OF ENLISTMENT CEREMONY
  Sen. Dick Lugar and Adjutant General of Indiana MG R. Martin Umbarger recently presented Ira Schwartz and Brandon Pugh with Indiana Army National Guard ROTC Scholarships during the Annual Armed Forces Day events at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Both recruits are from Martinsville.  
   Pugh and Schwartz were awarded $105,000 scholarships after enlisting in the Indiana Army National Guard for six years. The Indiana National Guard identifies students as early as their junior year in high school for this scholarship and recipients are chosen based on their leadership skills, high moral character and academic achievement. 
   "I commend Ira Schwartz and Brandon Pugh for their decision to enlist in the Indiana Army National Guard, and I was pleased to lead them in the Oath of Enlistment," Lugar said. "I am grateful that these young men have accepted this scholarship and look forward to their commissioning upon graduation." 
   Lugar led 55 recruits, including Pugh and Schwartz, in the Oath of Enlistment into their respective branches of military service on Sunday, May 21, 2006. Lugar has participated in Armed Forces Day at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1981.
