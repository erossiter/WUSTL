SEN. LUGAR RELEASES REPORT ON STATUS OF SLAIN JOURNALISTS IN PHILIPPINES ON WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today released a report from the government of the Philippines in response to a Committee inquiry regarding the status of reported murders of journalists in the Philippines since 2000.  
   "Democracy depends on the free flow of information to the public, which depends on a press free to do its work without government intimidation," Lugar said. "Ensuring that legal officials thoroughly investigate and prosecute attacks on journalists is critical as the world recognizes Press Freedom day today." 
   World Press Freedom Day was established by the General Assembly of the United Nations and is recognized annually on May 3. This year's theme is "Media and Good Governance." 
   Lugar's correspondence with Philippine Ambassador to the U.S. Albert Del Rosario and the "Status of Cases of Slain Journalists" is available at:
