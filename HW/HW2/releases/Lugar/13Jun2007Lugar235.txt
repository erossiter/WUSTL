INDIANA EXCHANGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN CULTURAL BRIDGES RECEPTION
  Sen. Dick Lugar visited with nearly 300 high school students from predominantly Muslim countries, including seven students who spent the last year living with Hoosier host families and attending Indiana high schools. The students are participants in the Youth Exchange and Study (YES) Program administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the State Department, which brought over 670 high school aged students from fourteen countries in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia to the U.S. in 2006-2007 school year.  
   The participants are concluding their exchange year with a week in Washington, D.C., and attended a special Cultural Bridges reception hosted by Lugar and Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) on Wednesday, June 13. After September 11, 2001, Lugar and Kennedy introduced legislation to establish the Cultural Bridges program and provide scholarships for high school students from countries with significant Muslim populations. The State Department established the YES program in October 2002 as a result, which started with only 160 participants and now has more than 2,500 alumni. 
   Lugar congratulated the students on their accomplishments and advised them to use their experiences in the U.S. to make a positive contribution in their home countries. "I hope from this experience that you may have an idea of how you will make a difference in your community," Lugar said. "We have a sense of the future, and the future is you." 
   Students live with host families, attend high school, engage in activities to learn about American society and values, acquire leadership skills, and help educate Americans about their home countries and cultures. 
   Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Miller Crouch also attended the reception. 
   Lugar has advocated international education as a sign of national pride and humility, a building block of foreign policy and a source of national power. In the current Congress, he is the lead sponsor S.377, to establish a United States-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program. Lugar's bill was approved by the Senate in March and awaits action by the House of Representatives. 
   Lugar also authored the legislation that established the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, which provides 250 full scholarships annually for American high school students to live with a host family and attend school in Germany for a year. Since 1983, almost 15,000 young people have participated in this fully funded scholarship program. 
   YES students attending the reception, who spent the year in Indiana included:
   * Abulhassan Yousif from Kuwait was hosted by a family in Muncie and attended Southside High School; 
   * Al-Abbady Mohammed from Yemen was hosted by a family in Alexandria and attended Alexandria-Monroe High School; 
   * Alomari Sohaib from Jordan was hosted by a family in Indianapolis and attended Perry Meridian High School;
