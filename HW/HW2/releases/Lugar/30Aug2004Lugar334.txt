SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH HOOSIER TROOPS IN BOSNIA
  Sen. Dick Lugar met on August 28-29 with the men and women of the Indiana National Guard at Eagle Base, Bosnia, to personally thank them for their service overseas.  
 The Hoosier troops are part of the 38th Infantry Division that has been in Bosnia serving as international peacekeepers since the spring. 
   In his speech, Lugar addressed the amount of time that U.S. forces have been in Bosnia. "There has to be a patience factor. Here they got it right but it took a long time, nine years. It takes that long to make sure that failed states do not become incubators of terror." 
   Lugar also lauded the troops' efforts saying, "As part of the NATO Stabilization Force, your mission here was to deter hostilities and stabilize the peace. You - and the thousands of American soldiers who came before you - have succeeded beyond anyone's expectations." 
   Lugar added, "Thank you for your service in the Indiana National Guard. Thank you for your service to the people of this recovering part of the world."
