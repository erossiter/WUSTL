SEN. LUGAR APPLAUDS SENATE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PASSAGE
  Sen. Dick Lugar applauded Senate passage last night of legislation that would provide an additional $1 billion this fiscal year for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The legislation passed after agreement on a disbursement model that that would provide $500 million through LIHEAP's traditional funding formula and an additional $500 million through a contingency fund released at the discretion of the White House. The legislation awaits action by the House.  
   Lugar strongly supports LIHEAP and has a long history of working to increase funding for this important program, which has distributed $199 million in Indiana from FY2002 to FY2005. 
   "I am pleased that the Senate finally moved to provide a measure of relief to the low-income families and seniors struggling to deal with dramatically higher home-heating bills. No one should have to decide between heating their home and other basic necessities," said Lugar. 
   In the last six months, Lugar repeatedly voted to fund LIHEAP's at its Congressionally authorized level of $5.1 billion. Most recently, he cosponsored a motion to instruct budget conferees to insist that the final budget reconciliation bill include an additional $2.92 billion in funds for LIHEAP, an increase that would have brought LIHEAP up to its fully authorized funding level.
