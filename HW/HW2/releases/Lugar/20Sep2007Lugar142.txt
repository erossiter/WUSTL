SOUTH BEND TRANSPO AWARDED $1.1 MILLION GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today of a $1,100,640 grant for the construction of a new bus maintenance facility for the South Bend Public Transportation Corporation (TRANSPO) from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   "I look forward to the increased use of alternative fuel buses at the new center," Lugar said.
   The grant will be utilized to help build a new facility to replace the maintenance and administration facility, which has been in continuous use since the 1880's. TRANSPO's Board of Directors indicated the new facility will be more centrally located, allowing for increased operations efficiency and the introduction of new alternative fueled vehicles into TRANSPO's fleet. It will be located in South Bend's Studebaker Corridor, a brownfields area in the industrial core.
   Lugar has also secured an additional $1 million for this project in the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill which was passed by the Senate on September 6, 2007. The legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. Should the project be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies. The bill then heads to the President for his signature.
