SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR EXPANSION OF FOOD BANK FACILITIES FOR SECOND HARVEST
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended that $250,000 be set aside for the Second Harvest Food Bank of East Central Indiana.  
   "Second Harvest performs valuable work for the City of Anderson and for East Central Indiana," Lugar said. "These funds will help in Second Harvest's plans to expand the facilities and to continue their important work." 
   Funds provided will be used by Second Harvest to reach the organization's objectives and increase food distributions by 15 percent each year. Funds will also help their efforts to increase efficiency of food distribution, in cooperation with the network of pantries and meal programs. 
   Earlier this year, Lugar asked in a letter to the Appropriations Committee that special funds be set aside for this project. 
   Funds recommended by the Appropriations Committee are a part of the annual budget bill for the federal agencies. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this year. The bill may be folded into an omnibus measure. Funding levels can change prior to the bill becoming law. 
   Lugar is the author of the Good Samaritan Hunger Tax Relief Incentive. The bill provides an increased tax deduction on food products to our nation's food banks. Lugar believes these tax deductions are an important step in increasing private donations to the non-profit hunger relief charities playing a critical role in meeting America's nutrition needs. The bill passed the Senate as part of the Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment Act of 2003 (CARE Act) 
   The CARE ACT has been approved by the House and Senate and is currently awaiting consideration in conference committee.
