TEAMS COMPETE FOR MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES
  An international competition to design an energy efficient vehicle that can be mass produced announced today that 31 teams have signed a letter of intent to compete in the competition and more than 300 are actively considering entry. 
   "United States national security and economic prosperity demand that we move toward a sustainable energy future?the global trend of foreign governments asserting greater control over oil reserves allows unfriendly regimes to use their energy exports as leverage against the United States and our allies. Establishment of the Automotive X Prize demonstrates remarkable vision and leadership. I am particularly encouraged that development of the prize benefits from insights of a diverse group of government, non-government, university and industry representatives," said Lugar.
   On February 5, 2006, The Indianapolis Star published an op-ed by Lugar calling for Indiana to harness its historic leadership in automotive technology and innovation and lead the auto-tech boom of the 21st century to address fuel efficiency and reduce reliance on foreign oil.
