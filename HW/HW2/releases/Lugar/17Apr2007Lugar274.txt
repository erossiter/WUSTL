SEN. LUGAR SUPPORTS ENERGY EFFICIENCY BILL
  Sen. Dick Lugar is an original cosponsor of the Energy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007. The wide-ranging plan was introduced by Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and the committee's top Republican, Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM). 
   "At the heart of our national security is assuring our energy security. This will require an all out effort to develop diversified homegrown sources of energy, improve technology and increase efficiency. This bill is part of a comprehensive approach to improving our over-all energy security," Lugar said.  
   In the area of building and electrical efficiencies, the bill: 
   * Creates new lighting efficiency standards. 
   * Creates a variety of new appliance efficiency standards. 
   * Provides the Department of Energy with increased authority to put into place additional energy efficiency standards. 
   * Creates a variety of new programs and standards to reduce the federal government electricity consumption through "green" construction and employing energy-efficient technologies. 
   * Requires the federal government to increase its renewable electricity purchases to 10 percent by 2010 and 15 percent by 2015. 
   * Reauthorizes the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program. 
   The bill also includes many petroleum consumption efficiency measures based on provisions in the DRIVE Act, a bill Lugar cosponsored with Sen. Evan Bayh (D-IN). These provisions: 
   * Set national targets for reducing gasoline usage over time and require the President to issue - and if necessary, reissue - a plan to meet these targets. 
   * Authorize research into the use of advanced light-weight materials for vehicle construction. 
   * Authorize loan guarantees for plants that manufacture parts for fuel-efficient vehicles. 
   * Authorize awards of up to 30 percent for manufacturers and suppliers that retool their facilities to produce advanced technology parts and vehicles. 
   * Authorize research and development programs for advanced battery technologies and electric drive-train technology, including plug-in hybrids. 
   * Require federal and state vehicle fleets to reduce petroleum consumption. 
   Lugar noted that on his 15-mile drive into work this morning he got 54 miles per gallon in his hybrid car, and that even greater energy savings would come from more hybrid advancements and encouraging fuel efficient vehicles. 
   In a statement at this morning's press conference with Sen. Jeff Bingaman, announcing the Energy Efficiency Promotion Act, Lugar said: 
   "Last year in a speech to the Brookings Institution, I described energy as the "albatross" of U.S. national security. Most oil and natural gas in the world is controlled by governments, many of which are in tumultuous regions and in countries hostile to the United States. Our energy consumption choices today make us vulnerable to political manipulation of energy supplies globally and to economic disruption. 
   "There is a no single solution to our energy security problem. We have to promote new fuels from our domestic resources. I continue to give particular emphasis to the importance of cellulosic ethanol for transportation. And for electrical power, we also need to support wind, solar, and clean coal. 
   "Efficiency is another critical component. Gains from energy efficiency are renewable resources as well, and can save consumers money even as they save energy. 
   "Sections of this bill targeted to reduce gasoline consumption are particularly urgent. Among the many provisions, the bill will promote battery technology and plug-in hybrid vehicles, it will help auto-manufacturers up-date their factories to produce hybrids and other advanced technology cars, and promote research in ultra-light materials that will allow for increased fuel economy. 
   "We can offset a significant portion of future demand for oil by giving American consumers a real choice when it comes to the cars they drive and the fuels that power them."
