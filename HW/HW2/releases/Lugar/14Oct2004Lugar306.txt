NEW ETHANOL, BIODIESEL PROVISIONS PASS SENATE
  Several new ethanol and biodiesel provisions passed in the Senate as part of recent tax legislation (the FSC/ETI bill), according to Sen.  
 Dick Lugar. The provisions call for an extension of the Ethanol Tax Incentive through December 2010, creation of a new tax credit for biodiesel and improvements to the small ethanol producer credit. 
   "Bio-fuels and bio-chemicals increase energy independence and security and would significantly improve rural economies in America and around the world," Lugar said. "America's insatiable appetite for oil places our nation in a precarious situation of reliability on regions that have become increasingly hostile to us." 
   The development of renewable fuels would help ensure national and economic security and gas price stability. With ethanol and biomass becoming competitive and Hoosiers growing renewable crops of biomass every year, these alternative can add to the critical volume of gasoline market. In addition, the tax credit for biodiesel will encourage petroleum blenders to use more biodiesel in fuel and ease the overburdened refining industry. 
   "The need to fully harness the power of biomass in our technologically advanced society is paramount," Lugar added. "By furthering the use of biomass and ethanol, farmers are presented with the opportunity to produce a cash crop by collecting their agricultural wastes. Local crops that enrich the soil, prevent erosion and improve local environmental conditions can be planted and then harvested for fuel." 
   As former chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Lugar initiated a biofuels research program to help decrease U.S. dependency on foreign oil.
