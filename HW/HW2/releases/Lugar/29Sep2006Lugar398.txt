MUSEUM INSTITUTE ACCEPTING GRANT APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is accepting grant applications for the agency's FY 2007 Museums for America program.  
   Museums for America grants strengthen a museum's ability to serve the public by supporting activities to advance the museum's mission and strategic goals. It is the largest funding program for museums at IMLS, providing more than $17 million in grants. This is a competitive grant. 
   The IMLS has scheduled a conference call for interested museums on Tuesday, October 3 at 3:00pm EST. The Conference call telephone number is 1-800-274-0251. 
   The call will be directed particularly to first-time applicants and small museums from across the country to answer general questions.
