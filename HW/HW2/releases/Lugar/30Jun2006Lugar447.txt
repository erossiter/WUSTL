SEN. LUGAR SECURES $500,000 FOR LAPORTE
  Sen. Dick Lugar today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $500,000 to the City of LaPorte for sewer and wastewater collection improvements project. The legislation now heads to the Senate floor. 
   Funding would help improve storm water drainage problems occurring during heavy rainfall in the Monroe Manor area of LaPorte, where approximately 60 percent of households are low-to-moderate income. The project would replace marginal sanitary sewer lines and water mains and improve both wastewater and drinking water systems for approximately 75 homes across a five acre area.
   Preliminary planning and engineering evaluation has been completed by the City of LaPorte.
   Funds were provided through the State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) program within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
