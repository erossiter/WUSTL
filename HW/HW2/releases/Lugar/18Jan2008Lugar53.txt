WHITKO HIGH SCHOOL ARTWORK ON DISPLAY IN SEN. LUGAR COMMUNITY CENTER
  The Lugar Community Service Center now has 21 framed pieces of student artwork on display from the Whitko High School Art Gallery. The art was received from high school art teacher Walter Malicki and Principal Parrish Kruger.  
  The artwork is the first to be displayed in the Lugar Community Service Center in an effort to showcase student artwork from counties in Northeastern Indiana.
  Under Malicki's tenure, Whitko High School art students have received 22 state, 35 national and 115 international awards and more than 600 scholastic art awards. They have won eight state calendar contests and 13 consecutive stamp contests in Fort Wayne. Whitko High School artwork is also on display in the Indiana Department of Education in Indianapolis.
  Last year, the school competed in the 38th World School Children's Art Exhibition in Taipei. Whitko was one of ten schools to represent the U.S. in the exhibition.
  Malicki is a graduate of the Herron School of Art and Design at IUPUI and has a Master's from the University of St. Francis. His motto is "To be good is not enough when you dream of being great," and he encourages each of his students to do their best. Malicki has taught at Whitko High School for 31 years.
