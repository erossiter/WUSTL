SEN. LUGAR COMMENTS ON DEATH OF FORT WAYNE NATIVE
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement on James E. Kelley, of Fort Wayne, who died Sunday at age 87: 
   "Jim Kelley embodied that special Hoosier spirit of entrepreneurial and civic leadership. During a long and successful career, and an equally fulfilling life, Jim never ceased to explore new and different opportunities to create jobs and better opportunities for people in Indiana, and throughout the world. Jim Kelley will be missed, but his life of risk-taking, friendship and helping others lives on as a roadmap for all of us who follow his dedication to the future."
