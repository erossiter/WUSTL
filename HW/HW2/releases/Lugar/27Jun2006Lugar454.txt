  On Thursday, June 29, 2006, at 11:00 a.m. in room 419 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building (immediately following the hearing on Russia) the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee will meet to consider and vote on an original Lugar-Biden bill to exempt U.S. exports to India of nuclear materials, equipment and technology from certain requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The meeting was moved to Thursday to accommodate the schedules of Committee members.  
   "The Committee has taken its role in the Constitutional review process of this important diplomatic endeavor very seriously," Chairman Dick Lugar said. Lugar held four hearings with testimony from 17 witnesses including Secretary of State Rice; two closed intelligence briefings with the Undersecretaries of State Nick Burns and Bob Joseph; and asked over 174 questions for the record of the Department of State on details of the agreement and posted the answers on the website: http://lugar.senate.gov/sfrc/. The Committee staff hosted numerous staff briefings by the Congressional Research Service and other experts for the benefit of members' staffs.
