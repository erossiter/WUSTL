SEN. LUGAR AWARDED ORDER OF BERNARDO O'HIGGINS BY CHILE
  Sen. Dick Lugar received the "Order of Bernardo O'Higgins," Chile's highest award for a non-citizen, in a ceremony last night at the residence of Chilean Ambassador Mariano Fernandez. Lugar was recognized for his leadership of the 1989 U.S. Committee for Fair Elections in Chile to ensure that Chile's referendum on military rule take place with fairness and transparency. 
  The Order of Bernardo O'Higgins is named for the leader of the successful Chilean independence movement, who led the country from 1817 to 1823. 
  Lugar has continued efforts to strengthen the bilateral U.S.-Chile relationship and specifically has advocated a closer relationship between the two countries on energy issues. Earlier this year, he sent Tom Shannon, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, a letter regarding formalizing a closer energy relationship, and has also met with Ambassador Fernandez to talk about possibilities of deeper energy ties. 
  Chile has limited domestic energy resources and depends heavily on imports. In 2005, Chile imported 98 percent of its oil, 96 percent of its coal and 75 percent of its natural gas. 
  Developing closer energy partnerships with Chile could reduce the potential for tension over energy resources in the region and reduce vulnerabilities to international prices and supply disruptions.
  Lugar is the ninth U.S. citizen to receive the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins since 1990. Attending the reception was a delegation of Senators from Chile's governing body and other distinguished guests.
