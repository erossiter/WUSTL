SEN. LUGAR PAYS TRIBUTE TO REVEREND WILLIAMS
  The following statement was inserted in today's Congressional Record by Indiana Senior U.S. Senator Dick Lugar: 
   IN MEMORY OF REVEREND CHARLES WILLIAMS
   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay heartfelt tribute to The Reverend Charles Williams, a visionary Hoosier friend who passed away yesterday at the age of fifty-six.
   I have looked forward to visiting with Charles Williams for many years. His dynamic leadership was best exemplified through his work leading the Indiana Black Expo, Inc., a not-for-profit community service organization comprised of ten chapters throughout the State of Indiana. Since 1983, he has been an effective advocate of an expanding number of Indiana Black Expo programs.
   His accomplishments included founding the Circle City Classic football game, an annual event that raises funds for minority college scholarships. Most recently, Reverend Williams has worked diligently to inform men, especially African-American men, on the importance of prostate cancer screening. Afflicted with this terrible disease, he shared his personal testimony on struggles with prostate cancer in an effort to encourage other men to consider personal healthcare more seriously.
   The Indiana Black Expo was founded in 1970, while I served as Mayor of Indianapolis. Each year, the Indiana Black Expo hosts the Summer Celebration. Currently underway, this event is the longest-running cultural showcase of its kind nationwide. I look forward to visiting, once again, with thousands of attendees in Indianapolis this weekend.
   I am honored to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the life of Reverend Charles Williams. At this difficult time, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.
