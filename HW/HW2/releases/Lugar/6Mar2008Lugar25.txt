   The United States Senate Youth Program was created in 1962 by a Senate Resolution that was designed to give outstanding high school juniors and seniors throughout the United States a better understanding of the Senate and the federal government. With private funding from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, two students from each state and the District of Columbus are chosen to represent their state during the week-long, all expenses paid educational program and are eligible to receive a $5,000 college scholarship.
