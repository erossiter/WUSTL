SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES INAUGURAL AWARD FOR CONSCIENCE, COURAGE, COMPASSION FROM FAITH AND POLITICS INSTITUTE
  Sen. Dick Lugar received the inaugural Lewis-Houghton Award for Conscience, Courage, and Compassion from the Faith and Politics Institute yesterday at an event marking the Institute's 15th Anniversary.  
   The award recognized Lugar's support for economic sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa, his dedication to safeguarding and destroying weapons of mass destruction under the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and his advocacy for an energy policy that reduces U.S. dependence on foreign oil. 
   Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi attended the event, as well as Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA) who also received the award for her positions on peace, health reform and education. 
   According to its website, the mission of the Faith and Politics Institute is to provide occasions for moral reflection and spiritual community to political leaders. The Institute encourages civility and respect as values essential to democracy and strives to strengthen political leadership. 
   The Lewis-Houghton Award, named after the former chairmen of the Institute, Representative John Lewis and former Representative Amo Houghton, will be presented annually to Members of Congress who exhibit exceptional qualities consistent with the Institute's mission.
