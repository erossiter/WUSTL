SEN. LUGAR APPLAUDS U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR SUDAN
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement today following President Bush naming Andrew S. Natsios the President's Special Envoy for Sudan: 
   "President Bush naming Dr. Andrew Natsios as Special Envoy is important and timely in addressing the immediate crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan. Dr. Natsios has been a frequent witness in front of the Foreign Relations Committee and has a comprehensive understanding of the situation in Darfur. His tenure at USAID further qualifies him for the position.  
   "The naming of a Special Envoy for Sudan will assist the United States in maintaining a strong leadership role in organizing and implementing the international response to the crisis in Darfur. 
   "The Foreign Relations Committee has paid close attention to the developments in Sudan and especially Darfur. At a September 2004 hearing, then Secretary of State Colin Powell declared for the first time that genocide had been committed in Darfur. Following that statement, the Committee heard from then-Presidential envoy for Sudan Jack Danforth and then-USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios on the situation in Sudan. We have continued to examine the crisis. 
   "Regrettably, the Darfur Peace Agreement appears to be faltering with the ill-advised rejection of the UN Resolution establishing a UN peacekeeping force to transition from the overburdened African Union Mission in Sudan. The situation has become insecure for humanitarian operations and as threatening to the people of the region as ever it has been. The United Nations Security Council Resolution authorizing a peacekeeping force for Darfur is a unanimous signal that the international community is committed to seeing no further violence take place in Darfur. Sudan, as a member of the United Nations, must abide by this decision of the international community. Their national and international responsibility is to serve and protect their people, and the suffering and killing in Darfur must end. The gargantuan humanitarian effort to provide basic necessities for more than two million displaced persons requires unrestricted access by national and international aid organizations, as well as the UN-mandated peacekeeping force to ensure their security." 
   Last week, Lugar introduced S. 3884, the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006, which includes a recommendation that the President name a Special Envoy for Sudan and particularly the Darfur region. 
   Additional provisions in Lugar's bill include: 
   * Clear authority to provide the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with all appropriate and necessary assistance including in the areas of logistics, communications, material support, technical and training assistance, command and control, surveillance, and intelligence; 
   * Targeted sanctions on individuals determined by the President to be "complicit in, or responsible for, acts of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity in Darfur;" 
   * The prohibition of assistance, other than humanitarian assistance, to those countries violating United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591 for Sudan; 
   * Sense of Congress that the international community should immediately act to mobilize forces and resources to fulfill the requirements of UN Resolution 1706 authorizing a peacekeeping force for Darfur in support of the Darfur Peace Agreement; 
   * Sense of Congress that NATO assistance to AMIS should continue and should include support for aerial surveillance; 
   * Sense of Congress that the President should deny entry to the U.S. of certain sea-going vessels conducting business with Sudan whose cargoes are determined to be inconsistent with humanitarian efforts or the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan or the Darfur Peace Agreement. 
   * Clear authority to provide assistance for the reconstruction of southern Sudan and other marginalized areas in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan while maintaining existing sanctions on the Government of Sudan. 
   In 2004, Lugar introduced the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act, which was signed by the President on December 23, 2004 (P.L. 108-497). Lugar's legislation provided an additional $300 million in support of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and for the consolidation of the since concluded Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and South Sudan. The Act also imposed targeted sanctions and required reports.
