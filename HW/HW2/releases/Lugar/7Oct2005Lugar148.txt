SEN. LUGAR COMMENTS ON AWARDING OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE TO DR. ELBARADEI
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement on the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Dr.  
 Mohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
   "The Nobel Committee in Oslo has made an inspired and important decision in awarding the Peace Prize to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The most pressing global security issue facing all nations comes from the proliferation of weapons and materials of mass destruction. Since the dawn of the nuclear age 60 years ago, the international community has faced the challenge of containing and controlling the development and proliferation of fissile materials. Dr. ElBaradei's leadership in this struggle, and an invigorated IAEA, are critical in this cooperative initiative. 
   "As was the case last year, the days prior to the Nobel Peace Prize announcement brought significant worldwide recognition to the paramount importance of keeping nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and materials out of terrorist hands. This consideration has also heightened attention to the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction efforts to secure and destroy these weapons of mass destruction and the additional destruction of conventional weapons that we have advanced. It is an honor to be the subject of such extensive attention. 
   "Our work in non-proliferation requires constant vigilance in keeping the program going, gaining additional cooperation and expanding partnerships. With so much more work ahead of us, I am hopeful that many partners in peace will make progress both possible and inevitable."
