SENATE RATIFIES TREATIES WITH DENMARK, FINLAND
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican leader Dick Lugar announced that the Senate ratified the following treaties on Friday, November 16: 
  * Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Finland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital (Treaty Doc.109-18) 
   * Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (Treaty Doc. 109-19) 
  "These agreements will bolster the economic relationships between the United States and countries that are already close trade and investment partners. As the United States considers how to create jobs and maintain economic growth, it is important that we try to eliminate impediments that prevent our companies from fully accessing international markets. These impediments may come in the form of regulatory barriers, taxes, tariffs, or unfair treatment. In the case of taxes, we should work to ensure that companies pay their fair share, while not being unfairly taxed twice on the same revenue. Tax treaties are intended to prevent double taxation so that companies are not inhibited from doing business overseas. As the U.S. moves to keep the economy growing and to increase U.S. employment, international tax policies that promote foreign direct investment in the United States are critically important," said Lugar.
