SEN. LUGAR SHARES RED HOT CANDIES FROM SCHIMPFF'S CONFECTIONERY WITH FELLOW SENATORS
  Sen. Dick Lugar hosted the Thursday Club Luncheon for members of the United States Senate on May 26, 2005, highlighting Hoosier Hospitality with food and gifts donated by restaurants and businesses in Indiana.  
   This year's Thursday Club gifts included Red Hot candies donated by Schimpff's Confectionery in Jeffersonville. The Schimpff family has been making candy in Jeffersonville since 1871, using hand operated, turn-of-the-century machines. These machines are still used today to produce Schimpff's candies and chocolates. 
   The lunch hosted by Lugar included breaded tenderloin sandwiches from Gnaw Bone Food and Fuel as the main entree. The sandwiches were served to the senators by owner Beni Clevenger and friends Dennis Sharp, restaurant manager, and Buck Stogdill, Brown County Sheriff, as well as Crystal Blevins and Michael Dunn, active members of the Indiana National Guard. The group prepared the tenderloins prior to the lunch and delivered them to the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The famous tenderloin sandwiches have been featured in Gourmet Magazine and on The Today Show. 
   The Thursday Club Lunch includes 50 members and began as a Wednesday Club with a small group of senators meeting in their personal offices for lunch. Today, senators rotate hosting duties of the weekly lunches, sharing food and gifts that represent their home states.
