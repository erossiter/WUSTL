$140,000 IN GRANTS AWARDED TO HOOSIER FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that two Indiana fire departments will receive funds from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) program for operations and safety. 
   "The brave men and women who serve as first responders are the backbone of our communities. It is vital that we ensure our fire departments and emergency medical services have the support, equipment and training they require," Lugar said. "I encourage Hoosier fire departments to contact me to explore grant opportunities and ways which we may be helpful."
   The primary goal of the AFG is to enhance first responders' ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of first-responder personnel, with respect to fire-related hazards.
   The U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the AFG program and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
   Fire departments with questions about the AFG program may reach the fire grants help desk toll free at 1-866-274-0960 or firegrants@dhs.gov For the most current information regarding the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program, visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
