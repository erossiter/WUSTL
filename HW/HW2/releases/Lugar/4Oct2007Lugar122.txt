WEST SIDE HOPE OF ANDERSON RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that West Side Hope Community Development Corporation of Anderson has been awarded a $231,560 Community Economic Development Operational Projects grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  
   Funding will be used to assist in the completion of West Side Hope's new Family Life Center. The center will provide a fully staffed daycare and preschool, as well as a catering business. 
   "I appreciate the efforts of West Side Hope Community Development Corporation to help lower income persons on Anderson's west side for employment. The services envisioned in the New Hope Family Life Center will assist in creating new employment and personal development opportunities for the neighborhood," said Lugar, who wrote a letter in support of West Side Hope's application. 
   HHS operational projects are designed to encourage rural and urban community development corporations to create projects intended to provide employment and business development opportunities for low-income people through business or commercial development. The opportunities must aim to improve the quality of the economic and social environment of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients; low-income residents including displaced workers; individuals transitioning from the prison system in the community; at-risk youth; non-custodial parents, particularly those of children receiving TANF assistance; individuals residing in public housing; individuals who are homeless; and individuals with disabilities. 
   Please contact HHS at 1-877-696-6775 for more information regarding this grant. Questions regarding the grants process in general may be directed to Kim Preston, Grants Coordinator for Senator Lugar, by phone at 202-224-4814 or by email at grants@lugar.senate.gov
