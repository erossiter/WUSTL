LETTER #10: UPDATE ON SECURITY, ECONOMY, POLITICAL FACTORS IN IRAQ
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today sent the tenth letter in a series of letters to his fellow Members of Congress to "strive to elevate our debate by studying thoughtful sources of information and embracing civility in our discourse." Below is the text of the tenth letter. Each letter and any reports mentioned are available at http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq.  
   Four months ago, I shared with you a copy of "The Iraq Index," a report produced by the Brookings Institution. I wanted to provide you with the latest update of this statistical compilation as we continue to examine U.S. policy in Iraq. 
   The Iraq Indexprovides a broad spectrum of data on innumerable security, economic, and political factors affecting the situation on the ground in Iraq. I believe that all Members would benefit from a careful review of the details presented in this report. 
   The report is available on the Brookings website: http://www.brookings.edu/fp/saban/iraq /index.pdf , and it is linked to my own website: http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq. 
   I also wanted to alert you that - as of this writing - Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad is scheduled to visit Congress and appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday April 4, at 2:30 p.m. If events allow Ambassador Khalilzad to maintain this schedule, it will be an important opportunity for Members of Congress to review the situation in Iraq and assess how we can contribute to a successful outcome. I plan to circulate his testimony so that all members may read it.
