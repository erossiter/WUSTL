SEN. LUGAR SECURES $500,000 FOR CENTERVILLE
  Sen. Dick Lugar today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $500,000 to the Town of Centerville for their wastewater improvements project. The legislation now heads to the Senate floor. 
   Centerville recently bonded for approximately $1.2 million to help an unincorporated cluster of 120 low-income homes with their failing septic systems. The failing systems have caused concern about potential health problems resulting from human contact with untreated sewage. Centerville's existing wastewater treatment plant will reach maximum capacity with the inclusion of the low-income cluster. To establish oversight of this project, Centerville created a Storm Water Utility Board and implemented a rate ordinance for the operation and maintenance of a Storm Water Utility. 
   Funds were provided through the State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) program within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
