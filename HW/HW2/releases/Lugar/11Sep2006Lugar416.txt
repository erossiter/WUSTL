SEN. LUGAR INTRODUCES DARFUR PEACE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today introduced the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 which addresses the immediate crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan and includes targeted sanctions against parties responsible for continuing the atrocities and war crimes in Darfur. 
   Specifically, Lugar's bill includes:  
   * Clear authority to provide the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with all appropriate and necessary assistance including in the areas of logistics, communications, material support, technical and training assistance, command and control, surveillance, and intelligence; 
   * Targeted sanctions on individuals determined by the President to be "complicit in, or responsible for, acts of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity in Darfur;" 
   * The prohibition of assistance, other than humanitarian assistance, to those countries violating United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591 for Sudan; 
   * Sense of Congress that the international community should immediately act to mobilize forces and resources to fulfill the requirements of UN Resolution 1706 authorizing a peacekeeping force for Darfur in support of the Darfur Peace Agreement; 
   * Sense of Congress that the President should appoint a Special Envoy for Sudan and particularly the Darfur region; 
   * Sense of Congress that NATO assistance to AMIS should continue and should include support for aerial surveillance; 
   * Sense of Congress that the President should deny entry to the U.S. of certain sea-going vessels conducting business with Sudan whose cargoes are determined to be inconsistent with humanitarian efforts or the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan or the Darfur Peace Agreement. 
   * Clear authority to provide assistance for the reconstruction of southern Sudan and other marginalized areas in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan while maintaining existing sanctions on the Government of Sudan. 
   "I rise today to introduce a bill that is a product of a significant amount of consideration and work within our Congress over the last year and a half. The Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 has had many iterations since both the Senate and the House introduced legislation by the same name in 2005. Each piece of legislation that has been introduced has contributed to Congress' understanding of this issue and has ensured a more complete and thoughtful response," said Lugar. 
   "There is a consensus within Congress that the genocidal policies of the Bashir regime in Sudan must be condemned and opposed. Many members have introduced bills and resolutions dealing with the crisis and members have been vocal about the urgency of this issue through hearings, statements, visits to the region, and other activities. This consensus has been supported by numerous groups and individual Americans who have lent their voices to the effort to prevent genocide and their resources to provide relief to those in the region who are facing violence and bleak circumstances. 
   "The legislation I am introducing today is intended to provide a vehicle upon which Members can quickly concur and consolidate their efforts in providing needed authorities for our State Department and targeted sanctions to compel Khartoum to comply with their agreements. Regrettably, the Darfur Peace Agreement appears to be faltering with the ill-advised rejection of the UN Resolution establishing a UN peacekeeping force to transition from the overburdened African Union Mission in Sudan. The situation has become insecure for humanitarian operations and as threatening to the people of the region as ever it has been. The United Nations Security Council Resolution authorizing a peacekeeping force for Darfur is a unanimous signal that the international community is committed to seeing no further violence take place in Darfur. Sudan, as a member of the United Nations, must abide by this decision of the international community. Their national and international responsibility is to serve and protect their people, and the suffering and killing in Darfur must end. The gargantuan humanitarian effort to provide basic necessities for more than two million displaced persons requires unrestricted access by national and international aid organizations, as well as the UN-mandated peacekeeping force to ensure their security. 
   "This legislation also seeks to help consolidate the difficult road to recovery in Southern Sudan in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan. I have included additional authorities for our officials to provide assistance to Southern Sudan, as well as Darfur. Such economic and military assistance is necessary and requires close consultation with Congress to ensure assistance is not manipulated or misdirected. The bill also sustains existing sanctions on Sudan in direct response to their violation of agreements they have made. The President will have the authority to waive these restrictions if he determines such action is in our national interest; so the flexibility he requires is there as well. 
   "Finally, in further support of peace and to assist U.S. diplomats, targeted sanctions are authorized on individuals whom the President determines are "complicit in, or responsible for, acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur." These sanctions include blocking assets and refusing to grant individuals entry to the United States. Further, this legislation encourages the President to prevent entry at our ports to certain ships in order to deny the Government of Sudan oil revenues and access to deliveries of military equipment. The only exception to such entry should be for those vessels providing assistance in carrying out the elements of the Sudan peace agreements or humanitarian assistance. 
   "Shifting circumstances on the ground in Sudan and at the United Nations have complicated our efforts to achieve consensus on legislation that would help our diplomats resolve the Darfur crisis. I believe the legislation I introduced today can win majority support in the Senate, and I hope it will receive favorable and expeditious consideration in the House." 
   In 2004, Lugar introduced the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act, which was signed by the President on December 23, 2004 (P.L. 108-497). Lugar's legislation provided an additional $300 million in support of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and for the consolidation of the since concluded Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and South Sudan. The Act also imposed targeted sanctions and required reports.
