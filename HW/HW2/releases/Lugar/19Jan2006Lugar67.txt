SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON TRANSFORMING STATE DEPARTMENT, NAMING OF TOBIAS TO HEAD AID
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar praised the naming Randall Tobias to head the U.S. Agency for International Development.  
 He also praised steps being taken by Secretary Rice to transform the State Department. 
   "Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has launched important restructuring and repositioning in the State Department. This is a monumental task, but one that must be undertaken. As Secretary Rice outlined, the State Department has an organization designed at the height of the Cold War. Diplomatic missions and responsibilities, technology and power alignments have changed dramatically. I look forward to working with Secretary Rice and the State Department in the coming months as we try to effect constructive improvements. 
   "This initiative includes expanding and funding State's Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization, which has been the aim of several pieces of legislation that I have introduced. The civilian reserve corps will play a vital role in international post-conflict reconstruction. It will include American police officers, judges, electricians and engineers, bankers and economists. 
   "I am also pleased that Secretary Rice has appointed Randall Tobias to manage U.S. aid programs. He has proven in his private and public sector responsibilities that he can successfully manage big organizations and complicated programs. I am delighted that he and his wife, Marianne, have accepted this new responsibility."
