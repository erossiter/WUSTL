SEN. LUGAR REINTRODUCES HEALTH PROMOTION ACT
  Sens. Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) introduced legislation today that would strengthen the scientific base of health promotion information in this country. The bill, Health Promotion FIRST (Funding Integrated Research, Synthesis and Training) Act, is designed to help Americans stay healthy and encourage the federal government to arrange a more comprehensive plan on health promotion research and activities across federal agencies. 
   The Health Promotion FIRST Act would build the foundation for a coordinated strategy to develop the basic and applied science of health promotion, synthesize research results and disseminate findings to researchers, practitioners and policy makers. 
   "This legislation can offer us the chance to help Americans live a healthier life," said Lugar. "Information is a key in living a healthy lifestyle. This bill will allow for additional research, collection and dissemination of critical information, so that individuals, as well as scientists and policy makers, will have the best information upon which to build their health promotion activities." 
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that of all premature deaths in the U.S., nearly half are caused by lifestyle factors. Studies increasingly show that medical costs are directly related to lifestyle risk factors and related diseases. 
   Health promotion programs have been successful in helping thousands of people improve practices and avoid disease, in addition to helping employers save money. 
   Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop strategic plans focusing on the following: 
   * How to develop the basic and applied science of health promotion; 
   * How to best utilize the authority and resources of the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies to integrate health promotion concepts into health care and other elements of society; 
   * How to synthesize health promotion research into practical guidelines that can be easily disseminated; and 
   * How to best support and develop the health promotion professional and scientific community. 
   Additional funding is also provided for the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to augment current activities related to health promotion research and dissemination. 
   Lugar is a consistent supporter of legislation and activities that promote fitness, nutrition and health. Each September, he hosts an annual community run and walk on the campus of Butler University and Health Fair in the ArtsGarden at Circle Centre Mall in Indianapolis. In addition, he is the only Member of Congress to participate in all 25 Capital Challenge 3-mile races sponsored each spring by the American Council of Life Insurers in Washington, D.C.
