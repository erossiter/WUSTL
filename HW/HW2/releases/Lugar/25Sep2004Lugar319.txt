SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR ANDERSON FIBER OPTIC NETWORK PROJECT
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended that $250,000 be set aside for the Anderson Fiber Network Project. 
   "This is good news for the City," Lugar said. "I commend Mayor Smith for his commitment to this project. This is an important economic development effort for Anderson. I am pleased federal funds can be used to help complete this ambitious effort."
   In a letter earlier this year to the Appropriations Committee, Senator Lugar asked that special funds be set aside for this project.
   Funds recommended by the Appropriations Committee are a part of the annual budget bill for the federal agencies. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this year. The bill may be folded into an omnibus measure.
