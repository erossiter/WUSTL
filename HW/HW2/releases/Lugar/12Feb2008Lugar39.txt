  Sen.

  On June 21, 2007, the Senate passed an energy bill that focuses on new sources of energy and conservation to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The bill includes major provisions initiated by Lugar, including incentives for flexible fuel cars; requirements for greater use of ethanol mixed with petroleum fuels, provisions to promote energy efficiency, and increased energy diplomacy. For more information, read "Senate Approves Energy Bill: Includes Several Lugar Initiatives" at http://lugar.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=277560&&year=2007&.
  For more than a decade, Lugar has stressed the strategic importance of energy security and the economic and security risks of dependence on imported foreign energy sources. His legislative efforts promote sustainable energy production and use, incentives for renewable fuels like cellulosic ethanol and E85, increased fuel economy in cars, and clean coal. The Lugar Energy Initiative at http://lugar.senate.gov/energy highlights not only the repercussions of America's dangerous dependence on imported oil, but also provides information on energy legislation introduced by Lugar, commentary by outside experts and information on alternative and renewable energy sources.
