DOD WILL NOT TEST EXPLOSIVES IN INDIANA
  The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has confirmed to Sen. Dick Lugar that they will not conduct a major test explosion in Lawrence County, Indiana.  
   In an August 29 letter to Lugar, DTRA Acting Director Michael K. Evenson wrote: "Thank you for your inquiry concerning DTRA's Tunnel Target Defeat experiment designated as DIVINE STRAKE. DTRA has no plans to conduct DIVINE STRAKE in the State of Indiana. Any discussion to the contrary is incorrect." 
   Lugar wrote Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on August 16 asking about reports in the August 2 Las Vegas Review-Journal that indicated Indiana was being considered as a possible test location. Secretary Rumsfeld wrote Lugar on August 22, saying that the agency would be providing Lugar with an answer, which they did yesterday.
