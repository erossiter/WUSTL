SENS. LUGAR, BAYH SECURE FUNDING TO STUDY SHOALING NEAR BURNS WATERWAY HARBOR
  Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh voted last night to authorize funding to study shoaling in the vicinity of Burns Waterway Harbor, Indiana as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The bill now heads to conference with the House of Representatives. 
   "Congressman Pete Visclosky secured authorization for this project in the House of Representatives, and I'm pleased to support his efforts in the Senate on this important project," said Lugar. 
   "It has been my pleasure to follow up on the work of Congressman Visclosky by working to see that the Senate provides funding for this important project," Bayh said. "Indiana has a rich natural landscape, and it is our responsibility to preserve it for the next generation of Hoosiers." 
   These funds would be used to study the impact of shoaling near the Burns Waterway Harbor. The Bailly Generating Station is located on Lake Michigan near Chesterton, Indiana, and adjacent to the Burns Waterway Harbor. The water used in the generation of electricity is derived from an intake structure located north of the generating station. When this structure was originally installed, it was approximately 1,500 feet into Lake Michigan. 
   Today, the structure is approximately 700 feet from the beach line due to sand build up following the 1968 installation of a breakwater that prevents sand from flowing farther east to fill in washed out areas of the beach. 
   As a result, sand in the areas around the intake structure must continually be dredged to get water, and more than 1.5 million cubic yards of sand was removed in the 1980's and 1990's. 
   With its proximity to the nearby beach, there are concerns that the intake structure could be a safety hazard for swimmers and boaters on Lake Michigan. 
   Funds were provided through the Small Projects to Prevent or Mitigate Damage Caused by Navigation Projects Program.
