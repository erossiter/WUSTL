SEN. LUGAR STAFF TO COLLECT 90 VETERAN INTERVIEWS AT AUBURN WORLD WAR II MUSEUM
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that his office will collect 90 completed interviews for the Veterans History Project at the World War II Victory Museum in Auburn on Thursday, June 8.  
   Phil Shaull, Lugar's Northeast Indiana Regional Director, will accept the interviews from museum officials on Thursday, June 8 at 2:00 p.m. at the World War II Victory Museum. The Museum is located at 5364 County Road 11 A in Auburn. 
   "I am pleased to add these interviews to the more than 6,500 collected throughout Indiana," Lugar said. "Together, we are making a substantial donation to our national history that will honor these veterans for decades to come." 
   Lugar last visited the World War II Victory Museum during the Grand Opening on May 3, 2003, to discuss the launch of the Veterans History Project in Indiana. 
   Lugar joined with the Library of Congress in the Veterans History Project in February 2002 and has submitted more interviews to the collection on behalf of Indiana than any other state has submitted. 
   The more than 6,500 Lugar submissions come from all of Indiana's 92 counties and account for more than 15 percent of the Library's entire VHP collection. In an effort to collect as many interviews as possible, Lugar has partnered with over 230 individuals and organizations, including AARP Indiana and the Greater Indianapolis Chapter of the NAACP. The histories are permanently archived by the Library of Congress and over time will be available for research and study.
