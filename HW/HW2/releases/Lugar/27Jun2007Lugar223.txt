SEN. LUGAR INTRODUCES BILL TO HELP COMMUNITIES MANAGE COST OF EMERALD ASH BORER
  Sen. Dick Lugar today joined Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) in introducing the Emerald Ash Borer Municipality Assistance Act of 2007. The legislation would help municipalities defray the costs of performing critical Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) management activities. Management activities include managing the EAB population by surveying trees, removing infested trees and replacing removed trees. 
  "Emerald Ash Borer is a serious threat to Indiana's native ash trees and the Hoosier forestry industry," said Lugar. "The only known control is to completely remove Ash trees, and tens of thousands of Indiana ash trees already have been cut down. Increased awareness and vigilance at the start of summer season will help prevent its unintentional spread."
  Emerald Ash Borer was confirmed in Indiana on April 21, 2004, and has been found in 14 counties. Those areas are now under federal quarantines, though resources do not exist to help municipalities combat the spread of the insects. 
  This bill would create a low-interest revolving loan fund for communities for the purchase of capital equipment and replacement trees. Communities would have a 20-year window to repay the loan. In addition, the bill would allow states using federal resources to contract with local units of government to perform EAB duties.
  Lugar is a member and former chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.
