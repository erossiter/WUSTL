GENERAL ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE TO RELEASE WOOD UTILIZATION REPORT REQUESTED BY SEN. LUGAR
  On Thursday, June 22, 2006, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) will release a Wood Utilization report requested by Sens. Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Thad Cochran (R-MS) in July 2004. This report is a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of the federal government to assist industry with wood utilization and product development and the federal capability to develop emerging technologies and transfer them into products and manufacturing processes for wood and wood fiber in the United States. 
   The report is a result of efforts by Lugar to boost the competitiveness of the hardwood industry in Indiana and the nation, and to highlight the economic importance of hardwoods and other wood products to the Indiana and U.S. economy.  
   "Trees hold great economic importance for our State. Indiana forests contribute over $9 billion dollars to our economy annually and our 4.3 million acres of timberland support 54,000 jobs. While Indiana has been a national and world leader in forestry and forest-based manufacturing, it is imperative that we invest even more in this industry's future," said Lugar. 
   "This report will help further the scope of forestry research and discussions about the role the federal government plays in stimulating new activity and data on wood use. The goal was to pool resources to help the wood industry as a whole and connect small business and manufacturers with the necessary tools to navigate the future of the hardwood industry." 
   The report is the first overview of wood utilization research and development activities in the federal government by the GAO. A previous report by the National Research Institute requested by the Forest Service noted that the federal commitment to personnel and financial resources for wood related research and development activity within the Forest Service was declining. 
   The GAO report consolidates significant data into charts and summaries of the activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service (CREES), the Forest Service and various other federal departments engaged in wood research. 
   GAO findings of note: 
   * More wood is consumed each year in the U.S. than all metals, plastics, and masonry cement combined. 
   * At least 12 federal agencies are involved in some form of wood research and product development. From 1995 to 2005, $54 million annually was appropriated for wood research and development. 
   * The Forest Service and the USDA-CREES are the agencies primarily involved in research and product development. The Forest Service is the only federal agency, however, that employs fulltime scientists and researchers (175 in 2004 and 2005) in wood research and wood product development. 
   * Although the Forest Service receives the majority of the funding, its portion of funding and research scientists has declined. The FS received $268 million ($289 million in 2004 dollars adjusted for inflation) from 1995 to 2005. 
   * The USDA-CREES funding increased over the 1995 to 2005 time period. USDA-CREES received approximately $51 million ($ 55 million in 2004 dollars adjusted for inflation) from 1995 to 2005. 
   Also discussed in the report are the various mechanisms the federal government utilizes to transfer knowledge gained through research to the marketplace and manufacturers; specific activities and projected wood research priorities of the CREES funded wood utilization centers; and a summary of the current federal laws and program provisions that apply to wood research and development. 
   Lugar is a member and former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Nutrition. He has championed programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and farm Best Management Practices, which have resulted in the increased potential of trees and crops to sequester CO2 and other gases. The CRP is the largest tree-planting program in history. Millions of acres have been planted to trees since 1985 and millions more have been left as grasses and not tilled. 
   In 2002, Lugar received the Black Walnut Achievement Award from the International Walnut Council and received Indiana's 2002 Tree Farmer of the Year at the 105th Annual Convention of the Indiana Hardwood Lumbermen's Association. 
   Lugar also manages his family's 604-acre corn, soybean and tree farm in Marion County, which in April 2006 became the first Indiana farm to enroll as an offset provider in the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Based on management practices, tree age, tree density, and other factors, the Chicago Climate Exchange estimated that the Lugar farm will capture about 3,400 metric tons of carbon in its approximately 200 acres of walnut trees. CCX member companies buy and trade units of carbon as a way to reduce their impact on climate change.
