SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH CONGRESSIONAL AWARD RECIPIENT JOSEPH BRICKER
  Sen. Dick Lugar recognized Joseph Bricker from Seymour, Indiana on December 10, 2005, as a Congressional Award Bronze Medal recipient.  
 The Congressional Award provides a unique opportunity for young people to set and achieve personally challenging goals in four program areas: volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration.
   To earn his Bronze Medal, Bricker helped the Community Provisions food panty by collecting and distributing goods; practiced his basketball skills and improved his shot accuracy from 20 percent to 30 percent; participated in Philmont, a two-week hike through the rugged mountains of Colorado; and participated in an eight-week sign language course during which he learned the basics of sign language and several phrases.
   The Congressional Award was established in 1979 through the Congressional Award Act. It is a public-private partnership created by Congress to promote and recognize achievement, initiative and service of America's youth aged 14 to 23 and is the first and only award for youth legislated by the U. S. Congress. Through this award, the Congress looks to honor and encourage volunteer public service and recognize the unsung and important accomplishments of young Americans throughout the United States.
