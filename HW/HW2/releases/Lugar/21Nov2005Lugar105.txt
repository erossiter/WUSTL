ANDERSON TO RECEIVE FUNDING TO EXPAND FIBER OPTIC NETWORK
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the City of Anderson will receive $250,000 to expand its fiber optic network and extend the technology to local businesses, as part of the Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development Conference Report passed by the Senate on Friday, November 18.  
   "Recent years have witnessed a technological revolution which stands to reshape the lives of Hoosiers in positive ways and improve lives for many," Lugar said. "These additional funds will allow Anderson to strengthen its infrastructure and continue its economic transition from the manufacturing to the commercial sector." 
   Anderson already has invested more than $875,000 to install a fiber optic ring around the city. This additional $250,000 will allow businesses to connect to the network and potentially encourage new business in the city. 
   In the past decade, the City of Anderson has lost about 20,000 automobile manufacturing jobs. This project demonstrates the city's motivation to attract innovative new businesses. 
   In May, Lugar met with Anderson Mayor Kevin Smith and the Madison County Chamber of Commerce to discuss economic initiatives. In both meetings, the strategic importance of a citywide fiber optic network was emphasized. 
   Anderson also received $125,000 for design and construction of an Intermodal Transportation Facility. The intermodal facility would serve city and inter-city buses as well as taxis and possible light rail service, if constructed in the future.
