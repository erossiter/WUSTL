SEN. LUGAR COMMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement on the President's State of the Union Address:
  "The President's State of the Union address underscores the importance of doing the nation's business even as the excitement of the presidential campaign distracts attention from important work in Washington. In the coming year we will face serious economic, energy security and foreign policy challenges that must be directly confronted. Every attempt should be made to set aside partisan gamesmanship and have a productive year."
