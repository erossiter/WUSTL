SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES FOUR GRANTS FOR ENERGY-RELATED PROJECTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are accepting applications for energy-related projects. 
   "While the challenges are great, there is reason for optimism," said Lugar. "Our current energy balance is the result of industrial and consumption choices of the past. Despite our import dependence today, the U.S. is in a strong position to choose a different path, a path toward real energy security. Success would free future generations of Americans from the energy dilemma that threatens to compromise our security and prosperity. It could also lead to opportunities in many new industries that could reinvigorate our economy."  
   The four grant opportunities, which are currently open for application, are listed below in order of application deadline: 
   * USDA is requesting applications from independent producers, farmer and rancher cooperatives, agricultural producer groups and majority-controlled producer-based business ventures for Value-Added Producer Grants. These competitive grants may be used for value-added planning activities or for working capital for marketing value-added agricultural products. Farm-based renewable energy projects are included in this program. Approximately $19.4 million in funds will be available, and applications are due May 16, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit http://www.grants.gov/search/search.do?oppId=7374&mode=VIEW or contact USDA's State Rural Development Office at (317) 290-3100 ext. 427. 
   * USDA is requesting applications from agriculture producers and rural small businesses in eligible rural areas to purchase renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements. $23 million in funds will be available in the form of grants, guaranteed loans and combined grant/loan guarantee applications with awards ranging from $1,500 to $500,000. Grant applications are due May 18, 2007. Guaranteed loan applications and combined applications are due July 2, 2007. USDA will announce grant awards in August. For more information, interested applicants should visit http://www.grants.gov/search/search.do?oppId=13211&mode=VIEW or contact USDA's State Rural Development Office at (317) 290-3100 ext. 427. 
   * DOE has partnered with the United States Advanced Battery Consortium to offer $28 million in grants for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle battery development. Applications are due May 31, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit http://www.uscar.org/guest/article_view.php?articles_id=87 or call Harshad Tataria at (586) 575-3472 or Eric Heim at (415) 472-1157. 
   * NSF is requesting applications from small businesses for its Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs Phase I Solicitations FY-2008 (SBIR/STTR). Funds will support high quality projects on important scientific, engineering or science and engineering education problems and opportunities that could lead to significant commercial and public benefit if the research is successful. Projects to accelerate energy-related industrial innovation in the U.S. by leveraging high technology capabilities of small businesses based upon fundamental scientific research and engineering innovation are also eligible for consideration. Applications are due June 13, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07551/nsf07551.pdf. 
   "All possibilities for growth in biofuels production must be explored to decrease our 'oil addiction.' I believe that alternative fuels, combined with hybrid and other technologies, can begin to move us away from our extreme dependence on oil in the next decade," said Lugar. "This is not a short-term proposition, but we can offset a significant portion of demand for oil by giving American consumers a real choice of automotive fuel." 
   On the first day of the 110th Congress, Lugar introduced the National Fuels Initiative, multifaceted legislation that seeks to diversify the energy mix by encouraging sustained production and use of non-petroleum based fuels. The bill would require all U.S. marketed vehicles to be manufactured as FFVs by 2016, require the major U.S. gasoline companies to carry E-85 renewable fuel in 50 percent of their gas stations, and extend and increase the renewable fuels standard (RFS) established by the Fuels Security Act of 2005. 
   Lugar also strongly supported the Energy Policy Act, which was signed into law by President Bush in 2005 and represents an important step towards addressing our nation's long-term energy needs. The legislation will help to modernize America's energy production and distribution systems, encourage conservation and improve our environment and our national security by encouraging the development of clean domestic energy resources. 
   For more than a decade, Lugar has stressed the strategic importance of energy security and the economic and security risks of dependence on imported foreign energy sources. His legislative efforts promote sustainable energy production and use, incentives for renewable fuels like cellulosic ethanol and E85, increased fuel economy in cars, and clean coal. The Lugar Energy Initiative at http://lugar.senate.gov/energy highlights not only the repercussions of America's dangerous dependence on imported oil, but also provides information on energy legislation introduced by Lugar, commentary by outside experts and information on alternative and renewable energy sources.
