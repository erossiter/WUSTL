CULVER ACADEMY BLACK HORSE TROOP, EQUESTRIENNES TO MARCH IN 55TH PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL PARADE
  Sen. Dick Lugar learned today that the Culver Academy Black Horse Troop and Equestriennes will march in the 55th Presidential Inaugural Parade on January 20, 2005.  
 This will mark the 13th time the Black Horse Troop has participated in an inaugural parade. 
   "This is an exciting opportunity for the Black Horse Troop and Equestriennes from Culver Academy. The Black Horse Troop has a long tradition of participating in inaugural parades dating back to Woodrow Wilson's inaugural parade in 1913, when they served as the escort for Vice President Thomas Marshall, a former Indiana governor," Lugar said. "In addition, this will mark the fifth Presidential Inaugural Parade for the Equestriennes." 
   The Troopers and Equestriennes, each mounted on a black horse and carrying a 3' X 5' American flag, will march in parade formation. 
   The Culver Black Horse Troop is the largest remaining mounted cavalry unit in the United States. It is comprised of riders from 19 states and 9 countries on all-black mounts along with the female riding unit, the Equestriennes. The Troop was founded in 1897 when Culver Academy purchased 16 mounts from the Cleveland National Guard after having seen the National Guard unit participate in President William McKinley's inaugural parade.
