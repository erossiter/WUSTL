REPORT ARGUES NEW STEPS FOR NUNN-LUGAR
  The Henry L. Stimson Center has released a new report that says, "Nunn-Lugar threat reduction and nonproliferation programs remain the best and most cost-effective means of mitigating the threat of terrorist groups acquiring WMD capabilities."  
   However, in the report, "25 Steps to Prevent Nuclear Terrorism: A Guide for Policymakers," and a new book, Cooperative Nonproliferation: Getting Further, Faster, authors Brian D. Finlay and Elizabeth Turpen argue for "a series of pragmatic, politically viable steps that must be taken to ensure the full and effective implementation of these critical national security programs and maximize the return on investment in these programs." 
   The report says that Nunn-Lugar and its companion programs "have achieved remarkable success during the past fifteen years. But, despite their front-line importance for preventing the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, materials, and expertise, their potential has not been fully realized due to bureaucratic encumbrances, a sustained lack of White House and congressional support, and enduring vestiges of Cold War Suspicion...
   "There is no greater threat to global security than the diffusion of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons expertise and materials. Without an integrated approach to securing the large inventories of WMD materials and expertise around the world, the United States will have failed to accomplish its primary national security goal to keep the 'world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people.'"
