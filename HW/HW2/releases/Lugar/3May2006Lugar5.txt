SEN. LUGAR'S TEAM STILL NUMBER 1 AFTER 25 YEARS
 Sen. Dick Lugar's team finished first in the Senate division at the 25th Annual Capital Challenge 3-mile race to benefit Special Olympics. It was the 7th time Lugar's team has won the Senate division.  
   Lugar is the only person to have run in all 25 races and was honored this year with the entry number 25. Race organizers awarded him with a Wheaties Box picturing Lugar running the first race and running last year's race. Lugar was captain and one of five runners on the team of senate staffers. 
   Lugar's teams have finished in first place in 1988, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, and 2006. His teams finished second in 1987, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004, and 2005. Lugar was the fastest member of the Senate in 1984 and 1988. 
   "The three-mile road race is one of the Capital's most enduring sports traditions," wrote race organizer Jeff Darman in announcing the 25th annual event. The race includes senators, congressmen, executive branch agency heads, judges and the media. 14 senators entered the race this year. 
   Lugar has been an advocate of physical fitness, health and preventative medicine throughout his career in public life. In September 2005, Lugar hosted the 27th Annual Dick Lugar Community Run, Walk, and Corporate Challenge as part of the Lugar Fitness Festival, which includes a free health fair.
