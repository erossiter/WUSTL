SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON PROTESTS IN BURMA
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today made the following statement on the ongoing protests in Burma:  
  The ongoing peaceful protests in Burma reflect courage and conviction on the part of citizens throughout Burma.
  I am hopeful the leaders of those countries who actively engage with the ruling junta, India, Russia, Japan, and China, in particular, are encouraging Burmese military leaders not to respond with violence against the peaceful protesters, but to respond appropriately to the legitimate grievances being expressed.
  It is essential that those who have elected to engage continually with this regime leverage the influence they maintain. With the world as a witness, the junta will be remembered as responsible for any actions of violence in response to the peaceful protests. Also accountable will be those nations who provide economic or military sustenance to this regime.
  The leaders of those countries who have a special relationship with the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) are in a position to offer an important and positive contribution to the current crisis in Burma. I hope and pray they will proceed accordingly.
