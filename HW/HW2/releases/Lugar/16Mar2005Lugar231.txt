HUD GRANTS MADE TO INDIANA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that 22 Indiana communities will receive various grants totaling more than $37.8 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
   The grants awarded to Indiana were the HOME program, the American Dream Down-payment Initiative (ADDI), the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), the Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) and the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) awards. 
   The HOME program helps to expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low-income and very-low income families by providing grants to states and local governments to fund housing programs that meet local needs and priorities. 
   The ADDI program is a new initiative under the HOME program that promotes home ownership opportunities by provided necessary resources for down-payment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority households. 
   The CDBG program provides annual grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low-income and moderate-income persons. 
   The ESG program provides annual grants to state, local and private entities to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters. 
   The HOPWA program provides housing assistance and related supportive services to states, local units of government and non-profit organizations for projects that benefit low-income persons medically diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and their families.
