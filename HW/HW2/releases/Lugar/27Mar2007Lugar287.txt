GRANTS AWARDED TO THREE HOOSIER COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that three Indiana communities will receive rural development funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  
   "Our rural communities play a critical role in Indiana's prosperity," said Lugar. "We must work to ensure rural Hoosiers have adequate support, equipment and training, and I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has recognized these Indiana communities." 
   The City of Connersville has been awarded a grant of $41,400 and a loan of $77,000. These funds will be used to purchase a new ambulance for the Fayette County First Aid Unit, jointly operated by the City of Connersville and the Fayette County Commissioners. The current ambulance is over ten years old and has high mileage. 
   Fountain County has been awarded a grant of $6,108 which will be used to purchase personal protection gear and new training equipment for the Fountain County Ambulance Service. Presently, the county's training mannequin is over 30 years old and in poor condition. The new mannequin will be used to train Fountain County Ambulance employees and other area emergency personnel. 
   The Town of Modoc has been awarded a grant of $345,000 and a loan of $677,000. These funds will be used to cover a cost overrun for the construction of a sewer collection system and wastewater treatment plant project.
