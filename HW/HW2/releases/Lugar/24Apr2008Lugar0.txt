SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE AWARD
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with the Spirit of Enterprise award for his support of pro-business issues during the first session of the 110th Congress.  
   "Senator Lugar has proven to be an effective ally to the business community, supporting legislation that helps grow the economy and creates new jobs for hardworking Americans," said Tom Donahue, Chamber President and CEO. "The Chamber is grateful for Senator Lugar's commitment to these important issues and is proud to present him with this award."
   The Chamber awards the Spirit of Enterprise based on rankings it gives Members of Congress for key business votes. Key votes are recorded floor votes on issues established as priorities by the Chamber's board of directors. Senate and House members who support the Chamber's position on at least 70 percent of these key votes receive the "Spirit of Enterprise Award." Lugar scored 91 percent with the Chamber in 2007 and has also has a 91 percent cumulative ranking during his tenure in Congress.
   This is the twentieth year that the U.S. Chamber has formally honored the accomplishments of Members of Congress who support a pro-business legislative agenda. Lugar is a past recipient of the Spirit of Enterprise award.
   Lugar, has also received the "Small Business Champion" award from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, the "Hero of the Taxpayer" award by the Americans for Tax Reform, and has repeatedly received the nonpartisan "Watchdog of the Treasury" award for fighting wasteful spending.
