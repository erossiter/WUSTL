LETTER #7: REPORT ON RELIEF AND RECONSTRUCTION
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today sent the seventh letter in a series of letters to his fellow Members of Congress to "strive to elevate our debate by studying thoughtful sources of information and embracing civility in our discourse." Below is the text of the seventh letter. Each letter and any reports mentioned are available at http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq. 
   This week I write to share with you a recently-released Congressionally-mandated report on Iraq produced by the State Department. This quarterly report on progress in Iraq is known as the "2207 Report," after the section of Public Law 108-106 that mandates it. I encourage all members to become familiar with the report, because it tracks the programs and initiatives being funded by the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) - the $18.4 billion that Congress appropriated for Iraq in FY 2004. 
   The report's length comes from the degree of detail it provides about reconstruction activities and accomplishments in Iraq during the last quarter. Of particular interest are the charts summarizing the IRRF's status on pages 19-21 and Appendix II cataloging the contributions of other donors. 
   The 2207 Report documents how American taxpayer dollars are being spent in an effort to create a foundation upon which a stable Iraq can grow. It provides helpful information on the Rule of Law Program (p. I-30), school construction (p. I-113), private sector development (p. I-95), the production of clean water (p. I-70), improved agriculture capacity (p. I-100), and many other areas of interest. Congressional understanding of these efforts is essential, because success in Iraq will depend greatly on how well these programs work. 
   I hope you find this information useful.
