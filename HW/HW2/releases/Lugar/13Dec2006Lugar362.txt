   Applications for this grant must be accessed, completed and submitted through http://www.grants.gov by Thursday, January 18, 2007.

   From the grant synopsis: 
   The organism must be able to survive a wide range of environmental conditions and be genetically stable. Only those applicants who are willing and able to take the strains to a commercial scale and have a sound business strategy to license and market the organism will be eligible for consideration. The applicant must identify its target high impact feedstock. A high impact feedstock is defined as one that is sustainable at quantities exceeding 100 million tons per year. Commercialization will be defined as the transition from research to routine operational application.
