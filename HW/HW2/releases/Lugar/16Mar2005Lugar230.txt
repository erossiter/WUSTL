2005 ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS GRANT PROGRAM
  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters program presents an opportunity for Indiana's rural, urban and suburban fire departments and non-fire based EMS organizations to obtain financial assistance to help procure much-needed equipment and vehicles, provide vital facilities and personnel training and to offer fire and health safety education to the communities they serve.  
 Through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2005, Congress provided $715 million for Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG). 
   The application deadline is April 8. Applications are automated and accessible via the AFG web site: http://www.firegrantsupport.com.
