SEN. LUGAR ENCOURAGES MEDICARE RECIPIENTS TO RESEARCH PRESCRIPTION DRUG CARD OPTIONS
  Sen. Dick Lugar is encouraging all 880,545 Hoosiers with access to a Medicare prescription drug benefit to investigate the possibility that they can save money with a federally approved Medicare prescription drug card.  
   The cards are the first part of the recently approved Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act to be implemented, legislation Lugar supported. He has backed a prescription drug discount program since 2000 when he cosponsored the first legislative attempt, which was introduced that year. 
   "The Medicare bill that recently became law will be phased in over time," said Lugar. "This program, however, allows seniors and those with disabilities to start saving money right away. The pieces are now in place to allow Medicare recipients to research options that work best for their healthcare needs." 
   Private organizations can now market their Medicare-approved discount cards to people with Medicare and beneficiaries are now able to compare cards and enroll in the one they choose. Medicare is providing a new Price Comparison Web site at www.Medicare.gov, on which industry drug prices are being posted for the first time. 
   Enrollment in the program will cost seniors up to $30 a year. The program is expected to save enrollees 10-25 percent off the price of their prescription drugs. For seniors whose income is less than $12,123 a year or couples whose income is less than $16,362, the cards will provide an additional $600 credit. Seniors who qualify for the $600 credit will not pay the enrollment fee. 
   Seniors are now able to enroll in the program and will start seeing savings in June.
