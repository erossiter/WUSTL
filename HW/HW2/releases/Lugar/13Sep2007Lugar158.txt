SEN. LUGAR SUPPORTS INTENT TO NOMINATE ASEAN AMBASSADOR
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican leader Dick Lugar made the following statement: 
  "I commend President Bush for his recent announcement to leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that he will appoint an Ambassador to ASEAN. This decision reflects the President's high regard for ASEAN and signals his commitment to strengthening the already vibrant U.S. - ASEAN relationship," Lugar said.
  "In 2006, the Senate passed S. 2697, legislation I introduced along with Senators Biden, Hagel, Kerry, Feingold, Obama, Bond, and Akaka to establish the position of U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs. This bipartisan initiative reflected interest by the Senate in providing greater emphasis on U.S. relations with ASEAN which is the third largest export market for U.S. products."
  Earlier this year, the Senate passed S. Res. 110, introduced by Lugar, to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the ASEAN - U.S. dialogue and which also called for appointment of a U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs.
  ASEAN is comprised of Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN was originally established in 1967 with five members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The ASEAN - U.S. dialogue and relationship began in 1977; today ASEAN is the 3rd largest export destination for American products. Nearly 40,000 ASEAN students study in the United States.
