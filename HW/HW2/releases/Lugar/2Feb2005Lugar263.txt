GRANTS MADE TO INDIANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that eight Indiana communities will receive firefighter assistance grants totaling $583,546 from the Department of Homeland Security for training programs and modifications to stations and equipment.  
   The awards are among grants made to fire departments throughout the U.S. announced this week in round thirty-three of the 2004 Assistance to Firefighter Grant program. 
   "I strongly support the efforts of Indiana fire departments to conduct operations, promote fire safety and equip themselves with the tools and the training they need to perform effectively," Lugar said. "I have seen first-hand how these funds have an important impact on Indiana fire departments. These funds help increase the level of service firefighters are able to provide to their communities." 
   For the 2004 program, $750 million was appropriated to provide direct assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. 
   Applicants had to demonstrate financial need and articulate the benefits to be derived from the grant funds in their applications. 
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
