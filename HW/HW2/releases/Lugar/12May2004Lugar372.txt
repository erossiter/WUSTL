JOBS BILL RECENTLY APPROVED
  Sen. Dick Lugar applauded the approval of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act yesterday.  
 The bill replaces export tax incentives given to U.S. companies that the World Trade Organization had deemed improper with tax incentives for U.S. manufacturers. 
   "This change in law will continue to allow U.S. companies to compete globally for market share, while keeping us in line with our treaty obligations," said Lugar. 
   The bill also included measures to promote a wide-range of energy tax incentives, including the use of alternative fuels, which had been stalled in Congress. 
   Lugar has been a long-time champion of alternative fuels, specifically bio-fuel and biomass. "I am pleased that the tax credits for alternative fuels was included in this legislation," said Lugar. "I am a consistent supporter of the greater use of bio-fuels." 
   "Additionally, bio-fuels and bio-chemicals increase energy independence and security, reduce greenhouse gases and would significantly improve rural economies in America and around the world," Lugar added. 
   The legislation calls for tax breaks for a wide variety of alternative energy issues, such as hybrid vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, bio-fuels production and clean coal technology. 
   The measure provides some tax incentives for greater domestic oil and natural gas production to occur. Also covered are provisions for energy conservation and efficiency efforts. 
   A companion measure has yet to clear the House of Representatives.
