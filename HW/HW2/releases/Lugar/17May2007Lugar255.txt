SENS. LUGAR, BAYH SECURE FUNDING FOR FORT WAYNE FLOOD CONTROL
  Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh last night voted to authorize $5.3 million in funding for the Fort Wayne and Vicinity Flood Control project. This new funding would provide flood control protection for an additional section of the St. Mary's River and the Fairfield Ditch as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The bill now heads to conference with the House of Representatives. 
   "Projects for flood damage reduction and mitigation are criticaly important to Hoosiers living near bodies of water and in flood plains. This funding will assist with an important infrastructure improvement for the residents of Fort Wayne," said Lugar. 
   "Flood control projects are critical to protecting Hoosier homes and businesses," Bayh said. "By funding these projects we can help ensure that the City of Fort Wayne is protected from the often devistating effects of floods." 
   In the past three years, the City of Fort Wayne has experienced two record flooding events which highlighted flood control deficiencies in the area known as the Fairfield ditch and an adjacent section of the St. Mary's River. 
   At the request of the city, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a reconnaissance study of the Fairfield Ditch and the flood prone section of the St. Mary's River and determined the benefits and the critical need to undertake this project before another major wet weather event. 
   Mayor Graham Richard requested this project be authorized, and the City of Fort Wayne is prepared to match the federal investment at a cost share of 65 percent federal and 35 percent local. Funds were provided through the Small Projects for Flood Damage Reduction program.
