BUDGET IS THE STARTING POINT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar noted today that the president's budget submission is the beginning of the annual policy and funding debate in Washington.  
   "President Bush's proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2008 is the first step in a lengthy process. The budget does not determine specific funding levels for programs; it simply outlines a broad framework for spending. Funding levels for specific programs are determined during the appropriations process which will occur later this year," Lugar said. 
   "It is critical that our final budget plan put our most critical national priorities first: protecting America at home and abroad, growing the economy and creating jobs, and maintaining budget discipline. In addition, we must provide resources for important energy, education, health care, veterans, and social service priorities." 
   Lugar highlighted the budget funding of three bills he authored: 
   * The President's budget proposes the permanent extension of Lugar's Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act at an estimated cost of $1.4 billion over 10 years. (http://lugar.senate.gov/pressapp/record.cfm?id=261295) 
   * Lugar's Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 has never been fully funded. For 2008, the president's budget proposes an increase to $29 million from $12 million in 2007. The program can be funded as high as $200 million. The president also proposes increasing the Department of Energy Biomass ethanol research from $92 million to $179 million. 
   * Earlier this year, the Lugar-Obama program became law (http://lugar.senate.gov/pressapp/record.cfm?id=267485). For more than a year the senators have been pressing for greater activity in the areas of conventional weapons reduction and counter proliferation. The 2008 proposed State Department budget increases conventional weapons elimination to $45 million from only $8 million in 2007. The budget proposes a slight decrease in counter proliferation assistance, $41 million in 2008, down from $45 million in 2007. Taken together, these two programs would be increase from $53 million to $86 million.
