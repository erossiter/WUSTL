NEARLY $7 MILLION IN HUD GRANTS AWARDED TO INDIANA COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that six Indiana communities will receive multiple grants totaling $6,804,488 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
   "As a former mayor and also as the former Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, I recognize the value of federal housing programs and the need of many Americans for housing assistance. The funds announced today will help ensure Hoosiers have the opportunity to live in safe, decent, affordable housing in economically stable communities," said Lugar. 
  The types of grants awarded include the HOME Award, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG).
  The HOME program helps to expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low-income families by providing grants to state and local governments to fund housing programs that meet local needs and priorities.
  The CDBG program provides annual grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, primarily for low-and-moderate-income persons.
  The ESG program provides annual grants to states, local and private entities to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters.
