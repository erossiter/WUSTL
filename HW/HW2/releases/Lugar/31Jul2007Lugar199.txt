SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR ENERGY-RELATED PROJECTS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are accepting applications for energy-related projects.
   "Our current energy balance is the result of industrial and consumption choices of the past. Despite our import dependence today, the U.S. is in a strong position to choose a different path, a path toward real energy security. Success would free future generations of Americans from the energy dilemma that threatens to compromise our security and prosperity. It could also lead to opportunities in many new industries that could reinvigorate our economy," said Lugar. 
   The four grant opportunities currently open for application are listed below in order of application deadline:
   * The EPA is requesting applications from eligible entities for the study and analysis of innovative feedstock sources for the production of renewable fuels as an alternative to petroleum-based fuels including for each feedstock its potential based on availability, production efficiency, costs and resources use (e.g. water, fertilizer and fossil fuels, etc). The award ceiling is $750,000, and applications are due August 24, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit www.epa.gov/air/grants/07-12.pdf or contact Elizabeth Etchells at the EPA by phone at 202-564-1372 or by email at etchells.elizabeth@epa.gov
   * The EPA is requesting applications from eligible entities for proposals to advance national, regional and local energy efficiency programming by utilizing market-based approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency in homes and buildings. Awards will range from $40,000 to $400,000, and applications are due August 30, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit www.epa.gov/air/grants/07-08.pdf or contact Kayla Roach at the EPA by phone at 202-343-9186 or by email at roach.kayla@epa.gov
   * The NSF is requesting applications from eligible entities for the Energy for Sustainability program which supports fundamental research and education in energy production, conversion and storage. The program is focused on energy sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable such as sunlight, wind and biomass. The duration of unsolicited awards is generally one to three years with an average annual award size of $100,000. Applications are due September 15, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501026 or contact Trung Nguyn at the NSF by phone at 703-292-8320 or by email at tnguyen@nsf.gov
   * The EPA is requesting applications from eligible entities for the Midwest Clean Diesel Initiative which supports projects that will demonstrate effective emissions reducions. Projects may include, but are not limited to, a variety of diesel emissions reductions solutions such as: add-on pollution control technology, vehicle replacement, engine replacement, idle reduction technologies or strategies, or cleaner burning fuel use. The award ceiling is $300,000 and applications are due September 18, 2007. For more information, interested applicants should visit www.epa.gov/midwestcleandiesel/grants/mcdi-rfp-2007.pdf or contact Steve Marquardt at the EPA by phone at 312-353-3214 or by email at Marquardt.Steve@epa.gov
   On June 21, 2007, the Senate passed an energy bill that focuses on new sources of energy and conservation to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The bill includes major provisions initiated by Lugar, including incentives for flexible fuel cars, requirements for greater use of ethanol mixed with petroleum fuels, provisions to promote energy efficiency, and increased energy diplomacy. Most provisions of the Energy Efficiency Promotion section of the bill (Title II) come from legislation that Lugar co-sponsored with Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Pete Domenici (R-NM). This title would reduce our nation's use of fossil fuels by improving the efficiency of vehicles, buildings, home appliances, and industrial equipment. For more information, read "Senate Approves Energy Bill: Includes Several Lugar Initiatives" at http://lugar.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=277560&&year=2007&.
   For more than a decade, Lugar has stressed the strategic importance of energy security and the economic and security risks of dependence on imported foreign energy sources. His legislative efforts promote sustainable energy production and use, incentives for renewable fuels like cellulosic ethanol and E85, increased fuel economy in cars and clean coal. The Lugar Energy Initiative at http://lugar.senate.gov/energy highlights not only the repercussions of America's dangerous dependence on imported oil, but also provides information on energy legislation introduced by Lugar, commentary by outside experts and information on alternative and renewable energy sources.
