BIOTOWN AWARDED $1.71 MILLION USDA GRANT
  U.S. Senator Dick Lugar was recently notified that the Town of Reynolds has been awarded a $1.71 million water and waste disposal grant from the Rural Development office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
  The funds will be used to construct a new mechanical wastewater treatment plant, including a new control building with office, laboratory and standby generator. 
  "Our nation can attain a greater degree of energy independence using domestic and renewable resources, and our national security demands that we make the shift quickly," said Lugar. "Reaching this goal requires the continued expansion of renewable fuel use, and I congratulate BioTown on being selected for this award which will help local leaders take another step toward expanding renewable fuel use in Indiana."
  The Town of Reynolds was selected in 2005 to demonstrate to the nation and the world that a community's energy needs can be fully met through locally produced renewable sources including electricity, natural gas replacement and vehicular fuel. Lugar last visited BioTown in October 2006 as part of a statewide energy tour in an E85 fueled car.
