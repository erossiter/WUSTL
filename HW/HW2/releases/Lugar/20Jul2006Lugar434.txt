SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH INDIANA NAACP; RELEASES STATEMENT ON VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Dick Lugar met with members of the Indiana NAACP in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing room yesterday, July 19, 2006. The group was in Washington, D.C., for the NAACP's national conference.  
   Lugar and the group discussed the minimum wage, higher education funding and the Voting Rights Act (VRA). During discussion of the VRA, Lugar recalled his service as Mayor of Indianapolis and the racial tension following the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   Lugar supported the VRA today as it passed the Senate by a vote of 98-0. Lugar also submitted the following statement for the record today: 
   "Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the reauthorization of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
   "I was a member of the Indianapolis School Board and Mayor of Indianapolis during the civil rights movement, and I witnessed firsthand the critical importance of promoting justice and understanding in our communities. Following the tragic death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., while I was serving as Mayor, so many of my friends and neighbors in Indianapolis came together in peace and reconciliation, and I am grateful that our city served as a model to so many other cities that were unfortunately stricken with violence and division. 
   "It is in the spirit of justice, harmony, and compassion that we must join together to pass this important legislation. This is a signal moment for the Senate and I am pleased that President Bush will sign this bill into law as the 41st Anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act approaches on August 6th."
