CITY OF GARY AWARDED DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the City of Gary will receive a Weed and Seed Communities Program grant of $175,000 from the Department of Justice. The funds will support efforts, including community policing, to create a safe and drug-free environment in the University Park/Glen Park area. This is the second time the city has received funds from the Department of Justice for this project. 
  The Weed and Seed Program focuses on reducing drug and other related criminal activity; reducing juvenile crime; and improving residents' perception of the neighborhood. Project goals include improving community policing, promoting prevention and treatment programs, and enhancing the physical and aesthetic qualities of the neighborhood. 
  For the purposes of this project, the University Park/Glen Park is bounded by Grant Street on the west, Mississippi Street on the east, I-80/94 on the north, and 47th Avenue on the south.
