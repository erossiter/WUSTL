INDYGO RECEIVES $2.3 MILLION GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation (IndyGo) has been awarded a $2,380,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
   "Efficient and reliable transportation is critical for the economic success of a city," Lugar said. "Enhancement of the Indianapolis transit system will also ensure the safety of people traveling in the city."
   This grant will provide funds to the IndyGo for design and project management activities related to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis Intermodal Center. 
   On September 12, 2007, Lugar secured $4 million to fund the acquisition of electric hybrid buses for transit operators across the State of Indiana. The funding is included in the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill. The legislation now heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. Should the project be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies. The bill then heads to the President for his signature. 
  Please contact the U.S. Department of Transportation at 202-366-4904 for more information regarding this grant. Questions regarding the grants process in general may be directed to Kim Preston, Grants Coordinator for Senator Lugar, by phone at 202-224-4814 or by email at grants@lugar.senate.gov
