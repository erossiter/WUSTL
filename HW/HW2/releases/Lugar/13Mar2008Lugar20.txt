SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES HIV/AIDS BILL
  The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved the U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act (S. 2731) by a vote of 18-3. 
   The bill was introduced by Sens. Joe Biden (D-DE), Dick Lugar (R-IN), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and John Sununu (R-NH). It expands upon the 5-year-old PEPFAR effort to stem the tide of these diseases worldwide.
   "PEPFAR has focused on prevention programs, with a target of preventing 7 million new HIV infections. As Americans, we should take pride in our nation's efforts to combat these diseases overseas," Lugar said. "Moreover, we should understand that our investments in disease prevention programs have yielded enormous foreign policy benefits during the last five years. PEPFAR has helped to prevent instability and societal collapse in a number of at-risk countries; it has stimulated contributions from other wealthy nations to fight AIDS; it has facilitated deep partnerships with a new generation of African leaders; and it has improved attitudes toward the United States in Africa and other regions. In my judgment, the dollars spent on this program can be justified purely on the basis of the humanitarian results that we have achieved. But the value of this investment clearly extends to our national security and to our national reputation."

   The bill includes language directing the Secretary of Treasury to participate in negotiations for advance market commitments to develop vaccines for HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases. The language is similar to Lugar's Vaccine of the Future Act (S. 569). The House companion bill was introduced by Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-IN).
