HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION AWARDED $2.9 MILLION IN HUD GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County has been awarded a $2,920,290 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to identify and control lead-based paint hazards. 
   The Marion County Lead Hazard Control (MCLHC) project utilizes HUD funds to ameliorate lead hazards in Marion County, Indiana, and to screen children in the case of potential lead exposure. The MCLHC has organized six additional lead testing sites throughout the three counties in addition to regularly scheduled weekly clinic at MCHD's main office. In August the MCLHC conducted 1,600 blood lead tests on young children.
   The Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration (LHRD) grant program assists states, Native American Tribes and local governments in undertaking comprehensive programs to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately owned rental housing for rental or owner-occupants. The Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Program is targeted toward urban jurisdictions with the highest lead-based paint hazard control needs as defined in the Notice of Funding Availability announcement.
