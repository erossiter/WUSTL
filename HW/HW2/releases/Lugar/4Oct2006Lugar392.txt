HOOSIER FIRE DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE MORE THAN $1.7 MILLION
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that seventeen Indiana fire departments will receive funds from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grants Program (AFGP).  
   "It is essential to Hoosiers that we ensure our fire departments have adequate support, equipment and training," Lugar said. "These brave men and women fill the invaluable role as first responders and are the backbone of our communities." 
   The award is among grants made to fire departments throughout the U.S. announced this week in the 2005 Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program (AFGP). 
   For the 2005 program, $650 million was appropriated to provide assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. 
   Applicants were invited to apply for funds in the following three supported program areas: Operations and Firefighter Safety Program, Fire Prevention Program and Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program. 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the AFGP and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. 
   Fire departments with questions about the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program may reach the fire grants help desk toll free at 1-866-274-0960 or firegrants@dhs.gov. For the most current information regarding the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program, visit www.firegrantsupport.com.
