SEN. LUGAR BACKS PREMATURITY AWARENESS DAY
  Sen. Lugar has added his voice to those who are supporting the effort to curb the growing number of premature births. Prematurity Awareness Day is November 16, 2004 and is part of a larger effort to significantly decrease the number of premature births in the United States.  
   "The rise in the number of premature births throughout the country and in Indiana - despite all of our achievements in medicine - is astounding. Nationally, more than 480,000 babies were born preterm in 2002. Nearly 13 percent of Indiana's infants are born preterm and in half of the cases, doctors cannot identify the cause," noted Lugar. 
   Many preterm infants suffer lifelong health problems - such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss - and some die. Reducing the number of premature births improves the health of hundreds of thousands of infants born each year. 
   "Aside from these human costs, the financial cost of caring for preterm infants is enormous. The March of Dimes estimates that the national hospital bill for infants with a diagnosis of prematurity/low birth weight was $13.6 billion in 2001." 
   Lugar is supporting this effort legislatively as well. He is a cosponsor of S. 1726, the "PREEMIE Act," which seeks to expand and coordinate research on the prevention of preterm birth and the most effective care for babies when they are born preterm. He is also a sponsor of S. 1734, the "Prevent Prematurity and Improve Child Health Act," which seeks to improve Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program to reflect our current state of knowledge on preterm birth. 
   Lugar, and his wife Charlene, have been long-time advocates of the March of Dimes and fully support the group's efforts to successfully combat the difficult problem of prematurity.
