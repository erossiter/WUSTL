SEN. LUGAR CO-SPONSORS COMMEMORATION OF 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLACK PRESS OF AMERICA
  Sen. Dick Lugar is co-sponsoring a resolution to commemorate the 65th Anniversary of the Black Press of America.  
   "African-American focused media has a long and important tradition in our country," said Lugar. "Indiana boasts six members of the Black Press of America. For example, in my hometown of Indianapolis, the Recorder has served as an important voice in the African-American community for more than 100 years. Currently flourishing under the ownership of my friend Bill Mays, the Recorder continues to provide valuable information and perspective for all city residents." 
   The resolution recognizes the significant contributions all African-American newspapers have made from the time of slavery and segregation to today and the continued contributions those newspapers make to the ideal of equal opportunity for all Americans. 
   The National Newspaper Publishers Association, also known as the Black Press of America, is a federation of more than 200 Black community newspapers from across the United States. 
   Hoosier papers that are members of the Black Press of America are:
   * Frost Illustrated
  * Gary Crusader
  * Gary Info
  * Indiana Herald
  * Indianapolis Recorder
  * Scoop Magazine.
