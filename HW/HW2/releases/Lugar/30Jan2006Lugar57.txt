MUNCIE PUBLIC TV STATION RECEIVES DIGITAL CONVERSION GRANT
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that public TV station WIPB in Muncie will receive a $500,000 digital conversion grant from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB).  
   The station will equip a multi-stream digital Master Control facility for WIPB-TV with this funding. 
   "I am pleased that the CPB is helping WIPB update its technology. This grant will positively impact the station and its viewers as WIPB makes the transition to digital technology," Lugar said. 
   The award is among grants made to 37 local public television stations that total $9.7 million. These funds are part of the nearly $220 million in funding that Congress has provided to the CPB over the last six years to assist both public radio and public television stations to convert from analog to digital transmission. 
   So far, the CPB has distributed grants to 461 public radio stations to complete their digital transition. 
   The CPB is the largest single source of funding for public television and radio programming. It funds diverse and innovative programming, promotes public telecommunications services and invests in more than 1,000 local radio and television stations.
