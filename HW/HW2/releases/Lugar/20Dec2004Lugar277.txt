SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES $2.6 MILLION IN AID FOR HOMELESS
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced today that Indiana will receive a $2,683,723 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as part of its Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program.  
   "This funding is important because it provides necessary assistance to those Hoosiers who need it most," Lugar said. "I am pleased Congress has appropriated this money and that FEMA continues this valuable program." 
   The funds, which in Indiana were awarded to the state, a city and 39 counties, will support social service agencies to help feed and shelter the hungry and homeless. EFS funds are used to supplement food, shelter, rent, mortgage and utility assistance programs for people with non-disaster related emergencies. 
   The EFS Program, entering its twenty-second year, is administered by a national board of volunteer agencies chaired by FEMA. The National Board qualifies local jurisdictions for annual EFS funding awards based on criteria involving current population, unemployment and poverty levels. Grants are awarded to local social service agencies that are chosen by local boards in the qualifying jurisdictions. In addition, 8% of the year's total EFS appropriation was set aside by the National Board for state grants to aid the needy in jurisdictions that did not otherwise qualify for assistance.
