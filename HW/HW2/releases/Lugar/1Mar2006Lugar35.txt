SEN. LUGAR DISCUSSES ENERGY CRISIS WITH LAFAYETTE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  Sen. Dick Lugar met with the Lafayette-West Lafayette Chamber of Commerce in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Room today in Washington D.C. The Chamber was in Washington for its annual fly-in. Lugar spoke to them about the world-wide problem of energy, as well as the use of ethanol and its importance to Indiana's economy.  
   Lugar also addressed the energy crisis in Indiana last week when he spoke to a group of faculty, students and guests at Marian College. 
   A decade ago, Lugar began pushing for a national biomass ethanol research program. Witnesses at Agriculture Committee hearings he chaired from 1996 to 1999 said this would be the most efficient method to produce ethanol. In 1999, Lugar and former CIA Director James Woolsey co-authored a seminal article that linked foreign policy and high cost of securing foreign oil flowing to the United States with the development of homegrown ethanol derived from any form of cellulose ("The New Petroleum," Foreign Affairs). Lugar then authored and passed the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, which remains the nation's premier legislation guiding renewable fuels research. 
   In 2005, Lugar led 21 bipartisan Senators in introducing the Fuels Security Act to more than double the production and use of domestic renewable fuels including ethanol, biodiesel and fuels produced from cellulosic biomass. This legislation laid the groundwork for the renewable fuels section of the energy bill that passed Congress in July 2005. Lugar also joined with Sens. Barack Obama (D-IL) and Harkin in introducing the Fuel Security and Consumer Choice Act that would require all U.S. marketed vehicles to be manufactured as Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) within ten years. FFVs can use both regular gasoline and E-85 renewable fuel (motor fuel with 85 percent ethanol content).
