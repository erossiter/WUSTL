SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES PROGRESS IN NUNN-LUGAR COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2007
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar today announced the following progress in the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program for August 2007:
   * 209 strategic nuclear warheads were deactivated;
   * 9 Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) mobile launchers were destroyed; 
   * 2 Submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) eliminated
   * 20 SLBM launchers were destroyed; and
   * 4 train shipments of nuclear weapons were sent to safe and secure storage.
   Lugar and former Sen. Sam Nunn visited Russia, Ukraine and Albania in August 2007 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Nunn-Lugar program. During a visit to Geodeziya, Russia, Lugar, Nunn and Bill Burns, U.S. Ambassador to Russia, became the first Americans to ignite the solid fuel in a rocket motor removed from an SS-25 ICBM, missiles that could have been launched from the 9 ICBM mobile launchers recently destroyed.
   Lugar and Nunn also visited:
   * Moscow, Russia for meetings with Foreign Minister Igor Lavrov and other commemorations of the Nunn-Lugar program's 15th anniversary;
   * Podolsk, Russia to tour the Luch Scientific and Industrial research facility where highly enriched (weapons grade) uranium is being down-blended to low-enriched uranium for use in nuclear power plants;
   * Chelyabinsk, Russia to tour the construction of the Shchuchye Chemical Weapons Destruction Facility where the U.S. is working with Russia, Canada, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to eliminate 2 million artillery rounds filled with sarin, soman and VX nerve agent;
   * Yekaterinburg, Russia to tour the Mayak fissile material storage facility;
   * Ukrainian-Moldovan border to monitor Ukrainian effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons and materials of mass destruction; and
   * Tirana, Albania to commemorate the successful destruction of Albanian chemical weapons through the Nunn-Lugar program, the first use of Nunn-Lugar funds outside of the former Soviet Union.

   In November 1991, Lugar (R-IN) and Nunn (D-GA) authored the Nunn-Lugar Act, which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. This program has provided U.S. funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, related materials, and delivery systems. In 2003, Congress adopted the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, which authorized the Nunn-Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats. In 2004, Nunn-Lugar funds were committed for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to destroy chemical weapons in Albania, under a Lugar-led expansion of the program.
   The Nunn-Lugar scorecard now totals 7,191 strategic nuclear warheads deactivated, 653 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) destroyed, 485 ICBM silos eliminated, 110 ICBM mobile launchers destroyed, 615 submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) eliminated, 456 SLBM launchers eliminated, 30 nuclear submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles destroyed, 155 bomber eliminated, 906 nuclear air-to-surface missiles (ASMs) destroyed, 194 nuclear test tunnels eliminated, 359 nuclear weapons transport train shipments, 12 nuclear weapons storage site security upgrades, and 9 biological monitoring stations built and equipped. Perhaps most importantly, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn-Lugar program. Those countries were the third, fourth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers in the world.
   Beyond nuclear elimination, the Nunn-Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons and biological weapons, and has worked to reemploy scientists and facilities related to weapons of mass destruction in peaceful research initiatives. The International Science and Technology Centers, of which the United States is the leading sponsor, engaged 58,000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work. The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded 750 projects involving 14,000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high-tech jobs.
   Lugar makes annual oversight trips to Nunn-Lugar sites in the former Soviet Union and Albania.
