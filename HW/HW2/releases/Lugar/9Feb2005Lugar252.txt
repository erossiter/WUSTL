SEN. LUGAR'S RESOLUTION ON GEORGIA APPROVED BY SENATE
  The U.S. Senate has approved the resolution written by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar commemorating the life of the late Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania.  
   The resolution, S. Res. 46, expresses the Senate's deepest condolences. It commends "the courage, energy, political imagination, and leadership of Zurab Zhvania that were so critical to the development of a democratic Republic of Georgia; and recognizes that the integration of the Republic of Georgia into Euro-Atlantic institutions will be the completion of the vision of Zurab Zhvania and his most lasting legacy." 
   Lugar was asked by President Bush to lead U.S. representation at Zhvania's funeral on Sunday, February 6. Millennium Challenge Corporation CEO Paul Applegarth and International Republican Institute President Lorne Craner joined him. 
   "Prime Minister Zhvania was a prominent leader in Georgia's Rose Revolution. He was a true reformer, lauded for his intellectual acuity, and a friend of America. I was fortunate to meet with Zhvania last December. We had an extensive discussion about Georgia's promising future and vigorous agenda to transform it into a regional model of political and economic progress," said Lugar. "The U.S.-Georgia relationship is strong."
