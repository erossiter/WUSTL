SEN. LUGAR STAFF TO COLLECT VETERANS INTERVIEWS IN MICHIGAN CITY
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that members of his staff will be at the Battle of the Bulge meeting Saturday, September 23, at 10:00 a.m. at the Elks Club in Michigan City to gather stories for his Veterans History Project. The Elks is located at 416 East U.S. Highway 20 in Michigan City.  
   The Veterans History Project has already preserved the memories of more than 6,800 Hoosier veterans in the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. 
   "We are fortunate to have shelves of information about notable figures from the U.S. Military such as Generals Patton and Eisenhower and Admirals Halsey and Spruance," Lugar said. "Histories of the average GI, the men and women who carried the burden of protecting our freedom, are sorely lacking." 
   Veterans interested in participating are encouraged to RSVP to Senator Lugar's Northwest Indiana Office at (219) 548-8035 or via email at vetproject@lugar.senate.gov. 
   "Most Americans have simply lost touch with what it means to serve in the Armed Forces or to serve a cause greater than self. I believe it is important that veterans communicate to the next generation an understanding of the sacrifices and hardships involved in life in the military, which cannot be gained by reading books or watching movies," Lugar added. "I am pleased to work with the Library of Congress to help ensure the memories of Indiana veterans are preserved in this important collection." 
   "The Library of Congress estimates that 1,700 veterans die in this country each day," Lugar noted. "That sobering fact is an important reason Congress began this program, and I am pleased that we can help Hoosiers record and preserve these powerful oral histories."
