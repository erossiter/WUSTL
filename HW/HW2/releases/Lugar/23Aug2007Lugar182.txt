JASPER SCHOOLS AWARDED $100,000 GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded the Greater Jasper Consolidated Schools a $104,046 grant under the Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Program.  
   The REMS program provides funds for Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to improve and strengthen their emergency management plans. It enables school districts to develop improved plans that address all four phases of emergency management: prevention-mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.
   In reviewing and improving plans, districts are required to work with community partners including law enforcement, local government, public safety, public health, and mental health. Plans must include training for school staff and students, a plan for communicating emergency management policies and procedures to parents, and must support implementation of the National Incident Management System. Additionally, LEAs must take into consideration special needs populations in their districts as they work on their emergency management plans. Districts also commit to developing a written plan designed to prepare the LEA for a possible infectious disease outbreak. Typical activities included in grantee programs include reviewing and revising existing emergency management plans, conducting vulnerability assessments of schools and other district facilities, providing training, organizing tabletop exercises, and engaging in crisis simulation drills.
