SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE AWARD
  Sen. Dick Lugar received the U.S. Chamber's Spirit of Enterprise award this morning in Washington, D.C. for his support of pro-business issues during the first session of the 109th Congress.  
   This is the eighteenth year that the U.S. Chamber has formally honored the accomplishments of a select group of Congress members who support a pro-business legislative agenda. 
   The Chamber awards the Spirit of Enterprise based on rankings it gives members of Congress for key business votes, setout in its annual publication, How They Voted. Key votes are recorded floor votes on issues established as priorities by the Chamber's board of directors on which the Chamber communicates its position prior to the vote. 
   In 2004, Lugar was ranked first out of all members of Congress in the 106th and 107th Congresses in economic efficiency according to a study published in the Investor's Business Daily and completed by the Department of Economics at the University of Delaware.
