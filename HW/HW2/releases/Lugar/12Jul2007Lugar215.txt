HUD GRANTS AWARDED TO TWO HOOSIER COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that two Indiana communities will receive Economic Development Initiative (EDI) funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Madison Township in Morgan County was awarded $99,200, and the City of Marion was awarded $327,360.  
  "As a former mayor, I recognize the value of federal programs that assist in community economic development initiatives," said Lugar. "I congratulate Madison Township and the City of Marion on receiving these funds which will support local activities."
  EDI grant funds can be used for activities such as property acquisition; rehabilitation of publicly owned property; housing rehabilitation; economic development activities; acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or installation of public facilities; and for public works and other site improvements. Increasing access to capital for entrepreneurs and small business has emerged as a key component of the job growth strategy powered by the EDI grant program.
   Under EDI, grants are provided to local governments to enhance both the security of loans guaranteed through the Section 108 Loan Program and the feasibility of the economic development and revitalization projects they finance.
