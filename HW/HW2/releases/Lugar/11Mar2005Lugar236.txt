HOOSIER NOMINATED AS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
  President Bush today nominated Benton County native Chuck Conner to be Deputy Secretary of Agriculture. 
   "For more than 25 years, my friend Chuck Conner has been involved in every aspect of American agriculture, from running his family's farm to writing farm programs to negotiating trade agreements. He will be an outstanding Deputy Secretary of Agriculture and will confidently help lead the USDA," U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar (R-IN) said. 
   Conner was Staff Director of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee when Lugar was chairman of the Committee. He worked for Lugar for 17 years, beginning in 1980.
