U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE ACCEPTING GRANT APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is accepting grant applications for conservation projects to benefit imperiled species on private lands through its Private Stewardship Grants Program. This program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to individuals and groups engaged in voluntary conservation efforts on private lands that help federally listed endangered or threatened species as well as proposed, candidate and other at-risk species.  
   In 2006 the Service awarded 80 grants totaling more than $6.9 million to individuals and groups to undertake conservation projects for endangered, threatened, and other at-risk species on private lands in 35 states. 
   Landowners and their partners must submit their proposals to the appropriate Regional Offices of the Service by February 14, 2007. For additional information regarding this grant opportunity and how and where to submit proposals, please visit the Service's Private Stewardship Grants Website at:

   As both a farmer and U.S. Senator, Lugar supports many programs to preserve and protect wildlife, trees, and the environment. Through his own re-forestation efforts, Lugar has been planting and growing trees, including black walnuts, on his farm in Marion County for more than 20 years. He recently enrolled these trees on the Chicago Climate Exchange, which recognizes that these trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere and applies a market approach to mitigating global climate change.
