SEN. LUGAR CO-SPONSORS MEDICARE HOME HEALTH BILL
  Sen. Dick Lugar is a co-sponsor of the Medicare Home Health Payment Fairness Act.  
 The bill would extend the current five percent add-on payment for Medicare home health services furnished in a rural area for two years. The current add-on is set to expire on April 1. 
   "I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this bill," Lugar said. "Health care for rural America is a pressing issue. It is my hope that this legislation will allow residents of rural areas to access top-quality medical care more quickly." 
   Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural areas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the extra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, higher transportation expenses, and other factors. In addition, in many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary caregivers for homebound beneficiaries with limited access to transportation. 
   Lugar co-sponsored similar legislation in the 108th Congress.
