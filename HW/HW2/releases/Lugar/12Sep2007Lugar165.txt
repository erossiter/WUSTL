SEN. LUGAR SECURES $500,000 FOR UNITY CENTER IN MUNCIE
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar voted today to secure $500,000 for the construction of the HOPE VI Unity Center. The funding was included in the Senate Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriation Bill which passed in the Senate today by a vote of 88-7. 
  "I am especially pleased that funding was included for the Unity Center, which is part of the final phase of the HOPE VI Millennium Housing Project we helped start several years ago," Lugar said.
  The facility will be built in a centralized location in Heekin Park. The concept of the Unity Center project resulted from a $12.35 million HOPE VI grant awarded to the City of Muncie Housing Authority to assist in demolishing the existing pre-World War II housing and reconstructing a new neighborhood. Lugar also helped secure HOPE VI funding.
  The project has been developed through a collaborative partnership between several local organizations: YMCA, YWCA, Boys & Girls' Club, PAL Club, and South Madison Community Center. This facility will house and combine two current youth organizations, the Boys and Girls Club and the South Madison Community Center. It will provide family-oriented programs, after-school learning programs, after-school balanced snack programs, health screenings, and senior health programs. 
  Mayor Dan Canan and Delaware County Commissioners requested federal funding for this project in the spring of 2007.
  This project was included by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 12, 2007, at the request of Lugar. The legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. Should projects be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies. The bill then heads to the President for his signature.
