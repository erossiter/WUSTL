FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT TROPICAL FORESTS, CORAL REEFS
 The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved today S. 2020, the Tropical Forest and Coral Conservation Act (TFCCA) introduced by Ranking Member Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Committee Chairman Joe Biden (D-DE). The TFCCA reauthorizes the 1998 Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA), originally written by Lugar and Biden, and broadens their initiative to protect coral reefs. 
  The Tropical Forest and Coral Conservation Act promotes conservation of these natural resources by allowing eligible countries to engage in debt swaps, buybacks or restructuring in exchange for protecting threatened tropical forests and coral reefs on a sustained basis. 
  Since Lugar and Biden initiated TFCA, more than 47 million acres of tropical forests around the world have been conserved through country "debt-for-nature swaps." 
  With TFCA, the U.S. State Department has reached agreements generating $137 million in long-term commitments for tropical forest conservation. In addition, private donors, including the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and Conservation International, have contributed more than $9.6 million to TFCA swaps, leveraging U.S. Government funds.
  Twelve TFCA agreements have been concluded to date in Bangladesh, El Salvador, Belize, Peru, the Philippines, Panama, Guatemala, Colombia, Paraguay, Botswana, Costa Rica, and Jamaica. With the reauthorization of TFCA, the State Department will be able pursue agreements with Brazil and Indonesia, both of which have threatened coral reefs.
  This legislation authorizes appropriations for debt reduction for eligible countries at $20,000,000 through FY 2008; $25,000,000 in FY 2009; and $30,000,000 in FY 2010.
