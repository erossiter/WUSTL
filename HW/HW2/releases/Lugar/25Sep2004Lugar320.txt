SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES $600,000 FOR MARION WATER LOOP INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended that $600,000 be provided for the Marion Water Loop and Deer Creek Project. 
   "This is good news for the City," Lugar said. "I commend Mayor Seybold for his commitment to this project. This is an important economic development project for Marion." 
   The Marion Water Loop and Deer Creek Stormwater project is a collaborative effort by the city of Marion, the Marion Utilities Service Board (MUSB) and Indiana Wesleyan University. 
   Federal funds will be used to assist with the severe water infrastructure problems that have prevented economic growth, particularly in south Marion and on the IWU main campus. EPA funds will be used to address immediate needs to increase drinking water and stormwater capacity, increase declining water pressure, and relieve flooding problems during rains. The economic environment in Marion further exacerbates these water issues. A decline in the manufacturing sector has resulted in significant revenue shortfalls for Marion. The City is on the verge of having the highest unemployment in the State. As a result, the Marion is unable to finance critical infrastructure projects, which are needed for future economic development and growth. 
   In a letter earlier this year to the Appropriations Committee, Senator Lugar asked that special funds be set aside for this project. 
   Funds recommended by the Appropriations Committee are a part of the annual budget bill for the EPA and other agencies. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this year. The bill may be folded into an omnibus.
