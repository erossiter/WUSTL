GAO APPROVES SEN. LUGAR'S STUDY OF WOOD RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
  Sen. Dick Lugar has been notified that his request for a U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) study concerning wood products research has been approved. The study will begin around the first of next year.  
   On July 13, 2004, he requested the GAO:
   * Evaluate the current ability of the federal government to assist industry with wood utilization and product development; 
   * Evaluate the programmatic and budgetary support and personnel capacity for basic wood and material sciences; and 
   * Evaluate the federal capability to develop emerging technologies and transfer them into products and manufacturing processes. 
   A recent report entitled "Forests of Indiana: Their Economic Importance," prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, State and Private Forestry; the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry; and Purdue University, Department of Forestry and Natural Resources found that: 
   * Forest-based manufacturing in Indiana provides over $8 billion in value of shipments, 
   * Forest-based manufacturing provides employment for over 54,000 people and generates payrolls of $1.4 billion annually, 
   * Each 1000 acres of timberland in Indiana supports 12 forest-based manufacturing jobs, 
   * For every acre of Indiana timberland, over $340 of direct forest-based manufacturing payroll is generated annually. 
   Lugar requested the report with Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-MS). Lugar is former chairman and a senior member of the committee. 
   Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the Forest Service and 2010 will mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Forest Products Laboratory that provides research and technical assistance to wood product users and manufacturers and is administered by the Forest Service. The Senators are interested in reviewing the historical and current level of federal funding and the specific wood-related research programs managed by the wide scope of federal agencies active in the wood products and wood consuming sector of the economy. They have expressed interest in GAO reviewing "the use of wood materials, fiber and/or support the introduction of new products, processes or technology for the wood manufacturing and consuming industries in the United States."
