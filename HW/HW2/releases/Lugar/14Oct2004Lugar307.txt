INDIANA RECEIVES 7TH HIGHEST BONUS GRANT FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES PROGRAM
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified recently that Indiana will receive a High Performance Bonus award for the amount of $10,339,955 for its efforts in moving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program recipients from welfare to work and self-sufficiency.  
 The award was announced this week by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   Fifty states and the District of Columbia competed on one or more measures for bonus awards for performance year 2003. Indiana's bonus award, the 7th highest received by any state, is based on receiving a top ranking in the job entry rate and the rate of increase in children living in married couple households. 
   The bonus must be used to carry out the purposes of the TANF program, including a range of supportive services to overcome barriers to employment and self-sufficiency. 
   Other awards were based on the following criteria: success in the workforce rate, improvement in the job entry rate and improvement in the success in the workforce rate, the rate of participation of low-income working families in Food Stamps and improvement in this Food Stamp rate, the rate of enrollment of former TANF recipients in Medicaid/SCHIP and improvement in this Medicaid/SCHIP rate, and the rate of access, affordability and quality of child care. 
   Lugar supported the passage of the welfare reform bill in 1996 which established TANF. Since its passage, family welfare cases have declined more than 50 percent, work by single mothers has increased more than 20 percent, poverty among mother-headed families has declined, and child poverty has declined.
