SEN. LUGAR, AARP, INDIANAVETERANS.INFO HOST VETERANS COMMUNITY DAY
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar, along with AARP Indiana and IndianaVeterans.info, are hosting Indiana Veterans Community Day on Saturday, October 27, 2007, at the Indiana War Memorial located at 431 North Meridian Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  
   From 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., veterans' organizations, as well as state and federal agencies, will provide information to veterans about healthcare, benefits and finances. Participants include the Veterans Administration, National Guard Family Programs, the Small Business Administration and additional veterans' service organizations. 
   "I hope members of the military, veterans and their families will attend Indiana Veterans Community Day and take advantage of the many resources assembled in one location," Lugar said. 
   Workshops will be provided by the VA Regional Office, Indianapolis Vet Center, AARP Indiana Fraud/Scam Alerts, and Momentive Credit Counseling. 
   Members of Lugar's Veterans History Project team will also be available to document the personal histories of Hoosier veterans. These stories will be added to a collection of nearly 8,000 veterans' stories gathered in Indiana for the Veterans History Project and will preserved at the Library of Congress. 
   Flu shots will be provided by the Visiting Nurses. They are free for Medicare recipients and $25 for others.
