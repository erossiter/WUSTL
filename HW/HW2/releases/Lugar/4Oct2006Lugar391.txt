SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES 30TH ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM FOR TOMORROW'S LEADERS
  This December, Sen. Dick Lugar will open the 30th annual Lugar Symposium for Tomorrow's Leaders. Since his election to Senate in 1976, Lugar has held a symposium for outstanding high school juniors each year from across Indiana to discuss current events and issues.  
   This year's symposium will take place on Saturday, December 9, 2006, at the University of Indianapolis. 
   Administrators at all of Indiana's high schools are asked to nominate two juniors for the program. Schools may nominate their two students by completing the form found at http://lugar.senate.gov/symposium/form.html. For more information about the program, visit http://lugar.senate.gov/symposium/ or call (317) 226-5555. 
   Lugar will begin the day-long program with an address to the students on national and world affairs. State and national advocates then will lead small student discussion groups on ten topics areas, allowing students to fully engage in lively discourse. Some of this year's symposium topics will include: U.S. leadership in the world, energy security, Iraq, homeland security, and media responsibility. Participants often cite the symposium as an important high school achievement. 
   "Hoosier students continue to impress me with the knowledge and interest in current affairs that they bring to the Symposium," said Lugar. "It is exciting, once again, to host young people from all across Indiana, and I look forward to spending time with the intelligent and energetic students eager to participate in the day's activities."
