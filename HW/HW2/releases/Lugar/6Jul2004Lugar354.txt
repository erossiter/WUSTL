CHILD ABDUCTIONS REPORT RELEASED
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Dick Lugar announced the formal release of a study on the compliance of other nations to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. 
   "This vital study of forty-nine of the most significant countries that are a party to the Convention provides an important tool both for US government officials and American families," Lugar said.
   "The individual country studies were researched and written by legal experts from both our own Library of Congress and foreign-trained lawyers specializing in this field. They provide detailed analysis of each countries' domestic laws regarding implementation of the Hague Convention, domestic laws on parental visitation, court and law enforcement systems and structures, and legal assistance programs."
