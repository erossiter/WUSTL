SEN. LUGAR AWARDED ORDER OF MERIT OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
  Polish President Lech Kaczyski presented U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar the Commanders' Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in a ceremony last night at the Blair House in Washington, D.C. The award recognized Lugar for merit rendered to Poland.  
  The Order of Merit is one of the most prestigious Polish awards presented to foreign citizens and Polish residents living abroad. The Order of Merit is awarded in one of five classes: Grand Cross, Commander with Star, Command, Officer, and Member. The Grand Cross class is reserved for heads of state.
  In his remarks, Lugar recognized the close relations that the United States and Poland have enjoyed since the end of the Cold War. He thanked Poland for its strong support of efforts to combat global terrorism and troop contribution in Afghanistan and Iraq.
  This past March, the U.S. Senate approved legislation introduced by Lugar to establish the United States-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program. The program is intended to demonstrate to the youth of the United States and Poland the benefits of friendly cooperation based on common political and cultural values.
  Senator Carl Levin of Michigan was also recognized last night.
