NORTH LAWRENCE SCHOOLS AWARDED $173,000 GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded North Lawrence Community Schools a $173,706 grant under the Mentoring Program.  
   The Mentoring Program makes awards to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs), nonprofit community-based organizations and partnerships between the two, to promote school-based mentoring programs for children with greater need. 
   Programs must serve children with the greatest need in grades 4 through 8 that reside in rural or high crime areas or troubled environments, or who attend schools with violence problems. Applicants receiving awards under this program have developed projects that link children with mentors who will receive ongoing training and support in mentoring, and have been screened using appropriate background checks.
  Projects are designed to achieve one or more of the following goals:
   * assist children in receiving support and guidance from a mentor; 
   * improve the academic performance of children; 
   * improve interpersonal relationships between children and their * 
   * peers, teachers, other adults, and family members; 
   * reduce the dropout rate of children; and 
   * reduce the levels of juvenile delinquency and involvement in gangs.
