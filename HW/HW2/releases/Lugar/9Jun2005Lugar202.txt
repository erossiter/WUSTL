SEN. LUGAR ASSISTS CLINTON COUNTY FAMILY IN RECEIVING BRONZE STAR
  Sen. Dick Lugar recently announced that John Davis was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star for his service in the U.S. Army during World War II.  
 The medal was given to his widow, Francis Davis and his brother, James Davis. 
   In 1947, President Harry S. Truman issued an Executive Order to retroactively award the Bronze Star Medal to soldiers who had received the Combat Infantry Badge (CIB) during World War II. Similar accommodations were made for soldiers who earned a Combat Medical Badge. 
   "John Davis's family is entitled to awards that reflect the gratitude of our nation for his honorable service during World War II. I am pleased that his family received the Bronze Star he earned so long ago," Lugar said. 
   According to the U.S. Army, "The Combat Infantry Badge was established by the War Department in 1943 to enhance morale and the prestige of the infantry, also know as the 'Queen of Battle.' Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, then the Army Ground Forces commanding general, originally recommended that it be called the 'fighter badge.' Then Secretary of War Henry Stinson said, 'It is high time we recognize in a personal way the skill and heroism of the American infantry.'" 
   Davis served in the European Theater, reaching the rank of Sergeant. Along with the Bronze Star, he earned the EAME Theater Ribbon, American Theater Ribbon, World War II Victory Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal.
