GRANTS MADE TO INDIANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that 31 Indiana communities will receive firefighter assistance grants totaling more than $2.2 million from the Department of Homeland Security for training programs and modifications to stations and equipment. 
   "Local fire departments are the backbone of many of our Indiana communities," said Lugar. "Additionally, they also fill an invaluable first responder role. It is incumbent that we offer adequate support, equipment and training to these brave men and women."
