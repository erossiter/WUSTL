LAFAYETTE, WEST LAFAYETTE AWARDED OVER $2 MILLION IN HUD GRANTS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that the communities of Lafayette and West Lafayette will receive grants totaling $2,066,429 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
  The types of grants awarded include the HOME Award, the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI), and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).
  The HOME program helps to expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low-income families by providing grants to state and local governments to fund housing programs that meet local needs and priorities.
  ADDI, a new initiative under the HOME program, promotes home ownership opportunities by providing necessary resources for down payment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority households.
  The CDBG program provides annual grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, primarily for low-and-moderate-income persons.
