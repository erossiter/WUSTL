SEN. LUGAR CO-SPONSORS GREAT LAKES RESTORATION ACT
  Sen. Dick Lugar is a co-sponsor of the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act, which would fund one project in each of the Great Lake states per year.  
 The bill stipulates that these projects result in tangible improvements in the Great Lakes watershed and address at least one of the priority issues identified by the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board created by the bill. 
   "During my tenure in the Senate, I have supported funds for many worthwhile efforts aimed at preserving the natural beauty and vibrancy of our Great Lakes," Lugar said. "I support ongoing research efforts that help us understand more about what needs to be done to reduce harmful pollutants, address low water levels and preserve marine life throughout the system. I will continue to join with my Senate colleagues from Great Lakes states to support funding to continue several federal programs that focus on environmental protection of the Lakes." 
   If enacted, the bill would authorize $600 million per year for the program through 2013. 
   Lugar co-sponsored similar legislation in the 108th Congress.
