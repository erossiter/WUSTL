SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON ASEAN-US PARTNERSHIP
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Dick Lugar today expressed his support for the "Vision Statement on the ASEAN - U.S. Enhanced Partnership," announced during President Bush's visit to Asia.  
   "Since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has been a steadfast friend of the United States. Over the years, we have witnessed steady progress at strengthening the relationship. I look forward to working with the President, Secretary Rice and leaders of ASEAN toward implementing a comprehensive partnership plan, to be of mutual benefit to the people of ASEAN and the people of the United States. With the collective commitment of ASEAN leaders and President Bush, we will now forge much closer cooperation in the areas of social and economic development, security and trade."
   The joint Vision Statement on the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership is a twenty-point outline of areas of increased cooperation.
