SENS. LUGAR, BAYH SECURE FUNDING FOR MOUNT ZION MILL POND DAM
  Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh last night voted to authorize funding for the Mount Zion Mill Pond Dam in Fulton County as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The bill now heads to conference with the House of Representatives.  
   "I was pleased to advocate for the authorization of this important project at the request of the Fulton County Commissioners," said Lugar. "Projects for flood damage reduction and mitigation are criticaly important to Hoosiers living near bodies of water and in flood plains. This funding will assist with an important infrastructure improvement for the residents of Fulton County." 
   "Flood control projects are critical to protecting Hoosier homes and businesses," Bayh said. "By funding these projects we can help ensure that the residents of Fulton County are protected from the often devastating effects of floods." 
   The Fulton County Commissioners requested funding to repair the dam which is estimated to cost $1.2 million. Congressionally authorized funding is required for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete necessary repairs to the dam. 
   Funds were provided through the Small Projects for the Rehabilitation and Removal of Dams Program. The local community must provide 35 percent of the cost using non-federal matching funds to repair the dam.
