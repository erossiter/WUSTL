COLUMBUS AWARDED $301,200 IN HUD FUNDING
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the City of Columbus will receive a $301,200 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
  "As a former mayor and also as the former Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, I recognize the value of federal housing programs and the need of many Americans for housing assistance," said Lugar. "These funds will help ensure Hoosiers have the opportunity to live in safe, decent, affordable housing in economically stable communities." 
  The CDBG program provides annual grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, primarily for low-and-moderate-income persons.
