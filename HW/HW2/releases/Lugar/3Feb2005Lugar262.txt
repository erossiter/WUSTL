SEN. LUGAR COMMENTS ON NEPAL
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement today on the recent actions by the King of Nepal:  
   "I am deeply concerned about the situation in Nepal following King Gyanendra's announcement Tuesday to dismiss the government and declare a state of emergency in the country. I join with many voices in the international community calling on the King of Nepal to ensure the protection of human rights and to respect the constitutional rights of Nepali citizens, including individuals who reportedly have been placed under house arrest. 
   "Nepal has suffered for many years from the impact of a brutal Maoist insurgency that has claimed nearly 11,000 lives in the last nine years. The King and mainstream political parties need to focus attention on strengthening Nepal's young democratic system even as they cope with this increasingly threatening Maoist insurgency. Cooperation between the Palace and these political parties is a crucial element in convincing the Maoists to abandon violence and to re-enter the political process. 
   "King Gyanendra, along with the newly-established Cabinet, should demonstrate to the international community that they are committed to strengthening multi-party democracy under the constitutional monarchy as enshrined by the Nepali Constitution."
