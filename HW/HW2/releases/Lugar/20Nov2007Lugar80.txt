NEW CONGRESSIONAL STUDY FINDS FOREIGN ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOUNDERING
  The Republican staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has released a report finding that the United States is providing billions of dollars in foreign assistance without an overall strategy for success and sense of common purpose. The report recommends reform in setting priorities and providing strategic direction. It suggests such coordination has not happened because of uneven implementation and bureaucratic resistance.  
  "Leadership from this and future Presidents is needed if we are going to get foreign aid right. Our country faces a worldwide threat from terrorists seeking to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction. A foreign assistance program that fights endemic poverty and helps build just, open and well-governed societies will go a long way toward loosening the lure of violent extremism. The commitment must be long-term, and we must be coordinated as a government if we intend to make a difference," said U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
  The report, S. Prt. 110-33, "Embassies Grapple to Guide Foreign Aid," November 16, 2007, can be found in TEXT and PDF formats at the Government Printing Office website: http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/senate11cp110.html.
