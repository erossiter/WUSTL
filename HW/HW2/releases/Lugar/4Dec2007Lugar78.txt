SEN. LUGAR COSPONSORS BILL PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar today joined with 23 of his Senate colleagues in a bipartisan coalition requesting an additional $1 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Sens. Joe Biden (D-DE), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), John Kerry (D-MA), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Pat Leahy (D-VT), Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Barack Obama (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and John Sununu (R-NH) joined Lugar in cosponsoring the bill. 
  Separately, Lugar joined 47 of his Senate colleagues in writing a bipartisan letter requesting an additional $1 billion for LIHEAP to Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Ranking Member Arlen Specter (R-PA). "With the price of oil hovering near $100 per barrel, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2007-2008 winter, states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families, individuals with disabilities, and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter," the letter said.
  "I hope the Senate will move to provide a measure of relief to the low-income families and seniors struggling to deal with dramatically higher home-heating bills. No one should have to decide between heating their home and other basic necessities," said Lugar, who has consistently supported full-funding for LIHEAP.
  LIHEAP is a federally-funded program to help eligible low income homeowners and renters meet their home energy needs.
