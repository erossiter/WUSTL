SEN. LUGAR WARNS VENEZUELA ON OIL CUT-OFF
  Today U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the following statement in response to threats made by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to cut-off oil shipments to the United States and the February 12, 2008 declaration that Venezuela would halt shipments to Exxon refineries. 
  "I urge the government of Venezuela to maintain this discussion within the legal framework that ExxonMobil and Venezuela's state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) chose to resolve their differences. I encourage them to resolve this dispute without further disruption to global oil markets. Stability in oil supplies being traded freely in the global marketplace is vital to the interests of both importing countries and exporting countries," Lugar said.
  "The consequences of Venezuela no longer being seen as a reliable trading partner could be catastrophic for its domestic production, particularly as it attempts to develop technically-challenging heavy oil reserves. Even more importantly, the people of Venezuela could suffer tremendously and its economy could be crippled if oil revenues are lost. This was highlighted in the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report I requested three years ago."
  Senator Lugar requested in November 2004 that the Government Accountability Office examine the prospects for a Venezuelan shut-off of oil exports to the United States and the United States government capacity to respond. The report was released June 27, 2006, and a copy is available at: http://lugar.senate.gov/energy/venezuela/.
