SEN. MARTINEZ PRAISES HOUSE PASSAGE OF PATRIOT ACT - URGES SPEEDY SENATE ACTION
  Sen. Mel Martinez (R-FL) today praised the work of the House of Representatives in passing the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.  
 The senator also applauded the work of House and Senate negotiators in striking a balance between security and civil liberties. Senator Martinez called on his Senate colleagues to bring the bill to a vote.
   "From my time in the cabinet and after 9/11, I saw the need to significantly improve the tools available to our law enforcement. That need has not dissipated," said Martinez. "This reauthorization of the Patriot Act allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to share information that saves lives while protecting civil liberties. I strongly urge my Senate colleagues to act quickly on this measure because our national security demands it."
   By a 251-174 vote Wednesday, the House of Representatives agreed to renew 16 of the act's provisions that were set to expire at year's end. The bill now heads back to the Senate for consideration.
