SEN. LUGAR ENCOURAGES HOOSIERS TO CLAIM EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
  Again this year, U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar has joined the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in encouraging Hoosiers to determine if they are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). 
   Nationally, the IRS estimates that between 20 and 25 percent of qualified Americans do not claim the EITC. In Indiana, the IRS estimates that 15 percent or more of qualifying Hoosiers do not apply for the EITC.  
   In addition, taxpayers who qualify can retroactively claim an additional three years of the EITC, as long as they file their taxes before April 17. This is money that hard working Hoosiers already have earned and can save or put back into the economy. 
   According to the IRS, more than 429,000 Hoosiers claimed the federal EITC in 2005 for refunds totaling $782 million. This increase of 2.8 percent from 2004 included an additional 11,800 Hoosiers who received $53 million in refunds. 
   Enacted by Congress in 1975, the EITC is a refundable tax credit available to families with a working member where the family income falls below a certain level. The EITC was designed to decrease the tax burden and supplement wages, as well as provide incentive to work. When the EITC exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax credit for those taxpayers who qualify and claim the credit. 
   To qualify for the EITC, taxpayers must file a tax return, even if they are not required based on income, and meet ONE of the following income qualifications for 2006: 
   * Have two or more children with earned income less than $36,348 if single or $38,348 if married and filing jointly; 
   * Have one child with earned income less than $32,001 if single or $34,00 if married and filing jointly; 
   * Have no children with earned income less than $12,120 if single or $14,120 if married and filing jointly. 
   In addition to meeting one of the income qualifications, taxpayers must meet ALL of the following requirements: 
   * Must file a tax return; 
  * Must have earned income; 
  * Must be between 25 and 65 years of age or have a qualifying child; 
  * Cannot be claimed as a dependent by any one else; 
  * Must have a valid Social Security number; 
  * Must be a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident; 
  * Must have lived in the U.S. for at least six months; 
  * Cannot file as married filing separately; 
  * Cannot file Form 2555 or Form 2555-EZ; 
  * Investment income cannot exceed $2,800. 
  * New split refund option 
   This year, individuals have more options and flexibility to choose how to receive 2006 federal income tax refunds. Refunds can be direct deposited into one account or split among two or three checking or savings accounts with U.S. financial institutions no matter which 1040 form is filed (except Form 1040EZ-T, Claim for Refund of Federal Excise Tax). 
   Form 8888, the Direct Deposit of Refund to More Than One Account form, enables the option of splitting the refund when attached to your tax return. Please double check the account and routing numbers and verify that your financial institution will accept direct deposits to your account. 
   For assistance in determining eligibility, taxpayers may use the EITC Assistant, a new web-based tool, available at http://www.irs.gov. By providing basic information, this program will assist taxpayers with filing status, determining eligibility and estimating the amount of credit you may receive. In addition, the IRS has Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) centers available throughout the state to provide free assistance with tax preparation. For a center located near you, call Senator Lugar's Indianapolis office at (317) 226-5555. Taxpayers may request a free copy of Publication 596 Earned Income Credit by calling the IRS at 1-800-829-3676.
