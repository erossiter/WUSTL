$3.6 MILLION IN EPA GRANTS AWARDED TO HOOSIER COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that communities across the state will receive $3.6 million in funds from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Brownfields Program which provides grants to areas across the country. 
   The Brownfields Program encourages redevelopment of America's estimated 450,000 abandoned and contaminated wastes sites, known as brownfields.
   Brownfields grants serve as the foundation of the Brownfields Program. There are several types of grants available including cleanup grants, revolving loan fund grants, assessment grants, job training grants and technical research grants. The grants empower states, communities, and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess and safely cleanup at-risk areas.
