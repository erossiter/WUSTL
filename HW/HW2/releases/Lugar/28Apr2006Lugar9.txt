SENATE APPROVES RESOLUTION ON NEPAL
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar announced passage last night of S. Res. 451, a resolution expressing the support of the U.S. Senate for the reconvening of the Nepali parliament and for an immediate, peaceful transition to a democratic political process in the country.  
   "Nepal has been gripped by demonstrations in support of democracy for the past 20 days," said Lugar. "At least fourteen Nepali citizens have been killed in these protests and hundreds more injured. The demonstrations follow fourteen months of direct rule by King Gyanendra and February 8, 2006, municipal elections that the State Department characterized as a 'hollow attempt by the King to legitimize his power.' 
   This resolution expresses support for the reconvening of the Parliament of Nepal and urges the King, political parties and Maoists to support a process that returns the country to multiparty democracy and creates the conditions for peace and stability in the country." 
   The resolution also calls on the U.S. to work closely with India, China, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the United Nations to ensure a common and coherent international approach that helps bring about an immediate, peaceful transition to democracy and an end to the violent insurgency in Nepal. 
   Lugar's resolution follows King Gyanendra's announcement on April 24, 2006, that he would reinstate the Parliament of Nepal on April 28. 
   The resolution was cosponsored by Sens. Biden (D-DE), Coleman (R-MN), Chafee (R-RI), Feinstein (D-CA), Kerry (D-MA), Leahy (D-VT), and Sununu (R-NH).
