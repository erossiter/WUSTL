SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECRETARY OF STATE POWELL
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement today on Secretary of State Colin Powell:  
   "Secretary of State Colin Powell is a great leader whose military and diplomatic achievements and personal popularity have served our country well. I join countless friends of Colin Powell all over the world who have learned of his resignation with sadness. He has been loyal to President Bush and loyal to the interests of the United States. He has also succeeded in reaching out to encourage freedom loving people in other nations to strengthen their ties with us and to have confidence in our policies and trust in our alliances. Surely he will continue to offer leadership in promoting democracy building and humanitarian action, and I will look forward to opportunities to support his thoughtful and constructive idealism."
