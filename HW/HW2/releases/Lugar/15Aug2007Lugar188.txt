CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AWARDED WEED AND SEED GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that the City of Indianapolis have been awarded a $175,000 Weed and Seed Community grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. 
  The City of Indianapoliswill use funds to assist law enforcement efforts focused on reducing drug and gang activity, recidivism, youth crime, loitering and graffiti in the Eagledale-Lafayette Square area. 
  Community policing goals include increasing resident and property owner awareness and understanding of laws and improving the relationship between police and the Hispanic community as well as other ethnic minority groups. Prevention, intervention and treatment goals include increasing positive crime prevention activities for area youth, identifying job opportunities for area residents and reducing vulnerability to crime for non-English speaking residents. Neighborhood restoration goals include reducing the extent to which neglected and abandoned buildings provide opportunities for crime, reduce property values, and jeopardize neighborhood quality of life, as well as reducing crime and blight in rental properties through landlord accountability and supporting economic developers in recruiting businesses to the area. This is the first award Indianapolis has received for this project.
  The Weed and Seed Program focuses on reducing drug and other related criminal activity; reducing juvenile crime; and improving residents' perception of the neighborhood. Project goals include improving community policing, promoting prevention and treatment programs, and enhancing the physical and aesthetic qualities of the neighborhood.
