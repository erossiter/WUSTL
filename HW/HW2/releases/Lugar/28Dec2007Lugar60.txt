SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES ACADEMY NOMINATIONS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar has nominated candidates for the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland; U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York; U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York.
  The nominees were selected by Lugar's Academy Merit Selection Committees, which he has used for the nominating process each year that he has been a senator. The nonpartisan boards meet each winter in Indianapolis to review applicants. Lugar hosted the 6th Annual Dick Lugar Academy Day for high school students interested in learning more about military service this fall to encourage applicants. 
  The nominees now await admission to their respective academies for the class of 2012 with entrance in July 2008.
  "It is exciting that these outstanding Hoosier students have chosen to serve in our Armed Forces and I am pleased to nominate them. Additionally, I thank the selection committees for their objective service," said Lugar, who volunteered for the Navy after completing his Rhodes scholarship studies at Oxford University in England. Lugar served from 1957-60 as an intelligence briefer for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke.
