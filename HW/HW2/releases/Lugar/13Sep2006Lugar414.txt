SENATE PASSES URUGUAY BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar announced Senate passage last night of the Bilateral Investment Treaty with Uruguay.  
   "This agreement promotes investment and economic cooperation with a friend and partner in the Western Hemisphere. It will deliver important benefits to the United States and reinforce the significant economic reforms that Uruguay has undertaken in the recent past," said Lugar. 
   "More than eighty U.S. companies have operations in Uruguay, and the United States became Uruguay's largest export market in 2004. In the absence of a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas that facilitates trade on a hemispheric scale, we should move forward where we can to create open markets on a bilateral basis. Consequently, the United States should consider whether the groundwork laid by this bilateral investment treaty could be expanded into a full free trade agreement with Uruguay." 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on the treaty in June and passed it out of Committee on August 1. The agreement has already been approved overwhelmingly by both houses of the Uruguayan legislature.
