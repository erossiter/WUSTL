SEN. LUGAR ANNOUNCES 2006 FIREFIGHTER GRANT APPLICATION
  Sen. Dick Lugar invites Hoosier fire departments to apply for funding through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters program. The program presents an opportunity for Indiana's rural, urban and suburban fire departments and non-fire based EMS organizations to obtain financial assistance to help procure much-needed equipment and vehicles, provide vital facilities and personnel training and to offer fire and health safety education to the communities they serve. Through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2006, Congress provided $648 million for Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG).  
   The application deadline is April 7. Applications are automated and accessible via the AFG website: www.firegrantsupport.com. This web site contains useful background information on AFG program priorities and program guidance, as well as a tutorial on applying for each program and other useful materials. 
   Senator Lugar would like to support your grant application. To take advantage of this opportunity, please send a letter to Senator Lugar from your department indicating you are applying for this program. Indicate your interest in obtaining support, along with a copy of your project narrative to the following address:
