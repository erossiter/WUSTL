PUBLIC ASSISTANCE GRANTS ADDED FOR TORNADO DAMAGED COUNTIES
  Sen. Dick Lugar received notice that the State of Disaster Emergency Declaration for the State of Indiana as a result of a tornado, severe thunderstorms and extremely high winds that hit southern Indiana on November 6 signed by President Bush earlier this month has been amended to include public assistance.  
   "I deeply appreciate President Bush's and FEMA's quick response to Governor Daniels' request for federal disaster assistance," Lugar said. "It is important that we commit ourselves to advancing a swift and strong recovery in this area and access to these funds and programs will continue the important process of rebuilding" 
   The amended Disaster Delaration now includes assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for the repair and replacement of disaster-damaged public facilities. 
   Lugar and Sen. Evan Bayh wrote President Bush to support Governor Daniels' request to declare Indiana a Major Disaster Area after the tornado and sent a second letter of support on Friday, November 18 following the request for public assistance made by the Governor last Thursday. 
   Assistance to individuals and households damaged or destroyed during the storm was provided earlier this month.
