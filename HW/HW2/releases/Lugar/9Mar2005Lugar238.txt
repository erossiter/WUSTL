GRANTS MADE TO INDIANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that four Indiana communities will receive firefighter assistance grants totaling $400,653 from the Department of Homeland Security for training programs and modifications to stations and equipment.  
   The awards are among grants made to fire departments throughout the U.S. announced this week in round thirty-eight of the 2004 Assistance to Firefighter Grant program. 
   "Local fire departments are the backbone of many of our Indiana communities," said Lugar. "Additionally, they also fill an invaluable first responder role. It is incumbent that we offer adequate support, equipment and training to these brave men and women." 
   For the 2004 program, $750 million was appropriated to provide direct assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. 
   Applicants had to demonstrate financial need and articulate the benefits to be derived from the grant funds in their applications. 
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. 
   Communities receiving grants are:
