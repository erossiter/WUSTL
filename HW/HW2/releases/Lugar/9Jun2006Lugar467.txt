SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES 'SMALL BUSINESS CHAMPION' AWARD
  Sen. Dick Lugar received the "Small Business Champion" Award yesterday in Washington, DC, from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) for his support of issues important to small business owners.  
   The SBE Council is a nonpartisan small business advocacy organization which publishes an annual scorecard of congressional votes on issues important to the small business community. Members of the U.S. Senate were scored on 23 votes, and Senator Lugar received a rating of 93 out of 100. 
   SBE Council President & CEO Karen Kerrigan said, "Small business owners and entrepreneurs, of course, are the backbone of the U.S. economy in terms of job creation, innovation, and pushing economic growth forward. While most politicians talk favorably about small businesses, U.S. Senator Lugar actually voted in favor of their key issues during the first session of the 109th Congress, and therefore earned SBE Council's 'Small Business Champion Award.'" 
   Lugar was also presented with the "Hero of the Taxpayer" award by the Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) at the same event. As a fiscal conservative, Lugar has a voting record that is repeatedly recognized for prudent management of taxpayer funds. He has repeatedly received the nonpartisan "Watchdog of the Treasury" award for fighting wasteful spending. 
   Lugar also recently received the Spirit of Enterprise award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for support of pro-business issues. 
   In 2004, Lugar was ranked first out of all members of Congress in the 106th and 107th Congresses in economic efficiency according to a study published in the Investor's Business Daily and completed by the Department of Economics at the University of Delaware.
