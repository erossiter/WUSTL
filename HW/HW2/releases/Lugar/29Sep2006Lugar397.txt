INDIANA FAMILY CENTER TO RECEIVE $742,383 FROM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that the Indiana Center for Family, School and Community Partnerships (FSCP) in Indianapolis will receive $742,383 in grants from the U.S. Department of Education's Parental Information and Resource Centers Program (PIRC) for the period of October 1, 2006, to September 30, 2007. The grant will be for 5 years, although future funding may vary.  
   FSCP is a statewide agency that provides training and information to families across Indiana. Award money will go towards several projects to reach economically and educationally disadvantaged families statewide. 
   This year, FSCP plans to engage in broad information dissemination to 538,000 families, targeted information dissemination to 35,000 families and provide early childhood services and information to 43,000 families. In addition, the group hopes to train more than 3,000 Hoosiers directly. They will create a network of trained parent and school leaders, provide information to immigrant families to support the education of their children and work with the Indiana Department of Education to enhance the state's Parent Involvement Policy. 
   The purpose of the PIRC program is to help implement successful and effective parental involvement policies, programs and activities that improve student ac ademic achievement and strengthen partnerships among parents, teachers, principals, administrators, and other school personnel in meeting the educational needs of children.
