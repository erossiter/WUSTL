SEN. LUGAR RETURNS $275,000 IN UNSPENT OFFICE FUNDS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2005
 Sen. Dick Lugar has returned nearly $4.5 million in unspent office funds during his Senate career.  
 Figures show a savings of over $275,000 for the fiscal year 2005, bringing Lugar's total savings to $4.483 million from the allotment for office expenses and salaries. 
   "It is a priority to run an efficient office and to make good use of taxpayer dollars," said Lugar, who has returned funds each year since entering the Senate in 1977. 
   As a fiscal conservative, Lugar has a voting record that is repeatedly recognized for prudent management of taxpayer funds. He has continually received the nonpartisan "Watchdog of the Treasury" award for fighting wasteful spending. In 2004, Lugar was ranked first out of all members of Congress in the 106th and 107th Congresses in economic efficiency according to a study published in the Investor's Business Daily and completed by the Department of Economics at the University of Delaware.
