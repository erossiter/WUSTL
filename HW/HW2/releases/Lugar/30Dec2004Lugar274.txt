SEN. LUGAR RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS TSUNAMI DISASTER
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar will introduce a resolution to express the sense of the Senate regarding the tsunamis, which struck 12 countries in Southeast Asia and East Africa on December 26, when the Senate reconvenes next week.  
 The resolution expresses sympathy for the victims of the devastating tidal waves and urges a generous response by the United States and the international community. 
   "The tsunami disaster constitutes a humanitarian tragedy of incredible proportions," said Lugar. "My resolution explains the gravity of the situation, offers condolences to the victims and their loved ones, and sets the stage for Congress to make generous appropriations." 
   "The United States is a compassionate country that will respond generously to this human catastrophe. Under the leadership of President Bush, the agencies and resources of the United States government have been mobilized to assist in the initial humanitarian effort. In addition, countless Americans have donated millions of dollars directly to international relief efforts. As the world leader in international disaster assistance, we must work closely with the international community to implement the most effective response possible in the coming weeks and months." 
   "Beyond the compelling humanitarian reasons for swift action, a stable and prosperous Asia is essential to the global effort on a range of shared problems, including weapons proliferation, terrorism, narcotics, and contagious diseases. The worldwide economic and political consequences of this natural disaster could be even more severe unless we commit ourselves to advancing a strong recovery in the region," Lugar said.
