IRAN RESOLUTION APPROVED BY SENATE
  The U.S. Senate unanimously approved today a resolution condemning the government of Iran for violating its international nuclear nonproliferation obligations and expressing support for efforts to report Iran to the United Nations Security Council.  
   Senate Concurrent Resolution 78 was introduced by Sen. Bill Frist, drafted by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar and cosponsored by more than 20 senators. 
   The resolution states that Congress: 
   * Condemns the many failures of the Government of Iran to comply faithfully with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations, including its obligations under the Safeguards Agreement (as reported by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Administration to the IAEA Board of Governors since 2003), its suspension commitments under the Paris Agreement, and prior commitments to the EU-3 to suspend all enrichment- and reprocessing-related activities; 
   * Commends the efforts of the Governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to seek a meaningful and credible suspension of Iran's enrichment- and reprocessing-related activities and to find a diplomatic means to address the non-compliance of the Government of Iran with its obligations, requirements, and commitments related to nuclear non-proliferation; 
   * Strongly urges the IAEA Board of Governors, at its special meeting on February 2, 2006, to order that Iran's noncompliance with its safeguards obligations be reported to the United Nations Security Council; and 
   * Calls on all members of the United Nations Security Council, in particular the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, to act expeditiously to consider any report of Iran's noncompliance in fulfillment of the mandate of the Security Council to respond to and deal with situations bearing on the maintenance of international peace and security.
