CITY OF LAFAYETTE AWARDED WEED AND SEED GRANT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that the City of Lafayette has been awarded a $175,000 Weed and Seed Community grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. 
  "I am supportive of the City of Lafayette's vision to make downtown Lafayette safe, clean, rich in diversity, and welcoming to all its residents, businesses and visitors," wrote Lugar in support of the City's grant application. 
  The City of Lafayette will use funds to assist law enforcement efforts to design, plan and implement a Problem-Solving Re-entry Court for 20 high-risk offenders and to reduce drug dealing and abuse. The designated area includes the Wabash River as the west boundary, a series of connecting streets (Erie, Ninth, Elmwood, and Eighteenth Streets) as the east boundary, U.S. Highway 52 as the north boundary, and Wabash Avenue as the south boundary. This is the first award Lafayette has received for this project.
  The Weed and Seed Program focuses on reducing drug and other related criminal activity; reducing juvenile crime; and improving residents' perception of the neighborhood. Project goals include improving community policing, promoting prevention and treatment programs, and enhancing the physical and aesthetic qualities of the neighborhood.
