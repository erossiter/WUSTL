SENATE APPROVES U.S.-U.K. EXTRADITION, GENEVA PROTOCOL III TREATIES
  U.S. Senate last week unanimously approved the Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  
   "I am pleased that members of the Senate have reached a thoughtful, bipartisan agreement on the resolution of advice and consent to the U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty," U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar said. 
   "This is an important treaty, both for our law enforcement efforts and our relationship with the United Kingdom. The existing U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty dates back to 1972 and was last updated twenty years ago in 1986. The proposed treaty would replace these outdated provisions with more efficient procedures that are consistent with modern U.S. extradition practices and already in use in other updated U.S. extradition treaties." 
   The Senate also approved Geneva Protocol III (the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem). 
   Geneva Protocol III creates a new distinctive emblem, a Red Crystal, to serve the same purposes as the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems. The Red Crystal is a neutral emblem for use by governments and national societies facing challenges using the existing emblems or those that believe a neutral emblem may offer enhanced protection in certain situations. 
   The Protocol also paved the way for Magen David Adom, Israel's national society, to become a member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. U.S. ratification of the Protocol will continue the longstanding U.S. commitment to the humanitarian objectives of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and its fundamental principles of universality and neutrality.
