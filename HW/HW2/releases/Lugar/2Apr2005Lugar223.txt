SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement about Pope John Paul II:  
   "Pope John Paul II was a great religious leader and one of the most important international figures of our time. His outspoken support of freedom and democracy played a key role in bringing about the end of Communism in his native Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe. He also sought to end centuries of estrangement between Catholics and Jews, and he worked assiduously at trying to heal the breach with the Orthodox branch of Christianity. 
   "I had the honor of meeting him twice. First was at the White House during his first visit to the U.S. as Pope. Then I met with him at the Vatican in 1983. That year I introduced legislation to repeal a more than century old prohibition against the United States sending an ambassador to the Vatican. In January 1984, President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II re-established diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the United States. 
   "Using his fluency in eight languages, the Pope made moral diplomacy a central element of his ministry. His extensive travels, in particular his outreach to Africa, Asia, and Latin America, helped deepen international understanding. His kindness, humor, and courage were an inspiration to Catholics and non-Catholics alike."
