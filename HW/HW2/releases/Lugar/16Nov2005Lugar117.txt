  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that Vincennes University will receive $500,000 to develop a forensic technology program in conjunction with Vincennes University Center for Applied Technology as part of the Science, State, Commerce, Justice and Related Agencies Conference Report that passed the Senate today.  
   The funds will be used to equip and develop three specialized training labs within the Center for Applied Technology to provide computer and technology training for students who plan to seek employment in law enforcement agencies. The training labs also will provide tools for instruction on computer forensics, intellectual property enforcement, cyber and Internet crime enforcement, and drug enforcement. 
   The bill now heads to the President for his signature.
