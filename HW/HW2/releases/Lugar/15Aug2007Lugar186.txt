FOURTEEN HOOSIER ORGANIZATIONS AWARDED OVER $1.25 MILLION IN DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM GRANTS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that fourteen organizations throughout Indiana have been awarded Drug Free Communities grants from the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
  The Drug Free Communities Support Program provides grants of up to $100,000 to community coalitions that mobilize their communities to prevent youth alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug, and inhalant abuse. The program acts as a catalyst for increased citizen participation in efforts to reduce substance use among youth, and it provides drug-free community coalitions with funds to carry out their missions.
