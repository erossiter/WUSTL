SEN. LUGAR NOMINATES STUDENTS FOR SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Dick Lugar has nominated candidates for the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY, U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, CO and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY.  
   The nominees were selected by Lugar's Academy Merit Selection Committees which he has used for his nominating process each year that he has been a senator. The nonpartisan boards meet every November and December in Indianapolis to review applicants. The nominees now compete for appointments to their respective academies for the class of 2009, entering in July of 2005. This year, Lugar also hosted an Academy Day for high school students interested in learning more about military service. 
   "I am proud to nominate these outstanding young Hoosiers to our nation's service academies," said Lugar, who volunteered for the Navy after completing his Rhodes Scholarship studies at Oxford University in England. Lugar served from 1957-60 as an intelligence briefer for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke. "I am also grateful to the selection committees for their service."
