  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has opened the applications for fire grants under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, and U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar would like to support Hoosier grant applications. 
   Fire departments across Indiana can take advantage of this opportunity by sending a letter to Lugar indicating interest in obtaining support and including a copy of the project narrative to the following address:
   U.S. Senator Richard G. Lugar

  10 West Market Street
  Indianapolis, IN 46204
  Attn: Bob Healey
   The deadline for receipt of the applications is April 4, 2008, at 5:00 p.m. EDT. The AFG, which will be distributed in phases throughout FY 2008, will ultimately award approximately $500 million.

Additional Help Desk hours may be added if demand is high.
   Eligible applicants for the FY 2008 AFG are limited to fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical service (EMS) organizations operating within the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
