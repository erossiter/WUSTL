SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON HONDA EXPANSION IN GREENSBURG
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement after meeting with a Honda Motor Company official this morning who confirmed the plan to build an auto assembly plant in Greensburg. The $550 million investment is expected to employ 2,000 people and produce 200,000 vehicles annually, with production slated to begin in Fall 2008.  
   "The Honda announcement is a tremendous boost to the State of Indiana," Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar said. 
   "I compliment Governor Daniels and his traveling team because they made possible Japanese interest and hopefully South Korean interest that will come. This particular plant finds Greensburg a great place. Honda officials have mentioned to me I-74 and the infrastructure all around the area, the availability of 1,700 acres and the quality of the local workforce. 
   "Something is occurring in Indiana, and it comes through leadership and vision, and also through investors like Honda. 
   "Hoosiers are ready for business. We are eager to get new jobs, high-paying manufacturing jobs in particular, and all the suppliers that enter the picture. We're competitive, and we're aggressive. And that is required," Lugar said. 
   "It's the marketing and salesmanship of our State that has made a difference."
