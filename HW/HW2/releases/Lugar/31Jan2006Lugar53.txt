SEN. LUGAR COMMENTS ON STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar's statement on the President Bush's 2006 State of the Union Address:  
   "The President's State of the Union address focuses on important improvements in the economy, healthcare and education. 
   "Critical to U.S. economic and national security is taking significant steps to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. My work this year will focus on what steps we might take to accelerate the development of new, homegrown sources of energy and become more efficient consumers of energy. 
   "The United States also must continue focusing on the major national security challenge of keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists. We will continue our work in the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. Additionally, Sen. Barack Obama and I have written new legislation that extends the cooperative threat reduction idea to conventional weapons such as shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which are also being sought by terrorists. 
   "The Foreign Relations Committee has been the most active committee in the U.S. Senate. We will continue to explore the progress in Iraq. The committee will continue to work on issues involving the North Atlantic relationship, Iran, the Middle East peace process, North Korea, India nuclear sales, and trade and development issues in Asian, Latin America and Africa."
