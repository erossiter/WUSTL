SEN. LUGAR VISITS WITH FRANKFORT COMMUNITY PUBLIC LIBRARY DELEGATION
  Sen. Dick Lugar today visited with leaders from the Frankfort Community Public Library, who were in Washington, D.C., to receive a National Award for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The Frankfort Library was one of six institutions honored nationally for outstanding public service in 2006.  
   "A library is a resource that can make a great difference in a person's life and is essential to the education and health of a community," said Lugar. "Through its extensive offerings of arts and cultural classes and events, the Frankfort Community Public Library provides outstanding leadership and stewardship to the residents of Frankfort and Clinton County." 
   Traveling to Washington, D.C., from Frankfort were: Library Director Bill Caddell, Assistant Library Director Michelle Bradley, Board President Stephen Rothenberger, Board Member Nancy Fullerton, Arts Director Flo Caddell, and community activist Julie Miller. 
   The delegation was honored in the East Room of the White House by First Lady Laura Bush in a ceremony on January 8. First Lady Laura Bush said, "As the library introduces Frankfort to its residents' different cultures, it encourages their appreciation of all arts and culture, especially music. Children receive instruction, and show off their skills, on the library's new Yamaha grand piano. Teenagers develop healthy interests through voice lessons, and perform Broadway show tunes in the library's theater. Frankfort has one of the few libraries in the country that actually encourage noisy patrons." 
   In addition to visiting with Lugar, the delegation toured the U.S. Capitol Building and the Library of Congress. 
   The Institute of Museum and Library Services is an independent, federal grant-making agency dedicated to creating and sustaining a nation of learners.
