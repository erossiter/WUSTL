  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified that the City of Anderson has been awarded a $175,000 Weed and Seed Community grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The designated project area includes Euclid as the west boundary, Scatterfield Road as the east boundary, 38th Street as the south boundary, and Oak Street at the north boundary. This is the first award Anderson has received for this project.
