  Sen. Dick Lugar announced today that the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Joseph S. Van Bokkelen to serve as U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana: 
  "I congratulate Joe Van Bokkelen on his Senate confirmation. His performance as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana has been nothing short of remarkable and I am confident that he will approach his judgeship with the same enthusiasm and proficiency.
  "Judge Rudy Lozano has been a remarkable leader on the Federal bench and we look forward to his continued leadership as he assumes senior status.
  "As U.S. Attorney, Joe undertook the most aggressive public corruption initiative in the history of the office. He also used his office to target the use and possession of illegal firearms, combat gang activity, implement drug demand reduction programs, and cultivate community partnerships.
  "Likewise, Joe has demonstrated leadership in the Justice Department where he serves on several of the Attorney General's Advisory Committees, including: Violent and Organized Crime, White Collar Crime, Sentencing Guidelines, and the Regional Information Sharing Working Group."
