INDIANA RECEIVES GRANT TO UPDATE FLOOD MAPS
  Sen. Dick Lugar's office was notified today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will obligate more than $2.5 million to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) program.  
 This funding is to help transform Indiana flood maps into more reliable, easier-to-use and readily available digital products. 
   The National Flood Insurance Program can track more closely actual risk through updated flood maps. The maps will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of floodplain management and public awareness of flood hazards. In the future, CTP hopes to work with the National Service Provider (NSP) to implement state-of-the-art multihazard mapping. 
   The funding will be directed towards Adams, Clark, Dearborn, Delaware, Elkhart, Floyd, Hamilton, Lawrence, Madison, Monroe, Porter, St. Joseph, Vigo, and Warrick counties. These entities will be provided with Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps through the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
   The CTP program consists of communities and regional and state agencies that have the interest, capabilities and resources to be engaged in a flood hazard mapping program through FEMA. As members, communities ensure their commitment to better overall floodplain management and multihazard risk identification through reliable, up-to-date flood maps.
