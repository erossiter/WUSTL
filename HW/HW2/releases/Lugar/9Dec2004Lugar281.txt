UKRAINE RESOLUTION PASSES SENATE
  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar announced that the Senate passed a resolution last night expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the Ukraine presidential elections.  
   The resolution condemns the widespread fraud in the November 21, 2004, presidential run-off election and supports a peaceful settlement, both politically and legally, based on the principles of democracy and that reflect the will of the Ukrainian people. 
   Lugar went to Ukraine at the request of President George W. Bush. His main focus was to stress free and fair election procedures that would strengthen worldwide respect for the legitimacy of the winning candidate. 
   On November 22, the day following the run-off election, Lugar made a statement based on many reports from OSCE/ODIHR and other observers who observed an extensive list of serious procedural violations. He said, "It is now apparent that a concerted and forceful program of election day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities." Subsequently, the Ukrainian Supreme Court ruled the election results invalid and called for new elections. 
   In testimony in front of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, Lugar made the following suggestions for the new election: 
   * Absentee and mobile voting must be excluded; 
   * The presence of Ukrainian and international observers must be increased, ideally, to observers in each of the 33,006 polling stations; 
   * The candidates must have equal time to present themselves and to broadcast their platforms to the Ukrainian people; and 
   * The domestic and international press must commit to monitor and debate the electoral process in an open and transparent manner that fully illuminates illegal activities and conveys legitimacy to the rightful winner." 
   "A secure and democratic Ukraine is in the national security interests of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and Russia. A fraudulent and illegal election would leave Ukraine crippled. The new president would lack legitimacy with the Ukrainian people and the international community," Lugar said.
