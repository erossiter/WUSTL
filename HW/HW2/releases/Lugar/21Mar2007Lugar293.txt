SENS. BAYH, LUGAR JOIN INDY RACING LEAGUE TO PROMOTE GREATER ETHANOL USE
  U.S. Sens. Evan Bayh and Richard Lugar today praised the Indy Racing League's switch to 100 percent ethanol this year at a press conference on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Renewable Fuels Association, the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council and the IndyCar Series. They were joined at the event by Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George and Team Ethanol driver Jeff Simmons. Both senators are longtime advocates of ethanol and recognized the IRL today both at the press conference and in a Congressional Record statement for sending a strong message to race fans and Americans everywhere about the benefits of using ethanol and other renewable fuels.  
   "This is kind of leadership we need - from both the public and private sector - if we are going to begin reducing our dependence on oil," Senator Bayh said. "With its decision to switch to 100 percent ethanol, the Indy Racing League has taken the lead in encouraging all Americans to use renewable fuels. If a racecar can hit speeds of 220 miles per hour running on ethanol, then surely it's good enough for the family minivan, too." 
   "A century ago, Carl Fisher envisioned the Indianapolis Motor Speedway as an automotive testing ground, and ever since, the Brickyard has fostered innovation, from the rear-view mirror and now to pure-ethanol fuel. While ethanol not only displaces oil and is better for the environment, the Indy Racing League has chosen ethanol for a more fundamental reason. Ethanol is a high-performance fuel," said Lugar. "It is time to increase the availability of E85 pumps and flex-fuel vehicles so that all American's have access to this high-performance, renewable fuel." 
   Beginning this Saturday, all IndyCars will race on a 100 percent ethanol fuel. Ethanol, a non-toxic, biodegradable fuel, will deliver the same power drivers rely on today, only without harmful air pollution. In fact, its high octane ratings will allow engines to run even higher compression ratios by reducing detonation. 
   Earlier this year, Senator Bayh, joined by Senator Lugar and a coalition of senators from both parties, introduced the DRIVE Act, a comprehensive, bipartisan plan to reduce dependence on oil by 7 million barrels a day in 20 years - more than double the amount we currently import from the Middle East. In addition to Bayh and Lugar, 23 other senators have signed up to co-sponsor the legislation. 
   Among the steps outlined in the bill are proposals that would: 
   * Increase availability of home-grown, renewable fuels like ethanol, so that every American who wants to use alternative energy is able to do so; 
   * Provide tax credits for manufacturers who to retool their factories to build hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and flex fuel vehicles; 
   * Encourages the development and mass marketing of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and 
   * Lifts the per manufacturer cap on consumer tax credits for the purchase of hybrids and advanced diesels so more consumers receive tax incentives to purchase hybrids.
