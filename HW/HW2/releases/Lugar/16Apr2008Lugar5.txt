SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT TO MARK 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF 1983 BEIRUT BOMBING
  On April 15, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed Senate Resolution 516 sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to mark the 25th Anniversary of the tragic 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. 
   "Thousands of State Department employees are living and working abroad, promoting U.S. interests and building stronger relations with foreign governments and their peoples. While their work is always important, it is also sometimes dangerous. The 25th anniversary of the April 18, 1983, bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut reminds us of this fact," Lugar said.
   "We honor the service of those who died, mourn their death, remember the family members, and condemn all terrorist acts that deliberately target the innocent. We also reiterate our strong support for the people of Lebanon and their Government as they seek to build a better future free from the threat of terrorist violence."
   On April 18, 1983, terrorists detonated a bomb at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including 42 American and Lebanese Embassy staff, and injuring scores of individuals, including 35 Embassy staff.
