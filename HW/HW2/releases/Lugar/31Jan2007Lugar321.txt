SEN. LUGAR INTRODUCES BILL TO PROMOTE ADVANCE HEALTH CARE PLANNING
  Sens. Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Bill Nelson (D-FL) today reintroduced the Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007. The bill would improve understanding of the importance of advance directives and give people the opportunity to discuss options with a doctor.  
   "Americans of all ages deserve quality end-of-life medical care," Lugar said. "This legislation would improve access to information about individual health care options and, additionally, promote advance care planning and decision-making." 
   The bill encourages America adults, especially those 65 and older, to prepare advance directives for medical care near the end of life should they become unable to make decisions for themselves. Advance directives include living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care and other purposes. 
   Specifically, the legislation would encourage new Medicare beneficiaries to prepare advance directives by including a physician consultation on advance directives in each "Welcome to Medicare" physical exam. This initial consultation would cover the importance of preparing advance directives, when these documents are most likely to be used, and where to find additional resources and information. 
   It would also engage health providers in disseminating information about and assisting with the preparation of advance directives by providing funds for the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a public education campaign to raise awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end of life.
