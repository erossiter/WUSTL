NATIONAL GUARDSMEN RECEIVE SCHOLARSHIPS AT ARMED FORCES DAY
  Sen. Dick Lugar and MG R. Martin Umbarger, Adjutant General of the State Indiana, presented scholarships to Olivea Zook from Westfield High School, Kevin Bird from Ben Davis High School, and Lucas Simmons and Jon Harmon from Kings Academy in Marion during the Annual Armed Forces Day events at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday, May 20, 2007.  
   Zook, Bird and Simmons received $105,000 ROTC scholarships after enlisting in the Indiana Army National Guard for six years. The Indiana National Guard identifies students as early as their junior year in high school for this scholarship, and recipients are chosen based on leadership skills, high moral character and academic achievement. 
   Harmon was presented with a $105,000 College First scholarship by the Indiana Army National Guard. This scholarship allows students to complete a bachelor's degree without concern of mobilization. 
   "I commend these young people for their decision to enlist in the Indiana Army National Guard, and I was pleased to lead them in the Oaths of Enlistment," Lugar said. "I am grateful that each of these young people accepted this scholarship and look forward to their commissioning upon graduation." 
   Lugar led 61 recruits in the Oath of Enlistment into the various branches of military service at the Speedway and has participated in Armed Forces Day since 1981.
