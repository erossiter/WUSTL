INDIANA CRIMINAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE AWARDED MORE THAN $3.6 MILLION IN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANTS
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified that the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute (ICJI) has been awarded three grants totaling $2,621,004 from the U.S. Department of Justice. 
   ICJI will receive a $2,195,754 STOP Violence Against Women Formula Program grant. The funds will support the development and implementation of effective, victim-centered law enforcement, prosecution, and court strategies to address violent crimes against women.
   The STOP Program was reauthorized and amended in 2006 by the Violence Against Women Act of 2005. In compliance with the act, STOP funds are distributed to states and allocated to nonprofit victim services programs, law enforcement, prosecution, and the courts.
   ICJI will also receive $350,000 from the Department of Justice's FY 07 Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws Block Grants Program. This program aims to support and enhance state and local efforts to enforce laws prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors.
   Finally, ICJI will receive a $75,250 Title V Community Prevention Grant. This program intends to reduce risks and enhance protective factors to prevent at-risk youth from entering the juvenile justice system.
