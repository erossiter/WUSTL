MEASURE TO HELP FAMILIES WITH DISABLED CHILDREN APPROVED
  Recently, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a measure that will help moderate-income families with disabled children get and keep federal Medicaid coverage.  
   "Too often, families with disabled children report that they are turning down jobs, raises and overtime so that they can stay in their income bracket to qualify for benefits. Because it is extremely difficult to get comparable private coverage that includes specialized care such as physical therapy and medical equipment, families are often discouraged from advancing their economic prospects," Sen. Lugar said. 
   The Family Opportunity Act would allow states to offer a Medicaid buy-in for families with disabled children (with incomes up to 250 percent of the poverty level, or $47,125 for a family of four). A state would decide its premium rate using a sliding scale based on the family's income. States could initially apply for money to support demonstration projects to extend Medicaid coverage to children with potentially severe disabilities. The bill would also establish new health information centers. 
   Lugar has been a sponsor of this legislation in past Congresses. This is the first time it has been approved by the Senate. 
   "I compliment the work of Ben and Donna Olsen of Indianapolis who have been leading advocates in our state for this law change. I became particularly aware of this issue after meeting with the Olsens and other parents of children with special needs at St. Vincent's Children's Specialty Hospital, Indianapolis, in December 1998. The Olsen's work with the Parent Information Network has made - and will continue to make - a difference in many lives," Lugar said. 
   The Indiana Parent Information Network (IPIN), located in Indianapolis, can be contacted at 317-257-8683 or 800-964-IPIN (4746). IPIN is part of Family Voices, a nation-wide grassroots network of families.
