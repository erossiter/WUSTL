SEN. LUGAR SHARES NEWS OF PURPLE HEART WITH SELLERSBURG VETERAN
  At 6:00 p.m. today, Sen. Dick Lugar called Sellersburg resident Lance Corporal John M. Hargesheimer, United States Marine Corps, to share the good news that President Bush awarded Hargesheimer the Purple Heart for wounds received in action in the Republic of Vietnam on April 10, 1968.  
   "I was notified today that the President of the United States has awarded you the Purple Heart for wounds you received in Vietnam on April 10, 1968," said Lugar. 
   Hargesheimer, a Vietnam veteran, received the award due to a shrapnel wound he received on his arm and above his eye. Hargesheimer served in the Marine Corps from 1966-1968, reaching the rank of E-4. He served in Vietnam with the 2d Tank Battalion, 2d Marine Division. 
   In April 2002, he was interviewed by Pat McClain of Lugar's Jeffersonville office for the Veteran's History Project. 
   Since February 2002, Lugar has partnered with Library of Congress to collect oral histories of Hoosier veterans for the Veterans History Project. Lugar has submitted nearly 6,000 interviews to the collection on behalf of Indiana. These Hoosier histories number more than any other state and account for nearly 20 percent of the Library's entire Veterans History Project collection. The histories are permanently archived by the Library of Congress and over time will be available for research and study.
