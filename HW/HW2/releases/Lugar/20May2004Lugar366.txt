NEW NUNN-LUGAR NUMBERS RELEASED
  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has released the newest Nunn-Lugar Scorecard, showing that 6,312 former Soviet Nuclear warheads have been deactivated.  
   The Scorecard is a running account of weapons dismantled and destroyed in the former Soviet Union under the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. View the most recent scorecard. (see http://lugar.senate.gov/nunn_lugar_scorecard.html)
   Over the last two months the Nunn-Lugar program has reduced threats to the American people by: 
   * Removing 100 warheads from Russian missile systems; 
   * Destroying 15 SS-18 Satan missiles, each capable of delivering 10 independently-targeted warheads to cities in the United States; 
   * Destroying 8 missile silos housing SS-18 missiles; 
   * Destroying 6 Backfire bombers in Ukraine, each was capable of carrying 3 nuclear air-launched cruise missiles; 
   * Destroying 84 AS-4/Kh-22 long-range nuclear air-launched cruise missiles that were carried by Bear and Blackjack bombers; 
   * Destroying 51 SS-N-23, SS-N-20, and SS-N-18 submarine-launched ballistic missiles in Russia that were carried aboard Typhoon, Delta III, and Delta IV submarines; and, 
   * Destroying 4 SS-24 mobile intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, each capable of carrying 10 independently-targeted warheads to targets in the United States. 
   Since 1993, Nunn-Lugar has deactivated 6,312 former Soviet nuclear warheads taken from missiles, bombers, and submarines. In addition, the program has destroyed 535 intercontinental ballistic missiles; 459 intercontinental ballistic missile silos; 11 mobile intercontinental ballistic missile launchers; 128 strategic bombers; 708 nuclear air-launched cruise missiles; 496 submarine- launched ballistic missiles; 408 submarine Launched Ballistic Missile Launchers; 27 strategic missile submarines; and 194 nuclear test tunnels. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn-Lugar program. 
   Work continues today to dismantle the second Typhoon missile submarine near Arkhangel, in northwest Russia. Each Typhoon is capable of launching 200 nuclear warheads at cities in the United States. U.S. contractors and their Russian partners continue to dismantle SS-18 and SS-24 mobile missiles in several locations around Russia. In Ukraine, dismantlement operations are underway to eliminate the entire fleet of Backfire bombers that Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union. 
   The U.S.-based Parsons Company is making steady progress building a nerve agent destruction facility at Shchuchye, Russia. Numerous support facilities have also been completed. The Russians are constructing a second nerve agent destruction building at the same site. Foreign countries are also making financial and material contributions at Shchuchye, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Norway, Italy, and Switzerland. 
   Shchuchye is home to one of the worlds' largest stockpiles of deadly nerve agent. Nearly two million easily portable artillery shells and missile warheads filled with lethal sarin, soman, and VX are stored there. The stockpile stored at Shchuchye is enough to kill the world's population 20 times over. 
   This week the Senate and House will be considering the FY 2005 National Defense Authorization bill. Both House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommended full funding of President Bush's request of $409.2 million. The Senate bill contains a permanent annual waiver for Congressional conditions on the funding for chemical weapons destruction and the House recommended a one-year waiver. The waiver is important so that construction at Shchuchye can continue without interruption.
