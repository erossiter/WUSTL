SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH FARM BUREAU YOUNG LEADERS
 Sen. Dick Lugar met with participants of the Indiana Farm Bureau's Farm Bureau to Washington, D.C. (FB to DC) Leadership Program in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing room on Tuesday, June 13, 2006. These future Hoosier agricultural leaders were in Washington for the completion of the FB to DC Leadership Program.  
   Lugar spoke with the participants and answered questions on a wide range of topics, including biotech initiatives, energy competition, climate change, and Iraq. Lugar cited the importance of agriculture in determining the nation's energy future, specifically in regard to the utilization of ethanol as a source of fuel. 
   FB to DC is a two-year skill-developing program that focuses on communication, leadership and conducting effective meetings. Participants attended one of three regional programs called basic school and met as a group for a special institute in Indianapolis; they also observed three local government meetings and made contact with a state and/or national legislator.
