INDIANA UNIVERSITIES RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR MCNAIR PROGRAM
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today of grants totaling $955,591 awarded by the U.S. Department of Education to the following universities: Indiana State University, Indiana University-Bloomington, Indiana University-Indianapolis, and Purdue University-Calumet. The grants are part of the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement (McNair) program. 
   "I believe it is in the nation's best interest to open doors to higher education so that students of all economic backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue advanced degrees," Lugar said.
   The purpose of the McNair program is to award grants to institutions of higher education for projects designed to provide disadvantaged college students with effective preparation for doctoral study.
   The program prepares students for a doctoral studies program through involvement in research and other scholarly activities. Participants come from disadvantaged backgrounds and demonstrate strong academic potential. Institutions work closely with students as they complete their undergraduate requirements and encourage participants to enroll in graduate programs. The goal is to increase the attainment of Ph.D. degrees by students from underrepresented segments of society.
   Students in the program are provided with the following: academic counseling, financial aid assistance, mentoring, research opportunities, seminars, summer internships, and tutoring.
   Please contact the Department of Education at 202-401-1028 for more information regarding this grant. Questions regarding the grants process in general may be directed to Kim Preston, Grants Coordinator for Senator Lugar, by phone at 202-224-4814 or by email at grants@lugar.senate.gov
