SEN. LUGAR LEADS WITH HEALTH LEGISLATION
  Sen. Dick Lugar has introduced legislation that would strengthen the scientific base of health promotion information in this country. The bill, Health Promotion FIRST (Funding Integrated Research, Synthesis and Training) Act, is designed to help Americans stay healthy.  
   The Health Promotion FIRST Act will build the foundation for a stable coordinated strategy to develop the basic and applied science of health promotion, synthesize research results and disseminate findings to researchers, practitioners and policy makers.
   "This legislation can offer us the chance help Americans live a healthier life," said Lugar, a long-time runner. "Information is a key in living a healthy lifestyle. This bill will allow for additional research, collection, and dissemination of critical information, so individuals, as well as scientists and policy makers, will have the best information upon which to build their health promotion activities." 
   The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop strategic plans focusing on the following: 
   * How to develop the basic and applied science of health promotion; 
   * How to best utilize the authority and resources of the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies to integrate health promotion concepts into health care and other elements of society; 
   * How to synthesize health promotion research into practical guidelines that can be easily disseminated; and 
   * How to best support and develop the health promotion professional and scientific community. 
   Additional funding is also provided for the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to augment current activities related to health promotion research and dissemination. 
   Lugar has been a long-time proponent of health and fitness awareness. On September 18, he will host the 26th annual Dick Lugar Community Run, Walk and Corporate Challenge. The event, presented by Indiana Sports Corporation on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis, offers Hoosiers a chance to participate in a 5K walk or run, or a 10K run. 
   Senator Lugar will host a Community Health Fair on Friday, September 17 from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. in the Circle Centre Mall Artsgarden. The annual Health Fair is a free, family and community-oriented event designed to promote healthy lifestyles and physical fitness. Over 50 health and fitness experts from the Indianapolis metro area will offer exhibits, screenings and consultations to individuals interested in a wide-range of health and fitness issues. Due to duties in the Senate, Lugar will not be at the Health Fair. However, his wife, Char Lugar, will be attending and greeting all of the vendors.
