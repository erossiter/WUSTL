SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER OF GLOBAL ACTION FOR CHILDREN
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar today met with James Haven, Advisory Board Member of Global Action for Children (GAC). Haven, the brother of Angelina Jolie, Honorary Chairperson of GAC's Board of Directors, thanked Lugar for his leadership on global HIV/AIDS legislation, children health and nutrition issues, and international adoption policy. 
   According to its website, GAC is a nonpartisan, results-oriented coalition dedicated to advocating for orphans and other vulnerable children in the developing world. Its mission is to increase the level of funding by the governments of the wealthy countries for orphans and other vulnerable children in some of the poorest countries of the world.
   On March 13, 2008, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved the U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act (S. 2731) by a vote of 18-3. The bill was introduced by Sens. Joe Biden (D-DE), Lugar (R-IN), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and John Sununu (R-NH). It expands upon the 5-year-old PEPFAR effort to stem the tide of these diseases worldwide. Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives on April 2, 2008.
   On October 24, 2005, the Senate passed H.R. 1409, the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005, which was the companion bill to S. 350 by Lugar and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA).
   The Assistance for Orphans Act requires the U.S. to develop a comprehensive strategy for providing assistance to orphans and vulnerable children and authorizes the President to support community-based organizations that provide for their basic care. It supports school lunch programs, improved school enrollment by eliminating school fees and inheritance rights of orphans and widows with children.
