SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF DR. CONDOLEEZZA RICE AS SECRETARY OF STATE
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar made the following statement regarding President Bush nominating Dr.  
 Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State: 
   "Condoleezza Rice brings extraordinary talents and a gamut of experiences to her new responsibilities as the next Secretary of State. I share the strong confidence in Dr. Rice that President Bush has expressed by asking the United States Senate to confirm her promptly. As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I will work to expedite her confirmation hearing. 
   "Before President George W. Bush was elected, I enjoyed visits with Dr. Rice at Stanford University meetings chaired by former Secretary of State, George Shultz. Secretary Shultz, who was an early supporter of Gov. Bush, encouraged Dr. Rice's leadership within the Bush foreign policy team. As National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice has been a vital foreign policy confidant to President Bush. 
   "During the past four years, I have been honored to come to the White House, frequently, at the invitation of Dr. Rice to discuss foreign policy and national security issues with her and members of the National Security Council staff. She has asked me to continue that close association, and I look forward to working with her during coming times of daunting challenge and great opportunity to give the best possible counsel to President Bush."
