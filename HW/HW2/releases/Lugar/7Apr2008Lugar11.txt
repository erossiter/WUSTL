SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT
  Today U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the following statement in response to President Bush sending the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement to Congress to ensure a vote this year. 
   "I support the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. This trade agreement would benefit both Americans and Colombians. Its passage would provide new markets for U.S. exporters and additional jobs for U.S. companies, as well as jobs and income for hundreds of thousands of Colombians. Equally important, it will send a strong signal to the region that the United States stands by its friends.
   "However, I am concerned by the politically inhospitable circumstances in which the agreement is being sent to the U.S. Congress. The Colombian free-trade agreement faces stiff opposition because many in Congress believe the Colombian government has not taken sufficient measures to ensure the safety and security of its workers. This opposition could derail its passage this year, setting a negative precedent for the Colombia FTA, as well as for the Panamanian and South Korean free trade agreements.
   "I ask President Bush to work with the Colombian Government to show tangible progress regarding labor practices in Colombia. Without proof in this regard the significant economic and political benefits of the FTA with Colombia could be jeopardized."
