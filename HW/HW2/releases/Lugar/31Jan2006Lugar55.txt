SEN. LUGAR ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF CORETTA KING
  Sen. Dick Lugar made the following statement on the death of Coretta Scott King:  
   "Coretta Scott King participated and witnessed important advances in our history. She was a strong and resolute leader who continued her husband's vital work of moving our nation toward racial equality for all. 
   "I remember well April 4, 1968, when her husband, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was killed in Memphis, Tennessee. As the Mayor of Indianapolis, I understood the importance of Rev. King's work and the tragedy that could befall Indianapolis, as it had in other cities, when news spread of his death. 
   "By coincidence, Robert F. Kennedy was scheduled to be in Indianapolis. His historic speech added to the efforts of local leaders from all groups and allowed our community to emerge without the scars that befell many other cities. 
   "Our thoughts and prayers are with the King family as they celebrate Coretta Scott King's life."
