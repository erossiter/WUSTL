DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ACCEPTING GRANT APPLICATIONS
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that the U.S. Department of Energy is accepting grant applications for research and development for hydrogen production and delivery technology. Grants ranging from $50,000 to $6,300,000 will be awarded.  
   The Department of Energy is requesting applications in the following categories: 
   * Hydrogen compression; 
  * Hydrogen storage for stationary applications and gaseous truck delivery; 
  * Hydrogen liquefaction; and, 
  * Hydrogen production via electrolysis. 
   Lugar supported the Energy Policy Act, which was signed into law by President Bush in 2005 and authorizes $3.7 billion over five years for hydrogen and fuel-cell research, as well as infrastructure to support hydrogen-powered cars. It also creates a hydrogen research program in conjunction with federal labs, universities and auto manufacturers to design hydrogen cars. 
   "The Energy Policy Act represents an important step towards addressing our nation's long-term energy needs," said Lugar. "This landmark legislation will help to modernize America's energy production and distribution systems, encourage conservation and improve our environment and our national security by encouraging the development of clean domestic energy resources."
