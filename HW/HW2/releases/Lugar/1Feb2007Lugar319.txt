SEN. LUGAR CONGRATULATES INTEGRITY BIOFUELS IN MORRISTOWN ON GRANT
  Sen. Dick Lugar congratulated Integrity BioFuels on receipt of a $500,000 USDA Renewable Energy Grant. The check will be presented to Charles "Shorty" Whittington, President, Integrity BioFuels, on Friday, February 2, by Rural Development Under Secretary Thomas Dorr.  
   The grant will be used to help increase production capacity at the facility, which is Central Indiana's first soy biodiesel fuel production facility. 
   "Indiana and our nation can attain a greater degree of energy independence using domestic and renewable resources. Our national security demands that we make the shift quickly. Reaching this goal takes the leadership and innovation being demonstrated at Integrity BioFuels. I have followed its progress with intense interest and am excited by this additional recognition," said Lugar. 
   Integrity Biofuels officially opened August 1, 2006. The grand opening was attended by a member of Lugar's staff. 
   For more than a decade, Lugar has stressed the strategic importance of energy security and the economic and security risks of dependence on imported foreign energy sources. His legislative efforts promote sustainable energy production and use, incentives for renewable fuels like cellulosic ethanol and E85, increased fuel economy in cars, and clean coal. The Lugar Energy Initiative at http://lugar.senate.gov/energy highlights not only the repercussions of America's dangerous dependence on imported oil, but also provides information on energy legislation introduced by Lugar, commentary by outside experts and information on alternative and renewable energy sources.
