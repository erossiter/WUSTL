SEN. LUGAR SHARES FUDGE FROM AMISH ACRES WITH FELLOW SENATORS
  Sen. Dick Lugar hosted the Thursday Club Luncheon for members of the United States Senate on May 25, 2006, highlighting Hoosier Hospitality with food and gifts donated by restaurants and businesses in Indiana.  
   This year's Thursday Club gifts included an assortment of fudge donated by Amish Acres in Nappanee. Amish Acres' eighty-acre historic farm has been named Indiana's number one tourist attraction by Travel Trade Magazine. 
   The lunch hosted by Lugar included breaded tenderloin sandwiches from Gnaw Bone Food and Fuel as the main entree. The sandwiches were served to the senators by owner Beni Clevenger and friends Dennis Sharp, restaurant manager, and Buck Stogdill, Brown County Sheriff, as well as Crystal Blevins and Michael Dunn, active members of the Indiana National Guard. The group prepared the tenderloins prior to the lunch and delivered them to the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The famous tenderloin sandwiches have been featured in Gourmet Magazine and on The Today Show. 
   The Thursday Club Lunch includes 50 members and began as a Wednesday Club with a small group of senators meeting in their personal offices for lunch. Today, senators rotate hosting duties of the weekly lunches, sharing food and gifts that represent their home states.
