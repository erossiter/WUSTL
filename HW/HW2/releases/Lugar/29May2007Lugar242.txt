SEN. LUGAR, AARP INDIANA HOST VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT DAY IN LAFAYETTE
  Sen. Dick Lugar announced that members of his staff and volunteers from AARP Indiana will be interviewing local veterans for the Veterans History Project at the Jenks Community Center, located at 1915 Scott Road in Lafayette.  
   The Veterans History Project has already preserved the memories of more than 7,000 Hoosier veterans in the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. 
   "We are fortunate to have shelves of information about notable figures from the U.S. Military such as Generals Patton and Eisenhower and Admirals Halsey and Spruance," Lugar said. "Histories of the average GI, the men and women who carried the burden of protecting our freedom, are sorely lacking." 
   Veterans interested in participating are encouraged to visit the Jenks Community Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, May 31. Those unable to attend should contact Senator Lugar's office at (317) 226-5555 or at vetproject@lugar.senate.gov 
   "Most Americans have simply lost touch with what it means to serve in the Armed Forces or to serve a cause greater than self. I believe it is important that veterans communicate to the next generation an understanding of the sacrifices and hardships involved in life in the military, which cannot be gained by reading books or watching movies," Lugar added. "I am pleased to work with the Library of Congress to help ensure the memories of Indiana veterans are preserved in this important collection." 
   "These stories are vitally important, and AARP is excited to join with Senator Lugar on this endeavor," said Irene Wegner of AARP Indiana. 
   "The Library of Congress estimates that 1,700 veterans die in this country each day," Lugar noted. "That sobering fact is an important reason Congress began this program, and I am pleased that we can help Hoosiers record and preserve these powerful oral histories."
