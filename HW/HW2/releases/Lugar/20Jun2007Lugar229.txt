SEN. LUGAR CONGRATULATES JEFFERSON AWARD RECIPIENT KATHRYN MARTIN OF EVANSVILLE
  Sen. Dick Lugar congratulated Kathryn Martin of Evansville on Tuesday, June 19, 2007, on receiving a 2007 Jefferson Award for community and public service. In a surprise presentation, Martin was also named one of five people to receive the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting Local Communities.  
  Martin was recognized for her work as an advocate for the safety and welfare of children impacted by disaster. Her 2 year-old son, C.J., along with her husband's mother and grandmother were killed by a tornado which touched down in Evansville in November 2005. Martin subsequently established a fund-raising drive to create C.J.'s bus, a customized support vehicle that will travel to disaster areas across the nation to relieve displaced and distressed children.
  Martin has also helped to draft the proposed legislation known as C.J.'s law. The law would require state-of-the-art storm-weather warning systems in mobile home parks.
  The Jefferson Award was founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, U.S. Sen. Robert Taft, Jr. and Sam Beard. The intent was to create a "Nobel Prize" for community and public service. Since its inception, the Jefferson Awards has recognized citizens exhibiting the highest degree of leadership and service within their state and nation. Annually, 90 community winners from across the country are chosen to receive the Jefferson Award.
  Lois Hess of Fort Wayne also received a 2007 Jefferson Award for her volunteer efforts at both the American Red Cross and the Girl Scouts.
