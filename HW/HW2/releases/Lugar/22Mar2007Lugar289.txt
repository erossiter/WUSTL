SEN. LUGAR MEETS HOOSIER SENATE HISPANIC LEADERSHIP SUMMIT ATTENDEES
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar met earlier this week with Hispanic leaders from Indiana in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Room of the U.S. Capitol Building. The group of Hoosiers were among a total of 38 nominated by Lugar to participate in the Senate Hispanic Leadership Summit on March 20-21 in Washington, DC.  
   The meeting with Lugar provided an opportunity to discuss the Hispanic community in Indiana, immigration, Matricula cards, and the DREAM Act. 
   Throughout the Summit, delegates participated in policy-based discussions with Members of Congress, the Bush Administration and policy experts on issues such as on education, economic growth, entrepreneurs, job creation, immigration reform, financial security, and healthcare. Approximately 400 attendees from across the country participated. Each delegate served at their own cost. 
   Beginning in 2000, Lugar worked with the government of Mexico to establish a diplomatic office in Indianapolis to serve its growing Mexican community, and in 2002 Consul Sergio Aguilera was assigned to Indianapolis. Additionally, Lugar was the first public official to publicly support the State of Indiana accepting Mexican Matricula Cards as valid identification. 
   Lugar is also an original co-sponsor of the DREAM Act, which would allow young, undocumented individuals to work towards permanent status in the United States by obtaining an education and completing national or public service. 
   Lugar has designated Celina A. Weatherwax of his Valparaiso office to coordinate Hispanic outreach for the State of Indiana.
