SEN. LUGAR ASEAN PROPOSAL ENACTED BY ADMINISTRATION
  U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today applauded the Bush Administration decision to establish the position of U.S Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs.  
   "Creating this position expresses the strong support of the United States for strengthening ties between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Throughout the Bush Administration and in the Congress, there is deep appreciation for ASEAN's important ongoing contribution toward peace and stability in the region," Lugar said. 
   In May of this year, Lugar introduced S. 2697, a bill to establish the position of U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs. The measure was unanimously reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee and sent to the Senate Floor on May 25. 
   ASEAN was established in 1967, with an initial membership of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The membership of ASEAN has expanded to 10 countries, which constitute the 3rd largest export market for United States products. 
   Lugar's bill recommends that a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State serve with Ambassadorial rank, subject to advice and consent of the Senate.
