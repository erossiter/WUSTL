SEN. LUGAR MEETS WITH TERRE HAUTE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  Sen. Dick Lugar met with the Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, September 19, 2006. Mayor Kevin Burke led the delegation for their annual visit.  
   The visit also provided Lugar with the opportunity to meet Dr. Gerald Jakubowski, new president of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. 
   Lugar and Chamber members discussed the city's federal correction facilities, efforts to combat methamphetamine, CSX railroad relocation, and the New Business Development Incubator. 
   The Chamber members expressed their thanks to Senator Lugar for his help in bringing two Air National Guard missions to the Hulman Regional Airport Air Guard Station in Terre Haute. The additions will add an Air Support Operations Squadron consisting of approximately 70 personnel and a Distributed Common Ground Station which could require as many as 350 airmen. This was one of the Chamber's top priorities during its 2005 trip to Washington, D.C. 
   In addition, the members thanked Senator Lugar for his ongoing support for the comprehensive meth initiative, railroad relocation and the Cherry Street Project.
