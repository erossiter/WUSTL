SEN. LUGAR COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER HOSTS SMALL BUSINESS SEMINAR
  On April 29 and 30, the Richard G. Lugar Northeast Indiana Community Service Center will sponsor six sessions that address the basics of owning and growing a small business in recognition of National Small Business Week, April 21 to 25, 2008. These events will take place in the auditorium of Mitchell Books in Covington Plaza at 6360 W. Jefferson Blvd., Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
   Seminar sessions include: Considerations for Starting a Small Business, Business Plan Basics, Small Business Financing, Small Business Financing for Military Service Members, and Avoiding Federal Tax Pitfalls for Small Business. Information will be presented by representatives from the Small Business Administration (SBA), Small Business Development Center (SBDC), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), SCORE "Counselors to America's Small Business," and Women's Enterprise.
   "Prior to entering politics, my brother and I ran a small, family-owned company called Thomas L. Green & Co. The company, which was founded by my grandfather in 1893, made food machinery equipment, and was run by family members until it was recently sold. Businesses like Thomas L. Green & Co. keep the economy going by providing all kinds of jobs from the service industries to manufacturing. I hope these seminars will provide Hoosiers with necessary information to start and grow their businesses," said Lugar.
   Pre-registration for this event is not required but seating is limited. For more information or to reserve a seat, please contact the Lugar Community Service Center at 260-422-1505.
   Lugar is a past recipient of the "Small Business Champion" Award from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Spirit of Enterprise award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for support of pro-business issues.
