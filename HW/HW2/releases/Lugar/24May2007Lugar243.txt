SEN. LUGAR SERVES TURKEY STEAKS FROM FARBEST FOODS TO FELLOW SENATORS
  Sen. Dick Lugar hosted the Thursday Club Luncheon for members of the United States Senate on May 24, 2007, highlighting Hoosier Hospitality with food and gifts donated by Indiana restaurants and businesses to celebrate the 91st running of the Indianapolis 500.  
   This year's Thursday Club meal featured braised turkey forestier donated by Farbest Foods in Huntingburg. The company provides fresh and frozen turkey products throughout the world. Farbest Foods President Ted Seger also serves as the Chairman of the National Turkey Federation. 
   The lunch hosted by Lugar also included salad with award winning dressing donated by Holly Hock Hill in Indianapolis. The meal concluded with apple pie a la mode from Das Dutchman Essenhaus in Middlebury. 
   This year's Thursday Club also celebrated the Indy Car Series (ICS) decision to power its open-wheel cars on a 100 percent ethanol. At 17 tracks in the U.S. and around the world, ethanol will be show cased as a high-performance renewable fuel. Such visibility has been an important tool in further educating the public about the merits of ethanol and the growing urgency to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. Senators received model Team Ethanol racecars provided by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to commemorate the shift to ethanol. 
   The Thursday Club includes Republican Senators and began as a Wednesday Club with a small group of senators meeting in their personal offices for lunch. Today, senators rotate hosting duties of the weekly lunches, sharing food and gifts that represent their home states.
