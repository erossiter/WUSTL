SEN. LUGAR RECEIVES MARCH OF DIMES AWARD
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar today received the 2007 March of Dimes Public Affairs Leadership Award. The award recognizes outstanding national leadership by Members of Congress in advancing maternal and child health issues. 
  "We would like to thank you for authoring the Prevent Prematurity and Improve Child Health Act. Your commitment to improve the health of infants and children is an inspiration to all of us at the March of Dimes and our volunteers and staff would like to take this opportunity to offer a small token of recognition for the many ways in which you have improved the lives of mothers and children across the nation," wrote Ken May, Chairman of the Board of the March of Dimes, and Dr. Jennifer Howse, President of the March of Dimes Foundation, in a letter to Lugar.
  On March 7, 2007, Lugar introduced the "Prevent Prematurity and Improve Child Health Act" with Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-AR). The bill would expand and coordinate research on the prevention of preterm birth and the most effective care for preterm babies.
  Lugar has been a consistent supporter of the S-CHIP program and nutrition programs for women and children.
  Lugar and his wife Char are strong supporters of the March of Dimes, an organization committed to improving the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality. Mrs. Lugar, a former member of the national board of directors of the March of Dimes, established an endowed fund for fighting birth defects and infant deaths. The fund includes support for prenatal care provided aboard the "MOM mobile," which tours Indianapolis neighborhoods.
