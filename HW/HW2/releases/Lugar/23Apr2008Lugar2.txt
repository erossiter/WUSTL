$44,000 GRANT AWARDED TO FORT WAYNE FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that Fort Wayne Fire Department will receive a $44,000 grant for fire prevention through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program (AFGP). 
   "The brave men and women who serve as first responders are the backbone of our communities. It is vital that we ensure our fire departments and emergency medical services have the support, equipment and training they require," Lugar said. "I encourage Hoosier fire departments to contact me to explore grant opportunities and ways which we may be helpful."
   The primary goal of AFGP is to meet the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations.
   The U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the AFGP and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
