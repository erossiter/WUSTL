INOUYE ANNOUNCES AIR FORCE FUNDING FOR BROWN TREE SNAKE INTERDICTION  NAVY FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT IMMINENT          INOUYE ANNOUNCES AIR FORCE FUNDING FOR BROWN TREE SNAKE INTERDICTION  NAVY FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT IMMINENT     Wednesday  May 02  2007           For Immediate Release                                           Washington  D C   U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced that the U S  Air Force has sent  1 7 million to the U S  Department of Agricultures Wildlife Services  APHIS WS  to continue brown tree snake interdiction services at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam to guard against the movement of brown tree snakes from Guam to Hawaii    Senator Inouye stated  I am pleased that the Air Force has responded to my request to continue this important interdiction program  The brown tree snake interdiction program on Guam was in danger of being terminated due to the lack of funds from the Department of Defense  DOD  for fiscal year 2007 with the loss of earmarks in the DOD Health accounts  These funds will allow APHIS WS to continue this important aircraft and cargo inspection and control function through September 2007    Inouye further stated  With a substantial increase in the level of activity at Guams Anderson Air Force Base  all reasonable steps must be taken to minimize the inadvertent introduction of brown tree snakes to Hawaii  This is an especially important program for Hawaii because if brown tree snakes were introduced here  it would wreak havoc on Hawaiis fragile environment  I will continue to work with the Defense Department to assure that this program continues  I also expect that the U S  Navy will be making a similar funding announcement in the days ahead to ensure proper interdiction for its property and assets on Guam    I hope this demonstrates that what may appear to be an earmark solely because it was not requested by the President is no less important  In fact  this clearly highlights the role of Congress in addressing the critical needs of a particular home state  in this case  the people of Hawaii and the importance of preserving our beautiful environment     30
