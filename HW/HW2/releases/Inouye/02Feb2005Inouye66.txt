U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE 2005 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS         U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE 2005 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS  February 2  2005 For Immediate Release          WASHINGTON  The following is U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouyes statement on the State of the Union address that the President delivered tonight   The Presidents speech was well prepared  and highly emotional with the presence of Mr  and Mrs  Bill Norwood of Texas  whose son  a Marine  was killed in Fallujah  and Iraqi democracy advocate Safia Taleb al Suhail in the audience   The reaction of the Congress to the Norwoods  I believe  demonstrated the admiration and deep gratitude that all Americans hold for our men and women in uniform who have sacrificed so much while courageously demonstrating their patriotism   The President sounded an optimistic tone in his address  but I am certain he and the Congress will find the months ahead most trying and challenging   Although the President spoke at length on Social Security reform  I noticed that he called it a problem  and not a crisis as he did a year ago   Yes  something needs to be done  but the Congressional Budget Office has said that Social Security is safe   An in depth study of Social Security and how the system will be functioning in future years can be helpful   However  unlike the President  I do not believe that privatization is the answer   Consider  for example  if Social Security had been privatized a few years ago  and the system had invested in the stock of a company like Enron  which at one time was considered a very good investment and whose leading executives were considered friends of the Administration   Yes  prudently invested contributions to the Social Security fund may bring greater dividends  but those contributions would also face a greater risk   It would be like gambling   We should not gamble with the investments and the future of the citizens of this land   Regarding Iraq  I  too  join all Americans in expressing my admiration for the men and women who risked possible retaliation and voted a few days ago   What they did demonstrated courage   However  their participation in the election was just the first step in a long process   I am old enough to recall another election in another country in which we were once deeply involved   It was South Vietnam   We applauded the results and those who voted  despite the threats from the Viet Cong   But the optimism generated from that election was forgotten when we were forced to hastily withdraw from Saigon and South Vietnam   I hope and pray this will not be the case in Iraq   I noticed that the President in his address sidestepped several very important questions  When do we end or reduce our military presence in Iraq   Who will decide when Iraq reaches an appropriate stage of self reliance and self defense   The Presidents speech suggested to me that were we to follow his leadership  we will be in Iraq not for months  but for years   I also hope I am wrong on this   At times  I thought I was hearing a State of the Union speech delivered by a Democratic President   I heard the themes of education for all  affordable health care  and full employment   These are wonderful goals that I support   However  under this Administrations policies  we are faced with a massive deficit   Many of the Presidents proposals are not realistic at this moment   I am ready and prepared to work with the President  but I will not be a rubber stamp for any president   I believe the people of Hawaii elected me to represent them as best as I can  and I intend to do my very best                30
