INOUYE HAILS LEGISLATION THAT SETS NEW DIRECTION FOR IRAQ          INOUYE HAILS LEGISLATION THAT SETS NEW DIRECTION FOR IRAQ     Thursday  April 26  2007           For Immediate Release                                         WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today joined the majority of his colleagues  and voted to pass the Fiscal Year 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill  The measure sets the goal of withdrawing most U S  combat troops from Iraq by March 31  2008    The legislation cleared its final legislative hurdle today when the Senate voted 51 to 47 for its passage  but it faces a threatened veto by the President    I respectfully ask the President to reconsider his veto threat  Senator Inouye said  noting  to cite just a few examples  that the bill appropriates  4 billion more than what the President requested for the Department of Defense   1 2 billion more than what the President sought for mine resistant vehicles  and more resources for soldiers who have suffered traumatic brain injuries    This bill provides the road map for a new direction for the war in Iraq  and it addresses the shortfalls in the Presidents budget request  said Senator Inouye  a combat veteran of World war II who received our nations highest award for military valor  the Medal of Honor  Today our forces are bogged down in Iraq  caught in the middle of a civil war  We need a change of plans  a new direction    This war has dragged on too long  longer than our involvement in World War II  Staying the course isnt working  and I  for one  am not convinced it ever will  The only way we can succeed in Iraq is if the Iraqis fundamentally change the dynamic  The language in the conference agreement which the Senate passed today embraces this idea by offering a new plan    That plan is embodied in the goal of redeploying most of our forces from Iraq by March 31  2008  This is a goal  it doesnt mandate that all the troops are removed  To the contrary  it allows that forces remain in Iraq to protect U S  and coalition personnel    It also stipulates that U S  forces can continue to train and equip the Iraqis  so that they can better defend themselves  and it directs that we may continue counter terrorist operations in Iraq    This is a balanced plan    Senator Inouye added  How many of us still truly believe if we remain in Iraq that we will emerge with a Jeffersonian democracy on the banks of the Tigris River  If Iraq is to succeed  it must assume responsibilities for its own destiny  It must decide if it wants to stop internecine warfare  We cannot do that for them     30
