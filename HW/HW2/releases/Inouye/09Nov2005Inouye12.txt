CONGRESS POISED TO APPROVE  13 MILLION TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION REPAIRS TO KAUMALAPAU HARBOR BREAKWATER         CONGRESS POISED TO APPROVE  13 MILLION TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION REPAIRS TO KAUMALAPAU HARBOR BREAKWATER           November 9  2005        For Immediate Release    WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the Congress is poised to approve the appropriation of  13 million to complete construction repairs to the breakwater of Lanais Kaumalapau Harbor  which will increase harbor safety and usability  The appropriation could clear its last legislative hurdle as early as tomorrow  November 10  2005  when the Senate votes on final approval for this funding measure  This important project keenly illustrates the unique challenges we face as an island state  Senator Inouye said  Lanai is extremely dependent on barge traffic for its supplies  and of its two harbors  only one  Kaumalapau  receives supply carrying barges  But storms that occurred over the past 25 years caused significant damage to the rubble mound breakwater that protects the Kaumalapau Harbor Basin  Once 400 feet long and a decent barrier to rough seas and surge conditions  the breakwater has eroded to half its length  So far   11 7 million in federal funds have been appropriated to this breakwater repair project  The additional  13 million brings the project total to  24 7 million  It is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2006  I am proud of the many years I have worked in support of this project  and to know that it will soon be a reality  It is a triumph over conventional thinking that says you should not spend so much for an island with a resident population of only 3 000  But ocean waters and safe  operational harbors are Lanais lifelines  and the people of Lanai  while few in number  deserve no less than people who have easier access to goods and services  Senator Inouye explained  The Kaumalapau Harbor project is one of the more than 30 Hawaii related initiatives  with funding totaling nearly  30 2 million  in the final version of the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill  The House of Representatives today voted 399 to 19 to give its final approval to the measure  After the Senate gives its final approval  the legislation will move to the White House for the President to sign the bill into law   The other Hawaii initiatives in the bill include telemedicine expansion  flood mitigation  hurricane and typhoon evacuation studies  and environmental restoration projects  I am pleased that these important initiatives for Hawaii were funded during this tight budget year  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  With our nation at war  much of our federal funds are going to support our men and women in uniform on the front lines  As a result  many worthy non military projects are competing for fewer available federal dollars  Here are the Hawaii related projects in the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill  DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Hawaii New Mexico Sustainable Energy Security Partnership  3 million   The funds will be used by the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute and the New Mexico Tech for their efforts to increase electricity reliability and critical infrastructure protection for the nations benefit   The Queens Medical Center Telemedicine Project  500 000   The funds will allow Queens  the states largest hospital  to expand its operating room integration telemedicine technology and to link with the Big Islands North Hawaii Community Hospital  In our island state  timely access to medical expertise and service is a challenge for both hospitals and patients  Senator Inouye said  This is exacerbated when the medical condition is a result of some sort of traumatic event such as a motor vehicle collision  gunshot wound or hiking accident  In terms of survivability  trauma experts around the country define the golden hour of trauma as the 60 minutes that can mean the difference between life and death  These 60 minutes are when fairly severe injuries can still be treated and lives can be saved    ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS Kaumalapau Harbor  13 million   These funds will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to complete construction of the new Kaumalapau Harbor Breakwater on Lanai to reduce wave action in the dock area  and to increase harbor safety and usability  Kikiaola Small Boat Harbor  3 55 million   Kikiaola Harbor is located on the southwest coast of Kauai  between the towns of Kekaha and Waimea  and it has dangerous break wave conditions within the entrance channel  By dredging an entrance and access channels  and modifying existing breakwaters at this State harbor  safe conditions would be created for vessels entering the harbor basin  Hawaii Water Management Project  1 5 million   These funds would be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to continue the construction phases of major irrigation systems in drought stricken regions of the State that were recommended in a study done by the Corps of Engineers and the Hawaii Department of Agriculture  Sacred Falls Beach Park Demonstration Project  1 125 000   The funds will be used to rebuild a 370 foot beach shoreline that has deteriorated and eroded  thereby limiting its usefulness  The project would include a combination of low profile  permeable groins  and offshore breakwaters to abate further erosion  and allow sediment to pass through  resulting in a long term sustained beach  Surge and Wave Island Modeling Studies  750 000   This initiative would continue the development of improved models for predicting hurricane induced maximum water levels and wave run up levels along coasts  Information from variable water levels and wave run up levels along with the correlation in time and event location will help in the planning and design of public works  and assist in hurricane preparedness for island communities  Pacific Island Land Ocean Typhoon Experiment  650 000   U S  mainland models consistently underestimate the storm surge inundation and are not applicable to island environments  Actual hurricane typhoon wave  water level  and meteorological data in an island environment are necessary to continue development of an island based storm surge inundation model  Flood Mitigation  500 000   These funds will be used to initiate the expansion of the Ala Wai Canal feasibility study to include the Manoa  Palolo  and Makiki streams to evaluate flood mitigation measures and prevent future damages of the type that arose from the October 30  2004 flood in Manoa Valley  This feasibility study is the important first step in long term flood mitigation for the work that will be done by the Army Corps of Engineers  Hurricane Typhoon Evacuation Studies  500 000   This funding will be used for refining collected data  including behavioral  hazard  and shelter analysis  and for the development of a Geographic Information System database for hydrographic  topographic  demographic  infrastructure information  Kalaeloa Barbers Point Harbor    Maintenance  208 000   Modification Study  200 000   These funds would be used for feasibility studies for modifications to improve cargo transportation efficiency by enhancing the harbor entrance channel and basin to allow larger  deeper draft vessels to enter the harbor  Additionally  a 375 foot jetty is being proposed to mitigate crosscurrents within the harbor entrance which pose a hazard to navigation  Pelekane Bay  400 000   The goal of this restoration project is to reverse the degradation of the coral reef ecosystem and to improve water quality in the Big Islands Pelekane Bay to conditions that existed prior to the development of the Kawaihae Deep Draft Harbor area  Southeast Oahu Regional Sediment Management    Demonstration Project  400 000   Shoreline erosion threatens upland development and coastal habitat along much of the southeast coast of Oahu  Lanikai  located in the central portion of this area  has lost most  if not all  of the dry beach width that historically provided a buffer to the impacts of storm waves  and offered unique recreation opportunities  These funds will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the complex coastal processes  and promote the development of long term strategies for sediment management  Wailupe Stream Flood Control Study  400 000   This appropriation for the Army Corps of Engineers would be used to continue a project to improve Wailupe Stream on Oahu  Wailupe Stream passes under a bridge on Kalanianaole Highway  and studies and past rainstorms show the bridge is inadequate to accommodate flood waters  This bridge serves approximately 67 000 vehicles daily  and the highway is the only transportation link between East Oahu and the City of Honolulu  Iao Stream Flood Control  375 000   This is an ongoing project to build a levee system that would prevent this stream in Wailuku  Maui  from flooding  Kahoolawe Small Boat Harbor  250 000   This initiative continues the detailed investigation of having a small boat harbor on the Island of Kahoolawe  Kuliouou Stream Flood Damage Reduction Modification Project  250 000   This appropriation is for the feasibility phase of this project  During heavy rainfalls  Kuliouou Stream flood waters reach high levels  and have caused damage to the flood control channel and to private and public property   Mokuhinia Mokuula Ecosystem Restoration Project  220 000   These funds will be used to implement the feasibility phase of this project  It involves the development of wetlands that would provide habitat for endangered and native waterfowl species at a site  which was a home of Hawaiis royalty  Kahana Pond Wildlife Sanctuary Restoration  200 000   This appropriation would continue the environmental feasibility study for the Kanaha Pond Wildlife Sanctuary Restoration Project on Maui  The objective is to improve the habitat by providing more water and water circulation throughout the pond  which was used by early Hawaiians  Kaunakakai Stream Environmental Restoration Project  200 000   This project would restore habitat for the native endangered Hawaiian Stilt bird by creating 2 75 acres of shallow ponds and wetlands within Kaunakakai Stream  Waiakea Stream Flood Damage Reduction Project  200 000   This appropriation would be used to determine the flood zone  review design alternatives  and for environmental documentation  Rapid runoffs have damaged roads  homes  bridges  and drainage systems  and personal property  North Kohala Navigational Improvements  150 000   Funding would be used to determine navigational improvements for North Kohala  The area has lacked improved boat launching facilities for commercial and recreational boat use for many years  Wailele Stream Flood Damage Reduction Project  150 000   The funds would be used to initiate the engineering and design phase for this project  The study was requested following a flood in March 1991 that caused approximately  700 000 in damages to 300 homes  public facilities  and the Brigham Young University Hawaii campus in Laie  Hilo Bay Water Quality Model   125 000   Water quality and circulation problems plague Hilo Bay and the Port of Hilo  These funds will be used to develop a computer model to help the County of Hawaii and the Army Corps of Engineers determine whether there are viable alternatives to improving circulation and water quality without interfering with or degrading the operations of the Port of Hilo or Bayfront Highway  Kawaihae Deep Draft Harbor Modifications   100 000   This appropriation would continue the feasibility studies on modifications to the harbor  which is expected to have greater use as a possible future inter island ferry destination  Wave surges within the harbor contribute to operating inefficiencies and damage vessels and piers  Nawiliwili Deep Draft Harbor  100 000   The funding will continue the investigations under the feasibility phase of the Nawiliwili Deep Draft Harbor project on Kauai  It includes technical modeling of the harbor to determine the various design alternative and environmental documentation  Nawiliwili Bay is subject to prevailing trade winds that attain high velocities and result in high seas and swells  Palai Stream Flood Damage Reduction Project  100 000   The funds would be used to continue the feasibility phase of this project  There has been significant damage to roads  residences  bridges  drainage systems  and private property due to flooding of Palai Stream  Kawainui Marsh Environmental Restoration Project  10 000   This funding allows the Corps of Engineers to continue working with the City and County of Honolulu and State of Hawaii to execute a local sponsor agreement which is needed for the Kawainui Marsh Restoration Project to proceed  The total construction cost is estimated at  5 million   Failure to reach an agreement between the City and State regarding the land transfer and a maintenance agreement resulted in a significant funding reduction  Senator Inouye said  I am hopeful that a compromise will be reached between the government entities whereby each would share in the maintenance responsibilities  Such a comprise could include the State taking the marsh land and the levee and the City agreeing to continue to maintain the canal  This token federal funding keeps the Army Corps at the table as this compromise is worked out  I hope we are able to do so  and thereby allow us to proceed with a much more substantial funding request next year  BUREAU OF RECLAMATION Hawaiian Reclaim and Reuse Study  500 000   This appropriation will be used by the Bureau of Reclamation to work with local authorities in Hawaii to investigate and identify opportunities for reclamation and reuse of municipal  industrial  domestic  and agricultural wastewater  and naturally impaired ground and surface waters and to design and construct demonstration and permanent facilities to reclaim and reuse such waters and to carry out needed improvements specified in the Hawaii Water Management Study  Other Hawaii related initiatives in the bill  General Investigations   Kahuku  Oahu  100 000 Operations and Maintenance   Project Condition Surveys  180 000   Inspections of Completed Works  170 000   Pohiki Bay  90 000   30
