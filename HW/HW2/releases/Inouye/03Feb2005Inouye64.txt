STATEMENT OF U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE NOMINATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES FOR U S  ATTORNEY GENERAL         STATEMENT OF U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE NOMINATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES FOR U S  ATTORNEY GENERAL  February 3  2005 For Immediate Release          WASHINGTON  The nomination by President George W  Bush of Mr  Alberto Gonzales to serve as the Attorney General of the United States has stirred strong opposition   Although my first instinct is to support the prerogative of any president to select his own cabinet  I have concluded upon a thorough review of Mr  Gonzales record that I must oppose his nomination   The Constitution confides in the Senate the duty of Advice and Consent   This means that my colleagues and I have the responsibility of considering the men and women the President nominates for high government offices  and either confirming or rejecting them   Although many consider Advice and Consent to be a Senate right  I think of it as a duty that carries an obligation of fairness and due diligence   The power to reject a nominee should only be invoked where there is substantial doubt as to a nominees fitness for office  not when there is a simple difference in political philosophy   I do not personally agree with some of the positions that Mr  Gonzales has advocated  but that should come as no surprise  because I do not agree with many of the proposals made by the man who nominated him  President Bush   Most strikingly  I am appalled that he has professed only a vague knowledge of the racial and ethnic disparities in the imposition of the death penalty in federal cases   These very disparities in the State of Hawaiis penal system led me to champion the abolition of the death penalty in our territorial legislature many years ago  and I have remained opposed to this ultimate and irreversible sentence ever since   Our philosophical disagreement over issues such as the death penalty does not  in my mind  constitute a sufficient basis for opposing his nomination   His lack of candor and forthrightness in answering simple questions about his record does   A January 2002 memorandum from Mr  Gonzales to the President advocated abandoning the Geneva Convention and its prohibitions on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war   As a former officer in our nations military  I find this conclusion horrifying and repugnant   As a United States Senator  I find Mr  Gonzales refusal to clarify his role in the subsequent development of a U S  policy for torturing POWs inexcusable   His decision  supported by the refusal of the Bush Administration to turn over key documents  to stonewall efforts to bring this matter to the light of public scrutiny strikes to the very foundation of our nations democratic government   Our citizens have a right to openness and transparency in their public officials   Clandestine maneuvers under the ever growing cloak of national security and executive privilege disenfranchises the electorate and deprives them of the information they need in order to make their choices at the polls   Mr  Gonzales failure to respond to questions legitimately posed to him by the Senate raises grave doubts in my mind as to his fitness to serve the people of the United States as their Attorney General   Mr  Bush may have the privilege of choosing his own team for his cabinet  but American citizens have an unqualified right to be served by public officials who will answer candidly for their actions   Accordingly  I must reluctantly oppose this nomination                   30
