KEY SENATE PANEL APPROVES FUNDING FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL VISITOR CENTER         KEY SENATE PANEL APPROVES FUNDING FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL VISITOR CENTER              June 9  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee today unanimously approved legislation that provides more than  20 4 million for Hawaii related projects  including  1 69 million for the replacement of the USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center   We  as a nation  must not forget the bravery and sacrifice of the Americans who served on the USS Arizona and other ships in Pearl Harbor on December 7  1941   The USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center represents our commitment to always honor those special Americans  said Senator Inouye  who  as a 17 year old with medical aid training  rushed into service as the head of a first aid team on that historic day    Senator Inouye  who during World War II enlisted in the U S  Armys 442nd Regimental Combat Team  and who was awarded the nations highest award for military valor  the Medal of Honor  added   The current USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center Headquarters complex was built 25 years ago   It is deteriorating rapidly  and engineers have given it a life expectancy of four to nine years   The Visitor Center was designed to accommodate 750 000 people annually  but in recent years the actual number is double what had been projected   This appropriations measure also includes language that will help the National Park Service meet the challenges of running the USS Arizona Memorial   Although visitors are not charged for their experiences at this historic site  revenues generated from parking fees would be a welcome supplement to the National Park Services limited budget   Therefore  requested language has been included in the legislation that would permit the use of parking fees for the lease of administrative buildings to support the Memorial   The Hawaii initiatives  which also include national park expansion  environmental and native species protection  and brown tree snake detection  are part of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2006 that now moves to the full Senate for consideration     I am pleased that my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee  given the many competing demands for federal resources in this tight budget year  joined me in supporting these projects that are important for Hawaii  Senator Inouye said    In addition to the  20 4 million for individual Hawaii initiatives  the bill jointly appropriates  30 million to Hawaii  Guam  and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands for impacts from the Compacts of Free Association   Citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia  the Republic of the Marshall Islands  and Palau come to Hawaii to take advantage of the many opportunities we have  Senator Inouye said   While we welcome our fellow islanders  their needs place added burdens on our social service providers   Compact impact aid helps the State to meet the increased demand for social services    The following are the individual Hawaii related initiatives in the Interior appropriations bill   Expansion of Haleakala National Park  4 05 million  This project would expand the Haleakala National Park into lands currently owned by the Campbell Estate  which could be restored to high conservation value koa forest land   A second parcel in this project  currently owned by the Estate of Cordelia May  is thought to hold Hawaiian archaeological sites   Kalaupapa National Historic Park       3 779 000  These funds would be used to replace non compliant cesspools in the Kalaupapa Historic Park  ensuring that this facility will continue to be a haven for the remaining Hansens disease suffers who reside there   Wao Kele o Puna          3 4 million  The 25 856 acre Wao Kele o Puna tract is one of the last large intact lowland native Hawaiian forests in the State of Hawaii  providing habitat for more than 200 endemic and native species   The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service Hawaii Native Forest Birds Recovery Plan cited this land as one of the few areas where the latest sightings of the Ou occurred   The Ou is a forest bird that was last seen on the island of Hawaii in 1987 and is feared extinct   Some people believe the bird still exists within this vast parcel   Wao Kele o Puna is also extremely important to water quality on the island   The forested tract covers nearly 20 percent of the watershed that feeds the Pahoa aquifer  the single largest water source on Hawaii   It also serves as a critical seed bank for native forest regeneration of the barren lava flows that have recently covered large swaths of the nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   Brown Tree Snake          2 7 million  The requested funding for this program in FY 2006 will support the cooperative efforts of the U S  Departments of Agriculture  Defense  Transportation  and the Interior  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  the Territory of Guam  and the State of Hawaii   Funds will be used to   Evaluate and improve brown tree snake control products including toxicants  repellents  fumigants  sterilants  attractants  artificial baits  and aerial delivery of control products  increase and improve methods of detection  monitoring and control through rapid response plans  canine teams  controlling pathways  barrier installation  and trapping amongst others  create and maintain areas to protect endangered species and other wildlife from the brown tree snake  and prevent the introduction of a new brown tree snake prey species  coqui frog  to Guam  this invasive frog species was introduced to Hawaii in recent years via imported nursery plants    Replacement of USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center    1 69 million This project is to replace the existing USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center Headquarters with two separate facilities   The replacement Visitor Center complex will be a single story multi structure facility of approximately 23 600 square feet   It will provide space for all essential visitor services  a museum  two theaters  bookstore  a classroom  and security   A mix of exterior and interior spaces in the new Visitor Center will be used to reduce air conditioned space and long term costs   Support space for the National Park Service and the Arizona Memorial Museum Association staff will be minimal with their main offices and storage in a separate Headquarters facility   The Headquarters facility will be approximately 10 700 square feet and will accommodate all support functions and curatorial storage   Hakalau NWR  Alala Recovery and Restoration     1 1 million The Kona Forest Unit of the Hakalau National Wildlife Refuge is within the last known occupied habitat of the alala   Although the Fish and Wildlife Service and State of Hawaii are looking at several potential reintroduction sites for alala when sufficient birds are available for release from captivity  it is highly likely that the Kona Forest Unit will be a suitable release site when its habitat has been restored through the construction of fencing under this initiative   In the 1990s  several captive raised alala were released into the wild in South Kona  but for various reasons  including high rates of predation  mortality from disease  and suboptimal habitat conditions most of the birds did not survive   Eliminating feral ungulates from Kona Forest will allow regrowth of the understory plants that provide food and cover for the alala  greatly enhancing their chances of survival   Cesspool Management         1 million  Federal funding for this program will allow the Counties of Honolulu  Hawaii  and Kauai to continue their statewide project of replacing cesspool systems with septic systems  bringing these Counties into compliance with EPA guidelines   This effort will benefit low  and moderate income communities that are unable to absorb the cost of removing their cesspool systems and replacing them with septic tanks   Standardizing the community system with septic tanks will improve wastewater treatment and protect the communitys drinking water   Native Hawaiian Culture and the Arts Program     750 000 This programs efforts are focused on assisting Hawaiians to be practitioners of their culture in a rapidly changing multicultural world   Four priorities support these efforts  increase access to resources  provide opportunities to learn and practice  provide opportunities to celebrate the culture  and create partnerships to enhance the programs efforts   The four priorities are achieved through a network of Cultural Learning Centers linked electronically to a Resource Center at the Bishop Museum   Funding will support a new partnership between the Bishop Museum and the Honolulu Symphony to create a music enrichment program targeted to Native Hawaiian children  and communities and public schools serving a large number of Native Hawaiian children   Hawaii Endangered Bird Conservation Program  Operations   550 000 From 1993 to the end of 2004  a total of 1 780 eggs from 13 Hawaiian bird species have been managed by the Hawaii Endangered Bird Conservation Program at the state of the art Keauhou Bird Conservation Center  KBCC  and the Maui Bird Conservation Center  MBCC    Of this total  830 eggs have been estimated to be viable  from which 667 chicks have hatched and 582 survived to fledge   This is a record of 80  hatchability and 87  survivability of chicks to 30 days of age  or approximately to the age of fledging   The program has clearly demonstrated that the techniques exist to propagate and maintain the species of Hawaiian avifauna in captivity  Although captive propagation alone does not offer a simple  singular solution to extinction  it plays a key role in endangered species recovery by creating a species bank account that can be used to reestablish species into historical habitat that has undergone rehabilitation  restoration and management   Big Island Recycling         500 000 Federal funding will allow the Hawaii Island Economic Development Board  HIEDB  to continue developing and implementing a sustainable  community based waste recycling and reuse system on the Big Island   The project has been very successful  diverting more than 1 000 tons of recyclable goods due to effective community outreach and education programs on recycling  arts and handicrafts  composting  and equipment repair and maintenance   HIEDB plans to bring this project into self sustainability and launch a new project in the resort costs of North Kohala and Lower Puna to involve area hotels and resorts in recycling   Federal funding will permit HIEDB to construct a facility for stream sorting  disaster mitigation  an adjacent facility for reuse recycling  and the facility may include a construction and demolition yard   Exploratory Wells and Hydrological Data Collection     450 000 Since 1993  the U S  Geological Survey has carried out an exploratory drilling program in Hawaii   During this period  approximately 30 monitoring wells across the state have been drilled   These wells have permitted a more detailed assessment of water resources in many areas   The data collected have been used to revise fundamental concepts regarding the movement of ground water in volcanic areas  and to help clarify issues relating to the effects of groundwater development on the preservation of stream flow and the protection of Native Hawaiian cultural practices   The wells have also allowed the counties to address the increasingly stringent federal regulation of water purveyors by defining groundwater surface water relations and developing a regional understanding of groundwater sources in relation to potential contamination sources   University of Hawaii Volcanic Processes Study     450 000  This funding would support the cooperative partnership between Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory and the University of Hawaii Center for Study of Active Volcanoes   In addition to the basic activities of the partnership  the additional funding will be used to acquire and install better monitoring equipment on Mauna Loa  and recruit entry level seismologists to ensure that Hawaii will have a continuous community of scientists and professionals at the Observatory           30
