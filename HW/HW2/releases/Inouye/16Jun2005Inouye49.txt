KEY SENATE PANEL APPROVES  13 MILLION TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION REPAIRS TO KAUMALAPAU HARBOR BREAKWATER         KEY SENATE PANEL APPROVES  13 MILLION TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION REPAIRS TO KAUMALAPAU HARBOR BREAKWATER              June 16  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  The Senate Appropriations Committee today unanimously approved the appropriation of  13 million to complete construction repairs to the breakwater of Lanais Kaumalapau Harbor  which will increase harbor safety and usability  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced   This important project keenly illustrates the unique challenges we face as an island state  Senator Inouye said   Lanai is extremely dependent on barge traffic for its supplies  and of its two harbors  only one  Kaumalapau  receives supply carrying barges   But storms that occurred over the past 25 years caused significant damage to the rubble mound breakwater that protects the Kaumalapau Harbor Basin   Once 400 feet long and a decent barrier to rough seas and surge conditions  the breakwater has eroded to half its length   Contractors who feared that the harbors waters were becoming less safe had threatened to halt their delivery of goods and services to Lanai   They should be happy to know that the projects completion date has been accelerated to October of next year   So far   11 7 million in federal funds have been appropriated to this breakwater repair project   Kaumalapau Harbor has no distinct entrance channel  it has a 600 foot wide opening at the mouth of the bay leading to a 10 acre berthing area   I am proud of the many years I have worked in support of this project  and to know that it may soon be a reality  Senator Inouye explained   It is a triumph over conventional thinking that says you should not spend so much for an island with a resident population of only 3 000   But ocean waters and safe  operational harbors are Lanais lifelines  and the people of Lanai  while few in number  deserve no less than people who have easier access to goods and services   The Kaumalapau Harbor project is one of the more than 30 Hawaii related initiatives  with funding totaling nearly  36 million  in the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved today     The other Hawaii initiatives in the bill include telemedicine expansion  flood mitigation  hurricane typhoon evacuation studies  and environmental restoration projects   I am pleased that these important initiatives for Hawaii were funded during this tight budget year  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   With our nation at war  much of our federal funds are going to support our men and women in uniform on the front lines   As a result  many worthy non military projects are competing for fewer available federal dollars   The measure will now be sent to the full Senate for approval   After passage by the Senate  any differences between the House and Senate versions will be resolved by the House Senate Conference Committee   The conference version of the appropriations legislation will be sent to the House and Senate for their final approval  then transmitted to the White House for the Presidents signature     Here are the Hawaii related projects in the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY  Hawaii New Mexico Sustainable Energy Security Partnership   5 million The funds would be used by the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute and the New Mexico Tech for their efforts to increase electricity reliability and critical infrastructure protection for the nations benefit    The Queens Medical Center Telemedicine Project     500 000 The funds would allow Queens  the States largest hospital  to expand its operating room integration telemedicine technology and to link with the Big Islands North Hawaii Community Hospital   In our island state  timely access to medical expertise and service is a challenge for both hospitals and patients  Senator Inouye said   This is exacerbated when the medical condition is a result of some sort of traumatic event such as a motor vehicle collision  gunshot wound or hiking accident   In terms of survivability  trauma experts around the country define the golden hour of trauma as the 60 minutes that can mean the difference between life and death   These 60 minutes are when fairly severe injuries can still be treated and lives can be saved    ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS  Kaumalapau Harbor         13 million These funds will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to complete construction of the new Kaumalapau Harbor Breakwater on Lanai to reduce wave action in the dock area  and to increase
