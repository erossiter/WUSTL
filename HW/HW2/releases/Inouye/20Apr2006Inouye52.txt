INOUYE SECURES  600 000 TO REPAIR IRRIGATION SYSTEM VITAL TO FARMERS ON OAHUS NORTH SHORE          INOUYE SECURES  600 000 TO REPAIR IRRIGATION SYSTEM VITAL TO FARMERS ON OAHUS NORTH SHORE           April 20  2006        For Immediate Release                    WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the U S  Department of Agriculture will release  600 000 to repair portions of a 100 year old irrigation system that is vital to farmers on the North Shore of Oahu  The federal funds  coupled with more than  900 000 in cash and materials from Kamehameha Schools and Dole Foods  will be used to repair the Helemano Siphon and selected pumps  Once the repairs are completed  10 million gallons of water will again flow to the North Shore  Senator Inouye said    Kamehameha Schools and the parent company of Dole Foods  Castle and Cooke  own the land on which the irrigation system rests    Senator Inouye added  I am well aware that the North Shore community  especially its agricultural sector  is highly dependent on the efficient functioning and operation of the irrigation ditch system that begins with water stored at Lake Wilson  Recent failures in the distribution system have greatly limited the activities of North Shore growers during the past several months    I am pleased that the Department of Agriculture concluded that there were compelling reasons for my request for assistance  I also commend Kamehameha Schools  Dole Foods  and the North Shore Chamber of Commerce for their commitment and leadership in working together to ensure that the essential repairs to the irrigation system will be made    When sugar reigned as Hawaiis leading industry  Waialua Sugar leased nearly 20 000 acres on the North Shore from Kamehameha Schools and Castle and Cooke for sugar production  and built and maintained a water carriage system  But in 1996  Waialua Sugar closed  As new tenants were found to farm the land  water resources became strained  Problems came to a head last year when the Helemano Siphon  which carries Lake Wilson water from Kamehameha Highway to the Opaeula and Waimea ridges  broke  When efforts were made to fix the siphon  other weak areas in the system were discovered  Water trucks and hydrant water had to be used as a temporary solution     30
