INOUYE COMMENTS ON EARMARKS  AS A SENATE PANEL APPROVES  153 MILLION FOR HAWAII PROJECTS          INOUYE COMMENTS ON EARMARKS  AS A SENATE PANEL APPROVES  153 MILLION FOR HAWAII PROJECTS     Thursday  June 21  2007           For Immediate Release          WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today commented on earmarks  as the Senate Appropriations Committee approved nearly  153 million for Hawaii related projects    In recent months  there has been much discussion about so called pork barrel spending  with the implication that any congressional add on  or earmark  to the fiscal year budget is a waste of taxpayers money  So called watchdog groups insist that anything that is not proposed by the President is wasteful    I reflected on that position  which I believe to be misguided  when the Senate Appropriations Committee today approved two bills that provide nearly  153 million for Hawaii related initiatives in Fiscal Year 2008  Of that total  one of the bills appropriates  134 8 million for health  education  and social service programs for Hawaii  and nearly  55 6 million of that amount will directly benefit Native Hawaiians    The other spending bill  for the Department of Interior  provides more than  18 1 million for Hawaii  including more than  4 5 million for the replacement of the USS Arizona Visitor Center at Pearl Harbor  and nearly  2 7 million for the brown tree snake interdiction program    Most of the Hawaii related appropriations in those two measures are the result of my earmarks  And  as has happened in the past  some White House projects  such as the replacement of USS Arizona Visitor Center  began in my office    Lawmakers play a key role in addressing the unique needs of their home state  Just because a funding request was not made by the President does not mean that the request is without merit    As the senior member of the Hawaii Congressional Delegation  I am sensitive to the standing Native Hawaiians have in their own land  Native Hawaiians  through their history  culture  and traditions  have imbued Hawaii with a special openness and warmth that has made our islands the most unique and welcoming place in the world  But modern day Hawaii has not treated its First Citizens well  Federal initiatives  particularly in the fields of education and health  provide a strong foundation for the well being of Hawaiis native people  I am proud to be the sponsor of those earmarks    Earlier this year  the important program to prevent brown tree snakes from entering snake free Hawaii was nearly jeopardized as a result of the previous Congressional leaderships failure to pass in a timely manner funding legislation for the current fiscal year  There was a public outcry in Hawaii  Members of the delegation heard it  too  And the people of Hawaii turned to the delegation for help    Fortunately  bridge funding was arranged  And  I am proud to report  for Fiscal Year 2008  the Senates spending plan includes nearly  2 7 million to continue the brown tree snake interdiction program    The people of Hawaii know it is essential that brown tree snakes be kept out of Hawaii to protect Hawaiis fragile environment  which has many of the worlds endangered plants and animals  We must prevent brown tree snakes  which have caused extensive damage in Guam  from ever finding a home in Hawaii    The fight to secure congressional add ons will be more difficult now  given the current mood against earmarks  I hope this will be temporary  Having only one branch of government or a one size fits all formula to determine the needs of individual states is not in the best interest of Hawaii or the United States    I remain strongly convinced that it is my responsibility to do my best to ensure that the needs of Hawaiis residents are brought to the attention of the Congress  and  to the greatest extent possible  addressed  and satisfied  This is a responsibility that I will continue to take seriously     The following are the

approved today   Expansion of James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge  5 000 000  The acquisition of additional lands would restore historical wetland habitat and form the largest managed freshwater wetland on Oahu  It would connect the two existing units and create a protected flyway between them to provide essential habitat for both the four endangered waterbird species and migratory waterbirds  Protecting this coastal dune ecosystem would preserve native strand plants and protect coastal wildlife  such as threatened sea turtles  seabirds  migratory shorebirds  and possibly even the endangered Hawaiian monk seal  With these additional lands  support facilities could be constructed in order to sponsor environmental education and interpretation programs  visitor services  and habitat management programs  Additionally bringing these lands under a conservation regime would allow for better development of flood plain control  minimizing damaging floods to neighboring  populated areas  Replacement of USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center  4 545 000 This project is to replace the existing USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center Headquarters with two separate facilities  The replacement Visitor Center complex will be a single story multi structure facility of approximately 23 600 square feet  It will provide space for all essential visitor services  a museum  two theaters  bookstore  a classroom  and security  A mix of exterior and interior spaces in the new Visitor Center will be used to reduce air conditioned space and long term costs  Support space for the National Park Service and the Arizona Memorial Museum Association staff will be minimal with their main offices and storage in a separate Headquarters facility  The Headquarters facility will be approximately 10 700 square feet and will accommodate all support functions and curatorial storage  Brown Tree Snake Control  2 673 000 The requested funding for this program will support the cooperative efforts of the U S  Departments of Agriculture  Defense  Transportation  and the Interior  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  the Territory of Guam  and the State of Hawaii

products  increase and improve methods of detection  monitoring and control through rapid response plans  canine teams  controlling pathways  barrier installation  and trapping amongst others  create and maintain areas to protect endangered species and other wildlife from the brown tree snake  and prevent the introduction of a new brown tree snake prey species  coqui frog  to Guam  this invasive frog species was introduced to Hawaii in recent years via imported nursery plants    Kealakekua Ranch  1 989 000  The Kealakekua Ranch project is a 9 000 acre easement acquisition on an 11 814 acre property on the western slope of Mauna Loa in South Kona on the Big Island  The property contains many different forest types  including mixed open forest  closed ohia lehua rainforest  open koa

transaction   Improved Stream Modeling and Well Monitoring  1 000 000  Since 1993  the U S  Geological Survey has carried out an exploratory drilling program in Hawaii  During this period  approximately 30 monitoring wells across the state have been drilled  These wells have permitted a more detailed assessment of water resources in many areas  The data collected have been used to revise fundamental concepts regarding the movement of ground water in volcanic areas  and to help clarify issues relating to the effects of groundwater development on the preservation of stream flow and the protection of Native Hawaiian cultural practices  The wells have also allowed the counties to address the increasingly stringent federal regulation of water purveyors be defining groundwater surface water relations and developing a regional understanding of groundwater sources in relation to potential contamination sources   Fencing for the Hakalau National Wildlife Refuge  900 000 The Kona Forest of the Hakalau National Wildlife Refuge is within the last known occupied habitat of the alala  Although the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and State of Hawaii are looking at several potential reintroduction states for alala when sufficient birds are available for release from captivity  it is highly likely that the Kona Forest will be a suitable release site when its habitat has been restored through the construction of fencing through this appropriation  This will complete the fence building in Hakalau   Aid to the State of Hawaii for Invasive Species  700 000 With this funding  the Fish and Wildlife Services could increase its ability to deal with invasive species within the state by providing federal matching funds for new state invasive species initiatives through the Hawaii Invasive Species Council  providing funding to continue support of collaborative  interagency  and community based initiatives to control invasive species on a county level  and by providing funding for high priority projects that address the control of specific established or incipient invasive species in Hawaii  such as miconia   Experimental Tropical Forest  685 000 The Hawaii Experimental Tropical Forest will be established this year  Two experimental Forest Units located on the Big Island are among the largest and most biologically diverse experimental forests in
