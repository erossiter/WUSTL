HAWAII TO RECEIVE OVER  14 MILLION FOR INTERIOR RELATED INITIATIVES         HAWAII TO RECEIVE OVER  14 MILLION FOR INTERIOR RELATED INITIATIVES              August 4  2005        For Immediate Release  Washington  D C   U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that Hawaii will receive over  14 million for 10 projects that include national park expansion  environmental and native species protection  and brown tree snake detection   The Hawaii initiatives are part of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2006 that became public law earlier this week     Given the many competing demands for federal resources in this tight budget year when our nation is at war  I am pleased that important Interior related programs in Hawaii were funded  Senator Inouye said   As a result  we will be able to expand the Haleakala National Park  which is both a State and national treasure  and preserve the Big Islands Wao Kele o Puna  one of the last large intact lowland Native Hawaiian forests in the State of Hawaii that is home to more than 200 endemic and native species   Under the new funding law  we are also able to continue the vital work of preventing the brown tree snake from entering Hawaii   In addition to the  14 million for individual Hawaii initiatives  the bill appropriates  30 million to be divided between Hawaii  Guam  and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for impacts caused from the Compacts of Free Association   Citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia  the Republic of the Marshall Islands  and Palau come to Hawaii to take advantage of our many opportunities  Senator Inouye said   While we welcome our fellow islanders  their needs place added burdens on our social service providers   Compact Impact Aid helps the State to meet the increased demand for social services    The following are the individual Hawaii related initiatives in the Interior appropriations law   Expansion of Haleakala National Park  3 7 million This project expands the Haleakala National Park into lands currently owned by the Campbell Estate  which could be restored to high conservation value koa forest land   A second parcel in this project  currently owned by the Estate of Cordelia May  is thought to hold Hawaiian archaeological sites   Wao Kele o Puna   3 4 million The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service Hawaii Native Forest Birds Recovery Plan cited the nearly 26 000 acre Wao Kele o Puna as one of the few areas where the latest sightings of the ou occurred   The ou is a forest bird that was last seen on the Island of Hawaii in 1987 and is feared extinct   Some people believe the bird still exists within this vast parcel   Wao Kele o Puna is also extremely important to water quality on the island   The forested tract covers nearly 20 percent of the watershed that feeds the Pahoa aquifer  the single largest water source on the Big Island   It also serves as a critical seed bank for native forest regeneration of the barren lava flows that have recently covered large swaths of the nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   Brown Tree Snake   2 7 million The funding for this program in FY 2006 will support the cooperative efforts of the U S  Departments of Agriculture  Defense  Transportation  and the Interior  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  the Territory of Guam  and the State of Hawaii   Funds will be used to   evaluate and improve brown tree snake control products including toxicants  repellants  fumigants  sterilants  attractants  artificial baits  and aerial delivery of control products  increase and improve methods of detection  monitoring and control through rapid response plans  canine teams  controlling pathways  barrier installation  and traps  create and maintain areas to protect endangered species and other wildlife from the brown tree snake  and support the control of the coqui frog which was introduced to Hawaii in recent years via imported nursery plants   Cesspool Management   1 million Federal funding for this program will allow the Counties of Honolulu  Hawaii  and Kauai to continue their statewide project of replacing cesspool systems with septic systems  bringing these Counties into compliance with EPA guidelines   This effort will benefit low  and moderate income communities that are unable to absorb the cost of removing their cesspool systems and replacing them with sceptic tanks   Standardizing the community system with sceptic tanks will improve wastewater treatment and protect the communitys drinking water   Hakalau NWR  Alala Recovery and Restoration  700 000 The Kona Forest Unit of the Hakalau National Wildlife Refuge is within the last known occupied habitat of the alala   Although the Fish and Wildlife Service and State of Hawaii are looking at several potential reintroduction sites for alala when sufficient birds are available for release from captivity  it is highly likely that the Kona Forest Unit will be a suitable release site when its habitat has been restored through the construction of fencing under this initiative   In the 1990s  several captive raised alala were released into the wild in South Kona  but for various reasons  including high rates of predation  mortality from disease  and suboptimal habitat conditions most of the birds did not survive   Eliminating feral ungulates from Kona Forest will allow regrowth of the understory plants that provide food and cover for the alala  greatly enhancing their chances of survival   Native Hawaiian Culture and the Arts Program  600 000 This programs efforts are focused on assisting Hawaiians to be practitioners of their culture in a rapidly changing multicultural world   Four priorities support these efforts   increase access to resources  provide opportunities to learn and practice  provide opportunities to celebrate the culture  and create partnerships to enhance the programs efforts   The four priorities are achieved through a network of Cultural Learning Centers linked electronically to a Resource Center at the Bishop Museum    Hawaii Endangered Bird Conservation Program  Operations  550 000 From 1993 to the end of 2004  a total of 1 780 eggs from 13 Hawaiian bird species have been managed by the Hawaii Endangered Bird Conservation Program at the state of the art Keauhou Bird Conservation Center  KBCC  and the Maui Bird Conservation Center  MBCC    Of this total  830 eggs have been estimated to be viable  from which 667 chicks have hatched and 582 survived to fledge   This is a record of 80  hatchability and 87  survivability of chicks to 30 days of age  or approximately to the age of fledging   The program has clearly demonstrated that the techniques exist to propagate and maintain the species of Hawaiian avifauna in captivity   Although captive propagation alone does not offer a simple  singular solution to extinction  it plays a key role in endangered species recovery by creating a species bank account that can be used to reestablish species into historical habitat that has undergone rehabilitation  restoration and management   Big Island Recycling   500 000 Federal funding will allow the Hawaii Island Economic Development Board  HIEDB  to continue developing and implementing a sustainable  community based waste recycling and reuse system on the Big Island   The project has been very successful  diverting more than 1 000 tons of recyclable goods due to effective community outreach and education programs on recycling  arts and handicrafts  composting  and equipment repair and maintenance   HIEDB plans to bring this project into self sustainability and launch a new project in the resort coasts of North Kohala and Lower Puna to involve area hotels and resorts in recycling   Federal funding will permit HIEDB to construct a facility for stream sorting  disaster mitigation  an adjacent facility for reuse recycling  and the facility may include a construction and demolition yard   Exploratory Wells and Hydrological Data Collection  450 000 Since 1993  the U S  Geological Survey has carried out an exploratory drilling program in Hawaii   During this period  approximately 30 monitoring wells across the State have been drilled   These wells have permitted a more detailed assessment of water resources in many areas   The data collected have been used to revise fundamental concepts regarding the movement of ground water in volcanic areas  and to help clarify issues relating to the effects of groundwater development on the preservation of stream flow and the protection of Native Hawaiian cultural practices   The wells have also allowed the counties to address the increasingly stringent federal regulation of water purveyors by defining groundwater surface water relations and developing a regional understanding of groundwater sources in relation to potential contamination sources   University of Hawaii Volcanic Processes Study  450 000 This funding will support the cooperative partnership between Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory and the University of Hawaii Center for Study of Active Volcanoes   In addition to the basic activities of the partnership  the additional funding will be used to acquire and install better monitoring equipment on Mauna Loa  and recruit entry level seismologists to ensure that Hawaii will have a continuous community of scientists and professionals at the Observatory     30
