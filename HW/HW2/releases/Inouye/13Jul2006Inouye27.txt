SENATE PANEL APPROVES  6 1 MILLION FOR NORTHWESTERN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS MARINE NATIONAL MONUMENT          SENATE PANEL APPROVES  6 1 MILLION FOR NORTHWESTERN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS MARINE NATIONAL MONUMENT  Initiatives Provide Management and Research Services for the Marine Area  And Are Included in Nearly Two Dozen Projects to Receive a Total of  67 1 Million   Thursday  July 13  2006           For Immediate Release   WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the Congress has taken a huge step forward to protect the newly proclaimed Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument  as the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved nearly  6 1 million for management and research in this vast marine area    Without the funding to back up the high ideals that the President stated in his proclamation last month  the protection afforded to our islands would be a paper tiger  long on words  and short on teeth  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  With this appropriation  we will be providing unquestioned support of ocean conservation by nurturing and maintaining biodiversity in this special archipelago of 140 000 square miles  It will mean the flourishing of marine life in our archipelago    I have long championed conservation and funding for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands  and I am grateful for the sensitivity my Senate colleagues have shown to this remote region of our country  The nearly  6 1 million will go toward ensuring responsible  science based management and research of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands according to the needs and priorities that we develop together  as a community  in Hawaii  Under the stewardship and guidance of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  I am confident that even the farthest islands in our archipelago will have a bright future    The funds for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands marine monument are in two of nearly two dozen Hawaii related initiatives that the Senate Appropriations Committee is supporting with its approval of funds totaling more than  67 1 million  The initiatives are part of the Fiscal Year 2007 Departments of Commerce and Justice  and Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill that the committee unanimously approved today by a roll call vote    Of the initiatives related to the marine monument  one provides  3 8 million to support the science based management practices and research necessary to ensure that the area will endure for generations to come  The second initiative  for  2 25 million  allows the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology to continue research in support of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument and Pacific sanctuaries    The entire package of Hawaii related appropriations will also allow us to continue to protect endangered sea turtles  humpback whales  Hawaiian monk seals  and fragile coral reef ecosystems  Senator Inouye said  Additionally  the funds will promote science and ocean education  and allow us to move forward with the construction of a regional NOAA facility on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor  The people of Hawaii and the Pacific will be better served when all of NOAAs Hawaii based staff and programs are in one facility    Senator Inouye also said he was pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee is approving nearly  2 million more for Hawaiis ocean and marine initiatives than it did for Fiscal Year 2006  That may not seem like much  but at a time when the federal budget is tight  and when there are many more programs worthy of funding  it is heartening to know that Hawaiis initiatives are receiving widespread support  he said    The Fiscal Year 2007 Departments of Commerce and Justice  and Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill now advances to the full Senate for consideration  Funding levels for Hawaii initiatives that are justice  or science related will be determined later in the legislative process when conferees meet to discuss differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill    The following are the Hawaii initiatives in the funding measure approved by the Senate
