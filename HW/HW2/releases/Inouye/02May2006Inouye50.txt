SENATE REJECTS ATTEMPT TO STRIP DISASTER AID FOR STATE FROM EMERGENCY FUNDING BILL          SENATE REJECTS ATTEMPT TO STRIP DISASTER AID FOR STATE FROM EMERGENCY FUNDING BILL           Tuesday  May 02  2006        For Immediate Release                       WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye said today he is pleased that the Senate voted 59 to 40 to reject an amendment introduced by U S  Senator John McCain that would have barred  6 million in emergency assistance from two Hawaii sugar companies that suffered significant losses during the 42 days of heavy rains and flooding that drenched Hawaii earlier this year    Senator McCain argued that the  6 million was an unnecessary appropriation because the President has not even issued an emergency disaster declaration as a result of the severe weather that hit the islands  beginning on February 20  2006    Senator Inouye countered  The Governor of Hawaii submitted a request on April 10  2006  eight days after the downpour and flooding ended  for a presidential disaster declaration  It is under consideration  and we believe a declaration will be issued    Furthermore  this earmark was not sneaked into the Fiscal Year 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill  It was openly discussed with the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  with authorizers  appropriators  and the Secretary of Agriculture  and they agreed there was a need for this earmark    During the floor debate  Senator Inouye asked his colleagues to show compassion  and understanding by supporting the earmark  Seventeen Republican senators voted against the McCain amendment    The earmark will aid the sugar companies Gay  Robinson  Inc   the family run corporation on Kauai  and the Hawaiian Commercial  Sugar  Co   headquartered on Maui  with the losses they sustained to their sugarcane crops  and the damage to their irrigation canal systems and their roads  For Gay  Robinson  more than 100 miles of its roads were severely damaged  and some roads must be rebuilt completely    It is estimated that crop losses for the two companies will total more than  14 million for during the three year period beginning this year  Senator Inouye said  Losses have occurred because most of the available labor has been directed to repairing infrastructure and away from normal production management  Losses will also continue to occur because of the disruption and delays in planting new sugar crops     It is undisputable that it will take more than  6 million to ensure the complete recovery of these two sugar companies that are a vital part of Hawaiis economy    The  6 million earmark is part of a  33 5 million package of disaster assistance for Kauai and other parts of the state that is in the emergency appropriations measure    30
