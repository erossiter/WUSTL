Senate for consideration    The Honolulu High Capacity Transit Corridor Project is a crucial initiative that brings the delegation together because we all have jurisdiction over it  said U S  Senators Inouye and Daniel K  Akaka  It provides a solution to the heavy traffic congestion in the east west corridor between fast growing Kapolei and densely populated Honolulu  The more than 546 000 people  60 percent of Oahus population  who live in the transit corridor have expressed their desire for traffic relief  and we are poised to secure the federal funding to ensure that this vital projects moves forward    Representative Abercrombie added  This is a clear statement that the federal government is committed to help solve one of the worst traffic congestion problems in the country  This rapid transit system is likely to be Honolulus largest infrastructure development project in more than 30 years  It will provide construction jobs  workforce housing  and other transit oriented development  not to mention the much needed congestion relief    The Honolulu Transit Project  said Representative Mazie Hirono  is a top priority for the entire delegation  I am proud to be part of the strong and effective Hawaii Congressional team  and I look forward to helping Hawaii on this and other projects through my service on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure    In
