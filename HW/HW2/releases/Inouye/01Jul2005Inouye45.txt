INOUYE CHALLENGES BASE REALIGNMENT PANELS SUGGESTION  HE STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF THE PEARL HARBOR NAVAL SHIPYARD         INOUYE CHALLENGES BASE REALIGNMENT PANELS SUGGESTION  HE STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF THE PEARL HARBOR NAVAL SHIPYARD              July 1  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye said today he is disappointed that the Base Realignment and Closure Commission has asked Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld why the Pentagon did not recommend that the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard be closed or realigned   Much of our nations security concerns is now focused on the Asia Pacific Region  he said   It is for that reason that the Navy is planning to increase its forces in the Pacific   Today  the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard provides the support for the ships that are based in the Pacific   As we increase forces in Hawaii and elsewhere in the region  the role of Pearl Harbor will continue to grow  Senator Inouye explained   He added  It is critically important that we do not send a message to potential adversaries in the region that we are lessening our commitment to the  Asia Pacific  area   Our bases in the Pacific provide the linchpin to demonstrating our resolve   No base is more important to supporting our forces in the region than the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard   Senator Inouye said he will work with the Hawaii Congressional Delegation  the Department of Defense  and the U S  Navy to ensure that the Base Realignment and Closure Commission understands the importance of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard to our nations security   The following is a detailed statement that the Senator issued today regarding the Commissions recommendation   Today we were advised that the Base Realignment and Closure Commission has notified the Department of Defense that it will examine the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard as a candidate for base closure   I am disappointed that the Commission has decided to review Pearl Harbor  because we in Hawaii recognize the critical importance of Pearl Harbor to the Navy and our national security   Nonetheless  I am confident that after the Commissions review  they will agree that Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard must remain open to meet our security requirements     As we proceed to respond  to any questions that the Commission may ask over the coming weeks  we will try to make several points about the importance of Pearl Harbor to our countrys future   First  the Defense Department in its recommendations to the Base Closure Commission recognized the critical importance of the Asia Pacific Region   It is for that reason that the Navy is planning to increase its forces in the Pacific   Today  the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard provides the support for the ships that are based in the Pacific   As we increase forces in Hawaii and elsewhere in the region  the role of Pearl Harbor will continue to grow   Second  many experts have noted that in the foreseeable future  the one area of the world which could require our military attention is the Pacific   We face a belligerent dictator in Kim Jong Il in North Korea   We have terrorist organizations in several countries in the Asia Pacific region that could jeopardize regional stability   And we know the only country that has the potential to engage us in the near future as a superpower is China   The vastness of the Pacific has always made it an area where the Navy was the key power   The ships of the Pacific Fleet are dedicated to maintaining peace and stability in the region   The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard provides the basis to keep the ships operating and ready when needed   Third  I have been informed that the Commission has made the recommendation to examine Pearl Harbor because it is dissatisfied with the Defense Departments justification for closing the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard   It is my view that the Portsmouth decision is unrelated to the need for the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard     If the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard were to remain open  the Navy would still need Pearl Harbor to provide the support for the Pacific Fleet   The location of Portsmouth in the Northeastern United States means it is simply geographically ill equipped to support the ships of the Pacific Fleet   Finally  we must all remember lessons from earlier times when we turned our back on the dangers that were arising from the Pacific   It is critically important that we do not send a message to potential adversaries in the region that we are lessening our commitment to the area   Our bases in the Pacific provide the linchpin to demonstrating our resolve   No base is more important to supporting our forces in the region than the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard   While I am not pleased that the Commission has made the announcement that it will consider closing the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard  I am confident when they review the facts and examine the critical need for the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard  they will recognize that it is essential to the Navy  to the Pacific  and to our nations security that we maintain this valuable base      30
