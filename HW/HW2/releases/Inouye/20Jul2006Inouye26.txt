include  364 million for more than 60 Hawaii related initiatives    These initiatives will help to strengthen our national defense  establish a blueprint to ease traffic congestion on Oahu  and assist the residents of Tantalus in recovering from the thunderstorms and mudslides that battered Hawaii earlier this year  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  The initiatives will also provide health care  education  job training  and housing support for Native Hawaiians  as well as transportation  health care  and job training assistance in rural areas of the state    Key projects include  25 million for a fuel cell nose dock at Hickam Air Force Base and more than  3 5 million for road restoration to support the C 17 cargo aircraft that will play a major role in moving needed supplies throughout the strategic Asia Pacific region  added the Senator  a highly decorated World War II combat veteran    The Committees allocation of more than  208 million for the C 17 projects and eight other Hawaii related military construction initiatives for Fiscal Year 2007 came two days after the Spirit of Kamehameha  Imua  the eighth and final C 17 Globemaster III to be based in Hawaii  landed at its new home at Hickam   Senator Inouye noted that  4 million was allocated for the Honolulu High Capacity Transit Corridor Project  which will explore ways to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow along the much used traffic pathway between Kapolei and Honolulu  For the nearly two thirds of the population of Oahu that live along this corridor  traffic congestion  especially while going to and from work  is an inescapable fact of life  Senator Inouye said  The Project  by providing a thorough review of all alternatives  give hope that improved traffic flow is an achievable goal  It certainly would make the lives of those who live along the Kapolei to Honolulu corridor less stressful    Senator Inouye was also pleased to announce that he has secured  4 million to assist local and state efforts to stabilize the hillside of Tantalus Mountain and to clean up Round Top Drive  For the residents of Tantalus who experienced flooding and mudslides  and who had to be evacuated  the construction of hillside retaining walls and the cleanup of Round Top Drive will help to bring normalcy and stability back into their lives  he said  When I toured Round Top Drive with Honolulu Mayor Hanneman in April  I saw the extensive damage  and I the heard the concerns of residents of Maunalaha Road  who suffered greatly from the landslides  That inspection tour strengthened my commitment to secure federal assistance    Hawaii related projects were allocated more than  84 million under the Labor and Health and Human Services appropriations
