TORTURE BAN  KATRINA RELIEF  AND AVIAN FLU PREPARATION APPROVED BY CONGRESS  INOUYE ANNOUNCES         TORTURE BAN  KATRINA RELIEF  AND AVIAN FLU PREPARATION APPROVED BY CONGRESS  INOUYE ANNOUNCES  Appropriations Bill Also Includes  413 Million for Defense Related Projects in Hawaii During Fiscal Year 2006           December 22  2005        For Immediate Release   WASHINGTON  Legislation that bans cruel and degrading treatment of suspected foreign terrorists  and provides billions of dollars to rebuild the hurricane devastated Gulf Coast and establish a national avian flu preparation plan has been approved by the Congress  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today    The measure  the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill  also includes approximately  413 million for defense related initiatives in Hawaii during Fiscal Year 2006  he said  Coupled with the Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction Appropriations Bill that provides nearly  354 2 million for military construction projects in Hawaii that the President signed into law on November 30  2005  the state will receive approximately  767 million in military related spending  excluding day to day operations and payroll  during Fiscal Year 2006    The Defense Appropriations measure cleared its final legislative hurdle this afternoon when it was approved by the House of Representatives  and it will be sent to the President to sign into law  The bill received final approval from the Senate late Wednesday night  December 21  2005  by a vote of 93 to 0    I am pleased that this legislation includes language that prohibits abusive interrogations of suspected terrorists  and clarifies current anti torture laws  said Senator Inouye  the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  who during House Senate negotiations vigorously fought White House backed efforts to remove the provision  While we must do our best to protect our nation from foreign terrorists and all other enemies  we must ensure that we  as a nation  do not engage in the sort of conduct that dishonors our democratic ideals    Senator Inouye also welcomed the inclusion in the bill of  29 billion to help New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast recover from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and  3 8 billion for preparations for the United States to cope with a possible avian flu epidemic    As a lawmaker from an island state that has suffered from natural disasters such as Hurricane Iniki in 1992  I know how important federal recovery assistance is  Infrastructure and buildings need to be rebuilt  Businesses need to get back on their feet  Families need to move out of tents and shelters  and back into their homes  Senator Inouye said    He added  A possible avian flu epidemic is a national concern  The funding in this appropriations measure will help us to be better prepared by increasing international surveillance  training more emergency officials  and stockpiling vaccines    I am disappointed  however  that the bill included language that shields pharmaceutical companies that manufacture bird flu vaccines from liability  Americans may refuse to be vaccinated if they fear that drug companies are more concerned about protecting themselves than the public    The funding for Hawaii defense related programs are important for our national security  especially given the crucial role Hawaii has in our nations defense  Inouye said  The Hawaii related initiatives will further develop the cutting edge technology needed by the American men and women who put themselves in
