INOUYE ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE AMENDED FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT         INOUYE ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE AMENDED FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT       Tuesday  August 07  2007           For Immediate Release                         HONOLULU  In response to inquiries from constituents and other individuals  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today issued the following statement on the decision by Congress to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978    I support an immediate stopgap approach to provide temporary authority  under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  also known as FISA  to ensure our domestic security  FISA has never been amended to reflect the present technological changes since the law was enacted in 1978    Accordingly  based on highly classified briefings  I felt it was necessary to provide the Director of National Intelligence  even though temporary  with the needed tools to collect time sensitive intelligence against foreign targets  Protecting our homes and families transcends partisan squabbling  and I am proud to have gone on record as supporting an immediate solution to this important issue     30
