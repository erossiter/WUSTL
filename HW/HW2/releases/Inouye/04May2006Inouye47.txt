STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE U S  COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT ON THE AKAKA BILL          STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE U S  COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT ON THE AKAKA BILL           Thursday  May 04  2006        For Immediate Release                         WASHINGTON  I was dismayed to learn that the U S  Commission on Civil Rights voted today to adopt a seriously flawed report that unfairly characterizes the Akaka Bill as race based and discriminatory    From what I have learned  not only does the report have significant errors of fact and history  but the process in which the Commission considered the report was also highly suspect  The meeting was disorganized and unprofessional  commissioners were forced to take a 10 minute break because they did not understand what they were voting on  Given those factors  how can anyone give any credence to its report    I remain committed to the Akaka Bill  and will continue to work vigorously for its passage    30
