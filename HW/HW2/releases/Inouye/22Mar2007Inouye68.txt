INOUYE BACKS NEW PLAN WITH WITHDRAWAL OF U S  TROOPS FROM IRAQ          INOUYE BACKS NEW PLAN WITH WITHDRAWAL OF U S  TROOPS FROM IRAQ   Staying the course isnt working and I  for one  am not convinced it ever will  he says  Thursday  March 22  2007           For Immediate Release                                    WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today asked his colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to retain a section of the Fiscal Year 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill that would direct the President  within 120 days of the enactment of the funding measure  to begin to redeploy U S  troops from Iraq  The goal is to have only a limited number of U S  troops remaining in Iraq on March 31  2008   Senator Inouyes colleagues agreed  and the provision was retained    The following is the statement delivered by Senator Inouye  who received the Medal of Honor  our nations highest award for military valor  for his service during World War II      Mr  Chairman  I would hope the Committee would not agree to strike Section 1315 of this bill    I would remind my colleagues that the provision states first and foremost  that we will continue to support and protect our forces serving in Iraq    The Committee is recommending nearly  100 billion in this bill for our military  an amount that exceeds funding requested by the Administration to support our troops  We also fully fund the training and equipping of the Iraq security forces  These funds make it clear that we support the men and women who are serving the nation and will continue to do so    But the language in the bill also says quite correctly that we should not have United States troops caught in the middle of a civil war  And  most regrettably  that is the situation we find ourselves in    We need a change in plans  This war has dragged on too long  longer than our involvement in World War II    Staying the course isnt working and I  for one  am not convinced it ever will    The only way we can succeed in Iraq is to fundamentally change the dynamic  The language embraces this idea by offering a new plan  one that eventually should allow for our forces to be withdrawn from Iraq    The proposal establishes a goal of redeploying most of our forces from Iraq in the next 12 months  It doesnt mandate that all the troops are removed by that date  To the contrary  it mandates that forces remain in Iraq to protect United States and coalition personnel    It also stipulates that U S  forces continue to train and equip the Iraqis  so that they can better defend themselves  and it directs that we continue counter terrorist operations in Iraq    This is a balanced plan  It recognizes that we still have military responsibilities in Iraq  and will continue to do so even a year from now  but it will force the Iraqis to fight their own civil war if they insist on doing so    We all know that there are very few military objectives to be achieved in Iraq  We defeated the Iraqi army four years ago    We won that part of the war  the part that the military can win  We failed in not preparing for the aftermath of direct conflict and now we are enmeshed in an untenable position    Our military has performed remarkably  They have achieved their military objectives    But the plan to rely on the military to achieve political objectives has not worked  And what we need is a political solution    We can stay in Iraq for the next year  or five years  or even ten years fighting a protracted civil war  Many of our brave young men and women will continue to die  many more will come home seriously injured    And  at the end  how many of us truly still believe we will emerge victorious  with a Jeffersonian democracy on the banks of the Tigris River    Or  we can embrace a new plan that begins to reshape our forces in Iraq to provide those missions that our military is best suited for with a goal  not a mandate  but a goal of redeploying the remaining forces one year from now    If Iraq is to succeed  it must assume responsibility for its own destiny  it must decide if it wants to stop internecine warfare  We cannot do that for them    My friends  this is actually a very modest proposal  but one that is caught up in the emotion of the debate    It offers a plan  one that has a much greater chance of success than staying the course   It doesnt mandate a timetable for ending our involvement in Iraq  but provides a new way ahead which will ensure better protection for our forces and a greater chance for the Iraqis to succeed    I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of retaining this language    30
