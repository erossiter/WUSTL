INOUYE ANNOUNCES  Senate Appropriations Committee Advances  Hawaii Related Initiatives Totaling  68 Million    Thursday  June 22  2006           For Immediate Release                                  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  15 million for the completion of the Hilo based research facility whose work in crop production and preparation will strengthen the agriculture industry in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific    The panel also approved the re inclusion of  13 million in disaster assistance for Kauai and Oahu  which were pummeled by 42 consecutive days of severe rainstorms and flooding that spurred the President to issue a disaster declaration  The storm assistance funds were initially in an emergency supplemental bill  but the White House and House Republican conferees balked at including the Hawaii related assistance in that measure  which the President signed into law on June 15  2006      I am pleased that my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee continue to believe in the importance of releasing storm assistance funds for Hawaii  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Appropriations panel  The funds will play a crucial role in helping the Islands of Kauai and Oahu remove debris  clear and stabilize streams and assist farmers who suffered serious losses as a result of the havoc causing weather    I am also pleased that the Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center is moving closer to becoming a reality with the appropriation of  15 million to complete construction of the  45 million facility  which was first funded seven years ago  It is important to have a Hawaii based federal agricultural research center because the Pacific Basin is an extremely important region for tropical and subtropical agricultural production  The challenges our farmers face in our region are far different from those faced by farmers in the temperate zones    In addition to the funding for the Center and storm recovery  the Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations Bill includes  40 million for other Hawaii related earmarks  The Hawaii related earmarks total more
