SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE CONFIRMATION OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE AS SECRETARY OF STATE         SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE CONFIRMATION OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE AS SECRETARY OF STATE  January 26  2005 For Immediate Release          WASHINGTON  I voted today for Dr  Condoleezza Rice to serve as our Secretary of State not necessarily because I agree with her philosophy and vision as they relate to the war on terrorism  and specifically the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   I did vote for her for the following reasons   Number 1  she is the choice of the President  and the President wants her to be his voice on matters relating to foreign relations   As a rule  I support such nominees unless the nominee is a criminal or intellectually or mentally unfit to carry out the duties of the relevant office   Dr  Rice is intellectually well prepared  if one considers academic achievement   Very few people can match her record of academic accomplishments   Number 2  I felt that to vote against Dr  Rice might make me guilty of having a double standard   During the debate on her confirmation  I could not help recalling that when the previous Secretary of State went before the United Nations Security Council with photographs that showed aluminum tubes that were supposedly important in the development of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  and asserted that they were acquired by Saddam Hussein from Nigeria   When that presentation was later found to be misleading and not factual  I dont recall any of my colleagues standing up and condemning Secretary Colin Powell for lying and misleading the American people and the United States Congress   The same Secretary of State also appeared before the U N  Security Council with photographs of two large trailer trucks  and declared that these were mobile laboratories for the development of weapons of mass destruction   When we later learned that was not the case  I do not recall any of my colleagues taking the rostrum and condemning him   The main criticisms against Dr  Rice have resulted from her statements in support of the previous Secretarys statements on weapons of mass destruction  and on the aluminum tubes and the mobile laboratories   So why challenge one  but not the other   Remember too that Secretary Powell was the one who said Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda were linked  which also turned out to be not true   It should be noted that I voted against the war in Iraq   We were not prepared for a long  drawn out guerrilla type conflict  nor were we justified to make a preemptive strike   The justification was weapons of mass destruction  which were nowhere to be found   However  if the President of the United States wants Dr  Rice to be his voice on foreign affairs  I believe that is his prerogative                30
