INOUYE SUPPORTS PONO TOKIOKAS QUEST FOR EQUITY         INOUYE SUPPORTS PONO TOKIOKAS QUEST FOR EQUITY           December 6  2005        For Immediate Release         HONOLULU  HAWAII  In response to the announcement today by Pono Tokioka and his parents of their filing of a complaint with the U S  Department of Justice against the PONY Baseball Softball  Inc   U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye commented    As an organization whose mission is to coach and provide young athletes with an opportunity to excel  I was surprised and disappointed by the PONY Baseballs treatment of Pono Tokioka  If anything  PONY Baseball should step forward  acknowledge its error  and then take reasonable actions to demonstrate that if a young person  with or without a disability  works hard enough and perseveres  there are no limitations or obstacles   Providing reasonable accommodations for those with special needs  in this case  allowing a sign language interpreter in a baseball dugout  is the policy of our nation  I wholeheartedly support the Tokioka family in their quest for fair treatment      30
