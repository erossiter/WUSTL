U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE RESPONDS TO DEL MONTES CLOSURE ANNOUNCEMENT          U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE RESPONDS TO DEL MONTES CLOSURE ANNOUNCEMENT           February 03  2006        For Immediate Release       Washington   D C   I was clearly disappointed when I learned of Del Montes announcement that it will cease its pineapple operations in Hawaii which began more than a century ago    We learned some valuable lessons from the painful closure of our sugar plantations  beginning with Hamakuas announcement in 1992  As government leaders  we must support our workers and their families during this difficult time  I have called upon the City  County of Honolulus Oahu Workforce Investment Board which oversees Oahus allocation of Rural Development Program funding to set aside approximately  500 000 to assist Del Monte workers interested in pursuing new employment opportunities  The Rural Development Program is a statewide federal initiative I began many years ago to ensure that rural communities would have their own resources to pursue tailored job training placement and economic development opportunities  I know that together we can make a positive impact in this regard    In addition  I remain hopeful that a majority of these fertile lands will remain in agriculture  I was encouraged to see the interest expressed  albeit preliminary  in keeping the lands in pineapple  As such  I have directed that the FY 2006 Rural Economic Transition Assistance II  RETA II  allocation of approximately    1 75 million be targeted toward keeping the lands in agricultural production and in supporting those workers with an interest in remaining in the field of agriculture    I look forward to working with the ILWU  the Oahu Workforce Investment Board  RETA II  and others to provide hope and new opportunities for our Del Monte workers and their families     30
