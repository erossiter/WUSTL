SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES FLOOR STATEMENT ON DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE         SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES FLOOR STATEMENT ON DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE  March 16  2005 For Immediate Release               Mr  INOUYE  Mr  President  during the past several weeks  my office and I have received hundreds of letters  telephone calls  e mails  most of them condemning drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  Some were threatening  Some were very sensitive  I would like to take this opportunity to respond to these letters and telegrams and e mails               I do this with mixed feelings because I am well aware that the majority of my colleagues on the Democratic side are not with me and that I may be one of the very few on our side  But I have taken this position for many years  This is not the first time  So I think I have a few things I would like to share with you                Last night  I watched a television ad put out by people who are not for the drilling  If one looked at it objectively  you got the impression that the drilling would be done in all of Alaska  It showed pristine scenes of wildlife  of plants  You could not help but feel  my God  are we going to destroy all of this                How large is ANWR  As the Senator from Virginia stated  it is about the size of the State of South Carolina  The area that will be set aside for this drilling would be about 2 000 acres  2 000 acres out of 19 million acres                Put another way  if ANWR were the size of a page of the Washington Post  and you put something on it about a square quarter inch  that would be about the size of the drilling footprint of ANWR                We are not devastating the State of Alaska  We are not devastating ANWR                This debate has gone on for a long time  Many of the debates centered around the statements of an Indian tribe  the Gwichin  The Gwichin village at one time offered their lands for lease to drill and develop oil  They had no conditions to it  They said just go ahead and drill on our land  we would like to have that done  But when the test drills were made and they found that there was no oil or gas  then  suddenly  the Gwichins found themselves in opposition                There are 230 Indian tribes and tribal villages in the State of Alaska  230  One tribe is against it  the Gwichin tribe  For the past 15 years I was chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee  My mandate from my colleagues was that we should listen to the Indians  Mr  President  229 tribes said yes  we want it  One tribe said no                The Gwichins have cousins on the Canadian side  and the Canadian side Gwichin land is being drilled at the same time  and they seem to be happy                The question comes up  how many barrels will ANWR produce  The U S  Geological Survey suggests that ANWR holds between 5 7 billion and 16 billion barrels of oil  an average of about 10 billion barrels  The site will produce an additional 876 000 to 1 6 million barrels a day  This makes it the single greatest prospect for future oil production in the United States  It will produce over 36 million gallons of much needed gasoline  jet and diesel fuel and heating oil  To put this in perspective  while ANWR can produce 1 6 million barrels a day  Texas and California each offer about 1 million daily                Development of ANWR alone will reduce U S  dependence on foreign sources by 4 percent  Some would say  4 percent  thats not much  Tell that to the driver who has to go to the pump today and pay that extra price  Four percent makes a big difference                But equally as important  I have heard many of my colleagues suggest that the war in Iraq is a war on oil  If they believe so  why dont we produce our own oil so we dont have to fight for it                I close by sharing with you something that happened many years ago when the Trans Alaska Pipeline was being debated  It was a long time ago  and most of the Members of the Senate were not here at that time  Dire predictions were made  Environmentalists came forward and said  You are going to destroy Alaska  The caribou herd will be demolished and diminished  They will become extinct                Those are the words that we heard  At the time the Congress authorized the Trans Alaska Pipeline  there were 5 000 caribou  Today  there are 32 000 caribou  Instead of diminishing the herd  the pipeline apparently has helped them  But this is not a debate on the pipeline  it is a debate on ANWR                I hope my colleagues will give this opportunity to the people of Alaska  When 229 out of 230 tribes tell me they want it  I am ready to respond  sir                Thank you very much         30
