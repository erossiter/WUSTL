STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE ADMINISTRATIONS MASSIVE TRACKING OF DOMESTIC PHONE CALLS          STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE ADMINISTRATIONS MASSIVE TRACKING OF DOMESTIC PHONE CALLS           Friday  May 12  2006        For Immediate Release                          WASHINGTON  I am troubled by the recent news reports that revealed the National Security Agency has been secretly amassing a huge database of the phone calls made by the more than 200 million customers of three of our nations biggest telecommunications companies    When the NSA  under the direction of the current administration  is operating a data collection program of this magnitude  it comes close to monitoring every one of the 281 million Americans in the United States    As a senior U S  Senator whose legislative work includes defense and intelligence issues  I anticipate that my phone calls may be monitored by foreign and American interests  and I take appropriate countermeasures  But to learn that the NSA is tracking all the calls of more than 200 million Americans  even when the overwhelming majority are not involved in sensitive work or are not suspected of any wrongdoing  raises serious questions of legality  and of constitutional protections of privacy    At the very least  this latest disclosure of NSA related activities underscores the need for an oversight investigation by Congress    Furthermore  I applaud the announcement by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter that he will hold hearings on the latest NSA revelations    The administration and the executives of the three telecommunications companies  ATT Corp   Verizon Communications  Inc   and BellSouth Corp   have a lot of explaining to do    Senator Inouye is the Ranking Member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee          He is also Co Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation  which is responsible for telecommunications issues   He served as the first Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  and led the joint House Senate Iran Contra investigative panel     30
