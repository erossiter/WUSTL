U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE U S  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSES NATIONAL SECURITY PERSONNEL SYSTEM REGULATIONS         U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE U S  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSES NATIONAL SECURITY PERSONNEL SYSTEM REGULATIONS Congressional Record            November 18  2005        For Immediate Release       Mr  INOUYE   Mr  President  I am very disappointed with the U S  Department of Defense and Office of Personnel Managements final regulations for the National Security Personnel System  NSPS  that will affect more than 350 000 defense civil service employees throughout our Nation  What makes the new system dangerous is that upon a cursory glance  it would almost appear acceptable in the name of national security  Scratch the surface  however  and it becomes very alarming      The rhetoric does not match reality  U S  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in public testimony stated that these new regulations would not end collective bargaining  but  rather  would bring collective bargaining to the national level to avoid duplication and inefficiency  This has not occurred  nor do I believe there is a sincere interest in the Pentagon to pursue national collective bargaining  In fact  I would suspect that the Pentagons plan is just the opposite  to substantially remove from the table the number of subjects for good faith collective bargaining     For this reason  I am pleased that the employee unions have gone to Federal court to challenge the regulations  in the same fashion that they challenged the Department of Homeland Security regulations  I hope they will prevail in their call for injunctive relief  as they did in the Homeland Security case  as well as to prevail in the final disposition of both cases     While I would be the first to say that the Federal civil service system is not perfect  it is a system that has withstood the test of time as fair and impartial  To overhaul it in favor of vesting the subjective power to hire  fire  discipline and promote in the hands of a few political appointees is very dangerous  At this point  the seemingly acceptable national security rationale for the wholesale stripping of employees rights fast begins to lose its luster  It is no longer reasonable  There seems to me to be an inherent conflict  In the name of national security  this administration is willing to deny its own workers a small modicum of security  employment and family security  especially when I do not believe it is necessary to achieve our goal of national security  I call into question the motivations behind their actions     My position on the Pentagons issuance of the NSPS regulations is what I believe any decent fellow would say  Now is the time for our Nation to come together in support of our armed services abroad  To do so  we must stand behind our civilian defense workforce from whom we are demanding great productivity in support of our troops     Now is not the time to be divisive and punitive of our Federal workforce  It creates low morale  mistrust  and a decreasing level of respect between worker and management  The consequences stemming from such instability  could be dire  For me  the stakes in terms of human lives are too high to be taking such a gamble  United we stand  civilian and military together  Divided we could fail    30
