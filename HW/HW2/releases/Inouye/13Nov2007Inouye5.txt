total nearly  76 7 million in the conference approved appropriations measure   Senator Daniel K  Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee who served as one of the Senates conferees  said  With traffic congestion worsening between densely populated Honolulu and fast growing Kapolei  this project offers a solution that all motorists can embrace  More than 546 000 people

resources in millions of dollars for the initial phase of the Honolulu High Capacity Corridor Project  The conference report will also provide essential resources to help meet the transportation  housing  social service  and economic development needs of Hawaii    Commenting on the Transit Corridor Project  Representative Neil Abercrombie said  This fulfills our promise of a federal contribution for the project  in the theme of yet another promise kept  Committing these kinds of federal dollars to Honolulu demonstrates the confidence that Congress has in our project  This is where the hard work of the Hawaii delegation begins to pay off    Representative Mazie K  Hirono said  This initial funding represents a relatively small amount of the estimated  3 6 billion project  but significantly it demonstrates Congress support for this initiative  As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  I am working closely with the Committee chairs to secure
