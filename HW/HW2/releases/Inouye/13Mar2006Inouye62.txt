STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE PASSING OF HIS WIFE  MAGGIE INOUYE          STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE PASSING OF HIS WIFE  MAGGIE INOUYE           March 13  2006        For Immediate Release            WASHINGTON  I am saddened to report that my dear and lovely wife of nearly 57 years  Margaret Awamura Inouye  passed away today at 4 p m  Eastern Standard Time at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  She was 81  and her death was due to complications resulting from colon cancer    Maggie was recently hospitalized because an examination found small blood clots and some fluid in her right lung  and she had been undergoing a process of draining out the fluid and dissolving the blood clots    This most recent medical challenge came after Maggie underwent surgery in November 2004 to remove a cancerous growth from her large intestine  Her surgeons had pronounced that operation a success    As she has done throughout her life  Maggie handled her difficult situation without complaint  and with dignity and grace  Although her chemotherapy treatments would leave her drained  she always had a smile for you  and she retained her optimistic outlook    It was a most special blessing to have had Maggie in my life for 58 years  She was my inspiration  and all that I have accomplished could not have been done without her at my side  We were a team  She always supported me  listened to my ideas  and many times offered invaluable suggestions that always proved she was capable of achieving as much on her own right  given her intelligence and education  Instead  she chose to join me on a special journey that took us to Washington  and gave us the privilege of serving the people of Hawaii    On the campaign trail  she was invaluable  During my first race for the U S  Senate in 1962  legislative work in the U S  House permitted me to make only short trips back to Hawaii  I was facing a formidable opponent  the son of the wealthiest man in Hawaii  Both Time and Newsweek magazines didnt think much of my chances of winning  But Maggie put some magic into my campaign  She returned to Hawaii that June  and spent seven days a week visiting every island and making hundreds of speeches on my behalf  When I finally did get back in October  my campaign manager met me at the airport and said  Were glad to have you  but Maggies been doing great  I won  and I won big  In my heart  I know that without her I could not have won that pivotal race that put me on the path to become a United States Senator    I first met Maggie in the autumn of 1947  a week before Thanksgiving  when we were introduced to each other  She was already known as a poised  graceful  articulate  and gentle lady from a good family who was very much ahead of her time  Back then  few women went to college  But Maggie not only earned her undergraduate degree in education from the University of Hawaii  she went on to earn a masters in education from Columbia University in New York City  With her graduate degree  she returned home to Hawaii  and began her career as a speech instructor at UH    I  too  had returned home  from the war and from my injury rehabilitation regimen that I had undergone on the mainland  I was enrolled at the University of Hawaii  and was still trying to chart my future  However  I was certain of one thing almost immediately after I met Maggie  I was going to marry her  I dont think the possibility of marriage had ever occurred to me before that moment  but afterward  it never left my mind  Everything I had and wanted to have suddenly became absolutely meaningless unless Margaret Awamura would share it with me    On our second date on December 6  1947  I asked her to marry me  Without hesitation  she said  Yes  Her answer made me feel like I was in heaven  She was willing to have as her lifelong partner a man who at that time was nothing more than a combat veteran on the GI Bill whose future was still uncertain  Her numerous other suitors had much more to offer  as they were already professional men    During the 18 months before our marriage on June 12  1949  we were an unusual couple on the UH campus  She was an instructor  I was an underclassman  Of course  it was Maggies salary as a teacher at the university that saw us through those first years of our marriage    In the early 1950s when I was studying at George Washington to earn my law degree  Maggie was the breadwinner  while I contributed what I received from my GI education benefits and my pension as a retired Army Captain  While I was in class  she was working at the Department of the Navys Bureau of Yards and Docks  first as a file clerk and soon she was promoted to administrative secretary    When we returned to Hawaii  I went to work for the City and County of Honolulu as a Deputy Public Prosecutor  while Maggie returned to the University of Hawaii as an instructor in education  It was a position she would hold for six years    In 1964  five years after she left UH  Maggie gave birth to our son  Daniel K  Inouye  Jr  That was a most special day  perhaps because we became parents at a rather late stage in our lives    Kenny and I  as well as the people of Hawaii  were blessed to have had Maggie in our lives  She was a most special woman  and she will always be in my heart    In addition to Senator Inouye and Daniel K  Inouye  Jr   Mrs  Inouye is survived by five sisters  Edith Satow of Carmarillo  California  Grace Murakami of Honolulu  Betty Higashino of Orinda  California  Shirley Nozoe of Honolulu  and Patricia Tyler of Sudbury  Massachusetts  Funeral arrangements are pending        MARGARET AWAMURA INOUYE  AT A GLANCE   Personal Born on June 23  1924  in Wailuku  Maui     Married Daniel K  Inouye on June 12
