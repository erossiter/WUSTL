APPROVES  691 MILLION FOR LABOR  HEALTH  EDUCATION  AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS FOR HAWAII  INOUYE AND AKAKA ANNOUNCE       Friday  November 02  2007           For Immediate Release           WASHINGTON  U S  Senators Daniel K  Inouye and Daniel K  Akaka announced today that House and Senate conferees have approved the appropriation of more than  691 million for Hawaii related labor  health  education  and military construction initiatives    The bulk of the funds  nearly  534 million  are for 12 military construction projects  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  The bricks and mortar are important for our national defense  and for the well being and care of our brave men and women in uniform  But I am also gratified that Senator Akaka and I were able to secure funding for initiatives that give hope to those whose circumstances oftentimes put adequate healthcare and educational opportunities beyond reach  We are especially proud of the health and educational programs that cut away at the health and educational disparities that our islands First Citizens  Native Hawaiians  confront    Senator Akaka added  I am pleased that Senate and House conferees were able to come to agreement to fund these vitally important projects for the state of Hawaii  The funds included for military construction will not only make much needed improvements to our military facilities in Hawaii  but will also be invaluable in ensuring a high quality of life for the men and women serving our nation in the Armed Forces    I am also pleased critical funding for education and healthcare development in Hawaii was included in the appropriations bill  I urge the President to make the needs of our communities and our military a priority by signing this bill into law    The legislation covering military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs contains language offered by Senator Inouye and Senators Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski  both of Alaska  that requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study on the access to medical services that veterans who live in remote  rural areas have to services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs    Our veterans willingly put themselves in harms way  We  as Americans  must ensure that they have access to the healthcare they need  said Senator Inouye  who  like Senator Akaka  served with the U S  Army during World War II    The study must examine the problems and costs faced by veterans in remote rural areas in obtaining VA medical services  the need to fund alternative sources of medical services  particularly in areas that require air transportation to reach a VA facility  and an assessment of the possibility of increasing local access through partnerships with other government and local health care providers    Senators Inouye and Akaka said they are pleased that the military construction VA measure provides  3 6 billion more than what the President proposed for VA programs and facilities    The cost of caring for our veterans and for our disadvantaged is the cost that a great nation must bear  Senator Inouye said  We cannot sidestep this responsibility  I hope the President will reconsider his veto threat    Senator Akaka  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs  said  This bill truly reflects our commitment to fully fund veterans healthcare and benefits  It represents the largest increase in funding for VA healthcare  We in Congress have taken an important first step  I hope the President will join us to improve conditions for our veterans  I am pleased that there are additional funds included in the bill for the treatment of traumatic brain injuries and for VA mental health programs  to treat the invisible wounds that many veterans suffer from after serving in combat  These are two areas of vital importance to service members returning from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom    The conference report on the Labor Health and Human Services funding bill  which now technically includes military construction and Veterans Affairs  could be  considered in the Senate as early as Monday  November 5  2007  Once the Senate and House agree on the conference report  it will be sent to the White House for the Presidents consideration    The following are the Hawaii related initiatives in
