STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE          STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE    ON THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007   Wednesday  January 17  2007           For Immediate Release                            WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye issued the following statement following the introduction today of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007    I am pleased to join my colleague  Senator Akaka  as a cosponsor of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007    During the 109th Congress  the Administration expressed concerns with this legislation that stem from its experience with Indian tribes  The history of Native Hawaiians and their treatment by the United States is similar to that of Indian tribes and Alaska Natives  I want to commend the Administration for devoting staff to work with us to achieve consensus on mutually agreeable language  I am confident that this measure not only addresses the Administrations concerns but also the concerns of some of our colleagues    Having served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 28 years  I know that most of our colleagues are more familiar with conditions and circumstances in Indian Country  and  naturally  they bring their experience with Indian Country to bear in considering this measure  which has been pending in the Senate for the past eight years    Accordingly  I believe it is important that our colleagues understand what this bill seeks to accomplish as well as how it differs from legislation affecting Indian Country    It is a little known fact that beginning in 1910 and since that time  the Congress has passed and the President has signed into law more than 160 Federal laws designed to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians    Thus  Federal laws which authorize the provision of health care  education  housing  and job training and employment services  as well as programs to provide for the preservation of the Native Hawaiian language  Native language immersion  Native cultural and grave protections and repatriation of Native sacred objects have been in place for decades    The Native Hawaiian programs do not draw upon funding that is appropriated for American Indians or Alaska Natives    there are separate authorizations for programs that are administered by different Federal agencies    not the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian Health Service  for instance    and the Native Hawaiian program funds are not drawn from the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee account  Thus  they have no impact on the funding that is provided for other indigenous  native people of the United States    However  unlike the native people residing on the mainland  Native Hawaiians have not been able to exercise their rights as Native people to self determination or self governance because their government was overthrown on January 17  1893    This bill would provide a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian government and the resumption of a political and legal relationship between that government and the government of the United States    Because the Native Hawaiian government is not an Indian tribe  the body of Federal Indian law that would otherwise customarily apply when the United States extends Federal recognition to an Indian tribal group does not apply    Therefore  the bill provides authority for a process of negotiations among the United States  the State of Hawaii  and the reorganized Native Hawaiian government to address such matters as the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction by the respective governments  the transfer of land and natural resources and other assets  and the exercise of governmental authority over those lands  natural resources and other assets    Upon reaching agreement  the U S  Congress and the legislature of the State of Hawaii would have to enact legislation implementing the agreements of the three governments  including amendments that will necessarily have to be made to existing Federal law  such as the Hawaii Admissions Act and the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act  and to State law  including amendments to the Hawaii State Constitution  before any of the new governmental relationships and authorities can take effect    That is why concerns which are premised on the manner in which Federal Indian law provides for the respective governmental authorities of the state governments and Indian tribal governments simply do not apply in Hawaii    We have every confidence that consistent with the Federal policy for more than 35 years  the restoration of the rights to self determination and self governance will enable the Native Hawaiian people  as the direct  lineal descendants of the aboriginal  indigenous native people of what has become our nation s 50th state  to take their rightful place in the family of governments that makes up our constitutional system of governance       30
