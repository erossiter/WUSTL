INOUYE  BIPARTISAN COALITION INTRODUCE BILL TO RAISE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS          INOUYE  BIPARTISAN COALITION INTRODUCE BILL TO RAISE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS  Legislation would increase standards for all vehicles to 35 mpg by model year 2017  Save 2 5 millions of barrels of oil per day  by 2025  and  Reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 420 million metric tons   Tuesday  June 20  2006           For Immediate Release                                 WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator Daniel Inouye  D Hawaii  joined Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    Olympia Snowe  R Maine   Richard Durbin  D Ill    Lincoln Chafee  R R I    and Maria Cantwell  D Wash   to introduce legislation today that would raise the average fuel economy standards for all vehicles  including SUVs and sedans  from 25 miles per gallon  mpg  to 35 mpg by model year 2017   If passed  the bill would save    2 5 million barrels of oil per day by 2025  the same amount of oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf  and    420 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2025  the equivalent of taking 90 million cars  or 75 million cars and light trucks  off the road in one year     We know from experience that our nations insatiable demand for oil is one of our greatest economic vulnerabilities  but we have the capacity to do something about it  New CAFE    corporate average fuel economy    standards are one of the most immediate and effective steps we can take to remedy our dependence on oil  said Senator Inouye  Co Chairman of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee  which oversees vehicle standards  Our Commerce Committee helped establish the first CAFE standards in 1975  which were largely credited with decreasing the nations oil demand in the 1980s  It is time that we update them  and I look forward to helping lead the effort     The bill would also   Require vehicle fuel economy labels to reflect actual driving conditions  The bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to update the test that sets the estimated fuel economy for city and highway driving      Establish mandatory on board fuel economy displays that show real time fuel consumption to encourage more fuel efficient driving      Improve safety rulemaking standards  The bill would require the Department of Transportation to set standards for the industry that will protect Americans in whatever car they choose to drive    whether the Ford Excursion or the Toyota Prius      Create a program to identify vehicles that meet or surpass mandatory fuel economy standards  the green label and the gold star label       The green label would be for vehicles that meet or exceed the applicable fuel economy standard or have the lowest greenhouse gas emissions        The gold star label would be for vehicles that achieve a fuel economy at least 50 mpg  and for light trucks with 37 mpg or higher    The bill is also cosponsored by Senators Bill Nelson  D Fla    Barbara Boxer  D Calif    Frank Lautenberg  D N J    Robert Menendez  D N J   and Joseph Lieberman  D Conn      Background   The United States consumes 25  of the worlds oil  but only has 3  of the worlds reserves  Demand for oil is growing internationally      Chinas recent surge in oil imports has vaulted that country into second place among the worlds biggest oil consumers  behind only the United States  In the past 5 years  Chinas oil imports have doubled  and show no signs of slowing down  Chinas auto fleet is predicted to increase from 25 million currently to 125 million within 25 years  which is why Chinese demand for oil is expected to double again by 2025  while its imports will quadruple to 60 percent of its total oil consumption      India is a relatively small player in the global oil market so far and currently accounts for 3 percent of the worlds oil consumption  but this is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years  India is heavily dependent on oil imports  More than 70 percent of Indias oil is imported  and it is expected that more than 80 percent of Indias energy will be imported by 2020     Furthermore  oil producing countries are making it more difficult for oil companies to invest and increase production  Countries like Bolivia  Russia and Venezuela have taken over the oil fields in their countries  while Nigeria and Kazakhstan have given preferential treatment to state companies  Coupled with increased demand  this will lead to perpetual higher costs at the pump      The International Energy Agency Director Claude Mandil recently said that he expected oil prices to remain high for at least two to three years because of high international demand and tight supply     In fact  at  3 per gallon  Americans driving 15 000 miles per year are  on average  using 600 gallons of gasoline and spending as much as  1 800 per year on gas  By raising CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon  consumers would only use 429 gallons of gas per year  costing  1 287 per year for gas  Thats a savings of  513 per year at the pump  Assuming the consumer keeps the vehicle for at least five years  thats a savings of more than  2500more than enough to recoup the cost of more efficient vehicles     Raising fuel economy standards would also help reduce carbon dioxide emissions  Transportation accounts for one third of all U S  greenhouse gas emissions  Every gallon of gasoline burned emits 20 pounds of harmful CO2 into the atmosphere  That means that each car is responsible for about 12 000 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions every year
