INOUYE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERNMENT OF LATIN AMERICANS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY DURING WORLD WAR II          INOUYE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERNMENT OF LATIN AMERICANS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY DURING WORLD WAR II           February 16  2006        For Immediate Release         WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today introduced legislation to create a commission that would determine the facts and circumstances related to the relocation  internment  and deportation of Latin Americans of Japanese descent during World War II  and during the post war years in the late 1940s    The panel would determine how the actions of the United States affected Latin Americans of Japanese descent  It would also recommend appropriate remedies    I introduced the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act today in commemoration of February 19  1942  the day that President Roosevelt signed a document that authorized the internment of about 120 000 persons of Japanese ancestry  Senator Inouye said  Each year  on the anniversary of this date  the internment is remembered both for the pain it caused  and the lessons that can be learned  I am certain that these lessons can propel this great nation forward toward more equal justice for all    The story of U S  citizens taken from their homes on the West Coast of the United States and confined in desolate camps under harsh conditions is a story that was made known after a fact finding study by a Commission that Congress authorized in 1980  That study was followed by a formal apology by President Reagan and a bill for reparations  Far less known  and indeed  I myself did not initially know  is the story of Latin Americans of Japanese descent taken from their homes in Latin America  stripped of their passports  brought to the United States  and interned in camps our government had set up    This is a story about the U S  governments arm reaching across international borders  into a populous that did not pose an immediate threat to our nation  in order to use them  devoid of passports or any other proof of citizenship  for hostage exchange with Japan  Between the years 1941 and 1945  our government  with the help of Latin American officials  arbitrarily arrested persons of Japanese descent from streets  homes  and workplaces  and brought approximately 2 300 undocumented persons to camp sites in the United States  where they were held under armed watch  then used for prisoner exchange  Those used in an exchange were sent to Japan  a foreign country that many had never set foot in    Despite their involuntary arrival  Latin American internees of Japanese descent were considered by the U S  Immigration and Naturalization Service as illegal entrants  By the end of the war  many Japanese Latin Americans had been sent to Japan  Those who were not used in a prisoner exchange were cast out into a new and English speaking country  and subject to deportation proceedings  Some returned to Latin America  but some remained in the United States as their country of origin refused their re entry because they were unable to present a passport    When I first learned of the wartime experiences of Japanese Latin Americans  it seemed unfathomable  But it happened  It is a part of our national history  and it is a part of the living histories of the many families whose lives are forever tied to internment camps in our country    The outline of this story was sketched out in the report published by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians  which was formed in 1980  This Commission had set out to learn about Japanese Americans  When Commissioners neared the end of their investigations  they stumbled upon this extraordinary effort by the U S  government to relocate  intern  and deport Japanese Latin Americans  Because this finding surfaced late in their study  Commissioners were unable to fully uncover the facts  but found them significant enough to include in their published study  and to urge further investigation    By establishing a new Commission  I believe our great nation will be able to give finality to  and complete the account of federal actions to detain and intern civilians of Japanese ancestry    30
