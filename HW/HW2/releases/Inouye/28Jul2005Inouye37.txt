nearly  158 4 million for 18 transportation related improvement projects   The conference report also includes language authorizing the Honolulu Rapid Transit project within the New Starts program   This authorization will allow the project to move forward and  at the appropriate time  will permit the appropriation of federal funds    The funding for the projects is part of House Bill 3  the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   that House and Senate conferees have approved   After final approval by both the House and the Senate  the measure will be sent to the President to sign into law   In addition to the funds earmarked in the bill for the projects  the bill sets several formulas for the distribution of other program funds   Hawaii will receive a total of nearly  137 7 million over the next four years from the Federal Transit Administration   From the Federal Highway Administration  Hawaii will receive nearly  169 million each year over the next four years   In addition  a total of  32 75 million in highway and transit projects are provided in excess of the formula distribution   Senator Inouye said  I am especially pleased that Saddle Road on the Big Island will receive  50 million for the continuation of the work to the non military portion of the road   This project has been one of my top priorities   When all of the work on Saddle Road is finished  the travel time and distance between Hilo  where most of the Big Islands population is concentrated  and the Kona Coast  where much of the islands employment growth is occurring  will be significantly reduced   Motorists will no longer have to use traffic congested Hawaii Belt Road   Saddle Road will  in effect  become a bypass that cuts 16 miles from a trip between Hilo and Kailua Kona   Senator Akaka added  The additional resources included in the conference report will help to strengthen the transportation infrastructure of Hawaii that is currently suffering from excessive congestion and rapid growth in certain areas   This legislation is an important step toward meeting the enormous traffic demands of  our State   We must continue to work together to improve our transportation systems in Hawaii    As a result of the efforts of the Hawaii Congressional Delegation  the following are Hawaii projects will receive funding   Saddle Road

included in the bill that authorizes the development of an intermodal expansion program for Hawaii   While this program is not currently funded  it will permit the State to work with the federal government to develop infrastructure capacity to adequately handle increased intermodal use of its port facilities   Hawaiis ports are not only a major cruise ship destination  but also handle large volumes of cargo  Senator Inouye said   As a unique maritime state  Hawaii imports 80 percent of its needed goods  and 98 percent are shipped via water   In Fiscal Year 2002  commercial harbor facilities handled 16 9 million tons of cargo  and nearly 240 000 cruise ship passengers visited our States ports   It is estimated that by 2007  650 000 cruise ship passengers will visit Hawaii annually   We must be prepared to cope with this increased use of our ports and harbors     30
