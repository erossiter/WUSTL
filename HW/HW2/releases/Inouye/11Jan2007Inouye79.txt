 197 000 APPROVED FOR INTERIM RESTORATION OF WATER TO PARTS OF THE KOHALA DITCH  INOUYE AND AKAKA ANNOUNCE           197 000 APPROVED FOR INTERIM RESTORATION OF WATER TO PARTS OF THE KOHALA DITCH  INOUYE AND AKAKA ANNOUNCE    Thursday  January 11  2007           For Immediate Release                           U S  Senators Daniel K  Inouye and Daniel K  Akaka announced today that the U S  Department of Agriculture has approved  197 000 to assist the Big Islands Kohala community with the restoration of the flow of water for parts of the Kohala Ditch irrigation system  The system  which has served the community well  was developed in the plantation era 75 years ago  But the passage of time and a lack of maintenance have taken their toll   Senators Inouye and Akaka said a federal private partnership  the Biosystems Technology Oversight Committee  recommended funding the pumping of water from two existing wells into portions of the Kohala Ditch to provide a supplemental source of water while the main portion of the irrigation system is undergoing repairs  The failure of the system at one of the major intakes for the irrigation system cut off the flow of water through the 75 year old Kohala Ditch  leaving agricultural businesses and portions of the community without a source of irrigation water  Businesses impacted included farms  ranches  and agricultural tourism operations  Senator Akaka and I are pleased that the Biosystems Technology Oversight Committee provided the leadership in assisting the Kohala community with this initiative  Senator Inouye said  Without assistance from this program  the community had very few options for an interim operation while a longer term solution is implemented  While this assistance from the Department of Agriculture is both timely and appreciated  Senator Akaka and I are fully aware that this initiative is also temporary and partial   Senator Akaka added  Senator Inouye and I are also aware that there are users of the irrigation system who will not benefit from this effort  and this is not acceptable  We will continue to work with the community to seek a long term solution that will benefit a broader portion of the community  There is no doubt in our minds that a reliable irrigation water supply is critical to the sustainable agriculture in the Kohala region       30
