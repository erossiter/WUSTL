INOUYE RESPONDS TO NCL ANNOUNCEMENT          INOUYE RESPONDS TO NCL ANNOUNCEMENT     Tuesday  April 10  2007           For Immediate Release                                       Washington  D C   In response to Norwegian Cruise Lines announcement of the temporary withdrawal of its third ship  the Pride of Hawaii  from the Hawaii market  effective February 2008  United States Senator Daniel K  Inouye stated    I am proud of the great strides made  through the robust growth of a cruise ship sector  to further diversify Hawaiis tourism industry  making our island state the fastest growing domestic cruise destination in North America  Since NCL Americas entrance into the market in 2004  Hawaiis cruise capacity has quadrupled    There is no doubt that I am disappointed with NCLs announcement to temporarily withdraw the Pride of Hawaii from Hawaii waters  It was a very difficult decision that President and CEO Colin Veitch had to make for the good of the overall company as he and his corporate team work to further grow demand in the Hawaii market  I respect his decision and look forward to the day that we will be able to welcome the Pride of Hawaii back to Hawaiis shores  hopefully in the not too distant future     30
