CONGRESS APPROVES  73 4 MILLION FOR HAWAII PROJECTS         CONGRESS APPROVES  73 4 MILLION FOR HAWAII PROJECTS   Initiatives Support Marine Resources  Education  Youth Outreach  and the Fight Against Ice           November 16  2005        For Immediate Release      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the Congress has approved nearly  73 4 million for a variety of Hawaii related programs that consolidate NOAA operations  support marine resource protection  promote astronomy education  and aid rural youth outreach and the fight against the illicit drug ice    The Hawaii initiatives are part of the final version of a Fiscal Year 2006 appropriations measure that includes funding for science initiatives  and projects involving the Departments of Commerce and Justice  The Senate passed the legislation today by a vote of 94 to 5  and sent it to the White House for the President to sign into law    These initiatives are vital for the well being of Hawaii and its residents  and several have a positive impact that go far beyond our island shores  Senate Inouye said  However  the President has mounted a concerted effort to abolish Department of Justice programs that support local police departments ever since he was elected  This year  despite his strongest efforts to date  my colleagues and I were able to save some of the federal funding that our police depend on    Accordingly  Hawaii and other states will continue to receive a level of funding to fight crime and illegal drugs  Nonetheless  the Presidents opposition has taken its toll  and states across the nation  including Hawaii  will wind up with reduced resources in the war on drugs and crime    On a positive note  more than  15 million will go to protect and manage endangered Pacific sea turtles and the Hawaiian Islands fragile coral reef ecosystems  operate the NOAA ship HIIALAKAI  and promote science and ocean education    Also   3 million in federal funds will help to
