ENERGY BILL INCLUDES INOUYE SPONSORED TAX INCENTIVE FOR USE OF DEEP WATER AIR CONDITIONING IN HAWAII         ENERGY BILL INCLUDES INOUYE SPONSORED TAX INCENTIVE FOR USE OF DEEP WATER AIR CONDITIONING IN HAWAII              June 29  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that legislation is moving in the Congress that could spur the use of ocean water to cool the Hawaii State Capitol and office buildings in downtown Honolulu   This is a less expensive  environmentally friendly approach that will help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels  Senator Inouye said   It also takes advantage of one of Hawaiis greatest assets  our cool ocean waters   At my request  a provision was inserted into the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that allows the State of Hawaii to issue private activity bonds for projects that use a relatively new technology  deep water air conditioning   These bonds would be issued outside of the States volume cap   Two projects using deep water air conditioning are under consideration for Hawaii  and both will cost roughly  120 million each   The tax incentive in the Energy Policy Act would permit the use of tax exempt bonds to defray the significant start up costs of such projects without the State having to use its limited allocation of private activity bonds   The Energy Act   which has passed both the House and Senate  will soon be considered by a House Senate Conference Committee   Later  the measure will go to the House and Senate for final approval  and then sent to the White House for the Presidents signature   The provision introduced by Senator Inouye was co sponsored by Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii   Last year  the Hawaii State Legislature passed a resolution expressing its support of the development of deep water air conditioning for use on the Island of Oahu   With deep water air conditioning  cool water from the ocean or a deep lake is pumped through a pipeline to a cooling system on the shore   An intake pipe is placed at a depth where the water temperature is 39 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit   A cooling station transfers the deep waters chill to water circulating in a closed loop pipeline system that provides air conditioning service to consumers   The water is returned to the ocean or lake through a diffuser located at a depth where the water is the same temperature as the returned water     30
