INOUYE OPPOSES TRIFECTA MINIMUM WAGE ESTATE TAX TAX EXTENDERS BILL          INOUYE OPPOSES TRIFECTA MINIMUM WAGE ESTATE TAX TAX EXTENDERS BILL   Thursday  August 3  2006           For Immediate Release      Washington  D C   U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye voted no on a Motion to Invoke Cloture to limit debate on a Motion to Proceed to consideration of a three part bill  which includes a minimum wage increase  estate tax reduction and extends expiring tax credits  Senate Majority Leader Frist failed to secure the 60 votes necessary to proceed  The vote was 56   42   Senator Inouye stated  At a time when we in the Congress are struggling to provide adequate funding to support basic education  health care  and affordable housing programs  at a time when our nations taxpayers are being called upon to continue to support the ever escalating cost of war in Iraq  I could not in good conscience agree to an estate tax cut for the very wealthy at a cost of about  267 5 billion over six years  beginning in 2010  I realize that family businesses and family estates in Hawaii will be impacted by this vote  however  the provisions of the 2001 Tax Relief Act will remain in place until 2010  providing additional time for meaningful debate of the issue    Additionally  I found it disingenuous to attach the minimum wage increase    2 10 over a three year period   using it as a carrot to aid the wealthiest in our land  Of course  we want to provide our working families with a living wage  Of course  we want to support our middle class by extending some very popular tax credits  However  holding the poor and middle class as hostages for a Republican promise to provide relief to the wealthy was just not right      30
