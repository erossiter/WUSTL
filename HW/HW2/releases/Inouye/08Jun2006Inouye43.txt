STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE CLOTURE VOTE ON THE AKAKA BILL          STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON THE CLOTURE VOTE ON THE AKAKA BILL           Thursday  June 08  2006        For Immediate Release                            WASHINGTON  I am disappointed by the outcome of the cloture vote  I did not expect or anticipate that the Administration of President Bush would issue the sort of misleading letter it did on Wednesday evening  less than 24 hours before the cloture vote    It was no secret that for nearly two months  Senator Akaka and I  together with Governor Lingle and our respective staffs  entered into extensive discussions and negotiations with officials from the White House  Department of Justice  and the Office of Management and Budget to work out matters of concern in S  147  the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act    The results of those negotiations were set forth in S  3064  Before the beginning of the consideration and debate of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act  Senator Akaka tried to have the text of S  3064 substituted in for S  147  and have it considered as original text  That request was denied by the Republican leadership    The White House was grossly disingenuous in its letter to indicate its opposition to S  147  the original version of the bill  We all knew  the White House knew  the Republican opposition knew  that the legislation had been reworked to address all concerns  and that the result was S  3064    Then the Republican leadership used the letter to urge the majority to vote against the Akaka bill  saying this was the Administrations position    I was wrong to assume that Majority Leader Frist would be forthcoming  after his agreement with Senator Akaka and me to have the Akaka bill taken up by the Senate  We waited patiently for months  even past the agreed upon deadline for floor consideration of the Akaka bill  believing he would at least grant us the privilege of proceeding  But without cloture  we will not now have full debate on the Akaka bill    However  the record of the abbreviated debate on the cloture petition will be interesting reading for future scholars  Some of the claims by the Republican opposition was simply outrageous and misleading  to say the least  Heres just one example  It was suggested that the Akaka bill would set an ominous precedent  opening the door for the Amish and Hasidic Jews to establish a separate nation within the United States    Thats nonsense  The law is very clear  The Congress has the plenary authority to consider and grant government to government status with its aboriginal and indigenous natives  The Amish and Hasidic Jews are good people  but they are not aboriginal or indigenous people of the United States  I am certain that most Senators would realize that    I commend Senator Akaka for his tireless efforts to bring his namesake legislation this far  given the politically motivated obstacles that his measure had to face  But it would be premature to pronounce the Akaka bill dead  There is always tomorrow  Given all of the schemes used to derail the Akaka bill  I will not at this time reveal what we might do to advance this important piece of legislation for the First People of Hawaii    Finally  I am especially grateful for the support from the Republicans who voted with us  They were courageous in standing up to intense pressure from the White House and the Republican leadership     30
