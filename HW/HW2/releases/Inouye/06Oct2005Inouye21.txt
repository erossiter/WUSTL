SENATOR INOUYE IS SUCCESSFUL IN HIS LATEST EFFORT TO HELP THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AND MANOA VALLEY RECOVER FROM LAST YEARS MASSIVE FLOODING         SENATOR INOUYE IS SUCCESSFUL IN HIS LATEST EFFORT TO HELP THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AND MANOA VALLEY RECOVER FROM LAST YEARS MASSIVE FLOODING           October 6  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye has been successful in his most recent efforts to help the University of Hawaii and Manoa Valley recover from the massive flooding and severe storms of October 30  2004   As a result  the University of Hawaii at Manoa could possibly receive as much as  20 million to cover the replacement costs of educational and research materials damaged by last Octobers massive flooding and severe storms  and also non covered losses related to the disaster  At my request  language was included in the final version of the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider losses under those two categories to be eligible for the Federal Emergency Management Agency Public Assistance Program  Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  said today  Although no dollar figure is included in the provision  University officials have stated that  10 million are needed for Hamilton Library to partially offset the costs of the damage to educational and research materials  and an additional  10 million are needed for non covered expenses that resulted from the flooding that occurred on October 30  2004  Funds from the Public Assistance Program will go a long way to help make the University whole again  While the massive flooding that hit the University and Manoa Valley is in no way comparable to the flooding that swept across the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  these weather related disasters underscore the need for an effective federal response that is crucial to helping affected areas recover  The Public Assistance Program is an important part of that recovery response  The Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is now awaiting final approval by both the House and the Senate  Combined with other funding proposals and grants  the federal government is poised to allocate as much as  29 4 million in storm relief for the University and Manoa Valley  Two other funding bills  both now under consideration by House and Senate conferees  will provide a combined total of  6 6 million in storm relief  Two earmarks  each for  3 million  are for flood prevention and watershed improvements to prevent massive flooding in Manoa Valley  and for partially offsetting the replacement costs for educational and research materials and other non covered losses at the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources   An additional  600 000 would be used to initiate the expansion of the Ala Wai Canal feasibility study to include the Manoa  Palolo  and Makiki streams in order to evaluate flood mitigation measures and prevent future damages of the type that arose from last years flooding in Manoa Valley  I look forward to continuing to work with all levels of government  federal  state  and county  to ensure a full and complete recovery from last Octobers flooding  Senator Inouye said  We must all work together in the years ahead on flood mitigation and related projects that can prevent the type of damage that was caused by last Octobers flooding   In May of this year  Senator Inouye announced that the University of Hawaii at Manoa was granted nearly  2 8 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist in its recovery  A total of  1 9 million was earmarked for Hamilton Library  which suffered extensive building damage and the destruction of its collectives and archives  while  854 346 was earmarked to cover damages to the Biomedical Science Building       30
