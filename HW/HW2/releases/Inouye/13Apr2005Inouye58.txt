VETERANS STATE HOME IN HILO MOVING FORWARD         VETERANS STATE HOME IN HILO MOVING FORWARD  April 13  2005 For Immediate Release         Washington  D C   In response to concerns raised about the future of the Veterans State Home in Hilo  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye is pleased to announce that the combined federal state funds of  20 million for this important project are fully committed and not in jeopardy   Hawaii Health Systems Corporation is moving forward with the construction   Contracts have been signed with Architects Hawaii  Ltd   construction management firm Rider Hunt Levett and Bailey  and building contractor Dick Pacific   Senator Inouye stated  The demolition phase of the old Hilo Hospital  the site of the VA State Home  is about 80 percent complete   A groundbreaking is planned for August 2005  and the first resident welcomed through the new doors by about December 31  2006   During this construction phase  I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to hopefully convince the White House of the importance of safeguarding the per bed allocation to be paid  to ensure that when the doors of our facility open  our veterans will have the care and comfort they deserve     For me  it is part of a simple promise our nation made at the time of enlistment  whether 60 years ago or 60 days ago   If we cannot uphold our obligation to our aging veterans  I fear it sends a very loud and negative message to your young  able men and women contemplating enlistment  at a time when we as a nation are having increasing challenges in the recruitment and retention of both active duty  reserves and National Guard   We simple cannot afford to be so shortsighted  Inouye stated       30
