Senator Inouye on the Nomination of The Honorable John G  Roberts  Jr   to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court         STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE on the Nomination of The Honorable John G  Roberts  Jr     to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court           September 28  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today delivered the following statement on the nomination of the Honorable John G  Roberts  Jr   to be Chief Justice of the U S  Supreme Court  I had the privilege and honor of meeting with Judge Roberts  I was impressed by his legal scholarship  but expressed a hope that he would be forthright and open with the American people as he progressed through the Senate confirmation process  Although I must regretfully conclude that there are still questions outstanding on Judge Roberts record  in light of the urgency of ensuring that our nations Supreme Court has its full complement of justices  I agree with my Democratic and Republican colleagues that his nomination should be given an up or down vote     I have studied the development of the Supreme Court by our Founding Fathers  and it is apparent to me that our nations leaders did not want this group of citizens to be subjected to the political pressures of the day  so they provided for lifetime appointments  with no termination date  Further  candidates were not required to be lawyers  perhaps as a reminder that legal brilliance alone does not qualify a man or woman to sit on the bench of our highest court  Integrity  compassion  and wisdom are also required in equal  or perhaps greater  measure   Reconciling lifetime appointments with the demands of democratic elections  created understandable consternation  After much debate  our Founding Fathers provided that the Executive and Legislative Branches of our federal government would employ every means available to them to make certain that the selection is a wise one  and one that a nation could live with for the lifetime of the judge  Today  we walk again the careful path laid out by the Founding Fathers to ensure for the American people that Judge Roberts is a man worthy of their trust  Fully realizing that Judge Roberts will most certainly receive substantial support from the United States Senate  I will cast my vote against this appointment  I do not object to Judge Roberts politics  nor do I object to his personal beliefs  Our Democracy guarantees him both the freedom to think and speak as he chooses  and the opportunity to ascend to any position in our government for which he is qualified   My concerns lie instead with the failure of the Department of Justice and the White House to honor the request of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to make available certain documents relating to sixteen cases Judge Roberts worked on when he served as Principal Deputy Solicitor General  These documents  written during Judge Roberts tenure in his most senior Executive Branch position  are relevant to the Senates evaluation of his fitness to serve as the Chief Justice of the highest court of this land     I am not suggesting that these documents might contain dark shadows  far from it  The refusal of the White House to allow the American people to see this corner of Judge Roberts record  however  deviates from the careful road our Founding Fathers paved for us so many years ago  and leaves Americans wondering  Do those papers hide something I should know  Many groups have questioned Judge Roberts position on civil rights  His early writings outline defiance toward review of civil rights violations by federal courts  and many have asked how his views have evolved over the years  As one who has spent his life fighting against baseless prejudice and discrimination  I share these concerns  Would the papers withheld from our sight have answered these questions  We will never know  Throughout my career I have supported a womans right to choose  I have supported Roe v  Wade  I have also supported stem cell research  The responses Judge Roberts provided when questioned about these issues did not assure me that these questions would be seriously considered  I hope I am wrong  Perhaps the papers hidden from our sight would have allayed my fears  Similarly  my questions on Judge Roberts thoughts on the death penalty  and habeas corpus review by the federal courts will never be answered   I am not against the person  As I noted  I am impressed by his legal scholarship  Although we seem to differ on the fundamental issues of the day  I respect his right to freely form and hold his own opinions  I do  however  object to the failure of the White House  the Department of Justice  and ultimately Judge Roberts himself  to make available documents from his past  The American people deserve a nominee unclouded by needless secrecy  and our Democratic heritage demands that the President and the Congress work together to confirm the worthiness of any man or woman to sit as a Supreme Court Justice  To affirm my allegiance to these most American of principles  I will vote  no     30
