special openness and warmth that has made our islands the most unique and welcoming place in the world  But modern day Hawaii has not treated its First Citizens well  Federal initiatives  particularly

provide for the culturally relevant and appropriate Native Hawaiian health care and education programs  These programs help reduce the health and education disparities found in our Native Hawaiian communities    The language reaffirming funding for the regional laboratory and the appropriations for the other Hawaii projects are part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Departments of Labor  Health and Human
