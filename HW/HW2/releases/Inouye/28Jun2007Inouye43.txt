SENATOR INOUYE COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION REFORM          SENATOR INOUYE COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION REFORM     Thursday  June 28  2007           For Immediate Release             WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye issued the following statement following todays procedural vote by the Senate on the Immigration Reform Bill    We are confronted by the reality of 12 million immigrants who have entered the United States without going through the proper and legal channels  Compounding this situation is the fact that many are parents whose children were born in the United States  As a result  their children are U S  citizens    Many of my colleagues have been soundly criticized as favoring amnesty because they supported the immigration reform bill  But a careful reading of the proposal reveals that it is far from being an amnesty measure    The question now is  What do we do now  Are critics suggesting that we conduct a massive roundup of all who are here illegally  If so  what happens to their children    I am especially concerned about the young children who  because of their parents immigration status  must live in the dark shadows of the United States  This is not the way to raise young boys and girls    The Immigration Reform Bill was not perfect  It was easily subject to nitpicking  But it was a compromise solution that would have allowed us to address aspects of this crucial issue    It did not completely address all of my concerns  such as a family reunification  But I would have voted for it because it would have been a step forward  We would still have had opportunities in the future to address immigration reform    I remain in favor of immigration legislation that is practical and fair  and that strongly supports family reunification  I also believe that the immigrants who have followed all the legal and proper procedures should have the first opportunity to become citizens of our great country  They have waited patiently for many years      30
