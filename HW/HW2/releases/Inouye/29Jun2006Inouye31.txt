ANNOUNCES  Initiatives Are in Energy and Water Development  Interior  and Department of State Funding Bills for Fiscal Year 2007   Thursday  June 29  2006           For Immediate Release                                     WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee today approved nearly  67 1 million for more than 30 Hawaii related projects that address crucial issues such as harbor safety  flood control and mitigation  and conservation and environmental protection  as well as improvements to one of our nations most enduring symbols  the USS Arizona Memorial    One of the most important funding provisions is the appropriation of  14 5 million to complete improvements to Kikiaola Small Boat Harbor on Kauai  said U S  Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee    Senator Akaka  my partner in the Senate  and I knew that Kikiaola Harbor is important for the people on Kauai  So it became our top priority  too  The improvements will mean the elimination of dangerous break wave conditions within the entrance channel  and allow for the safe passage of vessels entering the basin    Kikiaola Harbor is located on the southwest coast of Kauai  between the towns of Kekaha and Waimea  The harbor improvements will consist of dredging an entrance and access channels  and modifying existing breakwaters to ensure a higher level of navigational safety    Since the project was first initiated more than 25 years ago  Senator Inouye has played a key role in securing the more than  22 million  which includes the  14 5 million approved today  in federal funds that cover nearly the total cost of the Kikiaola Harbor project  The State of Hawaii has contributed slightly more than  2 4 million    Senators Inouye and Akaka also worked together to secure funds for an expanded initiative to prevent the type of severe flooding that occurred on October 30  2004  when raging floodwaters rushed through Manoa Valley  causing more than  100 million in damages to homes and to the University of Hawaii    The appropriation of  300 000 for the expanded Ala Wai Canal Project does not seem like much  but it is a crucial investment that can save us millions of dollars in the future  Senator Inouye said  By studying the Manoa  Palolo  and Makiki streams  we will be able to determine and implement the best possible flood mitigation measures    Furthermore  the Ala Wai Canal Project is emblematic of a statewide strategy to combat and prevent damages caused by storms  The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill approved today also includes federal funds totaling nearly  1 2 million for flood related studies and work involving Kaawa  Moanalua Stream  Wailupe Stream  Iao Stream  and the Kahuku Watershed    Senator Inouye noted that the bill includes a Continuing Authorities Program  CAP  directive that the Army Corps of Engineers has full reprogramming flexibility to use available funds to prioritize its efforts in addressing the backlog of CAP projects  and to note those projects of greatest interest to the Congress  Although specific amounts were not listed  Hawaii projects of interest to the Congress include flood mitigation for Kuliouou Stream  Palai Stream  Waiahole Waikane Valley  Waialea Stream  and Wailele Stream  navigation improvements for Kahoolawe and North Kohala  and ecosystem restoration for Mokuhinia Mokuula  Kaunakakai Stream  and Kawainui Marsh    Other key Hawaii related initiatives in the Energy and Water Development  Interior  and Department of

000 for the Kaawa flood plain management study   100 000 for the Moanalua Stream Flood Damage Reduction Project   50 000 for the Maui hazard determination study  and  50 000 for the Wailuku town study  These funds  at the request of the State of Hawaii  were initially earmarked for the Waikiki Shore Protection Study   818 000  and the Kihei Shore Protection Study   143 000   But now the State is no longer interested in pursuing those two projects   Hurricane Evacuation Studies  1 000 000  This funding would be used for refining gathered data  including behavioral  hazard  and shelter analysis  and for the development of a Geographic Information System database for hydrographic  topographic  demographic  infrastructure information   Operations and Maintenance  890 000 The funds are allocated for project condition surveys   440 000   Barbers Point Harbor   245 000   and inspections of completed works   205 000   Surge and Wave Island Modeling Studies  750 000  This initiative would help to continue to develop the next generation of models for predicting hurricane induced maximum water levels and wave run up levels along coasts  Information from variable water levels and wave run up levels along with the correlation in time and event location will help in the planning and design of public works  and assist in hurricane preparedness for island communities   Pacific Island Land Ocean Typhoon Experiment  750 000  U S  mainland models consistently underestimate the storm surge inundation and are not applicable to island environments  Actual hurricane typhoon wave  water level  and meteorological data in an island environment are necessary to continue development of an island based storm surge inundation model   Regional Sediment Management Demonstration Program 500 000 These funds allow the Corps to continue with establishing baseline information on sediment condition in Southeast Oahu   Wailupe Stream Flood Damage Reduction Project  350 000  This appropriation for the Army Corps of Engineers would be used to continue a project to improve Wailupe Stream on Oahu  Wailupe Stream passes under a bridge on Kalanianaole Highway  and studies and past rainstorms show the bridge is inadequate to accommodate flood waters  This bridge serves approximately 67 000 vehicles daily  and the highway is the only transportation link between East Oahu and the City of Honolulu  Ala Wai Canal Project  300 000 The funds would be used to continue the expanded scope of the ongoing Ala Wai Canal project feasibility study to include the Manoa  Palolo  and Makiki streams  in addition to ecosystem restoration improvements  The goal  to evaluate flood mitigation measures and prevent future damages of the type that arose from the October 30  2004  flood in Manoa Valley  That flood caused more than  100 million in damages to Manoa homes and to the University of Hawaii   Iao Stream Flood Control  300 000 This is an ongoing project to build a levee system that would prevent this stream in Wailuku  Maui  from flooding   Pohiki Small Boat Harbor  220 000 The funds will be used to complete plans for the Pohiki project  Repairs to the breakwater are needed  Pohiki is the only harbor on the southeast side of the Big Island for subsistence commercial fishing and recreational boating   Kahuku Watershed Project  203 000 The funds would be used to assist in the final review and inspection of the feasibility and environmental documents before submission to the Congress  This project focuses on flood control improvements to Ohia Stream and Hospital Ditch   Kahului Deep Draft Harbor Project  100 000 This earmark is for a reconnaissance study of expansion of the Kahului Harbor  Kahului Harbor is the only commercial harbor serving Maui  and it has reached its capacity  Projected growth will increase operational inefficiencies  One possible option is to expand the coral stockpile area on the west side of the harbor  Development of the west harbor area will require dredging of a turning basin and berthing areas as well as improvements to existing breakwaters   Kalaeloa Barbers Point Harbor  39 000 These funds would be used complete final feasibility studies for modifications to improve cargo transportation efficiency by enhancing the harbor entrance channel and basin to allow larger  deeper draft vessels to enter the harbor  Additionally  a 375 foot jetty is being proposed to mitigate crosscurrents within the harbor entrance which pose a hazard to navigation  So far   1 344 000 in federal funds have been provided for this project    BUREAU OF RECLAMATION  Hawaiian Reclaim and Reuse Study  500 000  This appropriation would be directed to the Lahaina project to distribute recycled water from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility for non potable uses  The West Maui Reclaimed Water Master Plan calls for a four phase process to upgrade the West Maui system  The first phase is to rehabilitate the wastewater collection system to reduce saltwater intrusion into the system  This will result in lower salinity levels in the reclaimed water  making it more useable  This phase is essential to minimize salinity and enable treated water to be used in productive   The following are the Hawaii related earmark in the Senates Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Interior Appropriations Bill   Expansion of James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge  8 000 000  The acquisition of additional lands would restore historical wetland habitat and form the largest managed freshwater wetland on Oahu  It would connect the two existing units and create a protected flyway between them to provide essential habitat for both the four endangered waterbird species and migratory waterbirds  Protecting this coastal dune ecosystem would preserve native strand plants and protect coastal wildlife  such as threatened sea turtles  seabirds  migratory shorebirds  and possibly even the endangered Hawaiian monk seal  With these additional lands  support facilities could be constructed in order to sponsor environmental education and interpretation programs  visitor services  and habitat management programs  Additionally bringing these lands under a conservation regime would allow for better development of flood plain control  minimizing damaging floods to neighboring  populated areas   Replacement of USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center  3 685 000 This project is to replace the existing USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center Headquarters with two separate facilities  The replacement Visitor Center complex will be a single story multi structure facility of approximately 23 600 square feet  It will provide space for all essential visitor services  a museum  two theaters  bookstore  a classroom  and security  A mix of exterior and interior spaces in the new Visitor Center will be used to reduce air conditioned space and long term costs  Support space for the National Park Service and the Arizona Memorial Museum Association staff will be minimal with their main offices and storage in a separate Headquarters facility  The Headquarters facility will be approximately 10 700 square feet and will accommodate all support functions and curatorial storage   Brown Tree Snake Control  2 673 000 The requested funding for this program in FY 2007 will support the cooperative efforts of the U S  Departments of Agriculture  Defense  Transportation  and the Interior  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  the Territory of Guam  and the State of Hawaii  Funds will be used to  Evaluate and improve brown tree snake control products including toxicants  repellants  fumigants  sterilants  attractants  artificial baits  and aerial delivery of control products  increase and improve methods of detection  monitoring and control through rapid response plans  canine teams  controlling pathways  barrier installation  and trapping amongst others  create and maintain areas to protect endangered species and other wildlife from the brown tree snake  and prevent the introduction of a new brown tree snake prey species  coqui frog  to Guam  this invasive frog species was introduced to Hawaii in recent years via imported nursery plants   Kealakekua Ranch  2 000 000  The Kealakekua Ranch project is a 9 000 acre easement acquisition on an 11 814 acre property on the western slope of Mauna Loa in South Kona on the Big Island  The property contains many different forest types  including mixed open forest  closed ohia lehua rainforest  open koa forest with mamane  and open koa forest  This forest mosaic supports a wide variety of federally listed threatened and endangered plant and animal species  This is the first phase of a two phase transaction   Exploratory Wells and Hydrological Data Collection  1 000 000 Since 1993  the U S  Geological Survey has carried out an exploratory drilling program in Hawaii  During this period  approximately 30 monitoring wells across the state have been drilled  These wells have permitted a more detailed assessment of water resources in many areas  The data collected have been used to revise fundamental concepts regarding the movement of ground water in volcanic areas  and to help clarify issues relating to the effects of groundwater development on the preservation of stream flow and the protection of Native Hawaiian cultural practices  The wells have also allowed the counties to address the increasingly stringent federal regulation of water purveyors by defining groundwater surface water relations and developing a regional understanding of groundwater sources in relation to potential contamination sources  This funding will also be used to incorporate streams in the data collection  Aid to the State of Hawaii for Invasive Species  800 000 With this funding  the Fish and Wildlife Services could increase its ability to deal with invasive species within the state by providing federal matching funds for new state invasive species initiatives through the Hawaii Invasive Species Council  HISC   providing funding to continue support of collaborative  interagency  and community based initiatives to control invasive species on a county level  and by providing funding for high priority projects that address the control of specific established or incipient invasive species in Hawaii  such as Miconia   Hawaiian Culture and the Arts Program  600 000 This programs efforts are focused on assisting Hawaiians to be practitioners of their culture in a rapidly changing multicultural world  Four priorities support these efforts  increase access to resources  provide opportunities to learn and practice  provide opportunities to celebrate the culture  and create partnerships to enhance the programs efforts  The four priorities are achieved through a network of Cultural Learning Centers linked electronically to a Resource Center at the Bishop Museum   Hawaii Endangered Bird Conservation Program   Operations and Aviaries  550 000 The last sighting of a wild alala was in 2002  and biologists fear the only remaining birds are the 52 in captivity at the Keauhou and Maui Bird Conservation centers  Currently  these facilities are unable to accommodate additional apirs of alala  which are are needed to stabilize the captive flock genetically and demographically  The centers are also crucial to the recovery of other endangered Hawaiian forest birds  such as the Maui parrotbill  the puaiaohi  and the palila  Volcano Hazards Program  450 000 This funding would support the cooperative partnership between Hawaii Volcanos Observatory and the University of Hawaii Center for Study of Active Volcanoes  In addition to the basic activities of the partnership  the funding will be used to acquire and install better monitoring equipment on Mauna Loa  and recruit entry level seismologists to ensure that Hawaii will have a continuous community of scientists and professionals at the Observatory  and be able to develop a Volcanoes Hazards Data Center   Royal Mausoleum Mauna Ala Restoration Project  350 000 Since 1864  Maunaala has been the resting place for the Alii of Hawaii  Six of the eight monarchs of the Kingdom of Hawaii and nearly 50 of their family members are interred there  After 142 years of wear and tear from the elements and thousands of visitors  Maunaala is in need of major repairs and maintenance  with major repair work needed to be done on the crypts  the chapel  and the royal cemetery walls   Experimental Tropical Forest  300 000 Hawaiian forests are the only forests in the United States not served by an experimental forest  The vision of the Hawaii Experimental Forest is a research  demonstration  and educational forest focusing on ecological  economical  and cultural values important to all Hawaiians  The sites selected for the experimental forest will provide both research challenges for world class scientists  and learning opportunities for students of all ages  This earmark would fund part of the infrastructure and personnel needs to ensure establishment of this project   The following is the Hawaii related earmark in the Senates Fiscal Year 2007 Department of State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs Appropriations Bill    DEPARTMENT OF STATE  East West Center  19 000 000 The Honolulu based East West Center is a highly respected federal education
