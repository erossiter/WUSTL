SENATE APPROVES NEARLY  35 4  MILLION FOR INITIATIVES THAT AID HAWAII AGRICULTURE         SENATE APPROVES NEARLY  35 4  MILLION FOR INITIATIVES THAT AID HAWAII AGRICULTURE              September 22  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the Senate has passed a bill that will provide Hawaii with nearly  35 4 million for agriculture related initiatives in Fiscal Year 2006   Key initiatives include  10 million for the continued construction of the U S  Pacific Basin Agriculture Resource Centers laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Hilo  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   Two other initiatives  each for  3 million  address needed improvements in the aftermath of the severe flood that hit Manoa Valley and the University of Hawaii on October 30  2004   One is an earmark for flood prevention and watershed improvements to prevent massive flooding in Manoa Valley   The second appropriation would partially offset the replacement cost of damage to research and educational materials and other non covered losses at the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources   While the damage caused in Manoa Valley and at the University is in no way comparable to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina  both weather events underscore the important role the federal government can and should play in storm prevention and recovery   The Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Agriculture Appropriations Bill also includes an Inouye sponsored amendment that prohibits the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services  APHIS  from demolishing or dismantling the Hawaii Fruit Fly Production Facility in Waimanalo   The APHIS decision to destroy the Waimanalo facility has also stirred concerns in other states     More time is needed for the agency to work with stakeholders in all impacted states in finding and implementing an acceptable plan of action  Senator Inouye said   Releases of sterile insects have played an important role in the success of most pest control or eradication programs  particularly in Hawaii   It is in this context that I have concerns with the agencys decision   First  relying solely on Guatemala as a source of sterile Mediterranean fruit flies places the United States at risk if the supply from Guatemala is curtailed for any reason   In these times of terrorist activities and civil unrest  disruption is much more than an academic debate   Second  from a Hawaii perspective the permanent closure of the facility in Waimanalo would not bode well for the future of diversified agriculture in Hawaii   Unfortunately  Hawaii is infested with four fruit fly pest species  not just the Mediterranean fruit fly   Any hope of area wide control or eradication of these pests requires efficient rearing of all four species for sterile release programs   The Senate passed the appropriations legislation for the Department of Agriculture today by a vote of 97 to 2   The measure now advances to a House Senate conference committee to resolve differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill   The final version of the measure will move to both the House and Senate for final approval  and then be transmitted to the President to sign the legislation into law      Here are the other Hawaii related
