STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM          STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM     Friday  June 08  2007           For Immediate Release                                                  WASHINGTON  As a result of a late night procedural vote yesterday  Thursday  June 7  2007   the Senates consideration of immigration reform is on hold for now    When the Senate again focuses on this important issue  I will continue to do my best to ensure that the legislation that emerges is practical and fair  and strongly supports family reunification  During the two weeks of immigration debate  I supported amendments that strengthen family reunification  including one that exempts the children of certain Filipino veterans of World War II from numerical visa limits  thereby allowing sons and daughters to care for their aging parents  I also believe immigrant families help our nation to flourish  They bring an entrepreneurial spirit  and a willingness to work hard  As a result  immigrants become productive members of our society    Furthermore  I want to be certain that immigrants who have followed all the legal and proper procedures to become U S  citizens have the first opportunity to become citizens of our great country  They have waited patiently for many years  and must not be pushed to the back of the line    We must also find a reasonable way to deal with the 12 million people who are in the United States illegally  They cannot be ignored  Some 70 000 of their sons and daughters have served in the U S  Armed Forces  That is clear evidence of their patriotism and support of the United States    30
