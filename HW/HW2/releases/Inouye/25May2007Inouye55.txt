INOUYE SECURES  38 MILLION FOR POST EARTHQUAKE AGRICULTURE RELIEF AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS          INOUYE SECURES  38 MILLION FOR POST EARTHQUAKE AGRICULTURE RELIEF AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS     Friday  May 25  2007           For Immediate Release                                                WASHINGTON  Hawaii will receive nearly  38 million for agricultural disaster and emergency highway relief to help the state recover from an earthquake that shook the islands last year  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today  The funds are part of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that is now before the President to sign into law  following House and Senate approval yesterday    The emergency supplemental appropriations bill deserved my support because it benefits Hawaii  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  I also voted for this bill because    with congressional supplements  it increases funding levels to ensure that our troops  needs are met and their safety enhanced  The White House s proposal was inadequate in a number of areas for our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  Knowing what I know  I could not put at risk the needs of our troops any longer    I am  however  disappointed that  because of the opposition of the White House and because of the urgent need to provide the funds in this bill    the Congress was unable to include the goal of having a flexible timetable for reducing our forces in Iraq  Having said that  I believe the Congress will continue to press the point  and will continue to be supported by the American people  in trying to find a way to reduce our involvement in the Iraqi civil war  This must be done    This bill adds  1 2 billion to accelerate the production of the MRAP  the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle  which is the most protected vehicle from the increasingly dangerous road side bombs  The Congress is taking care of the health of our servicemen and servicewomen by adding a total of  1 9 billion to our military health care programs  That includes initiatives to fix problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  and also to hire additional staff to treat our wounded military personnel    HIGHWAY ROADWAY EMERGENCY REPAIRS   For Hawaii  included in this bill is more than  35 7 million to reimburse the state and county for repairs to highways on the Big Island and Maui that were damaged by the quake  These funds will be used for debris removal  slope  shoulder and road repairs  as well as retaining wall construction  The breakdown is as follows    Big Island   32 6 million  Route 11   Mamalahoa Highway   Route 19   Hawaii Belt Road   Route 160   Napoopoo Road   Route 180   Mamalahoa Highway   Route 190   Mamalahoa Highway   Route 240   Honokaa Waipio Road   Route 250   Kohala Mountain Road   and Route 270  Akoni Pule Highway      Maui   3 1 million  Route 30   Honoapiilani Highway     KOHALA IRRIGATION SYSTEM REPAIRS   Also included is approximately  2 2 million for the repair of the Kohala Irrigation System on the Big Island  which was damaged by the earthquake of October 15  2006  and for assistance to farmers and ranchers in the Kohala area who suffered damages    I am pleased that my colleagues agreed with me that the damages suffered by farmers  ranchers  related businesses  and residents of the Kohala area were immense and justified federal assistance  Senator Inouye said  I am hopeful that the U S  Department of Agriculture will work cooperatively with state and local agencies and with the Kohala community to devise an effective restoration plan  On my part  I will be working closely with the U S  Department of Agriculture to urge it to implement such a plan and to release funds as soon as possible    Blocked tunnels and collapsed flumes have reduced water flows from about 10 million gallons per day before the earthquake to about 500 000 gallons per day     Reduced flows  even when supplemented by interim pumping measures  has severely impacted a large dairy in the area that produced one third of the milk consumed on the Big Island  and shut down a hydroelectric plant proving electricity for nearly 150 homes  The nearly 15 mile long irrigation system is the only reliable source of surface water serving the windward side of the Big Islands North Kohala District  It serves more than 500 North Kohala families whose livelihoods are tied to farming  ranching  or water related businesses    ASSISTING HAWAIIAN AIRLINES   Also included in the legislation is corrective language that allows Hawaiian Airlines and three other air carriers to be treated more equally as it relates to other airlines in terms of pension payments  Beginning in 2008  Hawaiian Airlines  which did not freeze all of its defined benefit plans when it was in bankruptcy  will have 10 years to pay off unfunded liabilities and also be able to use a lower interest rate to calculate plan contributions  This means Hawaiian Airlines will be able to save millions of dollars as it strengthens its financial posture  while allowing it to meet its pension obligations    30
