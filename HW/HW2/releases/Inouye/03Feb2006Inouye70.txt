U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW          U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT ON THE QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW           February 03  2006        For Immediate Release      WASHINGTON  The issue of basing an aircraft carrier in Hawaii was not addressed in the Quadrennial Defense Review  but it remains under consideration    The QDR notes that we now face challenges in a post 9 11 world marked by unpredictability and uncertainty  and that conflicts are no longer solely traditional  If circumstances change in the volatile Asia Pacific region  the need to base a carrier in Hawaii will take on greater urgency    I will continue to advocate that we have an aircraft carrier group based in Hawaii  The United States faces many challenges in the Asia Pacific region  and I remain convinced that having a carrier based in Hawaii will be crucial for our national security     30
