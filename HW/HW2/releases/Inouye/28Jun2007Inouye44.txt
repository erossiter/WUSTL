Advance to full Senate  Thursday  June 28  2007           For Immediate Release              WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that a total of nearly  75 million has been approved for Hawaii related projects that include ocean and marine life protection  public safety  astronomy  energy development  water management and flood control    The initiatives are part of three funding bills that the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced today to the full Senate    The big ticket projects involve the appropriation of nearly  20 3 million for the continued construction of a regional facility for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at Ford Island in Pearl Harbor  and  20 million for the East West Center  the highly respected education and research organization that has done much to widen and deepen understanding of the important Asia Pacific region  Senator Inouye said    However  even initiatives set to receive smaller amounts of funding are equally important to Hawaii and the nation  I can cite many examples  but here are just a few  the University of Hawaiis International Pacific Research Center   2 million  the leader in conducting climatographic research over the entire Pacific  the Honolulu Police Department   1 million  to upgrade its crime lab to support its requirements and that of the neighbor island police departments  and the Renewable Energy Development Venture  nearly  1 3 million  to support renewable energy development in Hawaii    There are also funded projects that aim to prevent flooding  and involve the Kahuku Watershed  Ala Wai Canal  Manoa  Palolo  and Makiki streams in Honolulu  and Iao Stream in Wailuku  Other initiatives also bolster harbor safety at Port Allen Harbor and Nawiliwili Deep Draft Harbor  both on Kauai   The following are the Hawaii related initiatives in the Fiscal Year 2008 Departments of Commerce and Justice  and Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved today    DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE  NOAA Pacific Regional Facility  20 250 000  This request will fund the next construction phase of a regional facility for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Ford Island in Honolulus Pearl Harbor  Collocation of Hawaiis NOAA programs at a single facility will effectively catalyze their integration  The quirk of Hawaiis island geography has made it impossible for the agency s workforce to ignore one another s presence because they are all physically present on Oahu  Going one step further and bringing the pieces together under a single roof will spur the transformation and lead to a united whole with a grasp far beyond the shores of Hawaii out to the remote islands that would otherwise never have access to the breadth and depth of NOAA products we enjoy in the United States   Support for NWHI Commercial Fishermen  7 500 000  On June 15  2006  President Bush signed Presidential Proclamation 8031 creating the largest fully protected marine conservation area on the planet in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands  By applying the authority of the Antiquities Act  he created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument  As part of this Monument designation  commercial fishing in the Monument will be phased out over the next five years  and all commercial lobster fishing prohibited  The requested funding would be provided to the permit holders to compensate for future lost revenue due to the federal closure of their fishing grounds  NOAA Integrated Data and Environmental Applications Center  2 750 000 These funds are necessary to ensure the NOAA IDEA Center can continue to advance NOAAs mission objectives to help meet critical regional needs for ocean  climate and ecosystem information to protect lives and property  support economic development  and enhance the resilience of Pacific Island communities in the face of changing environmental conditions  The IDEA Center supports regional and global observing systems and programs and develops new  integrated data products and environmental applications for the region   Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale  National Marine Sanctuary Learning Center  2 000 000 These funds will be used to complete the construction of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary  HIHWNMS  Learning Center on Maui   International Pacific Research Center  2 000 000 These funds will support the University of Hawaiis International Pacific Research Center  IPRC   Funding for IPRC is based upon priority needs developed in consultation with NOAA  and is consistent with the goals of the climate change program and the National Climatic Data Center set by NOAA leadership  As one of the only institutions conducting systematic and reliable climatographic research over the entire Pacific region  the data produced by IPRC will be indispensable in furthering our understanding climate change   Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research  1 250 000  The Pelagic Fisheries Research Program  PFRP  conducted by the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research is a wide ranging primary and applied research program funded by a grant to the Joint Institute on Marine and Atmospheric Research  It supports the study of basic life history and biology of a number of target and incidental catch pelagic species  open ocean  important to Hawaii  In addition to basic and applied scientific research  the PFRP is now expanding into a broad range of socio economic studies that provide basic information on the conduct of commercial and recreational fisheries in Hawaii  their relationship to the broader market structure and society  and economic models of fishery operations  By expanding its scope from basic and applied fisheries research to include socio economic studies  the PFRP is now positioned to link research results to real world applications   Hawaii Fisheries Development  750 000  These funds will support efforts to make marine finfish culture technologies economically viable for commercial application  The future of the nations seafood supply depends upon the development of aquaculture technologies  Hawaii is uniquely positioned to take a lead role in aquaculture in the nation due to advantages in climate  geography  water  and species potential  Nearly all major fisheries have been depleted and the state imports over 70  of its seafood  The program has established a worldwide reputation for developing new marine fish culture technologies and plays a key role in national marine aquaculture development and fishery restoration initiatives  Funding will be used to develop core technologies in broodstock  live feeds  larviculture  and growout systems for warm water marine fish species including both food and ornamental species   Hawaii Seafood Safety and Inspections  750 000 The purpose of the Hawaii Seafood Program is to help the Hawaii fishing and seafood industry become more competitive in the U S  seafood market and sustain itself by pro actively addressing current and emerging concerns about the sustainability of the fishery and the safety of its seafood products    DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  Honolulu Police Department Crime Lab Improvements  1 000 000  The Honolulu Police Departments crime lab supports federal  state  and county law enforcement through a full spectrum of forensic analysis techniques  from DNA and fingerprints  to ballistics and chemical analysis  Currently  the lab is overworked  overcrowded  and suffers from a chronic backlog  Federal funding will support additional personnel  equipment acquisition  and the planning and design phase for the renovation of the lab facility   Comprehensive Methamphetamine Response Program  400 000  This program started with an appropriation of  4 million in FY 2003 to fund on the County of Hawaii  the Big Island  a comprehensive response to the plague of crystal methamphetamine  stepping up enforcement and prosecution  treatment and rehabilitation  and education and prevention to combat the proliferation of the use and distribution of crystal methamphetamine  and the resulting crimes and hardship  Since that time  the program has been spread county to county  and with an appropriation of  6 million in FY 2006  its reach will be statewide  Although the initiative continues to support the Big Island  its County Council is assuming responsibility for funding the programs started with federal funding  Until the counties are all ready to maintain their programs  continued federal support is critical   Hawaii Rural Youth Outreach Program  400 000  The rural communities of Hawaii have large numbers of at risk youth and high crime rates  The per capita income in these rural communities is low  and educational levels are also lowthe percentage of adults with college degrees is as low as one third the state average  These communities are affected by residential instability  ethnic diversity  and family disruptionthree factors that are strongly associated with higher crime rates among youth in rural areas  These rural communities lack youth programs and the infrastructure to support youth outreach activities  and this funding would go to the YMCA of Honolulu to work in partnership with the Boys  Girls Club of Hawaii to provide these critical services  The YMCA will cover rural Oahu  and the Boys  Girls Club will cover the neighbor islands    SCIENCE AGENCIES  Imiloa Astronomy Center  1 500 000  The Imiloa Astronomy Center will be a premier interpretive center for the world s finest and largest collection of operational astronomical observatories whose telescopes are located atop Mauna Kea  The funding request would both develop educational materials and programs  and also provide seed funding for essential staff as a first step toward realizing a sustainable business model    The following is the Hawaii related

geographically isolated part of the United States  Hawaii is particularly vulnerable to energy storages  This project would lessen Hawaiis dependence on fossil fuels    ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS  Hawaii Water Management Project  2 000 000  The funding continues construction of water systems in drought plagued areas of the state   Port Allen Harbor Breakwater Repair  1 700 000  The Port Allen Harbor breakwater on Kauai was built in 1948 to protect a 1 200 foot wide by 1 500 foot long harbor basin  As a result of damage caused by Hurricanes Iwa and Iniki in 1982 and 1992  respectively  and heavy storms in 1989  it is now a 1 126 foot mound of rubble  As a result  the breakwaters root section is in need of repair resulting from years of damaging waves  Without appropriated funds  the breakwater will continue to deteriorate  placing vessels and port facilities at risk from adverse wave conditions   Ala Wai Canal Project  700 000  Funding will continue the expanded scope of the projects feasibility study to include the Manoa  Palolo  and Makiki streams in addition to ecosystem improvement projects  The Manoa Stream flooding in 2004  which caused more than  100 million in damages to Manoa residences and the University of Hawaii  highlighted the need to mitigate future flooding events   Iao Stream Flood Control  500 000  This project is to correct a deficient levee system in Wailuku that has existed since 1981 when high flows undermined the levees  If not corrected  flood flows could inundate adjacent housing and commercial areas   Nawiliwili Deep Draft Harbor
