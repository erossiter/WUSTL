HOUSE AND SENATE CONFEREES AGREE ON MORE THAN  13 5 MILLION IN STORM ASSISTANCE FOR HAWAII          HOUSE AND SENATE CONFEREES AGREE ON MORE THAN  13 5 MILLION IN STORM ASSISTANCE FOR HAWAII           Friday  June 09  2006        For Immediate Release                             WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that House and Senate conferees have agreed on an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that will include more than  13 5 million in storm related assistance for Kauai and Oahu  which endured 42 consecutive days of devastating rainstorms and floods earlier this year    I am disappointed that the recovery assistance is less than what the Senate had approved  said Senator Inouye  But it was the firm decision of the Bush Administration that this appropriations measure be devoted almost entirely for funding the war in Iraq and Afghanistan  and for hurricane recovery along the Gulf Coast    While it was my desire that federal assistance reach the affected people of Hawaii as quickly as possible  it was clear that the Bush White House placed very little priority on Hawaii and other areas of the United States that experienced devastating natural disasters     Under the Senate version of the spending bill  Senator Inouye had secured  20 million to repair Kuhio Highway on Kauai and other roads on Oahu that had been damaged by the torrential weather that began on February 2  2006  However  at this time  Hawaii will receive a little more than  11 5 million because the State of Hawaii has assessed the damage at this lesser level    The conference measure also includes  2 million for dam break analyses of selected dams and reservoirs that may have been weakened by this years punishing weather  and may therefore pose a safety hazard   At this time  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  has issued grants totaling more than  500 000 for individual assistance  and the Small Business Administration has approved more than  1 3 million in loans for homes and businesses  Additional funding from FEMA is still being assessed for individual  public  and hazard mitigation assistance    Senator Inouye said  I am particularly interested in FEMAs commitment to stabilize Round Top Drive in Honolulu  including clearing the mudslide and debris  and reopening the road for the affected residents  as well as reimbursing the City and County of Honolulu for the emergency Beachwalk sewer line repair  which impacted the Ala Wai Canal and Waikiki beaches  I will continue to advocate for Hawaiis fair share of disaster recovery and mitigation funds through FEMA  and if necessary during the normal Fiscal Year 2007 appropriations cycle    The compromise legislation must now be approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate  and then sent to the President to sign into law       30
