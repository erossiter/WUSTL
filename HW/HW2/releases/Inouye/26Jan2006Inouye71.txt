Nomination of The Honorable Samuel A  Alito  Jr   To Be an Associate Justice of the U S  Supreme Court         STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE        On the Nomination of The Honorable Samuel A  Alito  Jr     To Be an Associate Justice of the U S  Supreme Court           January 26  2006        For Immediate Release     WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye today delivered the following statement on the floor of the U S  Senate on the nomination of The Honorable Samuel A  Alito  Jr   to be an Associate Justice of the U S  Supreme Court    Mr  President  at this moment in our history  our country faces a spectrum of challenges broader than any we have ever faced before  both at home and abroad  However great the storm we face today  I am confident that our nation  founded on the architecture of our Constitution  will prevail  The checks and balances it establishes among Congress  President  and Courts are the true arsenal of freedom  In the end  these checks and balances  in the hands of the American people  will prove greater than any assault on the precious freedoms and liberties our forefathers fought to establish    For the officials of our federal government  the protection of the institutions of our American democracy is a duty that both transcends and supersedes all others  especially for members of our Supreme Court who must interpret the Constitution of our nation as a living foundation for the freedom and liberty of our people  From confiding the power of the federal government in three co equal but separate branches of government  to guaranteeing the civil liberties that bless our nation  the Constitution enshrines principles that are as relevant today as they were when it was first penned  centuries ago    These cherished principles are the backbone of our nation  and they comprise the final yardstick for taking the mettle of any man or woman who would aspire to our nations highest court  I have studied the full record of President Bushs nominee  Samuel A  Alito  Jr   and carefully measured it against the sworn duties of the Supreme Court  Regretfully  I conclude that Judge Alito falls short    From his writings on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to his public speeches  I discern a man who would fundamentally rewrite the interpretation of our Constitution and leave in doubt the legacy of freedom it was meant to preserve  For many  this will mean his record on civil rights  reproductive choice  or the death penalty  Let there be no mistake  I share these concerns  and I have spent my life fighting for these rights  For me  however  the greatest area of doubt lies in Judge Alitos consistent preference for expanding the power of the President by relaxing the checks and balances the Constitution places on the Executive branch of government    In 1989 and 2000  Judge Alito gave speeches to the Federalist Society in which he embraced an obscure legal doctrine called the unitary executive theory  This so called unitary executive theory places the President almost above the law  Under this theory  independent counsel appointed to investigate Presidential misdeeds would be unconstitutional  Similarly  the theory holds that enforcement agencies independent of the President  such as the Securities Exchange Commission  the Federal Communications Commission  and the National Labor Relations Board  would also be unconstitutional because they are not under the Presidents control  The theory also justifies a President who would overstep Acts of Congress and the Constitution when acting as Commander in Chief    How Judge Alito might actually apply this unitary executive theory on the Supreme Court is  of course  an open question  Separated by a span of 11 years  however  his own speeches in 1989 and 2000  suggest that Judge Alitos views on the powers of the President are long held and strong    A memo he generated early in his career with the Reagan Administration amplifies this impression  In that memo  Judge Alito wrote on a Presidents authority to modify an Act of Congress by making a signing statement  a written document issued by a President on signing an Act of Congress into law  In the memo  Judge Alito wrote  that the Presidents understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress  This statement suggests that Judge Alito believes the President has a role in the legislative process not contemplated under the Constitutions exclusive grant of legislative power to the Congress    Judge Alitos writings and speeches show how he personally believes that the Congress should have less power to check and balance the President  His judicial opinions  issued in his official capacity as a judge on the Third Circuit  demonstrate a parallel conviction that the Congress should have less authority in general    In United States v  Rybar  Judge Alito wrote a minority opinion asserting that the Congress had no authority to pass laws to regulate machine guns  The majority opinion criticized Judge Alitos narrow and restrictive view of Congressional authority    In Chittister v  Department of Community and Economic Development  Judge Alito ruled that the Congress had no authority to allow State employees to sue for damages under the Family Medical Leave Act  Judge Alitos restrictive view on Congresss authority was later invalidated by the Supreme Court when it considered the same issue in a later case    Our Supreme Court shoulders the solemn task of discovering how the Constitution applies to the unique problems of the day  Through dialogue  study  and diligent inquiry  the Justices bring to bear the collected experiences of the nation  and forge justice from the Constitution by tempering its words with human compassion  wisdom  and integrity  Judge Alitos record suggests that he holds his personal beliefs on expanding the Presidents power so strongly that they might come before the call of justice  Accordingly  I have concluded that I must oppose his nomination    30
