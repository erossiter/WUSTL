INOUYE GAINS SENATE APPROVAL FOR AN ADDITIONAL  1 MILLION FOR STORM RECOVERY ASSISTANCE          INOUYE GAINS SENATE APPROVAL FOR AN ADDITIONAL  1 MILLION FOR STORM RECOVERY ASSISTANCE  But McCain Undermines Inouyes Push for Safety Inspections of Dams and Reservoirs Throughout the State          Wednesday  May 03  2006        For Immediate Release                       WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouyes efforts to provide additional storm related relief for Hawaii met with mixed results today  The Senate approved the Senators amendment to an emergency spending bill that will provide  1 million to assess the states water quality in the wake of the spill of raw sewage that temporarily closed Waikiki beaches  but rejected his provision to provide  900 000 for assessments of dams and reservoirs to ensure they do not fail  as happened with Kauais Kaloko Dam during the torrential rain and flooding earlier this year    The floor action was marked by high drama  For the second consecutive day  U S  Senator John McCain opposed Senator Inouyes efforts  and insisted that the two amendments were wasteful pork barreling  Senator McCain asked  When is it enough    Later  Democratic Leader Harry Reid noted that the President had issued a disaster declaration for Hawaii for the 42 day period that began on February 2  2006  and admonished Senator McCain for what he said was the Arizona Senators offensive remarks  This is beyond the pale to say to Dan Inouye   Have you no shame    Leader Reid told Senator McCain    Reid pointed out that Senator Inouye was doing his job in trying to secure federal funds for his state when an emergency occurs    Following Leader Reids remarks  Senator McCain apologized to Senator Inouye    The first amendment that Senator Inouye raised  for the inspection and evaluation of dams and reservoirs by the U S  Geological Survey  was rejected mainly along party lines by a vote of 53 to 43    The Kaloko Dam failure highlighted the need to inspect all other critical reservoirs and dams statewide  Senator Inouye said  The rejection of the amendment means that only Kauais dams and reservoirs will be inspected by the U S  Geological Survey because of a  500 000 provision already included in the 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill    The floodwaters from the Kaloko Reservoir on Kauai compromised the downstream Morita Reservoir  which officials have now declared to be unstable and dangerous  Senator Inouye said  The Kaloko and Morita reservoirs were built in the 1890s by the Kilauea Sugar Co  for irrigation purposes  Senator Inouye said    The Senate voted 51 to 45 to approve Senator Inouyes amendment to provide  1 million to the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and assess Hawaiis water quality    He told his colleagues that on March 24  2006  a Waikiki sewer line  weakened by storm waters  ruptured  and sent more than 48 million gallons of raw sewage into the Ala Wai Canal and led to the closure of Waikiki beaches    The water quality of other beaches and streams on the Island of Oahu was severely impacted by the sustained heavy rains that caused sewer overflows and runoff of tremendous amounts of sediment and pollutants  Senator Inouye said  High bacterial levels exceeded the recreational water quality standard  and the State Department of Health required beach closures    Yesterday  Tuesday  May 2  2006  the Senate rejected an amendment introduced by Senator McCain that would have stripped from the emergency funding legislation   6 million in assistance for two Hawaii sugar companies that suffered significant losses during the 42 consecutive days of torrential weather    Tomorrow  Thursday  May 4  2006  the Senate is scheduled to vote on the emergency funding bill  which now includes  34 5 million to help Kauai and other parts of the state recover from the punishing weather    30
