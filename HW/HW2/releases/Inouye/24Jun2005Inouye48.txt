U S  SENATOR DAN INOUYE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONTAIN THE COQUI FROG POPULATION ON THE BIG ISLAND         U S  SENATOR DAN INOUYE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONTAIN THE COQUI FROG POPULATION ON THE BIG ISLAND              June 24  2005        For Immediate Release  HONOLULU  HAWAII  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced that  225 000 will be available very shortly as the first wave of federal funding support to control and contain the coqui frogs on the Big Island     I was disappointed when the Bush Administrations Office of Management and Budget denied Hawaiis request for emergency funds from the U S  Wildlife Service office to eradicate the coqui frogs from Hawaii   I then went looking and found another federal funding source to at least begin the control and containment process on the Big Island  Senator Inouye stated     I am hopeful that the control measures developed on the Big Island can then be transferred and implemented in the other parts of our State   We need to get started  Inouye added   The  225 000 comes from the Biosytems Technology Program and will be managed by the Hawaii Island Economic Development Board  which in turn will coordinate the efforts of county  State  and federal agencies  and community groups   In addition  funding will be used to enter into cost sharing arrangements with local pest control operators now that the U S  Environmental Protection Agency has approved the use of hydrated lime to complement the use of citric acid to control the expansion of the coqui frog population   Another  400 000 is in the U S  Wildlife Office Fiscal Year 2006 budget which is pending consideration by the full Senate     30
