SENATOR INOUYE CITES FLAWS IN THE MAJORITY REPORT BY THE U S  COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS THAT CRITICIZED THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT          SENATOR INOUYE CITES FLAWS IN THE MAJORITY REPORT BY THE U S  COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS THAT CRITICIZED THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT           Thursday  June 08  2006        For Immediate Release                            WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye of Hawaii said today the U S  Commission on Civil Rights issued a flawed majority report on the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act  Given the reports weaknesses and lack of objectivity  it is difficult to see how it can be used to criticize the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act  which has the support of the American Bar Association  and leading civil rights organizations  such as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the National Congress of American Indians  Senator Inouye said   In a letter dated June 7  2006  that was sent to Senate leadership  the U S  Department of Justice cited the Commissions majority report as a reason why the Administration is not supporting the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act  also known as the Akaka Bill   However  Senator Inouye noted  the Government Accountability Office  the investigative arm of Congress  recently issued a report highly critical of the Commission  The Commission should strengthen its quality assurance policies and make better use of its state advisory committees  the GAO said  The Commissions majority report on the Akaka Bill is a case study of Commissions shortcomings that the GAO has identified  Senator Inouye added   In a statement that was inserted into the Congressional Record  Senator Inouye said   With respect to the Commissions report  I urge my colleagues to thoroughly examine the report and the proceedings leading to it  I say this because the majoritys report lacks credibility   both procedurally and substantively  I am confident that once my colleagues learn of the serious procedural and substantive flaws of the report  they will join me in rejecting the Commissions report and supporting S  147  the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2006   The first point that my colleagues need to consider is that this report is not even based on the measure that will be before us  During the Commissions January briefing  the Commissioners were provided with a copy of the Substitute Amendment that was publicly available since last fall and that Senator Akaka recently introduced as a separate measure  It is this language on which we will vote  Yet  even though the Commission was informed of this  the Commission based its recommendation on the bill as reported out of committee on May 16  2005  which is substantially different from the Substitute Amendment   Perhaps some think this was an oversight on behalf of the Commission but I assure you   it was not  During the Commissions May 4  2006 meeting  Commissioner Taylor specifically asked to which version of the bill this report referred  After a discussion on the record in which it was readily apparent that the Commissioners had no idea which version the report was referring to  the Commission had to recess for 10 minutes so that staff could determine to which version the report was referencing  Then  after calling the meeting back to order  the Commission stated that the report pertained to the version as reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs  ignoring entirely the Substitute Amendment  which they had been informed would be the measure considered by the Senate   Perhaps some may be thinking   what difference does it make  Let me assure you  the differences between the version reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Substitute Amendment are substantively different  In fact  the measure that will be before us reflects several weeks of negotiation between the Administration and Congressional Members to address concerns raised by the Administration   Before moving on to the substantive flaws of the Commissions report  I want to point out that one Commissioner filed an amicus brief in Rice v  Cayetano without ever publicly disclosing that involvement or recusing herself from the Commissions proceedings  Apparently  actions like these are par for the course for this Commission  It is actions similar to these that led to the recent findings of the Government Accountability Office that the Commission lacked procedures to ensure objectivity in its reports   The Commissions majority report also suffers from serious substantive flaws  Unlike the careful  thoughtful analyses contained in the dissenting opinions  the majority report is void of any analysis of the underlying bill or arguments  Instead  the so called report is merely a summary of the briefing held in January  a one sentence recommendation  and copies of the written testimonies provided during the January briefing  It is nothing more than he said this and she said that  Nothing in this document explains why one argument was rejected and another one accepted  I believe it is because the Commissioners know what we know   the law is on our side   Although this is apparently consistent with the way this Commission does business  it is unacceptable  The Government Accountability Office issued a report last week specific to the Commission and recommended that the Commission should strengthen its quality assurance policies and make better use of its State Advisory Committees  More specifically  the Government Accountability Office found that the Commission lacked policies for ensuring that its reports are objective  It also found that the Commission lacks accountability for some decisions made in its reports because it lacks documentation for its decisions  A review of the Commissions report on Native Hawaiians illustrates that this lack of accountability is clearly evident in this instance for the Commission provides no rationale for its finding on S  147   Another flaw with the Commissions recent report is that the Commission ignored two previous reports on related issues by the Hawaii State Advisory Committee  The Government Accountability Office acknowledged that the State Advisory Committees are the eyes and ears of the Commission  It also found that while the Commission does not have policies to ensure objectivity for its own documents  the Commission does have quality assurance policies in place for State Advisory Committee products  including a policy to incorporate balanced  varied  and opposing perspectives in their hearings and reports  The Hawaii State Advisory Committee heard from numerous witnesses and spent substantial time preparing two articulate  balanced reports on Native Hawaiian issues relevant to the measure before us  Yet the Commission ignored these reports  Imagine reports from the State Advisory Committee in your respective state   the entity with the most knowledge of local issues  that is the entity most in touch with the local communities  and that has quality assurance policies   not even being consulted or informed about a briefing on an issue that only impacts your State   Because the Commissions recommendation was based on a version of the bill that is not before us  is void of any analysis and is not supported by Supreme Court case law  it is difficult to address any arguments that may have influenced the Commissions decisions  Thus  I will take this opportunity to clarify some misconceptions that some of the Commissioners appear to possess   First  this matter is not race based as the Commissions recommendation implies  Instead  the Commission appears to have a fundamental misunderstanding of Federal Indian law  It is undisputed that the Supreme Court has upheld Congresss plenary authority over Indian tribes  including those aboriginal  indigenous peoples who exercised control over land that comprise the United States even if those peoples were not called Indians  were not organized as tribes  and did not have a government at that time   I am confident that if challenged  this measure will be upheld  For as then Attorney John Roberts  now Chief Justice Roberts  stated during oral argument in Rice v  Cayetano  The Framers  when they used the word  Indian  meant any of the Native inhabitants of the new found land and that Congresss power does  in fact  extend to Indians who are not members of a tribe   Second  it is absurd that there are some who think that because Congress delegated some authority to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to develop regulations to administratively recognize a group of people as an Indian tribe  Congresss power to exercise its own authority is now bound by those regulations  Let me remind everyone   the Congress is not subject to an agencys regulations  Congress still possesses the power to restore recognition to an Indian tribe and we have used this authority repeatedly without first determining whether a group met the criteria set forth in the Secretarys regulation    Thank you  Mr  President  for allowing me this opportunity to educate my colleagues about the true impact of the Commissions Report on this matter  I encourage my colleagues to examine the transcript of the January briefing and the May meeting  the Report with the dissenting opinions  as well as the recent Government Accountability Office Report on the Commission  I am confident that after doing so  my colleagues will understand that any reliance on this report is misguided    30
