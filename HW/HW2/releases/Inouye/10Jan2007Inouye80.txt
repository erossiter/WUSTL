INOUYE RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT BUSHS NEW STRATEGY FOR IRAQ          INOUYE RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT BUSHS NEW STRATEGY FOR IRAQ    Wednesday  January 10  2007           For Immediate Release                           Honolulu  Hawaii  In response to President Bushs new strategy for Iraq  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye commented    I have yet to carefully review the Presidents full proposal  However  as I recently stated  while I support the need to increase our armed forces to address growing instabilities in other areas  I do not support an increase of American troops in Iraq  It would only exacerbate a bad situation  and could signal the possible permanency of this conflict  The Presidents supplemental budget request of  5 6 billion to pay for his new commitment of troops will only put our nation further into debt  and will further reduce funding for basic domestic social programs that this White House has already cut to the detriment of many  many American families    Warfare is serious business  It should not be carried on or sustained because the action is politically correct  If we go to war  it must be because it is in our national interest  and in the interest of peace  Our citizens look to us to maintain peace  Decisions that must be made in the months ahead are not going to be easy  Nor will they be politically correct    Our national interest is involved  We must have the strength to proceed  and to do what is necessary to leave the battlefield with honor and return Iraq to its people       30
