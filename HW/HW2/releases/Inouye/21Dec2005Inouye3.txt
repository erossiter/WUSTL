U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT REGARDING HIS VOTE ON THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL         U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES STATEMENT REGARDING HIS VOTE ON THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL           December 21  2005        For Immediate Release          WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye was one of 50 Senators who voted against the Budget Reconciliation Bill that passed the Senate today when the Vice President cast the tie breaking vote   The following is Senator Inouyes statement regarding his vote   I voted against this measure because I wanted to voice my objection to the severe cuts made to socialservice programs  I dont see how the Bush Administration and the Congressional Republican leadership can face the American people  and justify their support for a bill that unravels our nations socialservice safety net and forces the poor and disabled to fend for themselves while a Republican agenda is pushed that benefits the rich and uppermiddle class with tax breaks and other incentives   At this time in our history when more Americans are struggling with tighter budgets and higher costs for health care and prescription drugs  the last thing we need to do is undermine vital programs such as Medicaid and Medicare  and student aid that widens access to higher education      30
