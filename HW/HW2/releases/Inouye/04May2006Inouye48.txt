SENATE APPROVES  37 5 MILLION IN STORM RELATED ASSISTANCE FOR KAUAI AND OTHER PARTS OF HAWAII          SENATE APPROVES  37 5 MILLION IN STORM RELATED ASSISTANCE FOR KAUAI AND OTHER PARTS OF HAWAII           Thursday  May 04  2006        For Immediate Release                        WASHINGTON  The Senate today passed the 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that includes  37 5 million in storm related assistance for Kauai and other parts of Hawaii that were battered by 42 consecutive days of punishing rainstorms and floods earlier this year  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced  The vote was 77 to 21    The House passed its version of the emergency spending bill by a vote of 348 to 71 on March 16  2006    I am pleased that the Senate bill  which includes the much needed assistance for Kauai and the state  is advancing to a House Senate conference committee that will reconcile differences in the House and Senate versions of the legislation  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee who was named a Senate conferee  I am well aware of the crucial role the funds will serve in helping all affected areas of the state  as well as residents and businesses  in recovering from the havoc causing weather  The funds will also help to ensure that the state can better withstand similar weather related emergencies    As a result of the Presidents declaration on May 2  2006  that Hawaii was a disaster area because of the 42 days of torrential weather that began on February 2  2006  the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was triggered  That means federal funds beyond the  37 5 million earmarked in the Senate bill will be available for individual  public  and hazard mitigation assistance  Senator Inouye said    Funds released through the Stafford Act can be used to clear the mudslide and debris from Round Top Drive in Honolulu  and reopen that road  Senator Inouye said  Homeowners on Kauai and Oahu may qualify for grants to repair damage that is not covered by insurance  and funds may be available to prevent or reduce long term risk to life and property from natural hazards    Senator Inouye noted that the President has threatened to veto the final version of the emergency appropriations bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  the Gulf Coast hurricanes  and other emergencies  and that some Republicans have threatened to vote to uphold such a veto if the measure contains more than the  94 billion the President requested    I would be very disappointed if the President were to veto the bill  and if the Republican majority upheld the veto  Senator Inouye said  The supplemental is more than what the President requested because the administration has consistently requested funds much lower than the actual cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and because the administrations previous budgets to address crucial social needs have been unrealistically low  I can assure everyone that the emergency funds for Kauai and the rest of Hawaii address important  and necessary  needs as a result of the more than 40 days and nights of unceasing rainstorms  floods  and mudslides  The President himself recognized the urgent needs in Hawaii when he issued his emergency disaster declaration    The following are the Hawaii earmarks in the Senate emergency spending bill      20 million for repairs to Kuhio Highway and other roads and road infrastructure        6 million in transportation funds to help sugarcane growers cope with their losses      3 million  through the U S  Department of Agricultures Natural Resources Conservation Service  NRCS   for the repair and rebuilding of the irrigation system infrastructure and removal of debris that are necessary because of the failure of the Kaloko Reservoir dam       An additional  3 million  requested by NRCS  for debris removal and stream  bank stabilization throughout Oahu  particularly the Windward side and Aiea        3 million to the U S  Army Corps of Engineers for water systems technical assistance and flood plain management services        1 million to assess the states water quality in the wake of the spill of 48 million gallons of raw sewage that temporarily closed Waikiki beaches  because a Waikiki sewer line  weakened by storm waters  ruptured  This was an Inouye sponsored amendment that the Senate added to the emergency appropriations bill      1 million for crop disaster assistance        500 000 for the U S  Geological Surveys Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program to provide assistance with conducting assessments of critical reservoirs and dams on Kauai  Those assessments include reservoir level instrumentation  post flood hydraulic assessments  and monitoring of dam structures using light detection imagery      A portion of the highway and agriculture assistance funds is for Windward Oahu    30
