WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved nearly  22 million for Hawaii related agricultural projects in Fiscal Year 2008    I am especially pleased that my fellow appropriators continue to support the creation of the centralized U S  Pacific Basin Agriculture Research Center in Hilo by approving  2 5 million for a portion of its second phase of construction  and more than  7 1 million for research by its staffers who are no longer scattered throughout the state  and are now working together in the completed first phase of the facility  said Senator Inouye  a senior member of the funding panel    This facility and its research work benefit not just Hawaii  but all of the United States  At a time when there is heightened concern over the quality of foreign food products entering the United States  the centers work is consistent with the federal mission to ensure high quality and safe food for consumers  It also ensures a competitive agricultural economy  Moreover  its research supports agriculture in the tropical and subtropical American Pacific  which is generally not available from the U S  mainland  The challenges our farmers face in our region are far different from those faced by farmers in the temperate zones    The funding measure also includes nearly  2 8 million for agriculture pre clearance quarantine inspections at Neighbor Island airports  and  1 6 million to strengthen Native Hawaiian involvement in agriculture  Projects also include efforts to eliminate or curb agricultural pests

to prevent and control invasive alien species  with the ultimate goal of lowering quarantine requirements  This goal is a priority for Pacific and Caribbean farmers because quarantine is one of their most significant trade barriers    Hawaii Agriculture Research Center  HARC   Diversified Agriculture Research  681 938  HARC focuses on improving the efficiency of sugarcane production  developing new products from sugarcane  and supporting the expansion of diversified agriculture in Hawaii  HARCs ongoing projects include completing the genetic fingerprinting for coffee  pineapple  macadamia nuts  and papaya  identifying the genes responsible for fungal resistance in papaya  and supporting a sugarcane breeding program    Papaya Ringspot and Pineapple Nematode  506 586  This appropriation will be used to monitor and refine control of the papaya ringspot virus  and to expand the techniques and knowledge obtained from this program to other diseases and pests  It will also be used to genetically engineer nematode and virus resistance in Hawaiis best varieties of pineapples    Agriculture Development in the American Pacific  500 000 This program addresses common Pacific island based agriculture and community issues through cooperative research  extension  and instruction programs that are culturally appropriate  socially acceptable  economically viable  and environmentally compatible  The programs objective is to help Pacific region residents live healthier and more productive lives by further developing their agricultural skills and knowledge    Watershed and Flood
