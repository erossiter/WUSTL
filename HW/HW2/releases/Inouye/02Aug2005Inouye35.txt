STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE REGARDING TODAYS DECISION BY THE 9TH U S  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS         STATEMENT BY U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYE REGARDING TODAYS DECISION BY THE 9TH U S  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS              August 2  2005        For Immediate Release  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye stated in response to the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Doe v  Kamehameha Schools   I believe the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  in this particular case  must have felt that the Kamehameha Schools interpretation of our civil rights laws could not support the Schools admissions policy  which critics have described as racially exclusive   However  I would submit that Native Hawaiians are more than simply an ethnicity or a culture   They are the descendants of a sovereign nation who are on equal footing with the Alaskan Natives and the Indian tribes   My colleagues in Hawaiis Congressional Delegation and I are now fighting to pass what is known as the Akaka bill   When we are successful  Native Hawaiians will be postured to reclaim their ancient dignity and forge a destiny for themselves in partnership with our State and our nation     30
