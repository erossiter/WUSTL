STATEMENT BY SENATOR INOUYE ON IRAQ         STATEMENT BY SENATOR INOUYE ON IRAQ       Wednesday  July 18  2007           For Immediate Release                 WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye released the statement below following his vote today in favor of an amendment that provides for a reduction and transition of United States forces in Iraq    Senator Inouye was one of 52 senators who voted for the amendment in a procedural vote  However  Senate rules required 60 votes for passage  Forty seven senators voted against the amendment    Senator Inouye said  From the beginning  I have been convinced that the Administration has never made the case for waging war in Iraq  It has never found the weapons of mass destruction that it claimed were there    The war in Iraq  which was supposed to be a preemptive strike against our foes in the global war on terrorism  has devolved into a civil war  and it has become a recruitment tool for al Qaeda  With the situation getting worse in Iraq  the Administration continues to turn a deaf ear to the American public  and insists that we continue to follow its failed course in Iraq  Instead  we need a new direction    That new direction  as I have advocated earlier  is a phased redeployment of troops from Iraq with us leaving the battlefield with honor  If Iraq is to succeed  it must assume responsibilities for its own destiny  It must decide if it wants to stop internecine warfare  We cannot do that for them    30
