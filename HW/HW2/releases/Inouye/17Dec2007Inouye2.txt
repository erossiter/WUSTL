INOUYE PROVISIONS IN FARM BILL NURTURE AND PROTECT HAWAIIS AGRICULTURAL SECTOR         INOUYE PROVISIONS IN FARM BILL NURTURE AND PROTECT HAWAIIS AGRICULTURAL SECTOR       Monday  December 17  2007           For Immediate Release                WASHINGTON  A measure that protects Hawaiis internationally known macadamia nut industry is one of the key provisions benefitting Hawaii that U S  Senator Daniel K  Inouye included in the five year farm bill  which the Senate approved late last week  The macadamia related language is one of nine Inouye backed provisions aimed at nurturing and further developing Hawaiis agricultural sector  which  in 2002  accounted for  533 4 million in sales  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture    At my request  macadamia nuts were added to the mandatory Country of Origin Labeling Program established in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  Senator Inouye said today  Adding macadamia nuts to the mandatory Country of Origin Labeling Program is intended to mirror the treatment of peanuts  whereby roasted and flavored macadamia nuts in cans or other packaging would be labeled  but not macadamia nuts that are used for candy or as ingredients in other foods     Hawaii is known to produce the highest quality macadamia nuts in the world  The macadamia nut product where the quality of the nut is most apparent is the roasted and flavored nuts in cans or other packaging  Using lower quality nuts for these types of products when the packaging implies a Hawaii origin reduces the demand and prices for Hawaii macadamia nuts  and tarnishes the high quality reputation for Hawaii grown macadamia nuts    This is a critical issue for Hawaii since  the sustainability of Hawaiis agriculture is directly related to maintaining and distinguishing high quality products from those produced in other parts of the world that are marketed in such a manner as to wrongly suggest that they were produced in Hawaii    The Inouye provisions in the Farm  Nutrition  and Bioenergy Act of 2007 do not carry a dollar value  However  they provide the authority for program funding through appropriations legislation    U S  Senator Daniel K  Akaka said  Passage of the 2008 Farm Bill is essential to ensure that our nation remains a leader in agriculture  I was pleased to join Senator Inouye in ensuring that these provisions were retained in the Senate bill  in order for Hawaiis agricultural producers to continue to prosper and receive assistance to combat invasive species  improve underserved areas  and address adverse impacts to geographically disadvantaged farmers    The following are the other Inouye provisions in the farm bill  which has advanced to a House Senate conference committee for consideration    Invasive Species Management  This provision minimizes the threats to Hawaiis unique ecosystem from non native plants  animals  and diseases  It requires the Secretaries of Agriculture  the Interior  and Homeland Security to work with the State of Hawaii to develop collaborative federal and state procedures in controlling and preventing the introduction of non native plants  animals  and plant and animal diseases    The Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has a substantial program based in Hawaii to inspect outgoing passengers and freight to protect agriculture on the U S  mainland and in other countries from pests that originate from Hawaii  In sharp contrast  however  Hawaii receives no similar protection by federal officials  This system fails to protect Hawaiis agriculture  unique ecosystems  and biodiversity from incoming passengers and freight    Exotic pests in Hawaii cause  300 million in yearly financial losses due to crop damage and lost export markets    Rural Utilities in Substantially Underserved Trust Areas  This provision formally recognizes the need to improve the availability and quality  of utility services in Native Hawaiian  American Indian  and Alaska Native rural communities  defined as Substantially Underserved Trust Areas  The Secretary of Agriculture  through the Rural Utility Services  is authorized to assign the highest funding priority for loans and loan guarantees for telecommunication and other services in Substantially Underserved Trust Areas  Enactment of this provision is a step toward providing utility services for Native Hawaiian  American Indian  and Alaska Native communities at levels comparable to those of other rural communities    Geographically Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers   This provision amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to provide assistance  in the form of direct reimbursements  to geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in both production and transportation activities in Hawaii  Alaska  and the U S  Territories    The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 required the Secretary of Agriculture to report on transportation and ownership and operation issues faced by geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers  This initiative is a direct follow up to a report filed in 2003  While the emphasis on the report was on transportation infrastructure and on the movement of products  the report covered the full range of programs offered by the U S  Department of Agriculture that would benefit geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers    Tropical and Subtropical Agricultural Research  This measure establishes a Tropical and Subtropical Agricultural Research Program to sustain the agriculture and the environment of U S  entities in the Caribbean and Pacific basins  with particular emphasis on pest management and deterring introduction and establishment invasive alien species    A regional  collaborative approach is the most efficient way to address the wide ranges of issues facing a sustainable agriculture in the tropical and subtropical areas of the United States  Senator Inouye said    This program has been funded by the Congress since 1983 under the Special Research Grants program administered by the Cooperative State Research  Education  and Extension Service  The Congress provided nearly  9 6 million in 2006  This measure  however  provides more specific authority for this program including definition of eligible entities and lead institutions  Senator Inouye said    Agricultural Development in the American Pacific Region  This provision amends the Agricultural Research  Extension  and Education Reform Act of 1998  to combine university experience and scientific capabilities in research  education  and outreach in the American Pacific region    Colleges and universities in the region are separated by thousands of miles of water in the Pacific  and by vast stretches of unpopulated and inhospitable distances in Alaska  They are the most physically and technologically separated Land Grant institutions in the United States  These land grant institutions typically serve ethnically diverse clients living in fragile ecosystems that need to be protected and enhanced for local  national and international benefit    Through collaboration and resource sharing  this alliance will use limited resources to maximize benefits to residents of the region  The Pacific islands and Alaska also act as key gateways between Asia  Russia  and the 48 contiguous United States  as such  they serve as bellwethers for the impacts of global warming  the movement of infectious diseases and growing chronic healthcare issues  rising costs of transportation  and invasive species  and other biological threats    Women and Minorities in STEM Fields  This provision would increase the participation of women and minorities in the fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  STEM   Rural and cultural barriers have historically precluded women and minorities from full participation in these fields  Innovative programs in Hawaii and other states are needed for underrepresented groups to overcome barriers  and enter careers in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics    Education Grants to Alaska Native Serving Institutions and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions  The authorization for the Education Grants to Alaska Native Serving Institutions and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions  Section 759 of Public Law 106 78 expired at the end of 2006  This provision extends the authority for this program through 2012    Sun Grant Research Initiative  This provision amends the Sun Grant Research Initiative in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  and recognizes the unique situation in the Pacific region  It also provides financial assistance for biobased energy technologies and products    Year round growing seasons offer ideal biomass development potential among the Pacific island nations  many of whom have mostly subsistence level agriculture  Researchers at the University of Hawaii have identified significant bioresidue potential from existing agricultural sectors in Asia and the Pacific  including sugarcane  rice  wheat  maize  coconut  oil palm  and roundwood processing  Research programs are now investigating biopharming and biorefining using tropical plants    30
