U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES REMARKS IN THE U S  SENATE ON THE FILIBUSTER         U S  SENATOR DANIEL K  INOUYES REMARKS IN THE U S  SENATE ON THE FILIBUSTER           May 12  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  Mr  President  on January 31  1963  I gave my maiden speech in the Senate  That is over 40 years ago  42 years ago  At that moment  the Senate was embroiled in a very heated debate on civil rights  The question before the Senate was the filibuster because many of my colleagues  especially those who were designated as liberals  looked upon the filibuster as the major obstacle to the granting of civil rights to the oppressed minority of this Nation  On that day  I was given the right to the floor and I gave a short speech  I think it is quite relevant at this moment  If I may  these are the words of 31 January 1963   Mr  President  I fully understand the respected custom of this body which advises a new member to sit in his chair  to listen quietly and learn before he rises to speak to the Senate himself    There is wisdom in that custom  as there is in most customs which last through years of trial and experience  I would not willingly break that honored silence  but because this debate calls to question the place of the minority in a democratic political system  I feel I must say these few words in deep but passionate humility  for I am a member of a minority  in a sense few other Senators have ever been    I understand the hopelessness that a man of unusual color or feature experiences in the face of constant human injustice    I understand the despair of a human heart crying for comfort to a world it cannot become a part of and to a family of man that has disinherited him    For this reason  I have done and will continue to do all that one man can do to secure for these people the opportunity and the justice that they do not now have  But if any lesson of history is clear  it is that minorities change  new minorities take their place  and old minorities grow into the majority    One can discern this course in our own history by observing the decisions of the Supreme Court  where the growth of the Nations law so often takes the form of adopting as the opinion of the Court the dissenting view of the earlier decision    From this fact  we discern the simple example of a vital democratic principle  I have heard so often in the past few weeks eloquent and good men plead for the chance to let the majority rule  That is  they say  the essence of democracy  I disagree  for to me it is equally clear that democracy does not necessarily result from majority rule  but rather from the forged compromise of the majority with the minority   The philosophy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is not simply to grant the majority the power to rule  but is also to set out limitation after limitation upon that power    Freedom of speech  freedom of the press  freedom of religion  What are these but the recognition that at times when the majority of men would willingly destroy him  a dissenting man may have no friend but the law    This power given to the minority is the most sophisticated and the most vital power bestowed by our Constitution   In this day of the mass mind and the lonely crowd  the right to exercise this power and the courage to express it has become less and less apparent  One of the few places where this power remains a living force is in the United States Senate   Let us face the decision before us directly  It is not free speech  for that has never been recognized as a legally unlimited right  It is not the Senates inability to act at all  for I cannot believe that a majority truly determined in their course could fail eventually to approach their ends  It is  instead the power of the minority to reflect a proportional share of their view upon the legislative result that is at stake in this debate   To those who wish to alter radically the balance of power between a majority in the Senate and a minority  I say  you sow the wind  for minorities change and the time will surely come when you will feel the hot breath of a righteous majority at the back of your own neck  Only then perhaps you will realize what you have destroyed   As Alexis de Tocqueville said about America in 1835  A democracy can obtain truth only as the result of experience  and many nations may perish while they are awaiting the consequences of their errors   The fight to destroy the power of the minority is made here  strangely enough  in the name of another minority  I share the desire of those Senators who wish to help the repressed people of our Nation  and in time  God willing  we shall effectively accomplish this task  But I say to these Senators  we cannot achieve these ends by destroying the very principle of minority protection that remains here in the Senate   For as De Tocqueville also commented  If ever the free institutions of America are destroyed  that event may be attributed to the omnipotence of the majority       30
