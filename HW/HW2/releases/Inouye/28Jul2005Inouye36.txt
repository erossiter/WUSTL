CONFEREES APPROVE INOUYE AUTHORED  LEGISLATION THAT FREES AIR TOUR OPERATORS FROM UNFAIR TAX         CONFEREES APPROVE INOUYE AUTHORED  LEGISLATION THAT FREES AIR TOUR OPERATORS FROM UNFAIR TAX              July 28  2005        For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON  Senator Daniel K  Inouye announced today that House and Senate conferees have approved legislation that includes a provision he authored that assists a key sector in Hawaiis tourism industry   The provision  which originated as Senate Bill 84  was inserted into the conference report to House Bill 3  the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU    It amends the Internal Revenue Code so that helicopters and certain categories of fixed wing aircraft that conduct sightseeing flights  which are popular in Hawaii  would be exempted from the air transportation tax   The legislation is poised for final passage by both the House and Senate   The Internal Revenue Service  IRS  issued a private letter ruling in which it exempted one Hawaii based air tour operator from paying the air passenger transportation excise tax  but it has not done so with other similar air tour enterprises     The IRS should be consistent in its application of this excise tax  Senator Inouye said   It was the intent of the Congress that the air passenger transportation excise tax be levied on passengers traveling on scheduled commercial airlines   It was not the intent of the Congress to impose this tax on air tour operators   Air tour operations are unlike scheduled commercial airlines   They are for entertainment purposes   They are circular in that they begin and end at the same destination   It is estimated that Senator Inouyes provision will save sightseeing air tours from having to pay an unfair tax that would amount to  79 million over 10 years   The provision  which would become effective on September 30  2005  would also benefit air tours that are widely used in places such as Alaska  California  Arizona  and New York City   This provision will ensure that air tour operators are treated fairly   They will all be exempt from the air transportation excise tax  but they would still be subject to the aviation fuel excise tax  Senator Inouye said   Many of these small companies have struggled to stay in business after incurring significant losses following the tragic events of September 11  2001  when our government imposed flight restrictions across the nation   Those flight restrictions halted or curbed many flight operations in all segments of the general aviation industry for many months into early 2002     30
