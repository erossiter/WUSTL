SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING LEGISLATION
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has introduced the Gasoline Consumer Anti-price-gouging Protection Act (S. 94), which would protect consumers by making it unlawful to raise the price of gasoline to an unconscionable level during times of crisis.  
   Alaska currently has consumer protection and antitrust statutes in place to ensure Alaskans do not fall victim to price gouging practices. S. 94 would add an additional layer of consumer protection for Alaskans by allowing the federal government to prosecute interstate perpetrators of price gouging. 
   "Gas prices can rise sharply immediately following a supply interruption like that which occurred in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina," said Senator Stevens. "The victims of these events should not also become the victims of price gouging." 
   Twenty-eight states have enacted price gouging laws carefully crafted to meet their unique local circumstances. S. 94 would supplement existing state laws by creating strict federal price gouging language enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. This language would close an existing regulatory gap by combating regional and multi-state price gouging violations with substantial civil and criminal penalties. 
   The Gasoline Consumer Anti-price-gouging Protection Act would permit civil penalties of up to $500,000 for independent small businesses and up to $5,000,000 for other suppliers. Criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment would be authorized for persons who violate this law. 
   S. 94 also provides gasoline suppliers with the flexibility to adjust prices as necessary during a crisis to maintain the free flow of commerce while still protecting consumers from unjustified price hikes.
