SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN ONLINE
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee along with Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), yesterday introduced the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act (S.1965). The bill is cosponsored by Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.). This measure would bring parents, industry, law enforcement, and educators together to address comprehensive online protections. 
  "This legislation will provide important tools to help protect our children from online predators and other cyber threats," said Senator Stevens. "The Internet is a significant part of many people's lives, and we must ensure that our children are educated about how to safely use this resource."
  The legislation would:
   * Require schools receiving E-Rate funds to offer age appropriate education regarding online behavior, including social networking, chat rooms and cyber bullying awareness and response; 
   * Create an interagency working group to identify and encourage technologies and initiatives to help parents protect their children from unwanted content; 
   * Require a public awareness campaign (and authorize $5 million for fiscal year 2008 and 2009); and 
   * Enhance child pornography enforcement.
