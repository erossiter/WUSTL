SEN. STEVENS COMMENDS NEW VA FACILITY FOR ANCHORAGE
  Earlier today, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it has awarded a $66 million contract to construct a new outpatient clinic and regional office in Anchorage, Alaska. Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who played an instrumental role in adding a facility for Anchorage to the VA's list of priority construction projects, offered the following statement in support of the VA's action: 
  "I am pleased to learn this process is moving forward. The VA's efforts to increase much-needed services for veterans living in the Anchorage area deserve to be commended," said Senator Stevens. "It took years to get a facility for Anchorage onto the VA's priority list, and this announcement marks another significant step toward its completion. Two years from now, Alaska veterans will greatly benefit from the expanded services the facility has to offer."
  Senator Stevens added language to several appropriations bills in recent years encouraging the Department of Veterans Affairs to move expeditiously and construct a new facility in Anchorage to help meet the needs of Alaska's veterans. The new facility will accommodate the VA's projected future demand for primary care, specialty care, and mental health in the Anchorage area. 
  The VA anticipates spending more than $240 million for Alaska's 65,000 veterans in 2007.
