SEN. STEVENS WELCOMES ALASKAN TO SENATE PAGE PROGRAM
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has welcomed Alaskan Gregory Bombeck to the U.S. Senate Page Program. Gregory will spend the next four months in Washington, D.C. serving as one of 100 Senate Pages.  
  Senate Page duties consist primarily of delivery of correspondence and legislative material within the Congressional complex. Other duties include preparing the chamber for Senate sessions, and carrying bills and amendments to Senators' desks. Pages also attend classes in the early morning at the United States Senate Page School. 
  "I am always happy to have young Alaskans come to Washington to work in Congress," said Senator Stevens. "Gregory will offer a unique perspective to this incoming class of Senate Pages. His experience here will serve him well in his future academic and professional endeavors." 
  Gregory is currently a junior at Lumen Christi High School in Anchorage. He has extensive leadership experience and is actively involved with the Civil Air Patrol. Gregory serves on the Anchorage Municipal Youth Advisory Commission and is involved in student government at Lumen Christi, where he is an Honors student. 
  Gregory is an avid snowboarder and recently represented Alaska at the United States of America Snowboard Association's National Championship. He is also working on earning a private pilot glider license.
