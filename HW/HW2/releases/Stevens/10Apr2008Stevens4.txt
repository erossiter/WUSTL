SEN. STEVENS COMMENDS FCC FOR INITIATING PLAN TO IMPLEMENT WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today commended the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision to implement a wireless emergency alert system to better notify the public during a crisis or disaster.  
  The Senate approved the alert system known as the Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN) in September of 2006. The bill, which was sponsored by Senator Stevens, was signed into law last October by President George W. Bush as part of the Safe Accountability For Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006. 
  "I am pleased to see the FCC's action in implementing the wireless alert system," said Senator Stevens. "When it comes to warning the public about a natural disaster or crisis, every second counts. This new alert system will be of critical importance to Alaskans, it will provide fishermen, hunters and others with access to emergency alerts as long as they have cell phones. This is vital to public safety because so much of our world is connected through wireless communications devices."
  Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN)
   * The Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN) is a national system for the transmission of public safety alerts across a broad variety of communications technologies including wireless applications. 
   * This action essentially moves the Emergency Alert System out of the broadcast radio and television era and into the wireless age. 
   * In addition to the threat posed by terrorist attacks, the system will give our emergency managers the ability to alert communities of other hazards such as natural disasters and manmade accidents. 
   * The measure ensures that when disaster strikes, the wireless network will be used as a tool so that almost all Americans will be notified through radio, television and wireless communications devices, because there are over 200 million wireless subscribers in the United States. 
   * Additionally, capabilities will allow other emergency managers to reach individuals away from their TVs or radios with specific life saving instructions.
