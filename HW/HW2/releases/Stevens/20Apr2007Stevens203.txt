ON RECORD: SEN. STEVENS' STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF APRIL 16
  On how increased postal rates will adversely impact rural Alaskans 
   "I understand that we have this rate increase scheduled for May 14. It will affect everyone nationwide, I'm sure. But no one will be affected the way rural Alaskans will be because of bypass mail?The lifeline to Alaska is the Postal Service and these communities already pay twice as much for their necessities as the average American. This is something that bothers me considerably." (4/19/07)
  On the importance of increasing the Drug Enforcement Administration's presence in Alaska to halt the spread of meth 
   "I urge you to do something about finding a way to work out a cooperative program to get to the bottom of this thing. It's taken off in the last year to the point where it is in crisis stage?.this is a very serious problem in Alaska and we end up with 11 (DEA) agents." (4/19/07)
  On the Coast Guard's role in combating IUU fishing 
   "To take care of this problem, of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, there has to be an identification of who is fishing illegally, a capability to warn them, and if there is a persistent violation, some kind of law enforcement. There has to be some way to put the fear of God in those people to make them lay off our fish." (4/18/07)
