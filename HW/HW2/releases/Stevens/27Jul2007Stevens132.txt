SEN. STEVENS CHAMPIONS FY 2008 COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senators Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Trent Lott (R-Miss.), and Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) today introduced the Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This bill would authorize total appropriations of $8.7 billion for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in FY08, including a six percent increase for its operating budget, $998 million for renovations, and much-needed authorizations to acquire new vessels and aircraft.
  The USCG's 17th District (D17), the largest Coast Guard district in terms of area, is responsible for the waters surrounding Alaska. Their activities include search and rescue missions, environmental protection, waterway maintenance, and icebreaking.  
  "The Coast Guard has a long history of saving lives and protecting our coasts," said Senator Stevens. "This reauthorization contains several provisions important to Coast Guard operations in Alaska. It will help D17 improve its search and rescue capability, protect the sustainability of our fisheries, and rapidly respond in the event of an oil spill." 
  Provisions in the reauthorization specific to USCG operations in Alaska include:
   * Forward Operating Facility in the Aleutians - This provision would authorize the USCG to construct or lease a helicopter hangar facility in the Aleutian Islands -Bering Sea operating area. The facility would help reduce rescue response times by allowing the Coast Guard to stage assets closer to fishing grounds. 
   * Response Station in Valdez - This provision would authorize the Coast Guard to construct a full multi-mission Coast Guard Response Station in Valdez, which would enhance the Coast Guard's ability to protect the Port of Valdez and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Terminal. 
   * Transfer of Storis - This provision would transfer the USCG Cutter Storis to the USCG Cutter Storis Museum and Education Center located in Juneau, Alaska. The Storis has been stationed in Alaska since 1948 and will be able to remain in the state as a result of this provision. 
   * Small Vessel Exemption from Definition of Fish Processing Vessel - This provision would provide new opportunities to salmon fishermen in Alaska by allowing each vessel to process and send up to five metric tons of salmon to market per week. 
   * Risk Assessment for Cook Inlet and the Aleutians - This provision directs the USCG to conduct a vessel traffic risk assessment for both Cook Inlet and the Aleutian Islands, which will ensure the continued protection of Alaska's waters as vessel traffic increases in these areas. This provision directs the Coast Guard to work with Alaskans to determine the best options for vessel tracking, towing and tug response, and increasing spill response equipment. 
   * Oil Spill Recovery Institute - The Oil Spill Recovery Institute (OSRI), located in Cordova, conducts research and develops technologies to prevent and mitigate the effects of oil spills. This is especially important as research is needed about potential spills in extreme cold water and ice conditions. OSRI received $22.5 million from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund in 1996, and its operating budgets are partially funded from the interest off of that appropriation. This provision would increase the principal amount by $12.851 million to account for reduced funding due to low interest rates and inflation. 
   * Pribilof Transition Act Extension - The Fur Seal Act of 1966 authorizes the Pribilof Island communities of St. Paul and St. George to receive economic development funding in order to provide new employment opportunities. The current authorization expires this year, and this provision would extend it until 2009.
