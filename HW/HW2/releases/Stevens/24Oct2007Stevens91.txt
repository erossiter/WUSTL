SENATE APPROVES $46.7 MILLION FOR DENALI COMMISSION IN LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Last night, the U.S. Senate approved nearly $47 million for the Denali Commission as part of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act. This measure (H.R. 3043), which passed the Senate 75-19, also includes a series of other provisions aimed at enhancing education in Alaska championed by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). 
  H.R. 3043, as approved, provides the Denali Commission with $6.9 million in U.S. Department of Labor funds for job training, and another $40 million in Health and Human Services/Health Resources Services Administration funds for the construction of health and social service facilities. The President's Budget cut all funding for these programs, but at the urging of Senator Stevens, the Senate approved funding levels for the Denali Commission that matched those in the FY07 bill.  
  "Since 1998, the Denali Commission has served as an efficient means to fund projects in rural Alaska. By eliminating the high administrative costs incurred by federal agencies, the Commission stretches every dollar it receives from the federal government. The results have been staggering. Particularly with respect to health care access, the Denali Commission has made significant strides in improving the lives of rural Alaskans," said Senator Stevens.
  Since its creation by Senator Stevens in the late 1990s, the Denali Commission has served more than 100 Alaska communities. The Commission has provided Alaskans with job training and new health clinics that have increased the availability of health services to rural villages. In addition, the unique structure of the Commission caps administrative expenses at five percent and capitalizes on the use of strategic partnerships. 
  In addition, H.R. 3043 funds a variety of education initiatives that the President's Budget proposed cutting. The Alaska Native Education Equity Act receives $34.5 million in the measure, with a portion of these funds to be made available for construction. Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions of Higher Education program is funded at $12.5 million, with half of this allocation going to Alaska.
  The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act also funds two national education programs started by Senator Stevens. The Education through Cultural and Historical Organizations (ECHO) received $9 million in the bill, which represents a $150,000 increase over FY07. Alaska heritage centers will be allocated $3 million in ECHO funds. The Senate also funded the Carol M. White Physical Education Program (PEP) at $80 million nationwide. Alaska would receive a portion of these funds. The PEP funding in H.R. 3043 is a $7.6 million increase of over funding appropriated in FY07. 
  "The President's request to cut funding for education programs like the ECHO and PEP was simply not acceptable," said Senator Stevens. "If our students are to succeed, Congress must ensure that we provide schools with all the necessary tools. Initiatives like the Alaska Native Education Equity program ensure that no Alaskan student is left behind."
