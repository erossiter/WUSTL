SEN. STEVENS ISSUES STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF JAN. 28
  On federal funding in Alaska...
   "I think we are justified to ask for those funds. The federal government must make available to the state of Alaska the same kind of assistance it makes available to other states without regard to population...We have needs that have to be met, and I believe in many instances it's the duty of the federal government to assist." (1/28/08) 
   On the proposed listing of polar bears as an endangered species...
   "I think it's become a very controversial thing. We have an Endangered Species Act, we don't have an Endangered Habitat Act. People are worried about the future exploration on the North Slope, and they're saying that because of the polar bear there should not be any exploration to even determine if there are resources up there. This whole thing comes from people that want to stop development in Alaska more than anything else." (1/29/08)
   On his meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff about new border crossing requirements...
   "We're trying to find a way to get the flexibility in handling this at the border. He [Secretary Chertoff] has indicated he understands there's a problem; he plans to send someone up to really study it. He's told the border guards that they should be flexible on dealing with these issues, particularly for people from rural areas. He's going to, hopefully, get some sort of variant for the traditional birth certificate." (1/30/08)
   On Customs and Border Protection's proposed rule requiring foreign-flagged cruise ships docking in Alaska to originate from a foreign port...
   "We'll find a way [for Alaska] to be exempted. If we don't get exempted from the rule, we will ask that the basic act be applied so it does not apply to an area where there is no competition for U.S.-flagged ships. It was intended to protect U.S.-flagged passenger vessels...We think it was meant for Hawaii and not meant for our state at all." (1/31/08)
