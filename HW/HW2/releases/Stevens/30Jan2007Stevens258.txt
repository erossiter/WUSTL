SEN. STEVENS ENDORSES NEGROPONTE AS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) on Tuesday, Jan. 30, urged the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations to quickly recommend Senate confirmation of Ambassador John Negroponte as Deputy Secretary of State, saying "I know of no man who can do a better job."  
   At Negroponte's confirmation hearing, Stevens introduced the Ambassador, lauding his experience in U.S. diplomacy. "Ambassador Negroponte is a seasoned diplomat, skilled and sensitive when dealing with his foreign counterparts," said Stevens, in his written statement. "He has lived abroad for 22 years, a rare extent for someone at this level of government. John is also fluent in five languages - a tremendous asset which will serve him well in his new role." 
   Negroponte has completed eight assignments with the Foreign Service on three different continents. He has served as Ambassador to four countries - Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines, and Iraq. He has worked as the nation's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and, most recently, he served as the U.S.'s first Director of National Intelligence. 
   "In each of these distinguished positions, Ambassador Negroponte has demonstrated the ability to expertly manage diplomatic, defense, and intelligence missions," said Stevens. 
   Senator Stevens also highlighted Ambassador Negroponte's previous work in Alaska. In 1977, he was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and Fisheries Affairs and, one year later, Negroponte negotiated a landmark accord which protected Alaskan salmon stocks from Japanese high seas fishing fleets. 
   "This agreement helped protect our marine resources and provided substantial benefits to Alaska's fishing communities - benefits which endure to this day," said Stevens.
