SEN. STEVENS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING FDA BAN ON FARM-RAISED SEAFOOD FROM CHINA
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee today released the following statement after the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a broad import control order to restrict all Chinese farm-raised seafood entering the United States. The FDA stated it will detain these products until they are "proven to be free of residues from drugs that are not approved in the United States." 
  "I applaud the Food and Drug Administration for taking this strong step to protect American seafood consumers," said Senator Stevens. "Wild Alaska fish continues to set the global standard for fresh, healthy and sustainable seafood.".
