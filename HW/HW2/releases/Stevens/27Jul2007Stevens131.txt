SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS FCC COMMITMENT TO RATE INTEGRATION
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today applauded the recent decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reaffirm its commitment to rate integration and geographic averaging requirements. The decision is based on Section 254(g) in the Communications Act, which prohibits phone companies from penalizing Alaska residents (or residents of any other state) by charging different fees for long distance service than are charged elsewhere. Senator Stevens and Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) worked together to secure the inclusion of Section 254(g) in the Communications Act of 1996. 
  "The rate integration provision in the Communications Act is essential to ensuring that Alaskans continue to receive the benefit of nationwide phone service plans," said Senator Stevens. "I was especially pleased to see all five of the FCC's Commissioners affirm their commitment to upholding this important provision and I applaud them for their decision.".
