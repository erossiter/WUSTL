APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. STEVENS' AMENDMENT TO HELP RURAL SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today voted in favor of an amendment offered by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), which would exempt rural schools, libraries, and health care facilities from the Antideficiency Act.  
  The measure would also prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from using funds to implement the primary line restriction proposed by the Federal State Board on Universal Service. 
  "This exemption will help rural schools, libraries, and health care facilities in Alaska and throughout America that receive funding for distance learning and telemedicine," said Senator Stevens. 
  This provision was included as part of the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
  According to the Government Accountability Office, this Antideficiency Act prevents the United States government from making payments or committing to make future payments for goods or services unless enough money has already been appropriated to cover their costs.
