SEN. STEVENS RECEIVES SILENT DEFENDER AWARD
  Last night, the International Code Council (ICC) Foundation honored Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) with their prestigious Silent Defender Award. This annual award honors exemplary actions taken to improve the public's safety, health, and welfare.  
   The ICC Foundation recognized Stevens for his instrumental role in forming the Congressional Natural Hazards Caucus and creating the Denali Commission. Stevens was also commended for legislation he introduced to improve the tsunami warning system. 
   Stevens was honored alongside Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, Dr. Omaima Ahmad Salah El-din, the Inter-American Development Bank, and Home Depot. 
   "It is a privilege to be included among this year's distinguished group of honorees," said Stevens. "Your foundation's mission reminds me of a quote by Cicero: 'The safety of the people shall be the highest law.' Those of us elected to office have a special duty to ensure the public's safety, and it is an honor to receive this award."
