SEN. STEVENS LEADS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY OFFICE IN ALASKA
  Today, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (S. 3721). This legislation includes a provision authored by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) that establishes a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) area office in Alaska. This office will help the state prepare for and respond to major disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tidal surges, and avalanches.  
   "Given our unique climate, terrain, and location, Alaska faces a variety of potential natural disasters," said Stevens. "One of the most important lessons our nation learned from Hurricane Katrina is that emergency preparedness is essential. The establishment of this FEMA office ensures that Alaskans will be prepared for disasters and extreme winter weather." 
   Currently, Alaska's federal emergency response and preparedness activities are managed by a FEMA regional office that is based in Washington State. This regional office oversees emergency activities for Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The provision included in S. 3721 today will create an area office, which will establish a FEMA presence within Alaska and have distinct responsibility for emergency activities in the state. 
   The bill will now go to the full Senate for its consideration.
