SEN. STEVENS: DON'T REWRITE THE HISTORY OF PRE-WAR INTELLIGENCE
  Today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) commented on recent attempts to rewrite the history of the United States' involvement in Iraq. Stevens specifically addressed the pre-war intelligence that led to the use of force in Iraq.  
   Stevens recalled former President Clinton's 1998 Pentagon speech, which outlined the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime. Stevens has previously entered President Clinton's speech into the Congressional Record. Today, Stevens said: 
   "Before giving his speech, President Clinton was briefed by the generals who command all of our forces. Their briefing convinced President Clinton that he might have to take military action against Saddam Hussein, and he told the generals to be ready. 
   "Those of us in Congress never doubted President Clinton's sincerity or truthfulness regarding this issue. In 1998, he said, 'If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.'" 
   Stevens also recalled that senior members of the Clinton Administration consistently made the case that the United States should take the threat of Iraq and its weapons program seriously. Stevens said: 
   "Vice President Al Gore echoed this concern. He said, 'Saddam's ability to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction poses a grave threat ... to the security of the world.' 
   "Secretary of State Madeline Albright told us: 'Iraq is a long way from here, but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.' 
   "And National Security Advisor Sandy Berger warned, 'He (Saddam Hussein) will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has 10 times since 1983.'" 
   Senator Stevens then described the pre-war intelligence that prompted the Senate to give President George W. Bush the authority to use force in Iraq. He said: 
   "In October 2002, this Senate overwhelmingly supported giving President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq. We authorized the use of force in a vote of 77 to 23. The facts before us indicated Saddam Hussein posed a grave threat. And let me be clear: at the time, the facts were undisputed, and we were all provided the same information. These were the facts as we understood them: 
   * Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction against the Iranians, his own people, and possibly, some of our men and women in uniform during the first Gulf War. 
   * In 1998, weapons inspectors were forced out of Iraq. 
   * When the inspectors left, the regime was capable of resuming bacterial warfare agent production within weeks. 
   * Iraq had not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions canisters. 
   * Iraq had not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets previously used for delivery of nerve agents or 500 artillery shells filled with mustard gas. 
   * Saddam Hussein had been ordered by the U.N. to disarm sixteen times, and sixteen times he refused to comply. He engaged in a series of deceitful tactics designed to prevent U.N. inspectors from completing their inspections. 
   "Our intelligence agencies had gathered further evidence of his activities. This information was classified to protect our sources and our methods. I received those intelligence briefings. I received the same information as the President. These intelligence reports were deeply disturbing ... It was our intelligence agencies' best assessment of what was going on in Iraq.
