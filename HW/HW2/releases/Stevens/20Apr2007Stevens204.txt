SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES BILL TO COMBAT IDENTITY THEFT
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today introduced legislation to combat identify theft. The "Identity Theft Prevention Act" (S.1178) would strengthen information safeguards and ensure consumers are notified whenever their sensitive personal information is acquired without authorization. 
  The bill would also direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce rules that would require all covered entities that handle sensitive personal information to develop, implement, and maintain appropriate safeguards to protect such information, and provide effective notice to consumers in the event of a breach. The bill also would allow consumers to freeze their credit for a reasonable fee to protect themselves from identity theft.  
  "Identify theft in the United States has reached epidemic proportions, with Alaska ranked fifth per capita in the number of fraud complaints filed last year," said Senator Stevens. "Consumers are under attack and we must give them the tools they need to protect themselves."
  Nationwide, identity theft has risen dramatically over the past decade. The FTC estimates that nearly 9 million Americans - or roughly 4.6 percent of the domestic adult population - are victimized by identity thieves each year. The FTC indicates that physical and online identity theft accounted for 40 percent of the more than 616,000 consumer fraud complaints filed last year with the agency. 
  The costs associated with identity theft are significant. In 2006, estimated losses to businesses and financial institutions due to identity theft totaled $52.6 billion, and out-of-pocket losses to consumers totaled $5 billion. 
  "This bill will not end identity theft - no piece of legislation can accomplish that goal," Senator Stevens said. "But this measure will help curb the occurrence of identity theft in this country to the greatest extent possible, while not inhibiting an information sharing system that yields many benefits to every American."
  Specifically, the bill would:
   * Require businesses that handle sensitive personal information to comply with the existing requirements of the FTC's rules that currently apply to financial institutions. These rules require covered entities to develop, implement, and maintain a written program for the security of sensitive personal information, protect against any anticipated threats, and protect against unauthorized access to such information. 
   * Direct the FTC to develop rules that would require procedures for authenticating the credentials of third parties to which sensitive personal information is to be transferred or sold. 
   * Require all entities that handle sensitive personal information to provide notice to affected consumers in the event that the security breach creates a reasonable risk of identity theft. 
   * Allow consumers to place, lift, or temporarily remove a security freeze on their credit, which would reduce identity theft by preventing credit from being extended to third parties without authorization from the consumer. 
   * Allow State Attorneys General (AGs) to bring actions under this Act, and in the place of the FTC, in either a state or district court on behalf of their state residents. The State AGs would be required to notify the FTC or the appropriate Federal regulator prior to bringing the action, and the FTC or appropriate Federal regulator would have the authority to intervene in the action. 
   * Preempt any State or local law that requires a covered entity to safeguard sensitive personal information or requires the notification of consumers of security breaches involving their sensitive personal information. 
   * Establish an Information Security and Consumer Privacy Advisory Committee comprised of industry participants, consumer groups, and State AGs to develop best practices to protect sensitive personal information. 
   * Require the FTC and Department of Justice to conduct a study of the correlation between methamphetamine use and identity theft crimes.
