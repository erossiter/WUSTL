SEN. STEVENS JOINS PRESIDENT IN URGING SENATE TO RATIFY LAW OF SEA TREATY
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today joined President George W. Bush and urged the United States Senate to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Commonly known as the Law of the Sea Treaty, this accord would regulate and govern activities that occur on or within the world's oceans. 
  "The United States is the world's largest maritime power, and our country also has one of the longest coastlines in the world," said Senator Stevens. "As a result, we have an enormous interest in the protection of the oceans and their resources. I am pleased to join President Bush in this effort and look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this important matter."
  Senator Stevens noted that in 1969, Senator Warren Magnuson (D-Wash.) asked him to monitor the Law of the Sea negotiations taking place around the world. This experience led him to work on the original Magnuson-Stevens Act, which extended coastal-state jurisdiction to all waters within 200 miles offshore. Senator Stevens said he supports the Law of the Sea Treaty because it would provide the United States with important international authorities to resolve jurisdictional matters over control of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). 
  "The Law of the Sea Treaty would allow member nations to lay claim to all bottom resources on their continental shelves beyond 200 miles. Two-thirds of our nation's OCS is located off Alaska, and if we ratify this accord, the United States could lay claim to a substantial area north and east of the Bering Strait," said Senator Stevens.
