SEN. STEVENS' AND MURKOWKSI'S PROVISION FOR RURAL VETERANS SIGNED INTO LAW
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) continued their efforts to support Alaska's veterans through their work on the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2764), which was signed into law today. This spending bill provides the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with $43.1 billion in new spending for veterans medical care, claims processing, and facility improvements. This figure is $6.6 billion above the FY 2007 level and $3.7 billion over the President's request. 
   In the bill, Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski secured a provision that directs the VA to investigate and address the unique challenges and costs many veterans in rural areas face in obtaining VA medical services. This measure calls a study on how to increase local medical services for veterans in remote rural areas through partnerships with other government and local private health care providers.
   "While we have made great strides in ensuring our veterans receive the best health care, there is much work to do," said Senator Stevens. "Alaska's massive area and small number of veterans' facilities, makes accessing VA health care difficult for many of our veterans. To remedy this longstanding problem, this study will provide us with options for improving care for veterans in remote rural areas of our State, particularly for those who must currently fly to a major city to receive treatment."
   "The concern that I hear most frequently from Alaska veterans is just how upsetting it is to fly to Anchorage or Seattle to receive VA medical care that is not available in their home communities," said Senator Murkowski. "It is unconscionable that Alaska veterans would have to fly up to 2,000 miles for the care they have earned. This report will examine whether it is feasible to utilize existing facilities, like community health resources or the Alaska Native health system, to provide care at home."
   The bill significantly increases 2007 funding levels for the VA and appropriates money beyond the President's 2008 request. This funding includes $37.2 billion for the Veterans Health Administration to be distributed to regional networks of states using the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system. In FY07, the Alaska VA's health care budget included approximately $95 million in federally appropriated funds. The Alaska VA expects a three percent increase for FY08.
   Nationwide funding for 2008 includes:
   * $2.9 billion for specialty mental health care;
   * $429 million for the VA Substance Abuse Program;
   * $130 million to help care for homeless veterans;
   * $3.5 billion to ensure the efficient operation of the VA's health care system;
   * $4.1 billion for on-going maintenance and renovations of existing facilities;
   * $480 million for research to improve the quality of life for injured and aging veterans; and
   * A minimum of $15 million for joint programs with the Department of Defense to increase research, improve access to care, and ensure a more seamless transition for our veterans, particularly in the areas of greatest concern for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan - traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, increased survival of severe burns, and amputation.
