CONGRESS APPROVES FUNDING FOR NEW METH TASK FORCE IN ALASKA
  Congress today approved the Omnibus Appropriations bill, which includes language sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) instructing the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to consult with Alaskan law enforcement to set up a new methamphetamine task force. In addition, the bill contains $1.4 million in funding for statewide methamphetamine enforcement. 
   "Alaska's growing meth problem is particularly challenging for us given our State's size and the remoteness of many of our communities," said Senator Stevens. "It is important for the DEA to work closely with our local law enforcement officials to attack the problem at its source and permanently shut down meth labs throughout Alaska."
   The legislation contains funding for a variety of other Department of Justice-related programs in Alaska. The bill sets aside $2.8 million to the Native American/Native Alaskan Liaison Office to combat sexual assault and domestic violence. These funds may also be distributed to non-profit entities that provide services such as a crisis hotline, services to victims of sexual assault or domestic violence in rural areas, and medical assistance to victims.
   Other funding for Alaska includes:
   * $1.1 million for Alaska's Boys and Girls Club's Mentoring Demonstration Project;
   * $1.1 million for the Alaska Native Justice Center;
   * $940,000 for the Rural Prosecution Unit;
   * $752,000 for the Rural Alcohol Interdiction Initiative;
   * $235,000 for the Alaska Public Safety Information Network; and
   * $197,000 for the statewide DARE coordinator.
