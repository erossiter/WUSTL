SEN. STEVENS TO ATTEND INTERNMENT AND MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR WWII PILOT EARTHQUAKE MCGOON ON MAY 24
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) will attend an internment and memorial service for James McGovern, better known as "Earthquake McGoon," at 1 p.m. today at Arlington National Cemetery. Earthquake McGoon, a World War II pilot and CIA operative during the Cold War, was shot down over Laos in 1954. He was one of the first two Americans to be killed in the Vietnam Conflict.  
  "Earthquake McGoon will always be remembered for his bravery and courage while flying daring missions in China and Southeast Asia," said Senator Stevens, who served with Earthquake McGoon in the 14th Air Force in WWII. "Today's ceremony honors a true American hero. While Earthquake will officially be laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, his legend will endure forever." 
  As a World War II fighter pilot, Earthquake McGoon was credited with shooting down four Japanese planes. While in China during the war, an American saloon owner dubbed him "Earthquake McGoon," after a large hillbilly character in the comic strip Li'l Abner. 
  Earthquake McGoon became a soldier of fortune during the Cold War before being shot down in his C-119 Flying Boxcar cargo plane near Dien Bien Phu, Laos. Ho Chi Minh's communist forces captured Dien Bien Phu the next day, ending a 57-day French-Indochina conflict that received worldwide attention.
  Earthquake McGoon's remains were found in an unmarked grave in Laos in 2002. Four years later, forensic experts with the U.S. military's Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command identified the skeleton as Earthquake McGoon's.
