PRESIDENT APPROVES FUNDING FOR DOZENS OF ALASKA WATER PROJECTS
  President George W. Bush today signed into law the Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 2764), which contains funding secured by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) for a series of water projects. Harbor and port projects across the state, ranging from Akutan to Barrow to Haines, received funding in the legislation. 
   "A viable harbor is the key to a vibrant local economy for our communities," said Senator Stevens. "But more importantly, our ports provide a gateway for Alaskans to receive basic goods and services. In many communities absent of roads, our harbors are our lifeline."
   Several Alaska ports and harbors received significant funding for ongoing projects. The Port of Anchorage received $15.1 million** in the bill for dredging. Another $3 million was allocated to the Nome harbor for dredging, sheet-pile replacement, and construction. The St. Paul harbor received $2.8 million for construction and another $6.6 million will be provided to the Unalaska harbor.
   Other Alaska water projects supported by Senator Stevens that were included in the bill passed by Congress include:
   * $175,000 for Whittier harbor development and feasibility planning
