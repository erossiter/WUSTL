COMMERCE COMMITTEE PASSES BILL TO EXTEND DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY
  The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee today unanimously reported out legislation cosponsored by Vice Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) that would extend the Do-Not-Call Registry administered by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007 (S. 781) was originally introduced by Senator Mark Pryor (D-Ark.). Since 2003, the FTC has entered over 130 million phone numbers into the Do-Not-Call Registry, allowing consumers to avoid unwanted phone calls from telemarketers. The legislation cosponsored by Senator Stevens will allow the FTC to continue enforcement of this popular and effective program.  
  "The FTC's Do-Not-Call Registry is one of the Commission's most successful endeavors," said Senator Ted Stevens. "The Registry has dramatically limited the number of unwanted calls to consumers and assisted the FTC in preventing telemarketing fraud and abuse."
