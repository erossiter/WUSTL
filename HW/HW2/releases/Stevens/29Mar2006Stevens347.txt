SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS ADMINISTRATION FOR NEW CAF? STANDARDS FOR LIGHT TRUCKS
  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today issued the following statement regarding the Administration's announcement of a new rule establishing higher CAF? standards for model year 2008-2011 pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs):  
   "The Administration's fuel economy rule for pickup trucks and SUVs is a positive step forward as our nation strives for energy independence. This rule is consistent with the President's desire to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Once these standards are fully in place, Alaskans will save millions of dollars at the pump each year. I applaud the Administration for its initiative and leadership on this important issue."
