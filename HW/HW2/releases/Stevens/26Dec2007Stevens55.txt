PRESIDENT SIGNS BILL TO FUND HUD PROJECTS IN ALASKA
  President George W. Bush today signed into law the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 2764), highlighted by housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding provisions sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). 
   Institutions serving Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native students will share $3 million to continue their efforts in strengthening the ability of institutions to carry out education, research, and community development in various education programs, including financial education.
   The city of Anchorage will receive $700,000 for Mountain View revitalization. These funds will be used to restore buildings, which will enhance the retail, commercial, and residential space along Mountain View Drive.
   H.R. 2764 allocates $562,000 for the Cape Nome quarry upgrade. This money can be used for the construction and expansion for the quarry's site pad.
   Lastly, the bill includes a provision championed by Senator Stevens that allows the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC), Alaska's only public housing authority, to become eligible for the Moving to Work program, which allows housing authorities more flexibility in use of their public housing funds. Participation in the program will allow AHFC to continue to provide public housing services in remote rural parts of the State.
