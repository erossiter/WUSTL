SEN. STEVENS NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR SUMMER INTERNSHIPS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) is now accepting applications for summer internships in his Washington, D.C. office. For more than three decades, Sen. Ted Stevens has provided Alaskans with an opportunity to work in the nation's capital by offering internships to graduating high school seniors and college students.  
   To apply for a summer internship, Alaska students must complete and submit an application via fax to the Senator's Washington, D.C. office on or before March 16, 2007. 
   Applications are available: 
   1. On-line at Senator Stevens' website at http://stevens.senate.gov/intern 
   2. From any one of Senator Stevens' Alaska offices. A complete list is on Senator Stevens' website: http://stevens.senate.gov 
   3. From high school principals or counselors 
   Senator Stevens' high school intern program gives graduating seniors the opportunity to participate in one of two month-long sessions. The first session runs from June 2 to June 30, while the second session is held July 7 to August 4. 
   The college intern program provides full-time employment to college students from Alaska for the entire summer; applicants are encouraged to specify dates based on individual academic schedules. Selected interns will assist the Senator and his staff with day-to-day operations. Duties will include monitoring committee hearings, conducting research, answering phones, filing, and carrying messages to the Senate floor or the Senator's committee offices. 
   While interns can expect to receive a small stipend, they are responsible for living expenses incurred during their stay in Washington. High school interns are required to live on the campus of George Washington University (GW), while college interns may stay at GW or make alternative housing arrangements.
