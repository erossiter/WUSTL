DOT NOMINEE AGREES TO VISIT ALASKA
  Mary Peters, President Bush's nominee to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), today accepted an invitation from Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) to visit Alaska. The commitment is contingent upon Mrs. Peters' confirmation as Secretary by the full Senate.  
   Mrs. Peters pledged to visit Alaska during a Senate Commerce Committee nomination hearing, during which Senator Stevens praised Alaska's Five-Star Medallion Program. The program has been responsible for reducing aircraft-related deaths and increasing aviation safety. 
   "I do get provincial here, but I want to know if you are willing to come up and take a look at that program and study it to see if it couldn't be replicated throughout the United States, particularly in the rural areas," said Senator Stevens. 
   Mrs. Peters responded, "Mr. Chairman, it sounds like an exemplary program and one I would be very pleased to come to Alaska to review." 
   Senator Stevens also continued his long-standing tradition of inviting nominees to go fishing with him in Alaska. "I look forward to showing you some of my marine research capabilities too," he told Peters. 
   President Bush nominated Mrs. Peters to be Secretary of Transportation on September 5, 2006. From 2001 to 2005, Peters headed the Federal Highway Administration. Her nomination must be approved by the Senate Commerce Committee, and she must be confirmed by the full Senate before taking over as head of the DOT.
