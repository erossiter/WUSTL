SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF TAX RELIEF EXTENSION RECONCILIATION ACT
  Today, the United States Senate approved the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act (TRERA) of 2005 (H.R. 4297) by a vote of 54 to 44. The Act renews and extends key provisions of the U.S. tax code that have already, or are slated to, expire. Since 2003, these provisions have lowered the tax burden for an estimated 270,000 Alaskans. The extensions approved today will ensure Alaskans continue to benefit from these tax relief measures.  
   "I applaud the extension of these critical tax reductions," said Stevens. "Thousands of Alaskans will benefit from the provisions included in this bill. This is meaningful tax relief that will help Alaska families and foster economic growth." 
   H.R. 4297 extends reductions in dividend and capital gains taxes through 2010 and Alternative Minimum Tax relief through 2006. Provisions in this legislation also reduce the marriage penalty and increase the child tax credit for Alaskan parents. H.R. 4297 also includes a provision which will change the eligibility requirements for the Veterans' Mortgage Bonds issued by the State of Alaska. As a result of these changes, more of Alaska's veterans will be able to qualify for state mortgage bonds. 
   H.R. 4297 has been sent to the President for his signature.
