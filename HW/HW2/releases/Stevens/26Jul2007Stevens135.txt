SEN. STEVENS WELCOMES FDA REPORT ON NANOTECHNOLOGY
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today commended the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Nanotechnology Task Force, which recently completed its analysis of nanotechnology's potential medical benefits. The Task Force's comprehensive report was released yesterday afternoon, and it has been strongly endorsed by FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach.  
  "I value the hard work and vision of Dr. von Eschenbach and the FDA's Nanotechnology Task Force. Advances in nanotechnology will lead to advances in a number of other fields, improve our quality of life, and help our nation maintain its competitive edge in global innovation," said Senator Stevens, a long-time advocate of federal nanotechnology initiatives. "I look forward to reviewing this report, and expect its recommendations to help inform my continued support for nanotechnology research and development."
  The report addresses regulatory and scientific issues and recommends the FDA consider development of nanotechnology-related guidance for manufacturers and researchers. Nanoscale materials could generate revolutionary advances in medicine and medical techniques.
  The FDA and 22 other federal agencies comprise the National Nanotechnology Initiative, a federal research and development program established to coordinate multi-agency efforts in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology.
