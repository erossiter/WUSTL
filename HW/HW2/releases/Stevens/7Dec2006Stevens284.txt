SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT GATES AS DOD SECRETARY
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today offered the following statement upon the Senate's confirmation of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense: 
 "I am pleased that the Senate acted quickly to confirm Bob Gates as Secretary of Defense. Bob is eminently qualified for the position. As President of Texas A&M University, he oversaw the largest ROTC programs in the nation. His ability to connect with men and women in an all-volunteer military force will serve him well as Secretary.".
