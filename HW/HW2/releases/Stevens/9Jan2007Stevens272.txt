SEN. STEVENS CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO MAKE QUALITY CHILD CARE AVAILABLE TO MORE ALASKANS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) announced today that he will co-sponsor the Small Business Child Care Act of 2007, legislation designed to improve the availability of quality child care in America. The new bill, introduced by Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), would provide resources and incentives to small businesses to start up and support child care centers for employees with families.  
   "This legislation will help hardworking American families obtain affordable child care," said Senator Stevens. "This is particularly important in Alaska, where parents often hold full-time jobs that require them to be away from home. The bill will also ensure the government works with small businesses to help these families without creating a burdensome legislative mandate." 
   The Small Business Child Care Act creates a short-term, flexible grant program to encourage small businesses to work together or with local child care agencies to provide child care services for employees. Small businesses will be eligible for grants of up to $500,000 for start-up costs, training, scholarships, and other related activities. Businesses will also be required to match federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities in the future. The program is authorized at $50 million over five years and sunsets in 2012.
