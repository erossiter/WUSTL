SEN. STEVENS VOTES FOR BILL TO TRIPLE DENALI KIDCARE FUNDING
  With the support of Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), the United States Senate today approved a measure to provide additional funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), administered in Alaska by Denali KidCare. Under a new SCHIP funding formula, the State would receive $36.5 million for Denali KidCare, a three-fold increase over last year's funding level.  
  Denali KidCare currently provides 22,227 Alaskan children with health insurance. The additional funding provided by legislation passed today will enable the program to expand its coverage. 
  "We know that thousands of Alaska's children have no health insurance," said Senator Stevens. "The passage of the SCHIP reauthorization bill is a first step in covering them. It ensures that one of our State's most important programs - Denali KidCare - receives the necessary funds to deliver basic prevention and treatment services. Routine visits to doctors and dentists, substance abuse treatment, and essential prescription drugs can all be made available to our children and teens thanks to this funding." 
  SCHIP provides health coverage to low-income, uninsured children whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid and cannot afford private health insurance. The bill passed today would maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children currently covered by SCHIP and bring dependable health coverage to an additional 3.1 million low-income, uninsured American children within five years. 
  The bill now proceeds to the President for his consideration. Funding for the SCHIP program will expire on September 30, 2007 if it is not reauthorized.
