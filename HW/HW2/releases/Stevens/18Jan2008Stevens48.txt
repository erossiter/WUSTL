SEN. STEVENS URGES ALASKANS TO PREPARE FOR NEW BORDER CROSSING PROCEDURES FOR LAND, SEA
  This week U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff announced that on January 31, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will no longer accept oral declarations as proof of citizenship to gain entry into the United States by land or sea. Border crossings will require possession of a passport, other approved single documents, or a combination of two documents such as a driver's licenses and birth certificate. 
   "This decision means that an Alaska driver's license alone will no longer be accepted as proof of citizenship for entry at the U.S.-Canada border. I have continually objected to hasty implementation of new border crossing regulations and will work with my Senate colleagues to see that northern border states are not adversely impacted by these changes," said Senator Stevens. "I urge everyone planning to cross the border into Alaska by land or sea to obtain the necessary documentation as soon as possible."
   These new document requirements are part of a phase-in of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI). Full implementation was delayed until June 2009 by language added by Senator Stevens and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in the FY08 Omnibus Bill due to concerns about whether DHS and the Department of State could implement passcard technology and other important measures in a timely manner. When fully implemented, WHTI will require a passport or passcard for border crossings between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
   The list of approved documents and new procedures can be reviewed on Customs and Border Protection's website at:
