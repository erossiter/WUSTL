SENS. STEVENS, FEINSTEIN INTRODUCE BILL TO SHUT DOWN REPEAT OFFENDER SLAUGHTERHOUSES
  Senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today introduced legislation that would shut down slaughter facilities that repeatedly process downed animals. It would also offer stiff fines and temporary one-year shutdowns for first and second time violators.  
   This bill was drafted in the wake of the February 17 Westland/Hallmark Meat Company's recall of more than 143 million pounds of beef products that were processed at their plant. This came after the Humane Society of the United States released a video showing workers abusing non-ambulatory cows to get them on their feet for slaughter. 
  "Slaughtering ill livestock and sending this meat to market is simply not acceptable," said Senator Stevens. "We need stiffer penalties for meat packing companies that are engaging in this practice. By passing this legislation Congress would help ensure fewer recalls, safer food, and the protection of American consumers."
  This measure would grant the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) greater authority to penalize and shutdown facilities that process livestock. It also would require the USDA to release the names of establishments that have received recalled products. This will help distributors, retailers, and consumers to better identify and more quickly get recalled products off their shelves and out of their homes. 
  Under this legislation, slaughterhouses would face fines and other penalties if caught trying to slaughter downed livestock. These include:
   * A fine for a first violation, based upon a percentage of the facility's gross income. The percentage would be determined by the USDA Secretary; 
   * USDA inspection services would be suspended for one year following a second violation, effectively shutting down the facility during that time; and 
   * A third violation would require the USDA to withdraw the facility's Grant of Inspection - resulting in the permanent shutdown of the facility.
