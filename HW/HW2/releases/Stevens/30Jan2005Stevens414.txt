SEN. STEVENS RECEIVES FRIEND OF JIMMIE DAVIS AWARD
  The Louisiana Political Museum and the Louisiana Political Hall of Fame honored Sen.  
 Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) on Saturday with their prestigious "Friend of Jimmie Davis" Award. The annual award is named after the late Louisiana Governor Jimmie Davis, with whom Stevens was friends. 
   "Jimmie was a committed public servant, and I was fortunate to call him a friend," said Senator Stevens. "One of his greatest accomplishments was the 'Sunshine Bridge' that connected Baton Rouge and New Orleans. I recently learned that when Jimmie proposed that bridge, his critics called it a 'bridge to nowhere.' But, Jimmie had vision; he saw that the Sunshine Bridge would transform his state. And it did; that area became the center of Louisiana's industrial activity." 
   "Some have used that same phrase - 'bridge to nowhere' - to criticize important infrastructure projects in Alaska. I'm following Jimmie's example; I know those bridges will carry our state into a new era of growth and prosperity."
