SEN. STEVENS RECEIVES DTV LEADERSHIP AWARD
  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today was honored with the Best DTV Leadership Award from the Consumer Electronics Association as part of its sixth annual Academy of Digital Television Pioneer Awards.  
   Chairman Stevens, Senate Commerce Committee Co-Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Congressman Joe Barton (R-Texas), and Congressman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), were recognized for their roles in moving DTV legislation as a title in the Budget Reconciliation Act passed earlier this year. The title set a hard date for the digital transition of February 17, 2009. 
   "It is an honor to receive this award. As we addressed the DTV issue, it was a pleasure to work with the electronics industry through listening sessions and Committee hearings," said Chairman Stevens. "The electronics industry will continue to play an important role by educating and informing consumers about the transition process. Years ago, some people said that the digital transition was a very heavy lift. It looks like working together, we proved them wrong.".
