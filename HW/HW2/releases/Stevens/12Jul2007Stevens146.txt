APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ADOPTS SEN. STEVENS' AMENDMENT TO EXTEND RETIREMENT AGE FOR COMMERCIAL PILOTS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a provision sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) which would allow commercial airline pilots to fly until age 65 provided the other pilot in the aircraft is under age 60. The amendment was added to the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development funding bill.  
  An identical provision was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee on May 16, 2007, as part of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill. The provision was secured in the Senate DOT funding bill today to mirror action taken by the House of Representatives, which added similar language to its Transportation appropriations bill.
  "Alaska, and the entire transportation system are losing qualified pilots every day to the outdated FAA Age 60 rule," said Senator Stevens. "It is important we change the rule as soon as possible to make sure our most senior and seasoned pilots remain in the system."
  The FAA currently requires commercial pilots to retire once they reach age 60. The FAA announced earlier this year that it would begin a rulemaking process to raise the retirement age of commercial pilots to age 65, which would make United States' policy consistent with international commercial pilot standards established by the International Civil Aeronautics Organization. Current international standards allow one pilot up to age 65 provided the other pilot is under age 60.
