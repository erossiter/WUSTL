SEN. STEVENS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF WILLYE B. WHITE
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) on Wednesday, Feb. 7, offered the following statement upon learning of the passing of Willye B. White, a five-time Olympian and member of President Ford's Commission on Olympic Sports. This panel was instrumental in the creation of the United States Olympic Committee, which was established by legislation championed by Sen. Ted Stevens.  
   "It was with great sadness that Catherine and I learned of Willye's passing. Our nation has lost a champion in every sense of the word - after a tremendous career in athletics, Willye found great success as a coach, a teacher, a philanthropist, and a steward of sportsmanship. Her work on behalf of underprivileged children and her contributions to the world of sports remain an inspiration. Any American who has ever been associated with the U.S. Olympic Committee owes a debt of gratitude to this amazing and gracious woman." 
   Ms. White is the only American athlete to compete on five consecutive U.S. Olympic track and field teams. In the 1956 Olympic Games, at just 16 years of age, White won a silver medal in the long jump. She collected another silver medal in the 4x100 meter-relay eight years later in Tokyo. White also represented track and field on the U.S. Olympic Committee, coached in the National Sports Festival in 1979 and 1981, and coached and managed at the 1981 World Cup Track and Field Championship Games. In 1988, she was inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. Three years later, she established the Willye White Foundation to help children build self-esteem and become productive citizens.
