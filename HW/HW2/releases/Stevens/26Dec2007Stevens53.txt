PRESIDENTS SIGNS BILL TO FUNDS ALASKA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  President George W. Bush signed into law the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 2764), which includes funding for the Department of Transportation. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), programs designed to enhance service and safety in the state of Alaska continue to receive the backing of the federal government. 
   Notably, the Essential Air Service will receive $110 million** to continue operations. The Service subsidizes commercial airline service to small communities in Alaska and throughout the U.S. that would otherwise not be profitable for carriers. In Alaska, 39 communities are served by this program. H.R. 2764 also includes $34.4 million for aviation projects in Alaska, ranging from the Medallion Program to rural runway safety.
   "Nearly 50 years after statehood, many parts of Alaska remain underdeveloped and a substantial number of our communities still lack basic infrastructure. This measure will help bridge that gap, keep Alaskans safe, and boost infrastructure development across the state," said Senator Stevens. "Because 70 percent of Alaska's communities can be reached year-round only by air, the funding for aviation projects, in particular, is an absolute necessity."
   Specific funding levels for aviation projects in Alaska include:
   * $17 million for Safe Flight 21, which funds the Capstone program and the Alaska Weather Camera program;
   * $5.1 million for flight service station modernization, which provides new infrastructure design to increase safety margins of Alaskan air service;
   * $2 million for the Alaskan National Airspace System Interfacility Communications System;
   * $2.5 million to the State of Alaska for rural runway lighting;
   * $2.7 million to the University of Alaska for the Alaska Volcano Observatory;
   * $2.5 million for the Medallion Program; and
   * $2.6 million for the construction of the Akutan Airport.
   Additional Alaska projects funded by this bill include:
   * $375,000 to the Alaska Mobility Coalition for statewide bus and bus facility enhancements and
   * $750,000 for the demonstration and deployment of positive train control technology along the Alaska Railroad.
   Alaska will also benefit from national programs aimed at enhancing transportation. Senator Stevens secured $15 million to be used for ferry projects in Alaska and Hawaii. These funds are split between the states and are for enhancements to the ferry infrastructure. Alaskans will also benefit from $10 million to assist small shipyards that facilitate domestic ship construction in making capital improvements.
   ** Funding levels for the Department of Transportation contained in the Omnibus Appropriations Act are subject to a 2.0 percent reduction as part of a bipartisan compromise needed to pass the bill. All spending figures in this press release do not reflect these reductions.
