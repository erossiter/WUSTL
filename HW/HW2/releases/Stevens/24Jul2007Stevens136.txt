SEN. STEVENS CO-SPONSORS BILL TO ESTABLISH NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE DAY
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has joined Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) in introducing legislation to designate the Friday after Thanksgiving each year as "Native American Heritage Day." This annual day would serve as a way for our nation to recognize the achievements and contributions of Native Americans, including Alaska Natives, to the United States.  
  "Native Americans have had an indelible impact on our nation," said Senator Stevens. "Their history is our history, and the rich culture and traditions of Native Americans are nowhere more evident than in our state. Native American Heritage Day will afford all Alaskans an opportunity to recognize the many contributions of Alaska Natives, and it will help us to celebrate their unique cultural legacy." 
  Native American Heritage Day will encourage public schools in the United States to enhance students' understanding of Native American culture by providing curricula and classroom instruction focused on their achievements and societal contributions.
