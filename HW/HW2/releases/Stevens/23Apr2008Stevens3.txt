ALASKA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO HOLD CONFERENCE ON FEDERAL GRANT PROCESS
  In an effort to educate Alaskans on the federal grant process, Senator Ted Stevens, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and Congressman Don Young will hold a grants symposium from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on May 29, 2008, at the Egan Center in Anchorage. At the event, information on federal grant opportunities, application processes, and post-award requirements will be provided. 
   As the amount of congressional earmarks in the federal budget is reduced, the executive branch and its agencies will continue to receive increased funding that will be spent at their discretion. Some of these funds will be available to groups and communities through grants for a wide variety of projects. The Delegation hopes to ensure their constituents are well-informed about the federal grant process and able to seek access to any available federal grant.
   A number of federal agencies have been invited to the symposium. The Alaska Congressional Delegation has asked the agencies to host information booths and be available to answer questions about the grant process for their respective agency.
