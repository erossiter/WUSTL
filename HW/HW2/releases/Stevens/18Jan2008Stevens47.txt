SEN. STEVENS COMMENDS PRESIDENT BUSH FOR THE RELEASE OF VETERANS' FUNDING
  Today Senator Stevens applauded President Bush for his decision to release $3.7 billion in emergency funding for veterans' programs. This emergency funding was included in the fiscal year (FY) 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which was approved by Congress in December. 
   "I commend President Bush for his continued commitment to our nation's veterans and those brave servicemen and women defending our freedom around the world today. These funds will have very real impacts on our veterans, including service members returning to stations in Alaska. However, the support cannot end there," said Senator Stevens. "In 2008, I will continue to work to ensure that all of America's veterans have access to the best care and services that our nation can provide."
   The majority of the emergency funding will go to the Veterans' Health Administration. Overall, FY 2008 appropriations provide the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs with $43.1 billion in new spending for veterans' medical care, claims processing, and facility improvements.
