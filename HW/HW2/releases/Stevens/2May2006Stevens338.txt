SEN. STEVENS CONGRATULATES PERSEVERANCE THEATRE OF DOUGLAS
  Today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) congratulated the Perseverance Theatre of Douglas for being selected to participate in the National Endowment for the Arts' (NEA) Shakespeare for a New Generation program. This honor includes a matching Shakespeare in American Communities grant, which will help the theater fund a tour of its Alaska Native-themed production of Macbeth.  
   "Congratulations to the Perseverance Theatre on this honor. The theater has helped preserve Alaska's cultural history and will now be able to share our state's artistic traditions with individuals throughout the Washington, D.C. area," said Stevens. 
   The Perseverance Theatre is one of 36 professional theater companies selected to participate in the NEA's Shakespeare for a New Generation program during the 2006-2007 academic year. The theater's tour will include performances at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. The company will also provide educational activities for high school students in Washington, D.C. 
   Since 2003, the NEA has awarded 82 Shakespeare in American Communities grants to professional theater companies. These companies stage live performances of Shakespeare's works in hundreds of towns across the country. More than one million high school students have attended these productions and an estimated twelve million students have benefited from the NEA's educational Shakespeare kits. 
   The Perseverance Theatre was founded in 1979 and has emerged as one of the nation's leading regional theaters, hosting as many as 20,000 artists and audience members annually. The theater is dedicated to working with Alaska artists and has premiered over 50 new plays by national and Alaska playwrights. It is the resident theater at the University of Alaska Southeast.
