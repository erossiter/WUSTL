SENATE PASSES SENS. STEVENS-MURKOWSKI RESOLUTION CONDEMNING HARMFUL FOREIGN FISHING PRACTICES
  The United States Senate has unanimously passed a Resolution condemning the harmful subsidies many foreign governments direct to their fishing industries. Introduced by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Resolution (S. Res. 208) was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 13 Senators. Sen. Ted Stevens noted that the problems caused by these subsidies affect not only global fisheries resources, but also the coastal communities which depend on them.  
  "The overexploitation of global fisheries resources must end," said Senator Stevens. "It is deeply troubling that many countries continue to subsidize their industrial fishing fleets, thereby enabling them to pillage fish stocks on the high seas. These practices harm the environment and threaten the livelihoods of American fishermen, who act according to management practices designed to ensure the sustainability of our fisheries."
  "The Senate resolution sends a strong message that the United States is serious about ending harmful foreign fishing subsidies," Senator Murkowski noted. "This reinforces our proposal to the WTO and supports our position that now is the time to address the global overcapitalization of fishing fleets which can lead to overfishing and harm to the environment."
  Senate Resolution 208 is attached.
