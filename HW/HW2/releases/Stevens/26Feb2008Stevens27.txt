SEN. STEVENS CALLS ON HOUSE TO SWIFTLY TAKE UP MEASURE
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today applauded the Senate's passage of S. 1200, a bill tailored to ensure an effective Indian health care system. The legislation reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and is the first stride toward modern Indian health care reform in over 15 years. Senator Stevens is a co-sponsor of S. 1200.  
  "Senator Murkowski worked hard on this legislation and her contributions led to its passage in the Senate," said Senator Stevens. "While great strides have been made, this Act will further address the shortage of proper health care services and facilities available to our Native peoples in Alaska and throughout the nation. The House should act swiftly on this bill and get it to the President."
  Senators Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) co-managed the bill to passage on the Senate floor. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act was first passed in Congress in 1976 and addresses the lack of basic health care services, doctors and trained professionals faced by Native groups.
