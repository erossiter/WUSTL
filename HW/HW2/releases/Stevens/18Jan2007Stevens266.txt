SEN. STEVENS' 'CALL HOME' LEGISLATION ENACTED TO ASSIST MILITARY WITH AFFORDABLE CALLS TO FAMILIES
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) on Thursday, January 18, commended FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and the Commission for acting quickly to begin implementation of the Call Home Act of 2006, which passed Congress late last year. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Ted Stevens and current Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii).  
   This legislation directs the FCC, in coordination with the Department of Defense and the Department of State, to work to reduce phone rates for Armed Forces personnel deployed overseas. This FCC action is only the first step in the implementation process, but will reduce costs for military personnel calling home. 
   "I applaud Chairman Martin and the entire Commission for the speedy implementation of the Call Home Act," said Senator Stevens. "As a former military pilot stationed overseas during World War II, I know how much it means to be able to communicate with families and loved ones at home. It can cost soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan as much as 33 cents a minute to call their families in Alaska. Today's action by the FCC will immediately provide our troops and their families with access to more affordable communications services." 
   The Call Home Act authorizes the FCC to take actions necessary to reduce phone bills for troops deployed overseas, including the waiver of government fees, assessments, or other charges. In seeking to reduce these telephone rates, the measure directs the FCC to evaluate and analyze the costs of calls to and from official duty stations; evaluate methods of reducing rates including the deployment of new technology such as Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP); encourage phone companies to adopt flexible billing for troops and their dependents; and seek agreements with foreign governments to reduce international surcharges on phone calls.
