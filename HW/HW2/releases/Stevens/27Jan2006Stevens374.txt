SEN. STEVENS TO VOTE TO CONFIRM ALITO
  Today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) went to the floor of the Senate and announced his intention to support Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to become associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Sen. Stevens told his Senate colleagues the decision to support this nomination was a difficult one because of his pro-choice position on abortion.  
   "For me, the decision to vote for Judge Alito was not a simple one," said Stevens. "I am proud to come from a family with a long line of very strong pro-choice women, and I have reflected their judgment here in the Senate. I am from a different generation. I remember well when a woman's right to choose to have an abortion was not recognized by law. 
   "The reversal of Roe v. Wade would be destabilizing for our country and our federal system. It could, and probably would, lead to a battle to amend the Constitution to reassure American women of their Constitutional rights. Such a battle is unnecessary as long as the justices on the Supreme Court honor the doctrine of stare decisis." 
   Senator Stevens explained that he decided to support the nomination because of Judge Alito's respect for precedent and his record of strict interpretation of law in previous cases. 
   Stevens said, "While serving on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Alito ruled on three cases related to abortion. In each of these cases, he demonstrated a respect for and deference to established rules of law. He did what he believed the law required; he did not seek to enact a personal political agenda... 
   "Based on his past rulings and testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I believe Judge Alito will respect stare decisis on the issue of Roe v. Wade or any issue that comes before the Court. And as I vote to confirm his nomination, I do so on the assumption that Judge Alito will uphold this commitment... to stare decisis."
