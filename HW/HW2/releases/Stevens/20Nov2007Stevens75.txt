SEN. STEVENS PRAISES FCC PROGRAM TO IMPROVE TELEMEDICINE IN ALASKA
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, today praised a new pilot program implemented by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to improve telemedicine in Alaska and across the nation. The new initiative would support the creation of a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure to improve the quality of health care. Participants in the pilot program are eligible for universal service funding to support up to 85 percent of the costs associated with the design, engineering and construction of their broadband health care networks. Pursuant to the FCC order, the Alaska Native Health Consortium will receive up to $10.4 million in funding assistance to improve telemedicine in rural Alaska. 
   "Access to affordable and dependable health care is vital to the residents of rural Alaska, and this pilot program is a great start," said Senator Stevens. "Broadband health networks in Alaska and other parts of rural America will mean that millions of Americans will be able to access the best health care in the world, no matter where they live."
   The Rural Health Care Pilot Program (RHCPP) implemented by the FCC will provide more than $417 million in funding for the construction of 69 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories. More than 6,000 public and non-profit health care providers nationwide are expected to be connected to broadband telehealth networks. The health care facilities participating in the program include: hospitals, clinics, universities, research centers, behavioral health sites, correctional facility clinics, and community health centers.
