SENATE PASSES LEGISLATION TO EXTEND DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY COSPONSORED BY SEN. STEVENS
  The United States Senate last night unanimously approved two pieces of legislation, co-sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), to extend and improve the Do-Not-Call registry. The combination of the Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act (S. 781) and the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act (S. 2096) would allow the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to collect fees to maintain the registry and remove the need for consumers to re-register their names on the Do-Not-Call list. More than 200,000 Alaskan numbers have been listed in the Do-Not-Call registry. 
   "By enacting this legislation, the Senate has taken an important step toward making the Do-Not-Call list the Never-Call list," said Senator Stevens. "The Do-Not-Call registry has dramatically limited the number of unwanted calls to thousands of Alaskans and millions of Americans. This list has also assisted the Federal Trade Commission in preventing telemarketing fraud and abuse."
   S.781 would extend the FTC's authority to collect funds to maintain the Do-Not-Call registry, while providing financial certainty to entities that utilize the registry by standardizing yearly fee increases for use of the registry's list. S. 2096 would remove the need for consumers currently on the list to have to re-register. It would also ask the FTC to report to Congress on its efforts to improve the accuracy of the Do-Not-Call list.
   Similar legislation was approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month.
