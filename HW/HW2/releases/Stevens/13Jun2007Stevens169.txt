SEN. STEVENS SPONSORS AMENDMENT BANNING FINFISH AQUACULTURE IN ALASKAN WATERS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today introduced an amendment to the Bush Administration's National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007, which would forbid the issuance of finfish aquaculture permits within Alaska's 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) has agreed to co-sponsor this amendment.  
  "Sixty percent of America's commercial fish harvest is caught off of Alaska's shores. The vitality of our waters is important not only to Alaskans, but to the whole nation," said Senator Stevens. "Senator Inouye and I have introduced this amendment because it will ensure the sustainability of commercial fisheries in Alaska. While fish farms may be important to other states, finfish aquaculture may threaten wild fish stocks in our state. My support for the Administration's aquaculture bill is contingent upon the adoption of this critical amendment."
  The amendment offered today by Senator Stevens would allow shellfish aquaculture in federal waters off the coast of Alaska. There is currently shellfish aquaculture taking place in Alaskan state waters. These farms are currently used to grow oysters, geoduck clams, and other species of shellfish. Recent research also indicates that shellfish aquaculture could greatly enhance the stocks of certain king crab species found in the waters off Alaska.
