VETERANS AFFAIRS NOMINEE GENERAL JAMES PEAKE COMMITS TO VISITING ALASKA AT SEN. STEVENS' REQUEST
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today met with Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) nominee Lieutenant General James B. Peake, M.D. (Ret.) to discuss issues facing veterans in Alaska and the nation, including rural veterans' access to healthcare, mental healthcare for veterans, and the treatment of wounded veterans returning to the United States.  
  Senator Stevens also invited Dr. Peake to visit Alaska, tour the State's VA facilities, and meet with Alaska veterans. Dr. Peake said he would accept the Senator's offer, should he be confirmed by the Senate. 
  "One of the most effective ways to get Alaskans assistance is to encourage senior federal officials to visit our State and see firsthand the challenges we face," said Senator Stevens. "I was pleased to meet with Dr. Peake today and was impressed by his enthusiasm. I look forward to traveling with him in Alaska as we work toward the common goal of getting our veterans the best care and services possible." 
  Alaska has more veterans per capita than any state in the nation.
  President Bush announced his intention to nominate Dr. Peake on October 30, 2007. The Senate Veteran Affairs Committee has scheduled a vote on his confirmation tomorrow, and if approved, his nomination must be confirmed by the full Senate. He is a highly decorated veteran who served as an infantry officer in Vietnam and retired from the Army in 2004 after serving as U.S. Army Surgeon General for four years. He also served as lead commander in several medical posts including Madigan Army Medical Center in Ft. Lewis, Wash., which oversees all Army medical centers in the western United States, including Alaska. Dr. Peake commanded and visited all of the Army medical facilities in Alaska.
