SEN. STEVENS WELCOMES FEMA AID FOR CARIBOU HILLS FIRE RECOVERY EFFORT
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today applauded the Bush Administration's decision to approve federal fire assistance funds for Alaska in response to the Caribou Hills fire, which has now burned 55,000 acres of land on the Kenai Peninsula. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded the State of Alaska a Fire Management Assistance Grant, which would allow the State to recoup up to 75 percent of its emergency response costs.  
  FEMA's decision came after the Acting Assistant Administrator of the agency determined that the Caribou Hills fire constitutes a major disaster. The grant funds may be used for a variety of purposes, including equipment, supplies, evacuations, shelter, and firefighter health and safety needs. 
  "I am pleased the Bush Administration has recognized the dire situation facing our State and the people who live on the Kenai Peninsula," said Senator Stevens. "FEMA funds will help Alaskans recover from this devastating fire, but federal assistance cannot stop there. As fires continue to burn across the nation, we are reminded that Congress must ensure all states battling wildfires, including Alaska, receive sufficient funds to prepare for the fire season. We have anticipated this need in the past, and I urge Congress to fully fund fire assistance programs again this year."
  According to the State Department of Natural Resources, 307 fires burned more than 266,000 acres in Alaska in 2006. Through his role as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens has continually advocated for federal funding for the State and Community Fire Assistance program, which provides fire management assistance to various States and communities.
  Last week, Senator Stevens secured fire assistance funds for Alaska in the FY2008 Interior Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. A portion of those funds would be dedicated to the Kenai Borough to address spruce bark beetle infestations; additional funds would go to the Mat-Su Borough. Fires have already caused extensive damage to both areas this year. The Fairbanks North Star Borough, Cook Inlet Tribal Council, the City of Skagway, and the City of Anchorage would also receive funding if the current Interior Appropriations bill is approved by Congress and signed into law by the President. 
  In the past, Senator Stevens has secured similar funding to aid Alaska. In FY2006, Congress allocated $5.5 million to fire assistance programs in the state. These funds were distributed as follows: 
   * $2.1 million to the Kenai Peninsula Borough; 
   * $300,000 to the Cook Inlet Tribal Council; 
   * $1.1 million to the Matanuska-Susitna Borough; 
   * $800,000 to the North Star Borough; and 
   * $1.2 million to the Municipality of Anchorage to remove dead and dying timber and for reforestation. 
  To help reduce fire risks, Senator Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also secured $6.5 million in FY2005. The funds were allocated as follows:
   * $2.1 million to the Kenai Peninsula Borough; 
   * $300,000 to the Cook Inlet Tribal Council; 
   * $1.6 million to the Matanuska-Susitna Borough; 
   * $1 million was allocated to the North Star Borough; and 
   * $1.5 million to the Municipality of Anchorage to remove dead and dying timber and for reforestation.
