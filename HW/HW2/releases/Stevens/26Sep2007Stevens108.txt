SEN. STEVENS PUSHES FOR PERMANENT 'DO-NOT-CALL' REGISTRY
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today joined Senator Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) in sponsoring legislation to eliminate the five-year automatic removal of telephone numbers registered in the federal "Do-Not-Call" list. If passed, the bill would create a permanent registry maintained by the Federal Trade Commission.  
  "The federal Do-Not-Call registry is a tool used by millions of Americans who do not want to be harassed by unwanted telemarketing calls," said Senator Stevens. "Consumers should not have to mark their calendars every five years as a reminder to re-register their numbers on the Do-Not-Call list."
  Currently, each number in the Do-Not-Call registry will expire five years after its initial registration. Nearly 52 million numbers will expire before September 30, 2008. 
  The Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007 is also co-sponsored by Senators Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), John Ensign (R-Nev.), John Kerry (D-Mass.), Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).
