SEN. STEVENS SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO DESIGNATE SEPTEMBER NATIONAL YOUTH COURT MONTH
  The United States Senate late last night passed a resolution sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) that designates September 2007 as National Youth Court Month. It is designed to raise awareness about youth court participation in the United States. The legislation (S. Res. 296) was co-sponsored by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and a bipartisan group of 10 other senators. 
  "Instilling a strong sense of volunteerism in our youth is critical to shaping the leaders of tomorrow," said Senator Stevens. "Programs like National Youth Court can inspire new generations and help our young people develop valuable life skills. By designating September National Youth Court Month, the Senate has highlighted the importance of youth volunteer service." 
  "National Youth Court gives young Americans an opportunity to develop leadership qualities that can last a lifetime," said Senator Murkowski. "I am proud that the Senate has recognized the success of this important program."
  Youth courts, also called teen, peer, or student courts, are programs in which youth determine fair and restorative sentences for peers for minor offenses and other problem behaviors. 
  More than 1,200 youth courts in 49 states, including Alaska, provide restorative justice for juvenile offenders. These efforts help prevent crime, enhance public safety, and educate participants. In 2006, more than 120,000 young people volunteered to hear more than 130,000 juvenile cases, and more than 20,000 adults volunteered to facilitate peer justice in youth courts.
