SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS DEPARTMENT OF LABOR GRANT FOR ALASKA GAS PIPELINE WORKER TRAINING
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today commended the U.S. Department of Labor's decision to award a $7.5 million competitive grant to the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. These funds will enable the State of Alaska to train 8,300 workers needed to construct a natural gas pipeline. 
  "The gas pipeline will bring Alaska's energy to America, stimulate our state's economy, and create thousands of new jobs. This is an essential project which must move forward as quickly as possible," said Senator Stevens. "By providing workers with the skills they need, this grant will help ensure the pipeline's swift and successful construction. I am encouraged by the proactive approach taken by Administration and State officials to begin training pipeline workers." 
  Within the Conference Report of the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Act, the Alaska Delegation was able to secure enabling language and a loan guarantee to provide the authorization necessary to permit and construct the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline. In addition, $20 million was authorized for an Alaska Pipeline Construction Training Program. The grant provided by the Department of Labor will complement these previously authorized federal funds.
