COMMERCE COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. STEVENS' MEASURE TO COMBAT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation today approved the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Management Act of 2007 (S.1581), which is cosponsored by Committee Vice Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). Ocean acidification is caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and it could negatively alter marine ecosystems and affect fisheries. S.1581 would authorize an interagency committee to develop a comprehensive research and implementation plan to deal with the emerging problem of ocean acidification. 
   "Ocean acidification threatens our fisheries and other marine resources," said Senator Stevens.  "It is important that we understand the effects of ocean acidification and implement management strategies that will protect the ocean and its ecosystem."
   S.1581 would specifically:
   * Authorize an interagency committee to develop a comprehensive research and implementation plan to deal with ocean acidification;
   * Authorize a program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to implement activities consistent with the plan, including a competitive grant process; and
   * Authorize appropriations of $100 million for Fiscal Years 2009-2013. This authorization would be split with 40 allocated to NOAA and the remaining 60 percent to other agencies.
