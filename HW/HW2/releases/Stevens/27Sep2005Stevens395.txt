SEN. STEVENS ANNOUNCES GRANT TO HAINES BOROUGH PUBLIC LIBRARY
  Today the Partnership for a Nation of Learners, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) leadership initiative, informed Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) that the Haines Borough Public Library, in conjunction with Lynn Canal Broadcasting and KHNS radio, will receive a grant of $212,367 for a project that uses technology to educate rural Alaskans about the impacts of drug and alcohol abuse.  
   The Haines Borough Public Library and Lynn Canal Broadcasting will enable patrons and listeners in Haines, Klukwan, Skagway and 20 other rural Alaska towns to participate in Perspectives: Issues and Explorations, a two-year program focusing on the use of technology to promote lifelong learning and social engagement. Activities include storytelling through digital audio production and the creation of audio diaries which illustrate the impacts of substance abuse. The project will increase awareness of substance abuse impacts, encourage civic participation, and create a partnership network among the participating organizations to improve services to their communities. 
   "This is an exciting new partnership between the Haines Library and the broadcast community to use technology to reach out to rural Alaska to combat drug and alcohol abuse," said Stevens. "This innovative collaboration will allow participants to share their experiences with substance abuse and allow others to learn from those experiences." 
   By bringing key community educational and cultural resources together to address defined community needs, the Partnership for a Nation of Learners strives to reap real community benefits, including public access, efficient use of community assets, and increased opportunities for learning.
