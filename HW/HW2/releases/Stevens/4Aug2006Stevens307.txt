SENATE PASSES SENS. STEVENS, LAUTENBERG PETS EVACUATION AND TRANSPORTATION STANDARDS EVACUATION BILL
  U.S. Senate late yesterday unanimously passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS) Act of 2006, a bill sponsored by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J). The legislation requires state and local authorities to include evacuation procedures for people with household pets and service animals in their emergency preparedness plans.  
   "I am pleased the Senate took swift action in passing the PETS Act," said Senator Stevens. "The aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma demonstrated that we do not have adequate plans in place for the evacuation of pets and service animals. This legislation will help ensure we are prepared to address this need during future crises and natural disasters." 
   "This isn't just about pet safety - it will also save human lives," said Senator Lautenberg. "During Hurricane Katrina, many residents remained in harm's way because they didn't want to leave beloved pets behind. It only makes sense to plan for pets in the event of a disaster." 
   Under the provisions of the legislation, state and local emergency preparedness plans must address the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals. Additionally, the PETS Act of 2006 authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to financially assist state and local efforts to secure emergency shelter facilities that can accommodate people with pets and service animals. 
   The U.S. House of Representatives passed a similar measure on May 22, 2006. The PETS Act now goes back to the House for final passage or to a conference committee, which will reconcile differences between the House-passed and Senate-passed bills.
