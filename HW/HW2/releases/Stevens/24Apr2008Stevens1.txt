SENATE COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. STEVENS' BILL PROMOTING SEAFOOD SAFETY
  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation today approved Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Dan Inouye's (D-Hawaii) legislation to improve seafood safety in the United States. The bill would establish a federal program that would ensure commercially distributed seafood in America is fit for consumption. 
   This measure would expand the authority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) so the agency could work closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to test seafood imports, inspect foreign seafood facilities, and track domestic seafood shipments. The bill would also expand the authority of the FDA to hold seafood imports that are suspected of being contaminated for further testing. Funding to implement the program has been authorized at $15 million through 2013 and would allow for additional laboratories to analyze imported seafood.
   "This bill will provide NOAA and the FDA with tools to ensure that seafood imports meet the same strict safety standards as our domestic seafood," said Senator Stevens. "Every year, nearly half of our domestic fishery production comes from the waters off Alaska and our seafood has set the standard in quality. It is vital to both consumers and our fishing industry that all seafood consumed in America is safe and healthy."
   The bill would require the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work together to:
   * examine and test imported seafood;
   * inspect foreign facilities;
   * provide technical assistance and training to foreign facilities and governments;
   * expedite seafood imports from countries with consistently high standards;
   * generate a shipment tracking system;
   * create labeling requirements;
   * commission NOAA officers and employees to examine seafood;
   * share information concerning non-compliance and new regulation; and
   * conduct joint training on subjects related to seafood inspection.
