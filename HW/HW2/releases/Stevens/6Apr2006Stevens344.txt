SEN. STEVENS: STATES MUST BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE
  Today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) participated in a hearing about offshore aquaculture, which was held by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation National Ocean Policy Study Subcommittee. During the hearing, Sen. Stevens reiterated his long-standing belief that coastal states must be able to opt out of a national offshore aquaculture program.  
   In June 2005, at the request of the Administration, Senator Stevens and Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) introduced S. 1195, the National Offshore Aquaculture Act. This legislation directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a permitting process that designates which areas of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone are open to offshore aquaculture development. Stevens simultaneously introduced amendment SA 769, which allows governors of coastal states to opt out of aquaculture development in the federal waters off of their shores. 
   "Clearly, it should be the right of a state that has wild fish to protect its fish without an economic analysis ? Alaska has half the coastline of the United States. Our state harvests 60% of all commercial fish harvested in the United States," said Stevens. "I myself doubt seriously that we would ever be able to protect wild fish if we had aquaculture off of our shores." 
   Stevens explained that his amendment would address this concern. He said, "That amendment would allow a portion of the coastline off of Alaska to be excluded from the concept of aquaculture, while at the same time permitting other areas to be used." 
   Mr. Mark Vinsel, executive director of the United Fisherman of Alaska, testified before the subcommittee and echoed Stevens' concerns. On behalf of the 31 fishing organizations that United Fisherman represents, Vinsel urged the subcommittee to carefully consider the proposed legislation. He stated, "These operations must be consistent with ecosystem management based on sound science and a precautionary approach. Please be very cautious in your drafting of regulations and heed the old saying ?'First, do no harm.'" 
   In his written statement, Vinsel also made specific recommendations for the proposed national offshore aquaculture program. He suggested that the program include: 
   * The study of market impacts to protect existing wild seafood production 
   * The incorporation of local scientific input into the permitting process and decisions about the location of fish farms 
   * Management authority for regional fishery management councils over fish farm operations 
   * Equal access to the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture research, marketing, and support programs for wild fish and farmed fish operations 
   * Provisions that allow coastal states to modify their aquaculture practices or completely opt out of the program.
