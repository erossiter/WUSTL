SENATE PASSES REVISED CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE BILL
  The United States Senate today approved a measure to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who was an original co-sponsor of the legislation that established the program a decade ago, voted in favor of the bill (H.R. 3963).  
   In Alaska, SCHIP is administered by Denali KidCare. Under the new funding formula in the bill, the State would receive $36.5 million for Denali KidCare, a three-fold increase over last year's funding level. The additional funding provided by the legislation passed today will enable the program to expand its coverage. 
   "Funding contained in this bill is not 'middle-class welfare' as some critics have claimed, and the SCHIP program will not replace private insurance for those who can afford it," said Senator Stevens. "Instead, the passage of SCHIP legislation ensures that thousands of Alaska's low-income children get the basic, dependable health coverage they need. It is time for Congress and the President to put aside their partisan differences and get SCHIP reauthorization signed into law. " 
   SCHIP provides health coverage to low-income, uninsured children whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid and cannot afford private health insurance. H.R. 3963 would maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children currently covered by SCHIP nationwide. The measure would also bring health coverage to an additional 3.1 million low-income, uninsured American children within five years. 
   The bill, which was approved 64-30, now proceeds to the President for his consideration. Funding for the SCHIP program will expire on November 16, 2007, if it is not reauthorized.
