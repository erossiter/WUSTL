SEN. STEVENS URGES CONGRESS TO ACT SWIFTLY IN SENDING DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL TO PRESIDENT
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today offered the following statement after the Senate's passage of the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act:  
   "I am pleased the Senate has passed the Defense Appropriations Act," said Senator Stevens. "Congress must now act swiftly to conference the House and Senate versions of this bill. This legislation must be to the President and signed so that the funds can be provided to the Department of Defense by October 1. Without this legislation, we will be forced to rely on funds from a continuing resolution, which will restrict our military's ability to conduct operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those of us in Congress owe it to our men and women in uniform to get them the resources they need to defend our country and fight the Global War on Terror.".
