ALASKA TRAVEL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY AT SENATE HEARING ON PROMOTING TOURISM
  Mr. Ron Peck, President of the Alaska Travel Industry Association, has accepted an invitation from the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee to testify at a hearing to examine economic and safety concerns in promoting travel to America. The hearing will begin at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 20, 2007 in Room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building. Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) serves as Vice Chair on the Senate Commerce Committee.  
  Mr. Peck represents more than 1,000 tourism and travel-related businesses throughout Alaska, which is one of the few states to utilize a public/private partnership in tourism promotion. The Commerce Committee has asked Mr. Peck to discuss this unique partnership and ATIA's role in promoting travel to Alaska and the United States.
  During the hearing, the Committee will also receive testimony from other state tourism officials and representatives from the Departments of Commerce, State, and Homeland Security. Witnesses will discuss economic and security concerns as they relate to: international tourism, successful promotional efforts by state tourism boards, and recommendations to increase international tourism to the United States. In addition, extended wait times in the visa application process, screening at U.S. ports of entry, and the need for tourism promotion to attract international tourists will also be addressed by Committee members and witnesses.
