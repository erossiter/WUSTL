SENATE PASSES COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE SPENDING BILL WITH FUNDING FOR DOZENS OF ALASKA PROJECTS
  The U.S. Senate last night approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. This measure (H.R. 3093) includes a series of provisions important to Alaska, including language sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) instructing the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to work with Alaskan law enforcement to start a methamphetamine task force. In addition, the bill contains $2 million in funding for statewide methamphetamine enforcement. 
  "Cooperation between the DEA and local law enforcement officials is a key to addressing Alaska's growing meth problem," said Senator Stevens. "We must find a way to stop the flow of this dangerous drug into our State, and especially into our Native villages. I am pleased that the Senate is instructing the DEA to work with Alaskan State and local law enforcement to combat this epidemic."  
  During its consideration of the bill, the Senate approved an amendment sponsored by Senator Stevens which would authorize the Secretary of Commerce to create a list of fishing vessels and vessel owners engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, a destructive practice that threatens to deplete important fish stocks around the world. The amendment would enable the Secretary to take appropriate action against listed vessels and owners in accordance with U.S. and international fisheries and trade laws. 
  "This amendment fills a critical gap that now exists in our efforts to combat global IUU fishing," said Senator Stevens. "By authorizing the Secretary to create this list of vessels and owners, we can ensure that our U.S. fishing industry can quickly and easily identify IUU 'blacklisted' boats and avoid conducting business with them. This will be one of many vital tools for discouraging - and ultimately ending - IUU fishing." 
  Alaska also stands to benefit from International Polar Year (IPY) funding contained in the CJS appropriations bill. The legislation fully funds the President's request for IPY activities through the National Science Foundation at nearly $47.3 million. Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) received IPY funding under the bill, bringing total funding for IPY to approximately $59 million. 
   "Knowledge gained from IPY studies will enable Congress and federal agencies to make informed decisions about the future of our nation," said Senator Stevens. "In Alaska, this research will help us address climate change affecting our communities, particularly those on our west coast."
