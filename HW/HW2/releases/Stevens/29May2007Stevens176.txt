SEN. STEVENS ISSUES STATEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION DECISION TO RENEW BOWHEAD WHALE QUOTA FOR ALASKA NATIVES
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) made the following statement today upon learning of the International Whaling Commission's (IWC) decision to renew the bowhead whale harvest quota for Alaska Natives for five years:  
  "I am pleased the IWC has recognized the subsistence rights of Alaska Natives," said Senator Stevens. "The very survival of the Eskimo people is tied to the harvest of bowhead whales. This sustainable harvest is a critical part of our Native peoples' heritage and identity, and it also provides a vital source of food and sustenance. By renewing this quota, the IWC has demonstrated the world's support for the unique culture of Alaska Natives.".
