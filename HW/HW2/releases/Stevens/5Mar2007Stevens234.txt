SEN. STEVENS COSPONSORS LEGISLATION TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Monday, March 5, joined a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues in introducing the "America COMPETES Act," which would increase American investment in basic research and improve the teaching of math, science, and engineering.  
   The America COMPETES Act focuses on three areas critical to maintaining and improving U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the 21st century: 
   (1) increasing research investment; 
   (2) strengthening educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school; and 
   (3) developing an innovation infrastructure. 
   "Our nation's success is the direct result of our advancements in science and technology," said Senator Stevens. "Scientists and engineers create new industries, and their efforts ensure our competitiveness in the global economy. To continue this tradition, we must increase our investment in basic research and improve the teaching of math, science, and engineering. This bill provides a great start and sends an important message: we are serious about the future of America." 
   Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Senator John Ensign (R-Nev.), Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), and Senator Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) also co-sponsored the measure. 
   The America COMPETES Act is a bipartisan legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report and the Council on Competitiveness' "Innovate America" report. The bill is similar to the "National Competitiveness Investment Act" that was introduced in September 2006.
