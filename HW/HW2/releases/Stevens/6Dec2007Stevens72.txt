SEN. STEVENS URGES SENATE TO PASS DECENCY LEGISLATION
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today urged the Senate to pass the Protecting Children from Indecent Programming Act (S. 1780), a bill that he is cosponsoring with Senator John D. Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii). The measure was approved earlier this summer by the Senate Commerce Committee, a panel on which Senator Stevens serves as Vice Chairman. 
   The legislation would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to maintain a policy that the broadcast of a single word or image may be considered indecent. S. 1780 would also allow the FCC to levy fines against broadcasters for a single-word or image violation.
   "I urge the Senate to take up and pass this important legislation because we must keep the airwaves clean," said Senator Stevens. "Children should not be exposed to indecent material by simply watching television or listening to the radio."
   Senator Stevens has long been a supporter of ridding broadcast television and radio of objectionable material. As Commerce Committee Chairman in 2005 and 2006, Senator Stevens held listening sessions and public hearings on the issue with key stakeholders, including family groups. Senator Stevens was also instrumental in Congress passing legislation that increased fines 10-fold on broadcasters that violated decency laws.
