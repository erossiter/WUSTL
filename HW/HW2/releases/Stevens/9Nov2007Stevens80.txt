SEN. STEVENS HONORS AMERICA'S VETERANS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today issued the following statement in honor of Veterans Day: 
  "Veterans Day is a reminder that the blessings of freedom and liberty are not free but are paid for by the sacrifice and dedication of the courageous men and women in uniform who defend our nation.
  "I was honored recently to meet such a hero, Quentin Aanenson, a fellow World War II veteran, along with Ken Burns, producer of the renowned documentary series, 'The War.'
  "Quentin's valiant story as a fighter pilot is featured in 'The War.' He was working at Elmendorf as a civilian when he enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1943. He flew combat missions over Europe and survived several close calls when his plane was hit by enemy fire.
  "Ken Burns' mesmerizing series brilliantly demonstrates the bravery, sacrifice, and commitment of the men and women, like Quentin, who fought for freedom and became known as our nation's 'Greatest Generation.' 
  "I am delighted PBS has supported this important project and it is my hope that this Veterans Day Alaskans will watch 'The War' and gain an even greater appreciation for all the men and women who have served our country in uniform throughout our history.
  "Today, new threats have brought forth a new 'Greatest Generation,' men and women, all of whom volunteered to once again defend our nation. On this Veterans Day, those of us from World War II proudly call these brave men and women our comrades. I honor their sacrifice and salute their service."
