SEN. STEVENS ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY RELIEF HIGHWAY FUNDING FOR ALASKA
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today announced that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will allocate $26,290,026 in emergency relief highway funding to the State of Alaska. These funds will be used to restore roads throughout the state that were damaged by severe storms in 2006.  
  Earlier this year, Senator Stevens worked with Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to secure disaster funding for Alaska within 2007 Emergency Supplemental spending bill. Senator Murray chairs the subcommittee which makes recommendations about the distribution of these emergency transportation appropriations. After the full Senate passed the supplemental, President Bush signed it into law in late May.
  "Last year, severe weather devastated areas across Alaska. Intense flooding and wind damage took a significant toll on our roads," said Senator Stevens. "I was pleased to work with my good friend and colleague, Senator Murray, to secure these much-needed relief funds. This appropriation will ensure highways and roads throughout Alaska are safe and accessible for travelers."
  Two storms caused extensive damage to transportation infrastructure in Alaska in 2006. Highway damages were reported in or around the Matanuska-Susitna Borough; Cordova; Valdez; the Chugach Rural Education Attendance Area (REAA); Delta/Greely REAA; the Denali Borough; Seward; Seldovia; Glennallen; the McCarthy area, and other areas in the state. 
  The FHWA's emergency relief program helps pay for repairs to roads and bridges damaged by inclement weather or natural forces. A total of $675 million was included in the 2007 supplemental spending bill to help recovery efforts in 23 states and by federal agencies, which manage federal lands including our national parks and forests.
