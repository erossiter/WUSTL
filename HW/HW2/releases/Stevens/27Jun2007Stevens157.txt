SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE APPROVES BILL TO EXPAND INTERNET, DIGITAL ACCESS FOR MINORITY SCHOOLS, COLLEGES
  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation today reported out S. 1650, a bill to help expand access to the Internet and digital technologies for minority-serving educational institutions, including those serving Alaska Natives. The measure, officially titled The Max Cleland Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act, is co-sponsored by Commerce Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and will support investment in wireless technologies and education for students in minority-serving colleges and universities. The legislation will specifically provide grants to Alaska Native-serving colleges and universities. 
  "The Internet and wireless technologies have become critical components of education in the 21st century," said Senator Stevens. "Several colleges and universities in Alaska have the potential to benefit from this bill, which will help students develop the skills necessary to succeed in our increasingly global economy."
  The bill will authorize the creation of an Office of Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology at the Department of Commerce to implement these improvements. The bill will annually authorize $250 million between Fiscal Year 2008 through Fiscal Year 2012. 
  Specifically, the funds made available by the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act will be used to:
   * acquire equipment, networking capability, hardware and software, digital network technology, and wireless technology for schools and colleges; 
   * provide educational services to individuals who seek to acquire or enhance their technology skills, including faculty development and teacher education, library and media specialist training, and preschool and teacher aid certification; and 
   * implement joint projects to provide education regarding technology in the classroom with a state or state education agency, local education agency, community-based organization, national non?profit organization, or business, including minority businesses.
