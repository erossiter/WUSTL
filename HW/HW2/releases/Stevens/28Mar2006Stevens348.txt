SEN. STEVENS CRITICAL OF FAA BUDGET CUTS TO ALASKA PROGRAMS
  Today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) participated in a hearing held by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. During the hearing, Chairman Stevens questioned Marion Blakey, Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), about significant cuts in funding for Alaska-related programs in the FAA's Fiscal Year 2007 (FY07) budget.  
   During the hearing, Stevens emphasized that under the proposed FAA budget, rural Alaska airports are slated to lose $22.9 million of their funding. This funding is vital to airport management. "We have 241 different little villages," said Stevens. "Of them, 159 can be reached only by air. Under this proposal, the funding for those airports is zero? How do we function in Alaska where there are no trains?into those villages?no buses, no taxis, no access except by air? How do we function in Alaska, which is one-fifth the size of the United States, if the bulk of the cuts to the FAA are assessed to Alaska?" 
   The proposed FY07 FAA budget also reduces funding for national navigational capabilities, local weather monitoring and warning systems, and several aviation safety programs in Alaska. Among the safety programs eliminated or reduced in the FY07 budget are: 
   * The Safe Flight 21 Program, a joint government and industry initiative providing upgrades to aviation communications, navigation, and surveillance systems; 
   * The Alaska Airport Improvement Program; 
   * Upgrades to the Loran-C system, a ground-based, long-range navigational aid used by mariners and aviators; 
   * The Alaska Volcano Observatory, which monitors volcanic eruptions in order to minimize their impact on aircraft flying over Alaska; and 
   * The Medallion Foundation Five Star Shield Program, an industry-sponsored initiative that promotes safe flying practices among air carriers in Alaska. 
   Stevens told the subcommittee that these programs have played an essential role in improving aviation safety in Alaska. "When we first started reviewing safety in Alaska, we found that one out of 11 pilots was dying," he said. "We have turned around the death rates and we have turned around the crash rates?. I do understand the overall budget situation, but I don't understand small amounts like this being deleted. The total to keep Alaska safe would be less than about $30 million," said Stevens.
