SENATE COMMEMORATES EFFORTS OF WORLD WAR II VETERANS SERVING IN SENATE
  Today, the United States Senate passed a sense of the Senate resolution honoring the service of the men and women of the United States that served in the Armed Services during the Second World War.  
   The resolution makes special commendation of the six Senate colleagues who are World War II veterans including Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Senator John Warner of Virginia.
   Following the reading of the resolution Senator Stevens paid special tribute to his good friend Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii, one of only eight members of the Senate to have earned the Congressional Medal of Honor. Senator Inouye received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his display of exceptional valor on April 21, 1945. It was in San Torenzo, Italy that then Second Lieutenant Inouye skillfully guarded a road juncture by destroying enemy artillery and small arms fire. It was during this service that Senator Inouye was seriously wounded but continued to lead his platoon until the enemy was broken and his men were in a defensive position. 
   In addition to Senator Stevens' remarks, Senator Lisa Murkowski rose to honor Senator Stevens' service in World War II. Senator Stevens was a 19-year-old man who enlisted in the Army Air Corps in March of 1943. During his three years in the military Stevens flew transport for the Flying Tigers and the 14th Air Force in the China-Burma-India theatre. Today Senator Stevens is the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its Defense Subcommittee.
