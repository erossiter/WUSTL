SEN. STEVENS MOURNS PASSING OF MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today offered the following statement upon learning of the passing of Mstislav Rostropovich, the world-renowned conductor, cellist, and music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. from 1977 to 1994.  
  "Catherine and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the Maestro, Mstislav Rostropovich. He was one of the most celebrated musicians of our time and he leaves with us an unparalleled international legacy. 
  "We will always remember the Maestro and the National Symphony Orchestra's visit to Alaska. While American Residency programs have continued in other states, this tradition began in Alaska in 1992 when we hosted this extraordinary man and the National Symphony. For more than a week, Slava shared his passion for music with people around the State. The Symphony traveled not only to our major cities, but also to small towns and villages where musicians performed and conducted workshops for our residents. It was an honor for us to have participated in this unique experience, which was inspired by the Maestro's desire to make the National Symphony truly national and to share it with people in every state. 
  "Perhaps my fondest memory of Slava came at the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts when he joined Native performers on stage. Slava picked up a seal-skin drum to try his hand at yet another instrument. To no one's surprise, he was a natural. The Maestro is an unforgettable man and he will be missed."
