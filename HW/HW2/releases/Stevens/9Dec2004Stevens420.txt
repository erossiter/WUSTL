SENATE PASSES LEGISLATION TO ENSURE CONTINUED INTERNET, PHONE SERVICE TO RURAL AREAS
  Telecommunications legislation vital to Alaska has passed the Senate and is headed to the President. H.R. 5419, is a combination of three bills - the Enhance 911 Act, the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act, and the Universal Service Anti-Deficiency Temporary Suspension Act. 
  The Universal Service Anti-Deficiency Temporary Suspension Act, cosponsored by Senator Stevens and other rural state Senators, exempts the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), which administers the Universal Service Fund, from the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA). The ADA requires the USAC to keep cash on hand to cover its funding obligations instead of relying on collections to be generated in the future. Rural telephone companies receive a substantial source of income from the USAC, which was threatened to be withheld because of the ADA. This, in turn, could have jeopardized Internet service to schools, libraries, and health care facilities (thereby impacting tele-medicine services) and could have substantially increased the cost of telephone service in rural areas of Alaska and other parts of the country.
  "Exempting the Universal Service Administrative Company from the Anti-Deficiency Act was crucial to retaining Internet access to our schools and libraries and ensuring the continued success of Alaska's tele-medicine program. We have worked to ensure that Alaska is not left off the information highway and failing to enact this exemption would have put us on the exit ramp," said Stevens.
