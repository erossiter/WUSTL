ON RECORD: SEN. STEVENS' STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF MAY 11
  On the importance of Congress reauthorizing the Denali Commission
   "Although the Denali Commission has made tremendous strides to ensure rural Alaska has basic living conditions, there still is work to be done. Many of the rural communities have no roads and their transportation infrastructure is deteriorating. Numerous villages can only be accessed by water, and the docks in the communities are in desperate need of repair. The projects conducted by the Denali Commission not only keep communities connected to mainstream Alaska, projects also foster economic growth." (5/11/07)  
  On global climate change affecting the world's oceans and fisheries 
   "What many don't realize is that the oceans may change as well, and if the predictions are accurate, these changes could have economic consequences. Warm ocean temperatures are causing widespread coral bleaching in the Caribbean. In Alaska, some species are moving north. There is concern on how these changes will affect our fisheries?.We need to make sure the federal agencies have their resources in the right places to study ocean acidification and climate change."

  On the U.S. Postal Service's decision to remove the nonmachinable surcharge from bypass mail packages as new postal rates go into effect on May 14
   "Because of the size of this national increase it was going to be difficult to control the cost of shipping the necessities of life to our people in rural areas?.(Postmaster General John Potter) agreed to work with me to mitigate the costs that might come about by these changes nationally. When we (looked) into this nonmachinable surcharge, I asked if he could have that charge removed from bypass mail that never came in contact with the Post Office?.I find the Post Office has been very willing to work with us over the years on bypass mail."
