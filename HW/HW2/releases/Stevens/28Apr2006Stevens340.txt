SEN. STEVENS: SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIRES DOMESTIC ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
  Senate President Pro Tempore, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), released the following statement upon learning of today's announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce that the American economy has grown at a 4.8% pace in the first quarter of 2006.  
   "For 54 straight months, we have seen real growth in our economy and job creation," said Stevens. "Our nation's economic success depends on our ability to maintain a stable energy supply. To sustain our current economic growth, we need a long-term, comprehensive energy policy that includes domestic production from Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain, which will generate one million barrels of oil a day."
