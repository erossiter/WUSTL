SEN. STEVENS MEETS WITH SECRETARY CHERTOFF ON NEW BORDER RULE
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today met with Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to express his concern about Customs and Border Protection's new border crossing requirements, which begin on January 31, 2008. On Thursday, U.S. citizens crossing land and sea borders will have to present documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, as well as a government-issued photo identification card. 
   During the meeting, Senator Stevens told Secretary Chertoff that the new requirements will impose a great burden on many Alaskans, particularly those who were born in rural areas and do not possess birth certificates. The Secretary acknowledged the unique challenges facing Alaskans and committed to send DHS staff to the State to explore viable alternatives to traditional birth certificates.
   "I am pleased that Secretary Chertoff has recognized that meeting the new border crossing requirements will be impossible for many Alaskans," said Senator Stevens. "I look forward to DHS officials working with our local leaders to determine what documents could be accepted in lieu of birth certificates."
