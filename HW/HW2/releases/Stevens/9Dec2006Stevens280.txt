SEN. STEVENS, REP. YOUNG WORK TOGETHER TO PASS MAGNUSON-STEVENS REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION
  Thanks to the efforts of Alaska Congressional Delegation members Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young, Congress today sent H.R. 5946, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, to the President to be signed into law. The bill passed the House early this morning after clearing the Senate by unanimous consent on Thursday December 7. 
   Since its enactment in 1976, the Act has been reauthorized six times. It was most recently amended in 1996 through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). H.R. 5946 is the culmination of a process that spanned two years and included consultation with members of Congress and concerned groups, constituencies, and organizations.  
   "This legislation is important to sustaining and conserving our nation's fisheries for generations to come," said Commerce Committee Chairman Stevens. "The bill promotes science-based management techniques successfully used in Alaska. It also gives regional councils across the country the flexibility to develop unique fishery management plans and adopt approaches that have worked so well in Alaska." 
   "We've worked long and hard on this bill and countless negotiations were held between many different people and committees," said Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Young. "In the end, I believe we have put together a comprehensive piece of legislation that meets our needs very well. I am pleased that this bill will include peer review provisions so that fishery managers may use the latest science in making their decisions. I am also very happy that it authorizes the Limited Access Privilege Programs including Regional Fishery Associations and allocations for fishing communities. As the newly appointed Ranking Member of the Resources Committee I look forward to continue improving the way we work with our nation's fisheries and natural resources." 
   The fisheries managed by the North Pacific Regional Council have been singled out by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission as an example of proper conservation and management. This bill implements some of the council's "best practices" nationwide. It strengthens the role of science in fishery management plans and decisions by enabling greater collaboration between the councils and their Scientific and Statistical Committees; improving data collection and management; and requiring fishery management plans to set annual catch limits that prevent overfishing. 
   In addition to protecting domestic fisheries, H.R. 5946 also strengthens management in international waters, particularly on the high seas. To help prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing from threatening the good management taking place in U.S. waters, the bill strengthens U.S. leadership in international conservation and management. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish an international compliance and monitoring program and allows the use of measures authorized under the High Seas Driftnet Act to force compliance in cases where regional or international fishery organizations are unable to stop IUU fishing. 
   Other provisions important to Alaska include: 
   Preserves and Strengthens the Regional Fishery Management Councils 
   * Strengthens and clarifies the MSA's conflict of interest and recusal requirements. 
   Establishes National Guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs 
   * Establishes national guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) for the harvesting of fish. The LAPPs include Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs), which are expanded to allow for allocation of harvesting privileges to fishing communities or regional fishery associations. 
   * Does not provide for the establishment of a separate Processor Quota, but processors would be eligible to hold LAPPs to harvest fish, pursuant to current law, and any decision to allocate privileges to processors would be made in the council's normal allocation decision making process. 
   * Provides for an initial five-year administrative review of each program's compliance with the goals of the program and the MSA, and requires at least one review every seven years after that. 
   Improves the Uniformity of Decision Making for Fishery Management Plans and Aligns Them with the NEPA Process 
   * Directs the Secretary, with public participation and in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Regional Fishery Management Councils, to develop one uniform fishery management-specific environmental review process that conforms National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, analysis, and public input schedules to the timelines appropriate for fishery management decisions under MSA. The intent is to establish a consistent, timely, and predictable regulatory process for fishery management decisions.
