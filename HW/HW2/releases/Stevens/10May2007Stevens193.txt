SEN. STEVENS WORKS WITH POSTMASTER GENERAL TO REDUCE BYPASS MAIL COSTS FOR RURAL ALASKANS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today announced that John Potter, the U.S. Postmaster General, has determined that the "nonmachinable" surcharge levied by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will not apply to Alaska's unique bypass mail system. This decision will help mitigate costs for shippers when mail rates increase nationwide on May 14th.  
  The conclusion reached today by the USPS is the result of weeks of meetings and correspondence between Senator Stevens and USPS officials, including the Postmaster General. These discussions began when Senator Stevens pointed out the nonmachinable charge was inappropriate for bypass mail. Because these packages "bypass" the Post Office and go directly to air carriers for shipment, they avoid the Post Office's processing system. Accordingly, the surcharge should not be applied.
  "Although mail rates will still increase, the Postmaster General's decision represents a savings for bypass mail shippers which will ultimately be passed on to Alaskan consumers. Eliminating the nonmachinable surcharge will help Alaska's most isolated communities control the cost of milk, flour, and other basic necessities," said Senator Stevens.
  Most bypass mail parcels weigh between 35 and 70 pounds. Without the nonmachinable surcharge, a typical 50-pound package will increase from $10.95 to $12.39 on May 14th. Had this surcharge been applied, the rate would have jumped to $15.26.
