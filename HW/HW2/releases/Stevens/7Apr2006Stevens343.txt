COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION INCLUDES COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA PROVISIONS
  A House and Senate Conference Committee has approved the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 889, the United States Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2006. The report includes a provision that strengthens and stabilizes the Western Alaska Community Development Quota (CDQ) Program by providing a long-term operating framework.  
   "Alaskans have greatly benefited from this unique program. By enabling our rural communities to create an economic base in commercial fishing, we have been able to combat poverty and unemployment in Western Alaska," said Stevens. "The CDQ program has enabled us to make significant progress, and this provision will ensure its viability for decades to come." 
   Created in 1992, the Western Alaska CDQ Program allows communities to become stakeholders in the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands fisheries. The CDQ program is comprised of six regional corporations, which include 65 villages and more than 25,000 Alaskans. Part of the basis for the program was to provide a percentage of the allocation of Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands fisheries for economic development for Western Alaska's communities. 
   The six CDQ groups reinvest their revenues into local commercial fisheries and Western Alaska's communities. Overall, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested, which has helped combat widespread poverty and unemployment in the region. These efforts have also been responsible for infrastructure expansion, including docks, harbors, and seafood processing facilities. 
   In 2005, an Alaska Blue Ribbon committee reviewed the CDQ program. The committee made a number of recommendations designed to assist the CDQ groups in their efforts to improve the social and economic conditions in Western Alaska. The conference report accompanying H.R. 889 implements the committee's recommendations by: 
   * Giving the CDQ groups greater autonomy by allowing them to invest in fisheries-related and non-fisheries-related economic development activities and programs in their region. 
   * Increasing the stability of the CDQ groups' fishery allocations by maintaining the current allocations until 2012. 
   * Ensuring better oversight of the CDQ groups' business and management practices by establishing a formal business operating framework. Under this framework, boards of directors will be created, annual statements of investments will be required, and compliance with State of Alaska banking and securities requirements will be mandatory.
