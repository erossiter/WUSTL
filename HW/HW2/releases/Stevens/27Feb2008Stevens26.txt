SEN. STEVENS AMENDMENTS WOULD IMPROVE E911 TECHNOLOGY, SAVE LIVES
  The United States Senate last night approved S. 428, the IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act, with two key provisions authored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). The measure would require Internet telephone companies to offer enhanced 911 (E911) services to all subscribers, ensuring those Americans using Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services can dial 911 during an emergency.  
   "Congress has been working on this legislation for several years and I am pleased to see that it has cleared the Senate," said Senator Stevens. "This important legislation will ensure that our 911 laws address the needs of Alaskans using new technologies." 
   The two Stevens' amendments were adopted last year when the Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill. The first provision addresses the issue of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authority. The change will give the FCC the authority to fold 911 requirements into new phone services without requiring Congressional intervention as technology evolves. 
   The second provision authored by Senator Stevens addresses future Internet Protocol- based 911 networks. Fifty percent of American counties and boroughs do not have enhanced 911 capabilities. To ensure that all communities may take advantage of the next generation of 911 services, Senator Stevens altered the bill to require a study to identify mechanisms and timetables for developing future 911 capability. The study of the next generation network would also be required to incorporate altitude information and identify technical solutions to address multi-story buildings where identifying the building address is not enough.
