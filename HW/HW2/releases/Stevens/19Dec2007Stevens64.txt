SEN. STEVENS CHAMPIONS FUNDING FOR TROOPS STATIONED ABROAD
  After months of battling Democratic opposition, Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) successfully secured $70 billion for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world. The amendment passed as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act approved by Congress today. 
   "It is our duty as Senators to support the troops in the field and provide them all of the resources they need to complete the mission they have been assigned," said Senator Stevens. "Unlike us, they don't get to choose which battles to fight. They go where duty calls without hesitation."
   This amendment funds continued military operations for the Global War on Terror, including special pay and subsistence to our troops, fuel, transportation, supplies, and equipment reset and purchase. It provides the resources for critical force protection equipment to include body armor, helmets, armor plating for vehicles, and aircraft survivability equipment. In addition, the $70 billion provides the Department of Defense with the necessary funds to reset military forces returning for overseas tours.
   "We know that General Petraeus' plans have been effective," said Senator Stevens. "To withhold funding now would only invite defeat and represent a step back from what our forces have achieved during the last several months."
   Specifically, this bill would provide:
   * $1.1 billion for military pay and benefits to include support for wounded warriors and death gratuities;
   * $500 million for the Commander's Emergency Response Program;
   * $1.4 billion for body armor and personal protection equipment;
   * $9 billion of depot maintenance funding to reset equipment and maintain force readiness;
   * $2.9 billion to continue efforts to train and equip Iraqi and Afghan security forces, which will allow the elected governments in these countries to effectively provide their own security and our troops to come home;
   * $4.3 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund to help U.S. forces detect and defeat the number one killer of our troops in Iraq;
   * $6.1 billion is included for equipment, ammunition, vehicles, missiles, and aircraft to replace worn out and damaged equipment;
   * $3.7 billion to continue and enhance our wartime intelligence activities;
   * $600 million for the Defense Health Program to provide for the care and recovery of our wounded service members; and
   * $193 million for counter-drug activities to curb the production and smuggling of opium in Afghanistan.
