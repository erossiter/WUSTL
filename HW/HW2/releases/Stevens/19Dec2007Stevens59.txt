CONGRESS APPROVES MILLIONS FOR ALASKA MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AT SENATOR STEVENS' REQUEST
  Congress today approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Appropriations Omnibus Act, which provides more than $340 million for Alaska-based military construction projects. Through the efforts of Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Congress appropriated $23.3 million above the President's budget request for essential projects to support Army, Air Force, and National Guard forces based in Alaska. 
   "The U.S. military will continue to have significant presence in Alaska given our unique strategic position," said Senator Stevens. "Congress must ensure that service members stationed in our State have the housing and training facilities they need and deserve. However, these projects do not just represent a win for troops based in Alaska. Because the vast majority of construction contracts are awarded to local contractors, these military construction projects will create hundreds of jobs for Alaskans and continue to help stimulate our State's economy."
   Congress approved $7.2 billion in support of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure recommendations passed into law.  Of that total, $33.2 million was designated for Kulis Air National Guard Base and Elmendorf AFB, which are realigning based on 2005 BRAC recommendations.
