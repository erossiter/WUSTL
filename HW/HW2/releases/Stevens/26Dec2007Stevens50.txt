SEN. STEVENS SAVES ALASKA EDUCATION PROGRAMS FROM BEING ELIMINATED
  President George Bush today signed H.R. 2764, the Omnibus Appropriations bill, legislation that funds numerous health and education programs important to Alaska secured by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska).
  Educational initiative designed for the Alaska Native community received funding through several federal programs. Among them, the Alaska Native Education Equity program is funded at $33.9 million. All of the funding for this Alaska-specific program was cut by the President's budget earlier this year. However, through Senator Stevens' work with members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, funding was restored, allowing this important program to continue. The legislation signed into law today also allocated funds for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions of higher education ($11.7 million) to further their programs.  
  Alaska heritage centers will receive approximately $3 million of $8.9 million allocated to the Education through Cultural and Historical Organizations (ECHO) program. ECHO was established by Senator Stevens as part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and funds programs in Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Massachusetts. Finally, the Carol M. White Physical Education Program, a nationwide program providing grants to start or improve physical education programs in schools, will receive $75.6 million. Alaska schools will get a portion of PEP funds, an initiative created by Senator Stevens. 
  "The President's request to cut funding for education programs like the ECHO and PEP was simply not acceptable," said Senator Stevens. "If our students are to succeed, we should ensure that we provide schools with all the necessary tools. Initiatives such as the Alaska Native Education Equity program ensure that no Alaskan student is left behind, whether they live in Anchorage or the tiny village of Eek."
