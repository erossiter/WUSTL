SEN. STEVENS WRITES HOUSE, SENATE MEMBERS ABOUT ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
  Today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) sent a letter to every member of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate regarding America's energy crisis and a solution to that crisis - allowing oil production on the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). 
   Recently Senator Stevens received a letter from retired Senator, Judge James Buckley (D - N.Y.b ), formerly an opponent of oil exploration in ANWR. Judge Buckley now supports exploration in ANWR, and Senator Stevens shares that in his letter.
   The letters from Senator Stevens and Judge Buckley are attached.
