SEN. STEVENS CELEBRATES UNVEILING OF IPY STAMPS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today celebrated the unveiling of new United States Postal Service stamps commemorating the International Polar Year (IPY). The "First Day of Issuance Ceremony" was held this morning at the National Postal Museum.  
  One of the two 41-cent stamps features a photograph of the northern lights over the Talkeetna Mountains taken by Fred Hirschmann of Wasilla. In addition, the header image on the 20-stamp pane is a photograph of aurora borealis by LeRoy Zimmerman of Ester, Alaska. Mr. Zimmerman attended today's ceremony in Washington D.C. 
  "Alaskans will play a vital role in International Polar Year activities," said Senator Stevens. "The event's impacts will be far-reaching and will be significant not only to Alaska, but our nation and the world. Now, thanks to these stamps, the photography of Fred Hirschmann and LeRoy Zimmerman will always be part of this important IPY legacy." 
  The second of the two IPY stamps features a photograph of the aurora australis, a phenomenon of the southern polar region. 
  IPY, which is taking place from March 2007 through March 2009, is an intensive and wide-reaching international polar research effort. In 1958, the United States issued a three-cent stamp to commemorate a similar event - International Geophysical Year 1957-58.
