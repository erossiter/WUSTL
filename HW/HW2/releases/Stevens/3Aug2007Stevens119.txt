CONGRESS APPROVES BILL TO ENCOURAGE COMPETITIVENESS
  The United States Congress late yesterday approved legislation (Conference Report on S.761 and H.R. 2272) to increase American investment in basic research and improve the teaching of math, science and engineering. The America Competes Act (S.761) was originally cosponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), along with Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Commerce Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Senator John Ensign (R-Nev.), Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Senator Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), and others.  
  "This bill is an important first step in maintaining our competitive edge in the world," said Senator Stevens. "By increasing our investment in basic research and the teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, America is addressing the serious competitiveness challenges that it faces in today's global economy." 
  The "America COMPETES Act" is a bipartisan legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report and the Council on Competitiveness' "Innovate America" report. The bill is similar to the "National Competitiveness Investment Act" that Senators Frist, Reid, Stevens, Inouye, Ensign, Domenici, Bingaman, Enzi, Kennedy, Lieberman, Alexander, Mikulski, Hutchison, and others introduced in September 2006. 
   The legislation focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintain and improve America's innovation in the 21st Century: 
   (1) Increasing research investment, 
   (2) Strengthening educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school, and 
   (3) Developing an innovation infrastructure.
