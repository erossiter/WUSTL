SEN. STEVENS CHAMPIONS ALASKA PROGRAMS IN SENATE-PASSED FARM BILL
  The United States Senate today passed the Farm Bill (S. 2419) by a vote of 79 to 14. Included in the legislation are several Senator Stevens-sponsored provisions which authorize funding for many important programs to Alaska's agriculture industry, educational system, and Native and rural communities.
  "While Alaska is not traditionally thought of as a major agriculture state, the Farm Bill passed today has significant benefits for our State," said Senator Stevens. "I am pleased that the Senate has recognized the unique challenges our farmers and rural residents face." 
  Alaska won a major victory in the Farm Bill when the Senate adopted Senator Stevens' amendment to extend the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) Farm Operating Loan program to commercial fishermen. Fishermen will be able to access loans for basic operating costs, including boats, and nets. 
  "Many of our commercial fishermen need access to these loan programs," said Senator Stevens. "Fishermen new to the industry have found it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain credit from commercial lenders for startup costs. As for traditional farmers, equipment necessary to begin a fishing business, such as boats and nets, are very expensive."
  Extending eligibility of the FSA program to commercial fishermen would put them on a level playing field with fish farmers, whose product they compete with directly.
  "Commercial fishermen make an important contribution to our food supply and economy. Their products - fish and shellfish - have been defined as agricultural products," said Senator Stevens. "The chief competitors of commercial fishermen are already eligible for financial assistance from the FSA. This legislation will ensure our commercial fishermen have the tools they need to succeed - and it will do so at no extra cost to taxpayers."
  Senator Stevens also joined Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in securing a provision to allow Exxon-Valdez oil spill plaintiffs to average any settlement or judgment-related income they receive in connection with the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill litigation over three years for federal tax purposes and contribute up to $100,000 to personal retirement plans. The amendment would provide tax relief to all of the individual plaintiffs in the oil spill settlement, 80 percent of whom are commercial fisherman.
  "Although the Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred more than 18 years ago, many people in our State are still dealing with personal losses suffered during that disaster," said Senator Stevens. "Alaskans whose livelihoods were adversely impacted by the spill have not been able to plan adequately for retirement. I applaud Senator Murkowski for her leadership and persistence on this issue. This is a big win for Alaskans." 
  Along with Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Senator Stevens championed two amendments to address the unique challenges of being a farmer or rancher in Alaska. One amendment authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide reimbursement payments, up to $15 million, to geographically disadvantaged farmers for costs associated with the transportation of agricultural commodities over a distance of more than 30 miles.
  A second amendment adds the University of Alaska to the Agricultural Development in the American Pacific program. This program provides a mechanism for the Pacific land grant institutions to collaborate on programs related to food and agriculture production and delivery systems. It also authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to the "consortium" of eligible institutions to carry out research, extension, and instruction programs. 
  In addition, there are several more programs related to Alaska contained in the Senate-passed bill:
   * AK Native/Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions: The bill reauthorizes the Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian serving institutions program through 2013. The purpose of this program is to help attract, retain, and graduate Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students to enhance the nation's food and agricultural scientific and professional workforce. 
   * Rural Alaska Village Grant Program: The bill reauthorizes this program through 2013. Under this program, the Secretary of Agriculture may make grants of up to $30 million a year to the State of Alaska for the development and construction of water and wastewater systems to improve heath and sanitation conditions in rural or Native villages. The State is required to provide 25 percent in matching funds. 
   * Denali Commission: The bill authorizes the Denali Commission to receive funds to address deficiencies in solid waste disposal sites in rural Alaska. 
   * Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: This provision will make permanent the exemption for U.S.-based commercial trucks transiting through Canada between Alaska and the Lower 48 from Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Agricultural Quarantine Inspection fees. 
   * Digital Television Transition: This Stevens provision will create a grant program to assist rural America with the digital television transition. Additional education and outreach is needed to ensure that Alaska's remote villages are prepared for this transition and don't lose television service. 
   * Broadband in Rural Alaska: This Stevens initiative clarifies that Alaska can use certain grant funds to deploy broadband service even if a village or community currently has dial-up Internet access. Removal of the dial-up restriction will allow for more of Alaska's communities and villages to get robust broadband service and better access to the Internet. 
   Alaska also stands to benefit from a variety of national programs contained in the bill, including the expansion of nutrition programs, such as the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to promote child health and nutrition, the Food Stamp Program, the Emergency Food Assistance Program. The bill also expands support for agricultural conservation programs, and increased funding to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crop producers.
