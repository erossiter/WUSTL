SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS SECRETARY KEMPTHORNE FOR COMMITTING TO STREAMLINING FIREARM REGULATIONS IN NATIONAL PARKS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today commended Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne's efforts to defend Second Amendment rights. Secretary Kempthorne directed the Department to update federal regulations regarding the possession of firearms on federal lands so that they match existing federal laws and states' laws for firearms on public lands.  
   "I am pleased that Secretary Kempthorne has committed to upholding our Second Amendment rights," said Senator Stevens. "The Department's firearm regulations simply do not take into account how law-abiding Alaskans use public lands. In Alaska, carrying a firearm is a not just a right but can be a necessity." 
   Current federal regulations prohibit individuals from possessing a firearm on lands managed by the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service. However, other federal land management agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, allow firearms to be transported and carried on these lands in accordance with the laws of the host state. 
   In December, Senator Stevens and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) signed onto a letter with 48 other Senators asking that the Department of the Interior provide for the consistent application of state weapons regulation across all lands managed by the Department. The letter stresses the importance of respecting states' sovereignty and the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.
