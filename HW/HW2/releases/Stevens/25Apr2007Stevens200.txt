SENATE PASSES COMPETITIVENESS LEGISLATION
  United States Senate today passed the America COMPETES Act (S. 761), legislation co-sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). This bipartisan legislation addresses several areas critical to enhancing American innovation and competitiveness. It would increase investment in basic research; strengthen educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school; and develop an innovation infrastructure.  
  "For generations, scientists and engineers have secured our place in the global economy. Today, there are serious concerns about America's ability to continue this tradition," said Senator Stevens. "If we are to maintain our competitive edge, we must improve the education our students receive in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We also must equip our teachers with the resources and skills they need."
  S. 761 is a bipartisan legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report and the Council on Competitiveness' "Innovate America" report.
  The America COMPETES Act would: 
   * Almost double funding for the National Science Foundation by 2011; 
   * Double funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science over 10 years; 
  * Authorize increased funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology; 
   * Establish training and education programs for science and math teachers; 
   * Provide grants to improve elementary and middle school math instruction and assist students who are struggling with math; and 
   * Increase the number of students who study critical foreign languages.
