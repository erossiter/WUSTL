SEN. STEVENS COMMENDS ALLEN INSTITUTE FOR COMPLETION OF BRAIN ATLAS
  At an event held on Capitol Hill today, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) congratulated the Allen Institute for Brain Science on the completion of its Allen Brain Atlas. The atlas is a web-based, three-dimensional map of gene expression in the mouse brain.  
   The Allen Brain Atlas, which is available to the public at no cost via the Internet, shows which genes are active within the brain and links them to specific brain functions. Since more than 90 percent of human genes are also found in mice, the atlas is an important step toward greater understanding of human disorders and diseases. This project could also provide new insight into the benefits and potential side effects of specific drug treatments. 
   "This atlas is a tremendous step forward in our efforts to unlock the mysteries of the human brain," said Senator Stevens. "This project brings us much closer to important breakthroughs in human neuroscience. The Allen Brain Atlas provides new hope that we will one day be able to effectively treat and cure brain disorders and diseases like Alzheimer's, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's. The importance of this effort cannot be overstated." 
   Located in Seattle, Washington, the Allen Institute for Brain Science was founded in 2001 by philanthropists Paul G. Allen and Jody Patton. The Institute seeks to identify and address key issues in neuroscience, particularly those that can advance the understanding of human behavior. The Allen Brain Atlas is available online at www.brain-map.org.
