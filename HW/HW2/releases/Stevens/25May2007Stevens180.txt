NOAA RECOGNIZES SENATOR STEVENS' SUPPORT FOR EXPANSION OF ALASKA'S BUOY NETWORK
  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Alaska Region office has recognized Senator Ted Stevens' (R-Alaska) support for additional buoys to bolster the Alaska Data Buoy Network. Laura Furgione, head of NWS in Alaska, presented Senator Stevens with a special Director's Award yesterday in his Washington, D.C. office.  
  "We appreciate your continuing efforts to help us keep mariners safe and global economic activity moving through Alaskan waters," Furgione said. "This project was only possible through your continued support of quality marine weather data and forecasts."
   In 2001, Senator Stevens initiated a six-year project to expand the Alaska weather buoy network. The deployment of a new buoy in the central Gulf of Alaska on May 4, 2007 marked the completion of this project, which increased the number of buoys in Alaska from five to 19. Two Coastal Marine Automated Network stations have also been deployed in Alaska's treacherous maritime waters. 
  "Weather buoys provide not only marine forecasts and warnings, but they also play a significant role in science and research programs," said Senator Stevens. "The expansion of the Alaska Data Buoy Network will help ensure mariners and the United States Coast Guard have the critical information they need to safely navigate our State's waters. I am proud to have supported this project and am honored by the National Weather Service's recognition."
  According to the National Weather Service, the expansion of the Alaska Data Buoy Network has improved wind speed and wave height verification by 25 percent and 32 percent, respectively.  This improvement is the largest since the beginning of electronic verification in the mid-1990s.
