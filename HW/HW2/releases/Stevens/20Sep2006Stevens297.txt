ALASKA SCHOOLS TO RETAIN E-RATE FUNDING
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) applauded a recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision to ensure school districts that were unable to file their applications on time do not lose their E-rate funding. The Federal Communications Commission's order, which was released last week, directs the Universal Service Administrative Company to make exceptions for school districts whose applications were late due to ministerial or clerical errors.  
   The FCC's decision affects 128 school districts nationwide, including five in Alaska. The Alaska school districts that will retain their funding under this order are the Alaska Gateway School District in Tok, the Northwest Arctic Borough School District in Kotzebue, the Southwest Region School District in Dillingham, the Tanana City School District in Tanana, and the Yukon Flats School District in Fort Yukon. 
   "Internet access is essential for our schools in Alaska, where we rely on tele-education to help educate our young people," said Senator Stevens. "This FCC decision ensures our schools will have the funding they need to maintain these vital services." 
   The term "E-rate" is commonly used to refer to the discount that educational institutions receive from the Universal Service Fund's Schools and Libraries Program, which is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company under the direction of the FCC. The E-rate discount enables schools, libraries, and health facilities to obtain affordable telecommunications and Internet access.
