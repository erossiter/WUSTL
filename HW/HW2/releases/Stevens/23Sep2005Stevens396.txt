SEN. TED STEVENS COMMENDS PETER PAN SEAFOODS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), commended Peter Pan Seafoods of Seattle for their generous donation of 38,000 pounds or 1,600 cases of canned wild Alaska salmon to the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.  
   "Peter Pan Seafoods has done a great thing in supporting the people of the Gulf Coast. Upon learning of a canned food drive in the Senate, they took it upon themselves to meet a need. This unselfish gift is one of many that the Alaska seafood industry have been contributing to the recovery effort," said Stevens. "All help, great and small is accepted as this disaster is one that has touched us all." 
   Peter Pan Seafoods became involved with the Hurricane Katrina relief effort after learning of the canned-food drive being organized by Senate Chaplain Barry Black from the Pacific Seafood Processors Association. Upon learning that the distribution center in Jackson, Miss. had specifically asked for canned salmon, Peter Pan's chief executive officer Barry Collier made every effort to donate as much wild Alaska salmon as possible.
