SENATE PASSES TRANSPORTATION AND HUD SPENDING BILL
  The U.S. Senate this morning approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 3074), which provides over $100 million in funding for Alaska projects.  
  Through the efforts of Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), the Senate appropriated a total of $110 million to the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, which benefits 39 communities located in Alaska. The President's budget requested $60 million for the EAS program. 
  H.R. 3074, as passed by the Senate, also includes $36.6 million for aviation projects in Alaska, ranging from the Medallion Program to rural runway safety. The Denali Commission would receive $15 million for road and waterway access projects. 
  "Nearly 50 years after statehood, many parts of Alaska remain underdeveloped and a substantial number of our communities still lack basic infrastructure. This measure will help bridge that gap, keep Alaskans safe, and boost infrastructure development across the state," said Senator Stevens. "Because 70 percent of Alaska's communities can be reached year-round only by air, the funding for aviation projects, in particular, is an absolute necessity."
  Specific funding levels for aviation projects in Alaska include: 
  * $17 million for Safe Flight 21, which funds the Capstone program and the Alaska Weather Camera program; 
   * $5.1 million for flight service station modernization, which provides new infrastructure design to increase safety margins of Alaskan air service; 
   * $2 million for the Alaskan National Airspace System Interfacility Communications System; 
   * $3 million to the State of Alaska for rural runway lighting; 
   * $3 million to the University of Alaska for the Alaska Volcano Observatory; 
   * $3 million for the Medallion Program; and 
   * $3.5 million for the construction of the Akutan Airport. 
  H.R. 3074 also includes an amendment by Senator Stevens which would allow commercial airline pilots to fly until age 65. Currently, pilots must retire at age 60; Senator Stevens' amendment will make U.S. regulations consistent with international standards. 
  Additional Alaska projects funded by this bill include: 
  * $500,000 to the Alaska Mobility Coalition for statewide bus and bus facility enhancements; 
   * $15 million for Alaska and Hawaii ferry projects; 
   * $3 million for Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions and Alaska Native-Serving Institutions; 
   * $1 million to the city of Anchorage for Mountain View revitalization. 
  These funds would be used to restore buildings, which will enhance the retail, commercial, and residential space along Mountain View Drive; and 
   * $750,000 for the Cape Nome quarry upgrade. 
  Lastly, the bill includes a provision championed by Senator Stevens that allows the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC), Alaska's only public housing authority, to become eligible for the Moving to Work program, which allows housing authorities more flexibility in use of their public housing funds. Participation in the program will allow AHFC to continue to provide public housing services in remote rural parts of the State.
