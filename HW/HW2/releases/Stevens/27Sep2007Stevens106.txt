COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. STEVENS' LEGISLATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN ONLINE
  The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee today approved the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act (S. 1965) sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). This legislation would bring parents, industry, law enforcement, and educators together to address comprehensive online protections. S. 1965 is co-sponsored by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Commerce Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), and a bipartisan group of 10 other Senators.  
  "As Internet access continues to expand, especially in rural Alaska, Congress should ensure a safe online learning environment for our children," said Senator Stevens. "This bill succeeds by employing an education-based approach and by striking a delicate balance - it empowers parents, local school boards, and communities to protect children while safeguarding First Amendment rights."
  The legislation would specifically:
  * Require schools receiving E-Rate funds to offer age appropriate education regarding online behavior, including social networking, chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response; 
   * Create an interagency working group to identify and encourage technologies and initiatives to help parents protect their children from unwanted content; 
   * Require a public awareness campaign, and authorize $5 million for fiscal year 2008 and 2009 for this program; and 
   * Enhance child pornography enforcement. 
  The Progress and Freedom Foundation today released a report on the bill, calling it a "sensible, education-based legislative approach" to online child safety. 
  The bill will now head to the full Senate for its consideration.
