SENS. STEVENS, MURKOWSKI INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ENCOURAGE ENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHT BULBS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has introduced the "Bright Idea Act of 2007" (S. 1526) and a companion bill (S. 1527) to provide tax incentives to encourage the manufacture of energy efficient light bulbs. The bills are cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).  
  The "Bright Idea Act of 2007" would establish efficiency targets for light bulbs that would cut energy consumption by at least half within six years and triple the efficiency of incandescent bulbs by 2018. The companion tax incentive legislation would ensure that America takes full advantage of lighting innovation through the creation of additional domestic employment opportunities.
  "Light bulb manufacturers have worked hard to develop technologies capable of reducing the electricity use associated with conventional incandescent bulbs," said Senator Stevens. "These technological and domestic manufacturing capabilities can save consumers billions of dollars each year in energy costs, and these bulbs are available today. Our bills will ensure we take advantage of new technologies to save energy, save consumers money on their electricity bills, and promote American ingenuity."
   "There are many ways Congress can help to promote energy efficient lifestyles - ways that can also help Americans save money in both the short and long term," said Senator Murkowski. "By establishing efficiency targets and promoting simple steps to help reduce energy consumption through the use of energy efficient light bulbs, this legislation is truly an innovative step forward." 
  The two companion bills would:
   * Double the efficiency of conventional light bulbs by 2013; 
   * Triple the efficiency of conventional light bulbs by 2018; 
   * Authorize a research and development program for lighting technologies; 
   * Establish a consumer lighting technology education program; 
   * Require reports for mercury disposal (from bulbs) and labeling; and 
   * Provide a 20 percent tax credit for the construction or renovation of domestic facilities used to manufacture new lighting technologies.
