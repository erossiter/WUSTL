SEN. STEVENS MEETS WITH ALASKA VETERANS GROUPS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today held a "listening session" with Alaskan representatives from a variety of veterans' service organizations. This meeting served as an open forum where local groups could express concerns and share recommendations on veterans' issues, including health care and other benefits. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Alaska has the highest number of veterans per capita in the nation.  
  "The Department of Veterans Affairs faces considerable challenges on both a national level and in Alaska," said Senator Stevens. "To ensure our veterans receive the best services, we depend on input from these organizations. Today I received valuable feedback on ways Congress can better address the unique needs of veterans in our state. I look forward to sharing their concerns with my Senate colleagues when I return to Washington, D.C. next month." 
  Congress has increased VA funding from nearly $48 billion in Fiscal Year 2001 to approximately $79.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2007. The full Senate will consider the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill upon returning from the August recess.
