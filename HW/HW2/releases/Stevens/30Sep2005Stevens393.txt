SEN. STEVENS TAKES ACTION TO SAVE COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANTS
  Today Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee took action to ensure that Community Service Block Grants would be funded at the Fiscal Year 2005 (FY05) level through November 18, 2005 by offering an amendment to the FY06 Defense Appropriations bill.  
   Senator Stevens' amendment, which was passed by unanimous consent, funds the Community Services Block Grant program at $636.8 million, the same at the FY05 level. This funding level is particularly important to Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming. 
   The Community Services Block Grants, funded through the Department of Health and Human Services, provides funds to states, territories and Indian tribes for activities and services designed to reduce poverty. Funds are used for employment services, education, housing assistance and other activities designed to address the needs of low-income individuals. 
   "This will assure that once the Defense bill becomes law the Community Service Block Grants will be funded," stated Stevens. "The sooner we get this bill to the President, the better off this program will be. This is an assurance that the Senate stands behind the total figure that funds the grants and provides necessary funds to our low-income families.".
