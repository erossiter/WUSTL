SEN. STEVENS DISCUSSES FUNDING FOR VOLCANO MONITORING, VETERAN SUPPORT
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii) visited Homer and Kodiak yesterday and today.  
  In Homer, the Senators toured the New Homer City Library and the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge Islands and Oceans Visitors Center. Stevens and Inouye also met with Homer's Mayor, City Manager, and several city council members. In Homer, Stevens discussed many issues facing Alaskans, including federal support of volcano monitoring and eruption forecasts. 
  "Alaskans face unique environmental challenges," said Senator Stevens. "Very few communities in the Lower 48 are affected by volcanic eruptions. Funding for the Alaska Volcano Observatory and similar institutions is critical to the safety of Alaskans and international air travelers. While some have called funding for the AVO unnecessary, Alaskans know that accurate and reliable volcano monitoring saves lives."
  Since 1988, Senator Stevens has consistently boosted funding levels through the appropriations process for volcano research and ash plume forecasting in the budgets for the United States Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Federal Aviation Administration. 
  Today, the Senators met with Coast Guard personnel at USCGS Kodiak and toured the station's facilities. Afterward, the Senators departed for the City of Kodiak, where they met with community officials, Native leaders, and veterans. At the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Kodiak, Senator Stevens discussed the importance of honoring service members, especially those who are wounded in combat. 
  "Kodiak has shown its true colors through its support of the Wounded Warriors project," said Senator Stevens. "This community's commitment to the military continues to set an example for how the rest of the nation should honor our service members."
