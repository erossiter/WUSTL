SEN. STEVENS SPEAKS WITH JAPANESE PM ABOUT WHALING ISSUES
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today released the following statement after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato:  
  "Today I had the opportunity to join a bipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan. We discussed several important issues, including international whaling quotas. During my conversation with the Prime Minister, he gave me his word that Japan would not try to tie its commercial whaling interests to the Eskimo cultural harvest of whales. While negotiations are still ongoing, I believe today's conversation shows that Japanese officials understand and respect the unique subsistence needs of Alaska's Native peoples."
