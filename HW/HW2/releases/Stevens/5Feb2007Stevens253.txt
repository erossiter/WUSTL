SENS. STEVENS, MURKOWSKI MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ALASKA ESKIMO WHALING COMMISSION
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) met with members of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC) today to discuss efforts to protect the AEWC's bowhead subsistence whaling quota. The bowhead whale quota will be up for renewal at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which will be held from May 4th through May 31st, 2007 in Anchorage, Alaska.  
   "The Alaska Eskimo subsistence bowhead whale hunt is central to their cultural and nutritional needs, and one of my top priorities is to ensure their subsistence hunting rights are protected," said Senator Stevens. "I look forward to working with the White House and representatives of IWC member nations to ensure this important activity is preserved for years to come." 
   "Subsistence whaling defines our Eskimo people in Alaska," said Senator Murkowski. "I will work with Senator Stevens and Congressman Young to make certain that we protect this unique and rich culture." 
   Alaska Natives in coastal villages in northern Alaska have hunted the bowhead whale for thousands of years. The AEWC works cooperatively with the IWC and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to manage subsistence whaling in Alaska. The Commission is composed of members from 10 subsistence whaling communities, four of which were represented at today's meeting in Washington. AEWC members will also participate in the United States' delegation to the IWC at this year's meeting in Anchorage. A three-fourths vote of member nations at the IWC meeting is needed to reauthorize the western Arctic bowhead quota for another five-year period.
