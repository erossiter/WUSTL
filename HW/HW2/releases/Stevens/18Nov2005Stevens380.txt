GRANTS AWARDED TO ALASKA PROGRAMS
  Today, the Alaska Congressional Delegation announced that federal agencies have awarded a series of funding grants to Alaska groups and communities. The grants total more than $10.2 million.  
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has awarded $35,000 to KAKM in Anchorage. This grant will support KAKM's Emergent Literacy Initiative, which aims to improve literacy among children in Southcentral Alaska. The initiative targets Alaska Native children, rural Alaskans, and children learning English who are at risk for school failure. KAKM has partnered with ImPACT Family Literacy, Kids' Corp Head Start, and rural libraries to provide "Ready to Learn" television programming. 
   CPB has also awarded $35,000 to KTOO in Juneau. The grant will support "A Book a Day - Parents & Teachers for Literacy," which will promote literacy in Southeast Alaska through family nights, a pilot television broadcast, and workshops. KTOO will continue to produce and distribute children's books and support materials for families throughout the region. 
   As part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, the Department of Homeland Security has awarded grants to three Alaska communities. These grants support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The following Alaska communities received grants: 
   * $22,325 to the Cordova Volunteer Fire Department for operations and safety. 
   * $47,785 to the City of Whittier Volunteer Fire Department for operations and safety. 
   * $50,906 to the Seldovia Village Tribe for firefighter recruitment.

   Through the National Institutes of Health, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has awarded $2 million to the Norton Sound Health Corporation in Nome. This grant will support the Norton Sound Health Corporation's Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives (GOCDAN) Study. GOCDAN was originally funded in 2000 through a grant to the MedStar Research Institute in Washington, D.C. The study assesses the genetic and environmental factors contributing to cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in Native Alaskans. During the first five years of the study, Norton Sound Health Corporation partnered with MedStar and conducted surveys and health examinations of more than 1,200 Alaska Native participants. Due to Norton Sound's outstanding performance during the initial phase of the study, Norton Sound and its collaborators were approved for five additional years of funding through three linked grants.
