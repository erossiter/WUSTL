SEN. STEVENS SUPPORTS FUNDING FOR ENERGY RESEARCH
  Senator Stevens continued his commitment to exploring America's energy potential by supporting research and development measures contained in the Omnibus Appropriations bill, which President George W. Bush signed into law today. 
   This bill includes $19.8 million for natural gas technology research and development, of which approximately $15 million is provided for methane gas hydrates research and development and about $5 million is for effective environmental production programs. Congress allocated another $6.89 million to the Arctic Energy Office at the University of Alaska. These funds will be used to conduct advanced research on fossil fuel energy, as well as natural gas and oil technologies.
   "Our nation, and Alaska in particular, holds vast potential for domestic energy development," said Senator Stevens. "Having the capability to tap this potential is one of the great challenges for our State. We clearly can play a tremendous role in helping the United States achieve energy independence by learning more about our oil and gas resources."
   The bill also provides $2.28 million for the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Alaska Gas Pipeline. This office was created by Congress to coordinate and streamline activities by federal agencies with respect to an Alaska natural gas pipeline project, including handling permitting and design issues.
