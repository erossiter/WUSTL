SEN. STEVENS REFLECTS ON ALASKA DAY
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today delivered the following Senate floor statement on the 140th Alaska Day:  
   "Today Alaskans celebrate Alaska Day - the day 140 years ago when our territory was officially transferred from Russia to the United States. That was the beginning of a long road towards the American Dream for our state and its residents. 
  "What was once called 'Seward's Folly' has become one of our nation's great assets. Alaska has more than made good on Seward's initial investment of $7.2 million. The federal government has collected enough revenue from the development of our resources to repay that investment hundreds and hundreds of times over. 
  "Over the years, Alaskans have worked to realize our land's vast potential. And, while much remains to be done, we have a great deal to celebrate.
  "We are working towards creating a climate for investment, attracting capital to develop and market our valuable natural resources. And, as our state grows, we are working to ensure that all Alaskans enjoy the benefits of a strong and vibrant economy.
  "Through programs such as the Denali Commission, we are building modern water and sewer facilities, health care centers and providing education and job opportunities to Alaskans in the furthest corners of our state.
  "Though many challenges lay ahead, we can look on our accomplishments and know that together we can continue to make progress on the road to the American Dream. And I ask the Senate to help us continue to pursue that dream."
