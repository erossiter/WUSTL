SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES BILL TO EXPAND NUMBER PORTABILITY RULES
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) have introduced legislation to expand number portability rules. This legislation, the Same Number Act of 2007 (S. 1769), would assist consumers who seek to keep the same phone number when switching between wireless carriers. S.1769 proposes to expedite the number portability process and ensure that it covers all voice services in order to help consumers take advantage of the competitive choices available in the communications marketplace.  
  "Technological advances and innovations generate constant change in the communications marketplace, and Congress must ensure consumers are not hampered by delays or protracted procedures which arise when they change services," said Senator Stevens. "This legislation would require the FCC to revisit its number portability rules and extend them to all applicable voice communications services, not just telecom services. As a result, consumers will be able to take full advantage of new choices and cheaper prices as they become available."
  As competition between different voice service providers increases, more consumers are expected to switch companies. Many consumers prefer to take (or port) their current number when switching to a new provider, but if this process is burdensome or slow, it may deter consumers from changing services.
  The Same Number Act of 2007 would specifically:
   * Direct the FCC to establish porting timelines for different classes of number portability [there are some technical differences depending on the type of provider (wireline vs. wireless) and how many services (voice, data, and video) are being ported]; 
   * Establish data exchange requirements for each class of number portability; and 
   * Require annual reports for the first five years from providers so that any needed changes or adjustments can be made.
