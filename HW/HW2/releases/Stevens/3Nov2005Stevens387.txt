SENATE PASSES DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
  Today Alaska Sens. Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski voted to approve the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005. The bill was approved by a vote of 52 to 47.  
   The Deficit Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 is the first significant budget reduction package produced by the Senate since 1997. This legislation includes revenue relating to oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Coastal Plain, which is expected to generate $2.5 billion over the next five years. 
   "By passing this bill, the Senate has moved one step closer to honoring the promise Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson and Senator Paul Tsongas made to me, Alaska, and our country in 1980. The Arctic Coastal Plain is our country's single greatest prospect for future oil production," said Stevens. "Americans know that the development of our domestic resources reduces our dependence on unstable and unfriendly regimes, and grows our economy. Today's vote was another step forward for our country's energy, economic, and national security." 
   "This is a great milestone for Alaska and for the country," Murkowski said. "We are coming ever closer to reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil. Responsible resource development in a small portion of ANWR is directly in line with our country's priorities. I'm proud Alaska may soon be providing more energy for the country while increasing our nation's economic, energy, and environmental security." 
   The Deficit Reconciliation Act of 2005 will now be conferenced with the House budget reconciliation bill. The House and Senate Conference Committee will issue a report of the legislation that must be approved by both bodies. Upon approval by both the House and Senate, the bill will be sent to the President for his consideration.
