CONGRESS PASSES 2008 DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
  The U.S. Congress late last night approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Act Conference Report (H.R. 3222), which provides nearly $183 million in funding for Alaska military projects secured by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). The bill also includes funding for a 3.5-percent, across-the-board pay raise for all military personnel. The bill now goes to the President to be signed into law. 
  "Congress has no greater responsibility than supporting our men and women in uniform," said Senator Stevens. "Their sacrifices are many, and they truly are the new 'Greatest Generation.' The Senate's overwhelming support for this measure demonstrates our commitment to those who risk their lives for our country each day." 
  "Congress must now act swiftly to pass a 'bridge fund' for the Department of Defense. Without approval of this funding, we hinder our current military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world. We owe it to our brave soldiers to ensure that they have the necessary supplies and equipment to defend our nation," said Senator Stevens. 
  A significant portion of the funding in H.R. 3222 directed to Alaska focuses on enhancing joint training capabilities, communications, and range infrastructure. For example, Senator Stevens secured approximately $42.6 million for Red Flag Pacific Alaskan Range Complex (PARC) upgrades. Red Flag Alaska provides training for home units in Alaska, visiting U.S. units, and international allies.
  Specifically, this $42.6 million will improve communications equipment, training range infrastructure, and security and target systems, enhancing training capabilities for military personnel. It will also be used to procure advanced training devices and simulated air defense systems in providing state-of-the-art training environment for members of the U.S. Air Force and coalition partners.
  "We continue to invest in upgrading our bases and training ranges to ensure that they provide realistic joint training opportunities," said Senator Stevens. "The centerpiece is the Pacific Alaskan Range Complex, which offers tremendous joint and combined training experiences. This bill makes significant investments in enhancing the range's capabilities, assuring that it remains the best training area in the world. It is essential that we improve the operational readiness and deployability of our Alaskan forces, while ensuring that they are positioned to deal with potential threats to our national security." 
  In addition, H.R. 3222 provides $44.2 million to the Joint Tanana Training Complex, which will improve training opportunities and facilities for Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and the Aviation Task Force. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and some international military units will utilize this complex for a variety of military readiness and training exercises. 
  Senator Stevens also secured $6.3 million for the Alaska Land Mobile Radio (ALMR), a system that will help correct shortfalls in communications interoperability between federal, state, and municipal agencies during emergencies. 
  Other highlights for Alaska in the bill include:
  INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
   * $11 million for improvement to the Port of Anchorage to enhance deployment capabilities of the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and Aviation Task Force 49. 
   * $7.4 million to improve Alaska's communications systems with the North American Aerospace Defense Command. These funds will eliminate satellite communications chokepoints and improve the diversity and survivability of communications needed to execute homeland defense. 
   * $9 million to Eielson Utilidors to continue repairs of aging critical infrastructure, such as electrical and sewer lines and water pipes that must be stored in underground tunnels due to the harsh Arctic climate. 
   * $11 million to 1/25th SIB Range Improvement. Funding will facilitate interoperability on Alaskan ranges between the Army, Air Force, and Navy. This incorporates overall joint capabilities into real-time battlefields training exercises. 
  EQUIPMENT UPGRADES
   * $9 million to the provide information technology equipment and furnishing for the Alaskan Command headquarters facility. 
   * $500,000 for Alaska Civil Air Patrol Survival equipment. Funding will provide cold water immersion survival suits, locator beacons, and light-weight compact survival rafts to enhance the survivability of volunteer Civil Air Patrol crew and pilots who conduct rescue mission in extreme Arctic environments. 
  CRITICAL DEFENSE RESEARCH 
   * $1.6 million for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This funding will develop unique operational concepts for unmanned aerial systems to meet the demands for both military and civilian applicants. 
   * $3.2 million to continue the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP), which examines the properties and behaviors of the ionosphere. Research will enhance military and civilian communications and surveillance systems. 
   * $4 million to Arctic Regional Supercomputer located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. This funding will enhance research into high-performance computational science and machine/human interactions. 
   * $1.6 million to the University of Alaska for purchasing automotive research equipment. Funding will assist the Army by providing equipment needed to measure the performance, energy consumption, and safety of military vehicles. 
   * $1.6 million to hibernation genomics projects at the University of Alaska. These studies will help develop new models for preventing and treating trauma from injury and ischemia for battlefield conditions. 
   * $20 million to the Expeditionary Craft to support an Office of Naval Research effort to construct a vehicle to demonstrate advanced transport technologies. 
  $1.6 million for the University of Alaska to study technologies for real-time identification of airborne threats in the form of chemical, radiological and biological compounds. 
  OTHER
   * $2.5 million to Alaska Counter Drug Program, which supports the drug demand reduction program with the Alaska National Guard. 
   * $3 million to provide additional healthcare professionals and administration personnel in support of returning service members of the 4th Brigade, 25th Infantry Division and their families.
