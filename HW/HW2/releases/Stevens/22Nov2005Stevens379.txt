ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, VERIZON WIRELESS PARTNER FOR BETTER COMMUNICATIONS IN ALASKA
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) is pleased to learn that Alaska Communications Systems (ACS) and Verizon Wireless have partnered to provide data roaming services in Alaska and the Lower 48.  
   Through this partnership Verizon Wireless devices such as the Blackberry or the Treo will now work in ACS service areas in Alaska, and similar ACS wireless devices will now work in Verizon Wireless service areas in the Lower 48. 
   The data roaming services provided by the ACS-Verizon partnership are in their initial test phase. This test phase is expected to proceed through year-end with full commercial launch early in 2006. 
   "I am pleased that ACS and Verizon Wireless have partnered to provide data roaming in Alaska," said Stevens. "This will ensure that Alaskans and their visitors will be able to travel and still communicate as if they never left home. Data roaming is particularly important as Alaska's infrastructure and economy continue to develop. We will now be able to have a seamless communications system between Alaska and the Lower 48."
