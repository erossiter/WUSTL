OCEAN POLICY REPORT CARD PRAISES FISHERIES CONSERVATION EFFORTS LED BY SENS. STEVENS AND INOUYE
  The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative on Tuesday, Jan. 30, released its Ocean Policy Report Card, which praised legislative efforts to conserve the nation's fisheries. Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) led these efforts in the 109th Congress.  
   Specifically, the Commission commended Congress' work to end overfishing; enhance the role of science in fishery management; provide tools to eliminate illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing on the high seas; and improve efforts to address the growing problem of marine debris. 
   "The marine resources in Alaska and throughout our nation represent a critical component of our economy," said Senator Stevens. "While we have made great strides in protecting America's fisheries, the Commission's report makes it clear that the federal government has more to do, including the elimination of illegal fishing practices in international waters." 
   Several measures sponsored by Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye were approved by the 109th Congress and signed into law by the President. These bills include: 
   * The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 5946), which strengthens the role of science in Council decision-making and requires an end to overfishing. This measure also contains provisions to help improve international fishery management and conservation compliance, with an emphasis on strengthening controls on IUU fishing. The Act ensures other nations provide comparable protections to populations of living marine resources at risk from high seas fishing activities. 
   * The Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act (S. 362), which establishes a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and enhances the U.S. Coast Guard's enforcement of laws designed to prevent ship-based pollution. This law also urges relevant federal agencies to collaborate with foreign governments to reduce marine debris. 
   * The Tsunami Warning and Education Act (H.R. 1674), which expands and strengthens the nation's tsunami detection and warning system. It also provides needed structure, authorities, and funding for the program, which would be operated and maintained by NOAA. 
   In the 110th Congress, Senator Stevens has introduced S. 39, the Ocean and Coastal Exploration and NOAA Act, which would establish a coordinated national ocean exploration program in the NOAA. This measure would also require NOAA to convene an ocean technology and infrastructure task force to study immediate threats to the oceans and coastal communities. 
   The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and Pew Oceans Commission. The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative's goal is to construct meaningful ocean policy. The Initiative is made up of a 10-member task force, five from each Commission, and led by U.S. Ocean Commission Chairman Admiral James D. Watkins and Pew Commission Chairman Leon E. Panetta.
