SEN. STEVENS SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO DESIGNATE SEPTEMBER NATIONAL YOUTH COURT MONTH
  The United States Senate has passed a resolution sponsored by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) that designates September 2006 as National Youth Court Month. The legislation (S. Res. 583), which was co-sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), is designed to raise awareness about youth court participation.  
   "When I was a boy, there was a strong volunteer spirit in our country," said Senator Stevens. "Programs like national youth court instill this volunteer spirit in the next generation and help our young people develop valuable life skills. By designating this month National Youth Court Month, the Senate has highlighted the importance of youth volunteer service." 
   More than 1,100 youth courts in 49 states, including Alaska, provide restorative justice for juvenile offenders. These efforts help prevent crime, enhance public safety, and educate participants. In 2005, more than 111,000 young people volunteered to hear more than 115,000 juvenile cases, and 20,000 adults volunteered to facilitate peer justice in youth courts.
