SEN. STEVENS REMARKS ON PASSING OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), made the following statement upon learning of the passing of President Ronald Reagan: 
   History will recognize Ronald Reagan as one of our great Presidents, alongside Washington, Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. He led our nation out of turbulent times and gave America something to hope for once again. His leadership restored both pride and unequaled capability in our military. His wisdom and belief in the triumph of good over evil led to the fall on Communism - the world will long remember President Reagan's speech at the Brandenburg Gate demanding that "Mr. Gorbechev tear down this Wall!"
   Serving in the Senate as Republican Whip while Ronald Reagan was President was a great experience. President Reagan was always optimistic and had a great sense of humor. Every time we went to the White House to meet with him he had another funny story.
   Ronald and Nancy Reagan conducted the affairs of our nation's White House with dignity and honor. And the way they handled his personal medical problems after he left Washington is testament to their love and devotion to one another. Catherine and I send our condolences to Nancy and the Reagan family.
