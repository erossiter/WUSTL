SEN. STEVENS SUPPORTS CHILD PROTECTION AND SAFETY ACT
  During an enrollment ceremony held today, U.S. Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) joined Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert in signing the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 4472).  
   Senator Stevens voted in favor of H.R. 4472, which passed the Senate last week by voice vote. In the absence of the Vice President, one of Senator Stevens' duties as President Pro Tempore is to sign legislation passed by the Senate before it is sent to the President for his signature. 
   "As a father of six children and a grandfather of 11, I am proud to support this bill," said Senator Stevens. "By passing this legislation, Congress has made it easier for parents and our public safety community to know where sex offenders live and work. This legislation also sends a clear message to sexual predators who seek to prey on children: the punishment will fit the crime. The passage of this bill is a victory for America's families." 
   H.R. 4472 creates the National Sex Offender Registry, which will enable child protective service officials in all 50 states to share critical information and more effectively investigate child abuse cases. The bill establishes uniform standards for the registration of sex offenders and requires lifetime registration for the most serious offenders. Under the act signed today, sex offenders who fail to register for this Internet database could face a felony charge punishable by 10 years in prison. 
   H.R. 4472 also strengthens penalties for the most serious crimes against children and requires mandatory minimum penalties for repeat offenders. 
   The bill will now be sent to President Bush for his signature.
