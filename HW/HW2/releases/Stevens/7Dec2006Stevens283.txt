CONGRESS PASSES NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD REAUTHORIZATION ACT
The Congress today passed legislation to reauthorize the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency responsible for investigating civil aviation and other major transportation accidents.  
 The National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act of 2006 improves congressional oversight over NTSB to ensure that the highest standards of transportation safety are implemented. The bill authorizes the appropriation of $81,594,000 for Fiscal Year 2007 and $92,625,000 for Fiscal Year 2008 to NTSB activities. 
 The National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act also includes a provision specific to Alaska. The bill provides a low-cost solution for improving the runway safety area at the Juneau International Airport. 
 "Alaska depends on aviation more than any other state in our nation. Safety is our number one priority," said Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over NTSB. "It was not long ago that one out every 11 pilots in Alaska was killed in an aviation-related accident. NTSB has played a critical role in reversing that deadly trend." 
 The bill will now be sent to the President for his consideration.
