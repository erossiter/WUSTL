SENS. STEVENS, MURKOWSKI INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO TRANSFER LAND TO CITY OF COFFMAN COVE
  Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens yesterday introduced legislation to convey 12 acres of surplus Forest Service land to the city of Coffman Cove, Alaska. The parcel is near the new Inter-Island Ferry Terminal and the city hopes to use the land to help spur economic development. Similar legislation passed the Senate last year, but Congress adjourned before the House could act.  
   "Economic development is critical in rural communities throughout Alaska," said Senator Murkowski. "This land transfer would help provide new jobs and opportunities to the residents of Coffman Cove." 
   "Passage of this bill would provide the City of Coffman Cove with a variety of economic development opportunities," said Senator Stevens. "Given its unique location, this land will be put to good use and will benefit the City and ferry users passing through its inter-island terminal." 
   Coffman Cove is a community of approximately 200 residents located on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. The land to be transferred was previously used by the United States Forest Service as an administrative.
