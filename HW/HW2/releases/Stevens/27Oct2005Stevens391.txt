ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE- COASTAL PLAIN DEVELOPMENT
  Today Sen. Stevens joined Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and others in speaking about the positive effects developing the Coastal Plain of Alaska will have on the nation's energy prices and economic development.  
   Excerpts of Senator Stevens' remarks follow. 
   "America is paying significantly more for gasoline, heating fuel, and consumer products than just a few short months ago. In the past four and a half years, the average price of gasoline has increased by $1.84 a gallon - that's a 75% increase! 
   "We now import almost 60% of the oil we consume. For every $1 billion that we spend to develop our domestic resources, we create 12,500 jobs. That means we lost over 1.3 million jobs in 2003 by importing oil instead of producing it here." 
   "We must reduce energy costs and create well-paying jobs for Americans by developing our domestic resources. Alaska can play a large role in this effort....we have what is estimated to be the 2nd largest oil field ever discovered in North America, capable of producing 1 million barrels of oil per day... which will create an estimated 700,000 and 1 million American jobs when developed. 
   "Public perception on this issue has begun to change - I believe Americans now support drilling on the Coastal Plain because they realize stable energy prices, economic growth, and improved national security will come only when we increase domestic energy resources. 
   "The United States can no longer afford to outsource jobs and meet our energy needs overseas".
