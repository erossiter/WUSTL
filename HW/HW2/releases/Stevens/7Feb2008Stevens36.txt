SENATE PASSES SEN. STEVENS-SPONSORED AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC RELIEF TO SENIORS, DISABLED VETERANS
  The U.S. Senate today approved an amendment originally authored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to provide income tax rebates to Social Security-dependent senior citizens and disabled veterans. The provision was part of economic stimulus legislation (H.R. 5140) that the Senate passed today 81-16. 
   Specifically, the amendment improves the House-passed stimulus package by allowing seniors, disabled veterans, and widows of disabled veterans to qualify for the rebate checks by counting Social Security benefits and veterans' disability payments towards the $3,000 income minimum requirement. In addition, the revised provision, which was co-sponsored by Senators Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), and Max Baucus (D-Mont.), excludes illegal aliens from receiving rebate checks by requiring a valid Social Security number to claim the base rebate and the per child bonus.
   "If we want this bill to have an immediate impact on the U.S. economy, Congress must act quickly to get this to the President," said Senator Stevens. "I am pleased that Senators of both parties put politics aside and chose a path that is best for the American people. Our amendment ensures that seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans also reap the benefits of this relief package without giving handouts to illegal aliens."
   The underlying economic stimulus package, which the House passed on January 29, would:
   * Distribute rebate checks to Americans with at least $3,000 of earned income in 2007, with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 (for single filers) and $150,000 (for married couples filing jointly). Individuals could receive checks of $300 to $600, and married couples between $600 and $1,200;
   * Provide an additional $300 tax rebate for each child under the age of 17;
   * Temporarily change the tax code to allow businesses that buy new equipment this year to deduct an additional 50 percent of the cost of their investment in 2008. The agreement also increases expensing for small businesses; and
   * Increase the size of mortgage loans that the Federal Housing Administration may insure and that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may purchase.
