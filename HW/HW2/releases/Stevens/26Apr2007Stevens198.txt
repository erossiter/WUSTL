SEN. STEVENS JOINS SEN. MURKOWSKI IN INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO AMEND NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today announced he will be an original co-sponsor of the School Accountability Improvements Act, legislation introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). This bill would amend the No Child Left Behind Act to ensure it properly addresses Alaska's education needs.  
  "In order for Alaskan children to succeed in school, our laws must reflect the special circumstances in which education is delivered throughout our state," said Senator Stevens. "We must continue to find ways to equip students and teachers with the tools they need in this unique learning environment. Flexible standards are also key. I applaud Senator Murkowski for her leadership on this issue, and look forward to working with her to move this legislation through the Senate and onto the President's desk."
