SEN. STEVENS ADDRESSES COMMONWEALTH NORTH - TOUCHING 3RD RAIL
  Today Sen. Ted Stevens addressed Commonwealth North in Anchorage to begin the discussion on the issue of Social Security in Alaska. 
   Below is the Senator's presentation, complete with slides and a text of his remarks which sometimes reference the image above the remarks. 
   Slide 1: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide1.JPG
   For years, Social Security has been the "third rail" of politics; for people who touched it, their career was over. 
   We are now entering a period when the challenge of Social Security is enormous. Elected officials must have the political will to touch the "third rail" and survive because the system itself must survive.
   As President Pro Tempore of the Senate and Chairman of the Commerce Committee, I intend to be involved in this issue. 
   As I said, Social Security must survive. It is not bankrupt, but great problems loom ahead. They cannot be resolved simply by raising taxes, which has been the solution since 1936.
   We have a duty not to leave the burden of an ailing Social Security system for another generation. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to try to fix these problems now.
   Slide 2: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide2.JPG
   Americans lived in a different world when Social Security was designed in 1935.
   * Most women did not work outside the home. 
   * The life expectancy of the average American was 61.
   * But, Social Security was paid at 65. 
   * So, a working man or woman did not live long enough to collect much in retirement benefits.
   Slide 3: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide3.JPG
   We need a system that reflects today's America.
   * Women now make up 47% of the workforce. 
   * The average American lives to 77.
   * The life expectancy for American women is greater than men. It is now 79.
   Slide 4: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide4.JPG
   Social Security was intended to be, and is, an insurance program. It was never intended to be funded by income tax payers. It was established so that Americans who have a job support retirees by paying Social Security taxes. 
   All annual wages up to $90,000 are subject to this tax.
   Slide 5: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide5.JPG
   Slide 6: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide6.JPG
   One of my concerns about the growing Social Security crisis is its impact on federal taxes. 
   This chart shows the breakdown of federal taxes collected in our state.
   In 2002, 43% of all the federal taxes collected in Alaska went to Social Security. Let me repeat that: 43% of all federal taxes paid by Alaskans in 2002 were Social Security taxes.
   Slide 7: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide7.JPG
  This slide illustrates this Social Security tax burden in dollars.
   In 2002, approximately 369,000 Alaskan residents worked on jobs that were covered by the Social Security program.
   They earned $9.83 billion, which were subject to the Social Security tax.
   Of that $9.83 billion, Alaska's employees, employers, and self-employed residents paid $1.22 billion in Social Security taxes.
   At a time when we are building the future of our state, I am concerned about the impact of growing Social Security taxes on the Alaskan economy. I will comment on this in greater detail in a moment when we talk about solutions.
   First, we must decide: Does Social Security have real problems? For me, there is no doubt - there are problems. A real crisis is brewing.
   Slide 8: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide8.JPG
   The number one problem for Social Security is the number of contributors. 
   In 1950, there were 16 workers paying into Social Security for every 1 person receiving benefits. 
   Today, that ratio is just over 3 to 1. 
   By the time our children and grandchildren retire, there will be only 2 workers for each beneficiary.
   The system is not broken. It just doesn't fit demographic trends.
   Slide 9: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide9.JPG
   The second problem is the way Social Security benefits are calculated. They are indexed to the growth in wages, rather than being adjusted for inflation.
   Let me put this into perspective:
   If I can buy one gallon of milk with my Social Security benefit today...
   ...then by the time our daughter Lily, now 23, retires, she will be able to buy three gallons of milk with the same benefit. 
   This is because the price of milk is tied to inflation, while the benefit is tied to wages.
   Over time, the benefit grows faster than inflation. This gives recipients more purchasing power. But, it creates a real solvency problem for the system.
   Slide 10: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide10.JPG
   The growth in benefits means that, going forward, the system promises higher benefits than it can pay out. 
   The first bar represents what the average wage earner retiring today will collect in benefits: $14,200.
   The second bar represents what Social Security promises to pay the average wage earner who retires in 2050: and that is $20,600.
   But the third bar represents what the system actually will be able to pay in 2050: Only $15,000.
   Slide 11: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide11.JPG
   The Social Security system will continue generate more money than is paid out until 2018.
   The black line in the middle of this graph represents the amount of money the federal government takes in from Social Security-related taxes. 
   The blue line represents the Social Security benefits being paid out.
   In the next 13 years, Social Security revenue collected will exceed the total amount of cash benefits paid to Social Security recipients. 
   This surplus is represented by the area shaded in green.
   Slide 12: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide12.JPG
   But in 2018 the baby boom generation retirement will hit its peak.
   Rising benefits, lower numbers of workers, and the growing numbers of retirees will create a "perfect storm" in 2018, moving the system from surpluses to deficits.
   Annual Social Security surpluses will decline, and according to Social Security's Trustees, the program will begin to run annual deficits.
   These annual Social Security deficits are represented by the area shaded in red.
   The annual deficits will increase each year from $16 billion in 2018 to over $300 billion in 2033.
   Slide 13: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide13.JPG
   When this happens, additional money must be paid into the Social Security fund. There are three options available to raise such funds: Cut government spending, raise taxes, or increase the national deficit through borrowing.
   Let me emphasize: the Social Security system is safe for today's seniors and those born before 1950. But if we fail to modify this system, by 2018 - just 13 years from now - Social Security will have to pay out more than it takes in. 
   All the signs of real crisis are there. 
   We must heed these warnings.
   Slide 14: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide14.JPG
   Young Americans understand the problem.
   79% of Americans under retirement age do not think Social Security will provide benefits by the time they retire. 
   That perception is compounded in our state where the average age is 32.
   More than 540,000 Alaskans are under the age of 55. They know they will inherit this crisis if we do not act now. 
   Young people on my staff tell me these days the first question a financial planner asks them is: "Do you want to assume Social Security will be here when you retire?"
   For me, this system needs repair. President Bush has started the discussion about how to fix it. A series of solutions have been presented. In coming months, Congress will seek to find solutions.
   Slide 15: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide15.JPG
   Ultimately, a graph that looks like this would be good news. 
   One where the lines representing Social Security revenues and spending come together and stay even. 
   To do this, we need a permanent solution, not a short-term fix.
   Slide 16: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide16.JPG
   Two decisions have been made:
   First, no one 55 or older will be affected - their Social Security will not change. Whatever plan we choose, the changes will impact only Americans born after 1950. This was a decision, not a component of the system. 
   Secondly, raising Social Security taxes is not a viable long-term solution.
   Slide 17: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide17.JPG
   Social Security taxes have been raised 22 times. 
   Raising these taxes again will have serious consequences. Social Security now takes 12.4% of a worker's wages on all income up to $90,000. And the Medicare tax rate is 2.9%, split between the employee and employer. 
   That's a great burden on lower income people. No matter how much income tax relief they receive, the costs of their own Social Security are great. And, those taxes should not increase.
   Slide 18: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide18.JPG
   Some have asked: Since only earnings up to $90,000 are subject to the Social Security tax, why not just raise the $90,000 cap?
   That alone is not a long-term solution. 
   Remember: Social Security is an insurance program. If a person pays more for Social Security insurance, that person's benefits will be greater.
   According to the Social Security Trustees, completely eliminating the cap would postpone deficits by only 6 years - to 2024.
   So, raising the cap alone is not a permanent solution.
   Slide 19: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide19.JPG
   The long-term fix to Social Security will likely be a combination of smaller solutions. As the President said in the State of the Union, all options are on the table. And the solution must be bi-partisan. 
   Many options have been proposed:
   When he was in office, President Clinton spoke of increasing the retirement age.
   Senator Graham is talking about personal savings accounts and raising the $90,000 cap, while lowering the Social Security tax to 11.4%.
   "Add-on accounts" have been proposed as an alternative to personal savings accounts. They would be structured as enhancements to today's 401(k)s and would be funded through additional payroll taxes paid by workers. 
   Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits.
   Slide 20: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide20.JPG
  The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.
   Former Congressman Tim Penny from Minnesota raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages.
   Others have expanded on Congressman Penny's idea. Senator Bennett's blended indexing system would tie the bottom third of workers to a wage index, the top 1% of workers to a price index, and use a blended system for all other workers. This plan would be phased in over time and completely implemented by 2011.
   After-tax indexing is another option on the table. Currently, we base benefits on pre-tax income. Under this plan, benefits would be based on the amount a person earns after taxes.
   Slide 21: http://stevens.senate.gov/pr/2005/february/Slide21.JPG
  A group of proposals target the need for incentives and mechanisms which will generate additional retirement savings.
   Some have proposed giving generous tax breaks to lower-income workers who participate in retirement accounts.
   Others think we should automatically enroll workers in job-based retirement accounts. There would be an opportunity to opt-out, but this system would encourage savings by assuming workers want to participate.
   Senator Lieberman and Senator Santorum support giving every child a lump payment at birth. This amount - say around $500 - would go into an account that must be held until retirement.
   My plan is to ask Alaskans to look at the facts, study the options, and help our nation deal with this crisis now! 
   We all need to be part of the solution. I look forward to a dialogue on options that will best serve Alaskans.
   The question is: What combination of options will save Social Security without creating more problems? Working together, I feel we can find that balance. 
   I really want to discuss this with you. I'll take your questions in a minute, but if you have any questions I don't answer or any ideas, members of my staff are here: George Lowe, my Chief of Staff; Marie Nash, Director of my Alaska offices; Liz Connell, my Legislative Assistant for Social Security, health and education issues; Jim Egan, a staff assistant in my Anchorage office; and Lindsay Hayes, my speechwriter. Please seek them out.
