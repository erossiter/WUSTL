SENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, & TRANSPORTATION APPROVES COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION BILL
  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation today approved the Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, legislation championed by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). This bill, which includes key provisions for Alaska, would authorize $8.7 billion for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to fund much-needed renovations and the acquisition of new vessels and aircraft.
  "With more than half of the coastline of the United States, Alaska relies heavily on the Coast Guard to protect our fisheries and conduct search and rescue missions," said Senator Stevens. "This bill will ensure the Coast Guard has adequate resources and the support needed to carry out these critical tasks. The modernization of the Coast Guard fleet must continue to be one of Congress' top priorities, and I am pleased to see this legislation advance."  
  Provisions in the reauthorization specific to USCG operations in Alaska include:
   * Forward Operating Facility in the Aleutians - This provision would authorize the USCG to construct or lease a helicopter hangar facility in the Aleutian Islands - Bering Sea operating area. The facility would help reduce rescue response times by allowing the Coast Guard to stage assets closer to fishing grounds. 
   * Response Station in Valdez - This provision would authorize the Coast Guard to construct a full multi-mission Coast Guard Response Station in Valdez, which would enhance the Coast Guard's ability to protect the Port of Valdez and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Terminal. 
   * Transfer of Storis - This provision would transfer the USCG Cutter Storis to the USCG Cutter Storis Museum and Education Center located in Juneau, Alaska. The Storis has been stationed in Alaska since 1948 and will be able to remain in the state as a result of this provision. 
   * Small Vessel Exemption from Definition of Fish Processing Vessel - This provision would provide new opportunities to salmon fishermen in Alaska by allowing each vessel to process and send up to five metric tons of salmon to market per week. 
   * Risk Assessment for Cook Inlet and the Aleutians - This provision directs the USCG to conduct a vessel traffic risk assessment for both Cook Inlet and the Aleutian Islands, which will ensure the continued protection of Alaska's waters as vessel traffic increases in these areas. This provision directs the Coast Guard to work with Alaskans to determine the best options for vessel tracking, towing and tug response, and increasing spill response equipment. 
   * Oil Spill Recovery Institute - The Oil Spill Recovery Institute (OSRI), located in Cordova, conducts research and develops technologies to prevent and mitigate the effects of oil spills. This is especially important as research is needed about potential spills in extreme cold water and ice conditions. OSRI received $22.5 million from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund in 1996, and its operating budgets are partially funded from the interest generated by that appropriation. This provision would increase the principal amount by $12.851 million to account for reduced funding due to low interest rates and inflation. 
   * Pribilof Transition Act Extension - The Fur Seal Act of 1966 authorizes the Pribilof Island communities of St. Paul and St. George to receive economic development funding in order to provide new employment opportunities. The current authorization expires this year, and this provision would extend it until 2009. 
  Nomination of Retired Vice Admiral Barrett to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation
  The Commerce Committee also approved the nomination of retired Vice Admiral Thomas J. Barrett, United States Coast Guard (USCG), to serve as Deputy Secretary for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Vice Admiral Barrett has served as DOT's Acting Deputy Secretary since March 2007. In this capacity, he is the principal advisor to Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters and responsible for the day-to-day management of the Department's $61.1 billion budget and more than 60,000 employees. 
  "Vice Admiral Barrett is a tremendous asset for our country and has demonstrated a great understanding of Alaska, both as a member of the Coast Guard and as Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration," said Senator Stevens. "He has continued to serve with distinction as Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation, and I urge the full Senate to approve his official nomination in an expeditious manner." 
   Often stationed in Alaska during his more than 35 years of distinguished service in the Coast Guard, VADM Barrett commanded the Seventeenth Coast Guard District; served as Commander, Naval Forces Alaska; and directed USCG operations in the North Pacific, a region which includes the Gulf of Alaska, the Eastern Bering Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. Vice Admiral Barrett also commanded the Coast Guard base in Kodiak, coordinated the Coast Guard Leadership Council, and is a recipient of the Coast Guard's Distinguished Service Medal.
