SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT RURAL TELEPHONE SERVICE
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today introduced the Universal Service for Americans Act. The bill (S.101) will update the nation's universal service laws. The measure will ensure that all communications technologies are incorporated into our nation's universal service program and that rural America is not left behind in the communications revolution.  
   "Through the years, our nation's universal service program has ensured that rural Americans, including residents of Alaska, have access to basic telephone and cell phone service," said said Senator Stevens. "The universal service program is essential to bringing broadband, distance learning, and telemedicine to rural Alaska, as well as the rest of our nation. The bill will ensure that schools, libraries and health clinics in rural Alaska and the rest of the nation continue to receive universal service funds on a timely basis." 
   This legislation expands the list of communications providers that will contribute to the fund. Under current law, long-distance companies pay the bulk of the cost. In addition to updating universal service, the bill includes measures to ensure the long-term integrity of the program with improved auditing requirements. The legislation mirrors Title II of the bipartisan Senate Communications bill that passed the Committee last summer.
