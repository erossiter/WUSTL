SEN. STEVENS HONORED WITH BENCHMARK IN RECOGNITION OF ALASKA VOLCANO OBSERVATORY LEADERSHIP
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) received an award from the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) today in recognition of 20 years of leadership and support for volcanic disaster preparation. The award included a plaque bearing a reference mark for the Washington, D.C., triangulation station, one of the markers maintained by the USGS. 
   "In communities across Alaska and in air travel throughout our airspace, volcanic activity poses a real threat to safety," said Senator Stevens. "The AVO is on watch 24/7, ready to warn of unforeseen challenges so eruptions don't threaten our lives. I continue to fight to get funding for volcano monitoring and ash plume forecasting to assure AVO will continue its important mission."
   The AVO was founded in 1988 after the eruptions at Cook Inlet's Augustine Volcano disrupted passenger jet travel in southcentral Alaska. Since its inception, the AVO has monitored volcanic conditions at over 100 volcanoes, which has increased safety not only for Alaska, but for international air travel as well.
   "Senator Stevens has shown great foresight and dedication over the years first in helping to establish the Alaska Volcano Observatory and then by making sure AVO could carry out its public safety mission," said U.S. Geological Survey Director Mark Myers following the ceremony.
   The AVO is a joint program of the USGS, the University of Alaska, and the State of Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. It uses federal, state, and university resources to monitor and study Alaska's hazardous volcanoes, to predict and record eruptive activity, and to mitigate volcanic hazards to life and property.
