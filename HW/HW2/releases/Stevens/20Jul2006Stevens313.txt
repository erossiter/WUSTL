SEN. STEVENS SUPPORTS VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today voted in support of H.R. 9, the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. The Senate passed the legislation, which amends the Voting Rights of 1965, by a vote of 98 to 0.  
   "This is a very significant act and I'm glad to see it has been passed on a bipartisan basis," said Senator Stevens. "This legislation demonstrates our country's continued commitment to equal voting rights." 
   H.R. 9 reauthorizes provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that were set to expire in 2007. These provisions include the assignment of election observers and bilingual election assistance requirements. In addition, this bill extends provisions under which Alaska and 15 other states must obtain approval from the Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures. The legislation passed today extends each of these provisions through 2032. 
   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was initially passed to end practices that disenfranchised African-American voters. It was amended in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 1992 and remains one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation enacted in the United States.
