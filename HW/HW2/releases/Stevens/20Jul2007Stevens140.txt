ON RECORD: SEN. STEVENS' STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF JULY 16
  On the climate change bill that he is co-sponsoring with Senator Lisa Murkowski
   "I believe it has the right approach to the concept of global climate change being a constantly evolving situation. (This bill) is not just a flash-in-a-pan, publicity stunt. ...This is a very modified cap-and-trade concept and it has a balance in it. It is dealing with global climate change rather than a spastic kind of global warming." (7/17/07) 
  On the importance of the Essential Air Service program to Alaska
   "Rural air service is a vital component of Alaska's transportation system. Alaska depends on aviation more than any other state. More than 70 percent of our cities, towns, and villages can be reached year-round only by air. Instead of cars and buses, we have airplanes?. In Alaska, we have 41 subsidized communities which rely on the Essential Air Service program for access to hospitals, mail service, food, and basic supplies and to transport teams back and forth to play basketball." (7/17/07)
  On the future of the Essential Air Service program 
   "Rural air service funding and reform is an annual challenge for Congress. In addition to finding a funding solution for the future air traffic control system, the (Senate Commerce) Committee is also looking for innovative reforms for the program. New innovation in the marketplace may hold great promise for rural air service. There is great interest in the emergence of very light jets. These new aircraft may prove to be a unique opportunity for small communities in Alaska to maintain and improve aviation access. However, Congress must remain vigilant in funding the Essential Air Service program. Rural air service is literally a lifeline for many Alaskans, and a healthy Essential Air Service program nationally, makes for a healthy program in Alaska." (7/17/07)
