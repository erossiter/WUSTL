NOAA HONORS SEN. STEVENS WITH 2006 SPECIAL RECOGNITION AWARD
  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) with a lifetime achievement award at its first annual Marine Stewardship and Sustainability Awards ceremony. Sen. Ted Stevens received the Special Recognition Award, which honors leadership in the sustainable management of living marine resources.  
   NOAA chose to recognize Stevens because of his instrumental role in developing the laws that form the basis of U.S. fisheries management and marine conservation efforts. 
   Stevens accepted the award Monday night. "It is a privilege to be included in this distinguished group of honorees," he said. "Our nation has come a long way from the days when Warren Magnuson and I first set out to address the sustainability of our fisheries. Today, 30 years later, the Senate is considering the seventh reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which includes provisions that will promote the sustainable use of marine resources in both domestic and international waters. It is my hope this bill will lay the foundation for 30 more years of successful fisheries management."
