SEN. STEVENS COMMENTS ON PASSING OF MRS. MARGARET INOUYE
  Sen. Stevens (R-Alaska) expressed his sincere sadness upon learning of the passing of Mrs. Margaret Inouye, wife of Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii).  
   "Words cannot express the sadness Catherine and I felt when we learned Maggie Inouye had passed away. 
   "Maggie was truly Dan's partner in life. She supported him, listened to him, and campaigned for him. She came to Washington with Dan, far from her friends and family, to help him serve the people of Hawaii. 
   "Maggie lived her life with great dignity, grace, and optimism. It was these qualities that drew Dan to her 58 years ago, and even illness could not dampen her spirit. 
   "Catherine and I send our deepest sympathies to Dan, their son Kenny and his wife Jessica, and Maggie's five sisters. Maggie will be sorely missed by all who knew her."
