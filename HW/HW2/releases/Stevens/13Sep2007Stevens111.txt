SEN. STEVENS MOURNS PASSING OF AUGIE HIEBERT
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today offered the following statement upon learning of the death of Alaska broadcast pioneer Augie Hiebert:  
  "Catherine and I were saddened to learn of the passing of our dear friend, Augie Hiebert. Alaska has lost one of its greatest pioneers. We will remember Augie for bringing us the benefits of broadcast communications as well as for his seemingly limitless energy and bright vision for the future of Alaska.
  "During his distinguished career in broadcasting, Augie served Alaska in many ways. He was a founder and president of the Alaska Broadcasters' Association. As the organization's attorney from 1961 to 1968, I watched Augie give countless Alaskans their start in the industry. 
  "In addition to being a pioneer, Augie was also the quintessential steward of Alaska broadcasting. Each year he brought local broadcasters to Washington, D.C. for 'Alaska Days' at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). But his efforts to educate the FCC about the unique challenges facing Alaska's broadcasters didn't end there. The entire FCC once made a trip to Alaska at Augie's request. 
  "Rather than all of the firsts he achieved during his long career, Alaskans will remember Augie most as the man who made the nation's largest state a little smaller - his efforts brought us closer to one another, and closer to the rest of the world. 
  "Our thoughts and prayers are with Augie's daughters and their families."
