SENS. STEVENS-MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT APPROVED IN FDA REFORM BILL
  The United States Senate late yesterday passed an amendment authored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) which will strengthen safeguards in the Food and Drug Administration's process for approving the use and production of genetically engineered seafood. The provision is part of a comprehensive bill to reauthorize and reform the FDA that now heads to President Bush to be signed into law. 
  "Genetically engineered fish could pose a very real threat to wild stocks that are essential to the economic, cultural, and physical well-being of Alaskans," said Senator Stevens. "Sound science and reasoned safeguards are the keys to protecting this critical resource."
  "Alaska's wild fish stocks are extremely important to the state and provide for sport, subsistence and commercial uses. We must do everything we can to protect this natural resource," said Senator Murkowski. 
  The Stevens-Murkowski amendment will require the FDA to consult with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and produce a report on any environmental risks associated with the introduction of a genetically engineered seafood product, including impacts on wild stocks.
  Research on genetically engineered fish is underway in several countries, including the United States. Scientists have raised concerns about genetically engineered fish escaping into U.S. waters, where they could cross-breed with wild stocks and out-compete them for food and mates.
