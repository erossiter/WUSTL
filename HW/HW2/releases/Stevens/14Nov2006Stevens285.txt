SEN. STEVENS WELCOMES UNITED PARCEL SERVICE'S DECISION TO OPEN 'PILOT DOMICILE' IN ANCHORAGE
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today applauded the United Parcel Service's plans to designate Anchorage as an official home base for about 80 pilots who will fly the company's MD-11 cargo planes. The transition is to be complete by May 2007. Anchorage will be the fourth "pilot domicile" for United Parcel Service's, which also bases pilots in Miami, Ontario, and Louisville.  
   "UPS' decision is good news for our whole state," said Senator Stevens. "It will help stimulate our economy by creating a variety of new jobs for people throughout Alaska. UPS has provided years of great service to Alaskans and this decision further strengthens that relationship." 
   UPS has serviced the Anchorage International Airport since 1977, and currently operates 11 wide-body aprons in a 90,000 sq. foot facility. UPS is Anchorage's second-largest cargo carrier.
