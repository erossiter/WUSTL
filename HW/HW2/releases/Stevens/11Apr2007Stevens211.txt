SEN. STEVENS VOTES TO SUPPORT STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) on Wednesday, April 11, voted in support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 (S. 5), which passed the Senate by a vote of 63 to 34.  
   "Embryonic stem cell research has shown great promise as we seek to develop treatments and cures for many devastating diseases. The federal government should support this type of research and ensure it is performed under strict ethical guidelines," said Senator Stevens. "With the appropriate safeguards in place, stem cell research has the potential to greatly improve our quality of life and our standards of care. It is also important to conduct this research in our country, so American medical science can remain the best in the world. " 
  S. 5 would require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research using human embryonic stem cells. The bill specifies that embryonic stem cells used for research may only be from embryos that were donated to an in vitro clinic and would otherwise be discarded. 
   Senator Stevens also voted today to support the Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act, or HOPE Act, which passed the Senate 70 to 28. This bill, S. 30, was sponsored by Senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) and Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga). It states that certain broad categories of scientific methods for deriving embryonic stem cell lines, including using "naturally dead" embryos, could become eligible for federal funding. 
  "It is time that Congress sends a stem cell bill to the President that will be signed into law," said Senator Stevens. "I hope one of these two pieces of legislation passed today will receive enough support from the House and Senate to become law."
