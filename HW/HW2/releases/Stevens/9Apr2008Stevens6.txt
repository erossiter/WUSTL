SEN. STEVENS HONORED BY U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today was awarded the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's prestigious Spirit of Enterprise Award for his support of pro-growth and pro-business legislation last year. 
   "I am honored to receive this recognition from the Chamber of Commerce," said Senator Stevens. "The business community and, in particular, small businesses play an invaluable role in America's economy and are vital members of our communities. I take great pride in representing these hardworking Alaskans in Washington, D.C., each day."
   "Senator Stevens has proven to be an effective ally to the business community, supporting legislation that helps grow the economy and creates new jobs for hardworking Americans," said Tom Donohue, Chamber president and CEO. "The Chamber is grateful for Ted's commitment to these important issues and is proud to present him with this award."
   The Chamber of Commerce's Sprit of Enterprise Award is given annually to members of Congress based on rankings it gives for key business votes outlined in its yearly publication How They Voted. Senator Stevens compiled a 91 percent score with the Chamber last year.
   The Chamber used 11 Senate and 20 House votes in 2007 as criteria for the award, including a trade promotion agreement with Peru; an extension of the Andean Trade Preference Act; an extension of the federal backstop for terrorism risk insurance; revisions to the rules governing direct foreign investment; and critical water resources legislation to facilitate commerce at the nation's waterways and ports.
