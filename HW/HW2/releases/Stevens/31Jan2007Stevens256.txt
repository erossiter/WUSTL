SEN. STEVENS CO-SPONSORS BIPARTISAN BILL TO FIGHT GANG VIOLENCE
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) joined a bipartisan coalition of 16 other Senators today in introducing the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007. This comprehensive legislation would combat gang violence and crime by establishing new offenses and tougher federal penalties to deter and punish members of illegal street gangs. The bill would also provide more than $1 billion in funding over five years for gang enforcement, prevention, and intervention programs. 
   "Youth and gang violence is a growing problem throughout Alaska, particularly in our urban areas," said Senator Stevens. "To reverse this disturbing trend, we need stricter laws and stronger penalties for those involved in gang activities. The first step in these efforts must be increased federal support for local law enforcement programs and the judicial system. By providing law enforcement and prevention programs with the resources they need, this bipartisan legislation will help keep our communities safe."  
   The legislation has garnered the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, which represents 238,000 police officers from across the country, as well as the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. 
   Senator Stevens joined the bill's sponsors, Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), in introducing the legislation. The bill is also co-sponsored by Senators Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), Joseph Biden (D-Del.), John Cornyn (R-Tex.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Ken Salazar (D-Col.), Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.). 
   Bill Summary 
   The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007 would help law enforcement officers by adopting new criminal laws and tougher penalties against those who commit gang-related crimes; authorizing funding for investigations, prosecutions, and witness protection programs; and investing in successful community programs to prevent young people from joining gangs. 
   Specifically, the bill would: 
   * Designate $1.02 billion to fund gang enforcement, prevention, and intervention programs over five years, including: 
    - $500 million to support collaborative efforts by federal, state, and local law enforcement in combating violent gangs in high-intensity gang areas. These funds would be split evenly between law enforcement and prevention programs; 
   - $150 million to expand the FBI's Safe Streets Violent Crime Initiative and Project Safe Neighborhoods, a Justice Department program to reduce gun violence; 
   - $100 million to expand violent crime enforcement personnel, technology, equipment, and training; and 
   - $270 million to fund witness protection programs. 
   * Replace the federal law's current sentencing enhancement for gang-related conduct - a rarely used provision - with a new, Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Organizations Act-like anti-gang section that directly criminalizes and penalizes street gang crime, related conspiracies, and attempts to commit crimes in furtherance of a criminal street gang. 
   * Create new criminal offenses to prohibit the recruitment of minors to criminal street gangs and gang recruitment in prisons; and 
   * Increase the penalties for racketeering and other existing offenses; create a new federal crime for violence committed in furtherance of drug trafficking; and establish violent crime reforms needed to effectively prosecute gang members.
