SENS. MURKOWSKI, STEVENS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS RIFLE TEAM PASSES SENATE
  A resolution sponsored by Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens which recognizes the University of Alaska Fairbanks Rifle team unanimously passed the Senate on Thursday night. The team won the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association Rifle Championship on March 10, in Fairbanks 
  With a total score of 4,662 points for their performance in the smallbore and air rifle competitions, the undefeated and defending champion University of Alaska Fairbanks Nanooks posted an 18-point win over the U.S. Military Academy and a 23-point win over Jacksonville State University to claim their ninth national championship title. 
  This was the first time the Nanooks have hosted an NCAA Championship. More than 900 spectators, a record crowd for an NCAA Rifle Championship, were present to help support the local team.
  "I congratulate the team on their championship performance and wish them continued success in future years," said Senator Murkowski. "Congratulations are also in order for the community of Fairbanks which represented the spirit of Alaska well by cheering on the home team in record numbers."
  "Rifle has a storied history in our State, and we were pleased to see UAF's team continue that tradition with another national championship," said Senator Stevens. "The home team represented Alaska with pride and excellence."
