SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ENSURE CREATION OF VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL VISITOR CENTER
  Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has introduced legislation designating a general location for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center and requiring final approval of the site within 30 days of the bill's enactment. This legislation is cosponsored by two Vietnam veterans, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).  
   "We owe it to our Vietnam veterans and the memorial's future visitors to follow through with this project," said Stevens. "This center will be an important resource for current and future generations. It will enable visitors to learn about the Vietnam War and pay tribute to the brave Americans who answered the call of duty." 
   In November 2003, the Senate unanimously passed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Act, which authorized construction of the visitor center. The center will serve the approximately 4 million people who visit the memorial each year. Since the Act's passage, this project has faced several delays. S.2419, the legislation introduced today, will accelerate approval of the center's site. Similar legislation was previously introduced in the House. 
   Per capita, Alaska is home to more veterans than any other state in the country. As a World War II veteran and Alaska's senior senator, Stevens has long supported this important project. 
   S. 2419 has been referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
