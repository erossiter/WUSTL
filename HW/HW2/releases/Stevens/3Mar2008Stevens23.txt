ALASKAN TO TESTIFY AT SENATE HEARING ON OIL SPILL PROTECTION
  Retired Coast Guard Captain Ed Page, President of the Marine Exchange of Alaska, will testify in front of the Senate Commerce Committee at the request of Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), the Vice Chairman of the Committee. The hearing, "Protecting our Shores from Oil Spills: Operational Procedures and Ship Design," will convene Tuesday, March 4 at 2:30 p.m. in room 253 of the Senate Russell Building. 
   Captain Page will discuss the long-ranged, satellite-based tracking system developed by the Marine Exchange. This system can track the real-time movement of ships globally, enhancing the Coast Guard's maritime domain awareness. This ability is important in both the prevention of oil spills and for a rapid response should a spill occur.
   Other topics to be addressed at the hearing include the examination of non-tank vessel fuel tank design, the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic System, and the U.S. vessel pilot system.
   Captain Page is a 1972 graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. He served in the Coast Guard for 29 years in a variety of assignments, including as a deck watch officer on a high-endurance Coast Guard cutter; commanding officer of LORAN Station Iwo Jima; and various marine safety assignments on the West Coast. After serving 12 years in Alaska, Captain Page retired from the Coast Guard in 2001 and founded the Marine Exchange of Alaska in Juneau.
