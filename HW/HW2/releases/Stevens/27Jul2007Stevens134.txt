SENATE PASSES HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL WITH IMPORTANT ALASKA PROVISIONS
  The U.S. Senate late last night approved the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill by a vote of 89-4. This measure includes a series of provisions important to Alaska, including language sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) to extend the implementation deadline for the land and sea portions of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI).  
  "This legislation will have a significant impact on our nation and Alaska. We've appropriated essential funding for airport and port security, and taken steps to ensure the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative is not hastily implemented," said Senator Stevens. "Keeping America safe must be a top priority, but we have to strike a balance between addressing national security concerns and maintaining America's economic wellbeing. Our state, given its unique geographical location, will face the most negative consequences if the WHTI's land and sea portions are not implemented with careful consideration." 
  The WHTI requires all U.S. citizens to present a passport or other accepted secure document when entering the United States from Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean. In the FY07 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, Senator Stevens added language allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State to delay WHTI implementation until June 1, 2009 or three months after all requirements have been met and certified, whichever came earlier. However, due to concerns about whether DHS and the Department of State could implement passcard technology infrastructure and other important measures within this timeframe, Senator Stevens and Senator Leahy secured language that would require DHS and the State Department to institute WHTI guidelines no earlier than June 1, 2009. The Bush Administration currently plans to begin implementing the land and sea portions of WHTI on January 1, 2008. 
  Senator Stevens also championed the following provisions in this bill: 
   * $3 million for rural fire equipment - These funds will allow Alaska Village Initiatives to apply for funding to purchase foam canisters, that do not require water, for communities throughout the state. 
   * Continuation of LORAN-C - This provision will ensure the continuation of the Coast Guard's Long Range Navigation (LORAN-C) system. The LORAN-C system provides civil and military air, land, and marine users with navigation, location, and timing services in Alaska and other states. 
   * Funding for Polar Icebreakers - This language ensures the National Science Foundation is fully funded, which will allow the agency to operate and perform unanticipated maintenance on the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Icebreakers. 
   * Marine Vessel and Cold Water Safety Education - This language encourages the U.S. Coast Guard to continue existing co-operative agreements and partnerships with organizations that promote vessel training and education for fishermen and children. 
  Alaska will also be eligible to apply for a wide variety of grants made available for state and local programs that provide training, equipment, exercises, and technical assistance to improve disaster readiness. The bill specifically appropriates monies for state homeland security grant programs; terrorism prevention by law enforcement; port security; and rail security. The FY08 Homeland Security Appropriations bill also includes funding for Firefighting Assistance Grants.
