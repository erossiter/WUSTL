SEN. STEVENS: SOUND SCIENCE IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND CLIMATE CHANGE
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today emphasized the importance of using sound science in making policy decisions related to climate change. Senator Stevens made this observation during the Commerce Committee hearing entitled, "Improving the Federal Climate Change Research and Information Program." 
  Senator Stevens' submitted statement follows:
  "The United States is the world leader in climate change research. We currently spend more on research than any other nation in the world. Since 2001, Congress has appropriated nearly $37 billion for climate change research, technology, and incentive programs. In fact, much of this funding was appropriated during my term as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
  "A robust research program is essential because any decision about the mitigation and prevention of climate change must be based on sound science.
  "In Alaska we have already begun to see the effects of climate change. This is especially true along our Arctic coast where communities are literally falling into the sea due to erosion. It is vital that we have the tools to allow these communities to adapt. 
  "There is consensus that manmade carbon emissions have an impact on climate change. This, along with the need to achieve energy independence, is why I support raising the corporate average fuel economy standard. However, there is no agreement on how much of an influence these emissions carry. Sound science will help to resolve this question and avoid making policy decisions that can be unnecessary and burdensome."
