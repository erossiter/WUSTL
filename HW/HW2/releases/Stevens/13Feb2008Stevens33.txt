PRESIDENT SIGNS ECONOMIC STIMULUS BILL INTO LAW
  President George W. Bush today signed into law economic stimulus legislation (H.R. 5140) during a ceremony attended by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). Senator Stevens and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) authored a provision in the bill that provides income tax rebates to Social Security-dependent senior citizens, disabled veterans, and the widows of disabled veterans. 
   The Stevens-McConnell language also excludes illegal aliens from receiving rebate checks by requiring a valid Social Security number to claim the base rebate and the per child bonus.
   "The House-passed stimulus package created a loophole that allowed illegal aliens to take advantage of tax rebate checks," said Senator Stevens. "This was simply not acceptable. Illegal immigrants should not enjoy the same benefits earned by hard-working American citizens and legal immigrants. This concern was expressed to me by thousands of Alaskans, so we ensured our amendment corrected the House's mistake."
   Specifically, the amendment allows Social Security-dependent Americans, disabled veterans, and the widows of disabled veterans to qualify for the rebate checks by counting Social Security benefits and veterans' disability payments towards the $3,000 income minimum requirement.
   "It is high time that the U.S. Congress put politics aside and did what is best for the American people," said Senator Stevens. "On this economic stimulus bill, we accomplished that. Congress returned money to the pockets of Americans who need it most, particularly our seniors and disabled veterans."
   The underlying economic stimulus package will:
   * Distribute rebate checks to Americans with at least $3,000 of earned income in 2007, with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 (for single filers) and $150,000 (for married couples filing jointly). Checks will be phased-out for those with adjusted gross income above those levels. Individuals could receive checks of $300 to $600, and married couples between $600 and $1,200;
   * Provide an additional $300 tax rebate for each child under the age of 17;
   * Temporarily change the tax code to allow businesses that buy new equipment this year to deduct an additional 50 percent of the cost of their investment in 2008. The agreement also increases expensing for small businesses; and
   * Increase the size of mortgage loans that the Federal Housing Administration may insure and that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may purchase.
