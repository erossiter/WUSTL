SENS. STEVENS, LANDRIEU INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO PROMOTE 'TELEWORK' FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) have introduced S. 1000, the Telework Enhancement Act of 2007. This legislation would help improve the cost-efficiency of the federal government and the lives of families by allowing federal employees to work from home on a full- or part-time basis depending on eligibility. The measure also would serve to decrease traffic congestion, thereby saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
  "We must continue to promote measures that will secure our nation's energy independence," said Senator Stevens. "This bill represents just one small piece of that puzzle. By encouraging federal agencies to allow employees to work from home, we will reduce their use of gasoline, save them thousands of dollars in fuel expenses each year, and help protect our environment."
  "Through Senator Stevens' leadership, this bill represents a smart approach to improving our nation's energy efficiency while taking a fresh approach to the challenges of balancing home and career," Senator Landrieu said. "This legislation will help American families by giving federal workers the opportunity to continue serving the nation while spending more quality time with their loved ones. It is a commonsense proposal and I will work closely with my colleagues to secure its quick passage."
  S. 1000 would, among other things: 
   * Change the telework eligibility to make all federal employees eligible unless shown otherwise by their employer. Currently the law states that all employees are ineligible to participate in the telework program unless deemed otherwise by their employing federal agency; 
   * Require that one full-time employee be designated by each federal agency as a Telework Managing Officer (TMO) who would be responsible for implementing their respective agency's telework policy, serve as a liaison between employees and managers, develop accountability and productivity criteria, and keep employees informed of their telework eligibility; 
   * Require telework training for new employees and managers; and 
   * Ensure that employee reviews include a discussion of telework feasibility for each employee.
