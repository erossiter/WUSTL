SENS. STEVENS, LAUTENBERG ADVANCE PETS EVACUATION BILL
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) have successfully incorporated the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS) Act of 2006 into the comprehensive Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 (S. 3721). The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved S. 3721 today.  
   Stevens and Lautenberg originally introduced the PETS Act in April. The Act requires state and local authorities to include evacuation procedures for household pets and service animals in their emergency preparedness plans. It also enables the Federal Emergency Management Agency to financially support state and local efforts to secure emergency shelter facilities that can accommodate people with pets and service animals. 
   "I am pleased the committee chose to include the PETS Act as part of this legislation. Our current emergency evacuation plans do not adequately address the needs of people with pets and service animals. This fact was tragically apparent during Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma," said Stevens. "The committee's vote today brings us one step closer to minimizing personal loss in future crises and natural disasters." 
   "By accounting for the very strong ties that millions of Americans have to their pets in preparing for future emergencies, we can ensure a better response and actually save lives. And, during Hurricane Katrina many people put themselves in peril because they couldn't bear to evacuate without their pets," said Lautenberg. "Senator Stevens and I applaud the committee for including our amendment in the final legislation." 
   The bill will now be sent to the full Senate for consideration.
