SEN. STEVENS HONORED FOR HIS WORK ON SAFETY ISSUES INVOLVING KIDS MOTOR VEHICLES
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today received an award from Kids and Cars, an organization dedicated to ensuring no child is injured in non-traffic motor vehicle-related accidents. Senator Stevens was presented the award in honor of his work on the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act which was recently signed into law. 
   "Too often children are killed or injured, not on our nation's highways, but in their own driveways or in parking lots," said Senator Stevens. "I was proud to support this bipartisan bill and my thanks goes out to all of the families who have lost loved ones - their efforts in support of this legislation truly made a difference in Congress."
   "The Cameron Gulbransen Act will make vehicles safer for American families and help to end future preventable tragedies," said Janette Fennell, President of Kids and Cars. "I applaud Congress for their recognition that children's safety cannot simply be an option or an upgrade."
   This new law was named after 2-year old Cameron Gulbransen who was killed when he was inadvertently backed over by an SUV because the blind zone behind the vehicle made it impossible to see him. The legislation addresses three major causes of preventable injuries and fatalities to young children in and around motor vehicles: getting caught in an automatically closing power window, being struck by a backing vehicle because of an unacceptable blind zone; and placing a vehicle in gear that results in an uncontrolled roll away without having to depress the brake.
   In 2007, more than 230 children died in non-traffic vehicle accidents.
