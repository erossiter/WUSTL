SEN. STEVENS VOTES FOR BILL TO TRIPLE FUNDING FOR DENAIL KIDCARE
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today voted in favor of H.R. 976, a measure to increase funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). SCHIP provides health coverage to low-income, uninsured American children whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid and cannot afford private health insurance.  
  Under a new SCHIP funding formula established through H.R. 976, Alaska would receive $36.8 million for Denali KidCare, greater than a three-fold increase compared to last year. Denali KidCare currently provides 22,227 Alaskan children with health insurance; additional funding will enable the program to expand its coverage. 
  "It is imperative that Congress continue to provide both flexible and quality health care for our nation's neediest children," said Senator Stevens. "The passage of this SCHIP bill reaffirms our commitment to this responsibility. Denali KidCare is one of the most important programs in our State, and under this measure it receives the necessary funds to deliver the best-possible care to Alaskan children."
  The State Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act would maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children covered by SCHIP today and bring dependable health coverage to an additional 3.2 million low-income, uninsured American children within five years. This increase would be funded by raising the federal tax on cigarettes from 39 cents per pack to $1.00 per pack.
