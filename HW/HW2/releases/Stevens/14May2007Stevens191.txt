ON RECORD: SEN. STEVENS' STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF MAY 14
  On Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization legislation approved by the Commerce Committee this week  
   "I am a cosponsor of the underlying bill, yet I am concerned that as drafted it places an undue burden on too many small carriers in rural America. The benefits of a much-needed next generation air traffic system should not unfairly deal with our smallest carriers that, in Alaska, are a combination of taxis, trucks, buses, and SUVs. They carry goods of necessity such as groceries, clothing, and health supplies. Alaskans use planes to commute to work, to go to the doctor, and for many other essential purposes. In many instances, our aviation system is a lifeline for Alaskans." (5/16/07) 
  On Alaskans' concerns with user fee provisions in the FAA reauthorization bill 
   "We've totally exempted (piston propeller) general aviation. We've totally exempted anyone who uses the Essential Air Service (in Alaska). We've exempted the parts of our State that don't have (TRACON) coverage. So it is a very small portion of our people that are (affected), but it is still a user fee. They object to it and I understand that. I don't like it either. But I do think that we have to have a bill. If we don't get a bill, we will not have the authority to start the (air traffic control system) modernization process which will benefit Alaska more than anybody else." (5/17/07) 
  On the importance of modernizing the FAA's air traffic control system
   "A digital system is a lot less costly to operate in the future than an analog system. We're going to get there. We've used modernization of communications in Alaska to solve a lot of other problems - tele-health, tele- medicine, tele-education. What we have to do is find ways to improve the service to our people who are flying." (5/17/07)
