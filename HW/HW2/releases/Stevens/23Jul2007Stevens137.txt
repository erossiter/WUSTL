SEN. STEVENS CO-SPONSORS BILL TO EXPAND INTERNET ACCESS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today co-sponsored legislation to increase access to affordable broadband services for cities and towns across America. The Community Broadband Act of 2007 would allow municipalities to help fill existing voids in broadband access and enhance public safety by expanding high-speed internet services available to their residents.  
  "Access to high-speed internet services can provide people in underserved areas with essential educational and economic opportunities," said Senator Stevens. "In communities throughout Alaska, the internet has become a lifeline for businesses, schools, and individuals. By encouraging public-private partnerships, this bill would make it easier for communities to offer affordable broadband access to their residents."
  The Community Broadband Act of 2007 would specifically:
   * Set forth that no state regulation or requirement shall prevent a public provider from offering broadband services; 
   * Prohibit a municipality from discriminating against competing private providers; 
   * Require a municipality offering high-speed internet services to comply with federal telecommunications law or regulation that applies to all such providers; and 
   * Provide the public with notice and an opportunity to be heard before a municipality provides broadband to the public. 
  Senator Stevens included similar broadband provisions as part of a comprehensive communications reform bill that was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee during the last Congress.
