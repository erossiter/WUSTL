SEN. STEVENS SPEAKS IN SUPPORT OF TROOPS' MISSION IN IRAQ
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today gave a speech on the floor of the Senate to discuss his recent trip to the Middle East and voice opposition to S. 2634, a bill that would put mandates on the military to lead to withdrawal from Iraq. The U.S. Senate is debating taking up the measure today. 
   "This is no time to consider a withdrawal from Iraq," said Senator Stevens. "I will not participate in such a withdraw. If we are to withdraw, its going to be because we finished the job and we can move back and let the Iraqi military and police forces take over."
   Senator Stevens has been a strong supporter of General David Patraeus' troops surge strategy and the funding of Mine Resistant Armor Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), which he believes has contributed to the current gains in operations in Iraq.
   "My personal conclusion from what I saw and what I heard was the surge has worked. There is still work to be done, and there is still support we have to give these people in the field," said Senator Stevens. "I believe Iraq will come to the state where they can defend themselves...The equipment we've got over there should help them do that. That MRAP, I think, is probably one vehicle that will live in history, as far as this war in Iraq is concerned."
   In late November 2007, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) and Senator Stevens, in their capacity as Chairman and Co-chairman of Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, respectively, traveled throughout Iraq to discuss the military's mission with service members, generals, and Iraqi leaders.
