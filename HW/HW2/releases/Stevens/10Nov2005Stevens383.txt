SEN. STEVENS ISSUES STATEMENT IN HONOR OF VETERANS' DAY
  Sen. Stevens made the following statement in honor of Veterans' Day:  
   "It has been more than 50 years since those of us who served during World War II returned home. The patriotism and bravery I witnessed firsthand during our war is part of a larger American story, which began with the first shot at Lexington and Concord and has been written in the forest of Argonne, on the beaches of Normandy, and on the deck of the USS Arizona. A new chapter is written every time freedom is threatened and Americans answer the call to defend it. 
   "Over 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers began the Great American Experiment. They set out to create a government defined by its commitment to liberty and freedom. The Global War on Terror is this century's proving ground for these ideals. 
   "Veterans' Day is a reminder that the great American story of courage, bravery, and sacrifice continues. Today, it is being written in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the men and women of our armed forces - all volunteers - are helping the people of those countries build their emerging democracies. As Abraham Lincoln told the crowd which gathered at Gettysburg, the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform ensure 'that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.' We are comrades in the deepest sense of the word, and I salute their service."
