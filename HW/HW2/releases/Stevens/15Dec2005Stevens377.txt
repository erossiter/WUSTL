COMMERCE COMMITTEE APPROVES MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2005
  The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee today approved the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2005 by voice vote. The bill was introduced by Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), with Sens. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), John Kerry (D-Mass.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), David Vitter ( R-La.), Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) joining as cosponsors.  
   The Magnuson -Stevens Act (MSA), originally enacted in 1976, was most recently amended through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) in 1996, and establishes a national framework for conserving and managing marine fisheries within a 200-mile wide zone contiguous to the United States through eight Regional Fishery Management Councils (Councils). 
   The bill retains key provisions of the SFA, while making adjustments to the legislation designed to improve national compliance with the Act. The bill, which reauthorizes the MSA from Fiscal Year 2006 through Fiscal Year 2012, also contains provisions that would help improve international fishery management and conservation compliance, with an emphasis on strengthening controls on illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and ensuring other nations provide comparable protections to populations of living marine resources at risk from high seas fishing activities. 
   During consideration of the bill, a substitute was adopted without objection. The substitute strengthens the originally introduced bill and incorporates the comments and suggestions of a broad range of sources, including the Administration, states, the Ocean Commissions, industry, environmental organizations, and Committee Members. The changes included in the substitute are reflected in the attached list. (Also, attached is a copy of the bill as reported.)
