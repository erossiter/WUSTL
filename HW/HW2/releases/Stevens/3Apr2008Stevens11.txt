SEN. STEVENS URGES ALASKANS TO FILE THEIR 2007 TAX RETURN TO QUALIFY FOR REBATE CHECKS
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today encouraged all Alaskans to file their 2007 federal tax return by April 15 to ensure that they qualify for tax rebate checks provided under the Economic Stimulus Act. Thanks in part to the efforts of Senator Stevens, Congress passed this bill in February to return tax dollars to hard-working Americans, senior citizens, and the nation's veterans. 
   According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Americans must file a 2007 tax return to receive a rebate. The IRS will use this information to determine eligibility and calculate the size of the rebate. Even if you are not otherwise required to file a tax return, you must file a 2007 return in order to receive a payment this year.
   "To receive a rebate check on time, I urge all Alaskans to promptly file their 2007 federal tax returns," said Senator Stevens. "Filing after the April 15 deadline will cause significant delays in the mailing of your rebate check."
   The Treasury Department will make payments starting in early May. Early filers, especially those who choose direct deposit, will get their payments first.
   During the Senate's consideration of the legislation, Senator Stevens authored a provision, along with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), allowing Social Security-dependent Americans, disabled veterans, and the widows of disable veterans to qualify for the rebate checks by counting Social Security benefits and veterans' disability payments towards the $3,000 minimum income requirement. The Stevens-McConnell language also excludes illegal aliens from receiving rebate checks by requiring a valid Social Security number to claim the base rebate and the per child bonus.
   The underlying economic stimulus package distributes rebate checks to Americans with at least $3,000 of earned income in 2007, with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 (for single filers) and $150,000 (for married couples filing jointly). Checks will be phased-out for those with adjusted gross income above those levels. Individuals could receive checks of $300 to $600, and married couples between $600 and $1,200. The legislation also provides an additional $300 tax rebate for each child under the age of 17.
