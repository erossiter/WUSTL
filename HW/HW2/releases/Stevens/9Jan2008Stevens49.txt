SEN. STEVENS WORKS TO ENSURE SMOOTH DTV TRANSITION
  Senator Stevens continued his efforts to ensure that Alaskans are prepared for the coming digital television (DTV) transition. Broadcasters who transmit their programming over-the-air, making it freely available to consumers, are mandated to switch from analog signals to digital signals by February 17, 2009. The DTV transition will provide clearer pictures and increased programming while freeing up airwaves for emergency first responders and new wireless communications. 
   In 2005, Senator Stevens ensured that Congress created a $1.5 billion fund to assist consumers with the costs associate with the switchover. Through this program consumers can apply for $40 coupons to be used toward converter boxes that will allow households to keep using their analog television sets to receive over-the-air programming after the transition on February 17, 2009. Each household is eligible for up to two coupons.
   To assist Alaskans, applications for digital converter box coupons will be made available at all of Senator Stevens' Alaska offices and through his website at http://stevens.senate.gov/dtv.
   "In just over a year, television in America will undergo an enormous change when the switch from analog to digital television is complete," said Senator Stevens. "It is vital that American consumers, including Alaskans, are ready. Having access to digital converter boxes will be the key to a smooth digital transition."
   A television connected to cable, satellite or other pay television service will not experience any disruptions in their service relating to the DTV transition.
   WHAT: The digital television (DTV) transition is scheduled for February 17, 2009. Converter box coupon applications are available from January 1, 2008 until March 31, 2009. There are four ways consumers can request a coupon:
