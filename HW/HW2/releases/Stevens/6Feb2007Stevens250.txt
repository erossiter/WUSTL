SEN. STEVENS CO-SPONSORS BILL TO REGISTER ONLINE IDENTITIES AND EMAIL ADDRESSES OF SEX OFFENDERS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska)on Tuesday, Feb. 6, announced that he is co-sponsoring the "Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act of 2007" (KIDS Act of 2007 - S.431), legislation introduced by Sens.Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in the Senate and Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) in the House.  
   This bill requires convicted sex offenders to register "any e-mail address, instant message address, or other similar Internet identifier the sex offender used or will use to communicate over the Internet" with the National Sex Offender Registry. The legislation is supported by the American Family Association and social networking sites Facebook and MySpace. 
   "This bill will provide one more tool to help protect our children from online predators," said Senator Stevens. "Social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook are increasingly becoming an important part of many young lives, and we must ensure that this continues to be a safe experience." 
   This bill would be used to further protect children online by allowing the Department of Justice to make this registry available to social networking sites and allow them to compare the database with user profiles. The measure would also make it a crime for any person 18 years or older to knowingly misrepresent his or her age with the intent to use the Internet to engage in criminal sexual content involving a minor.
