SEN. STEVENS REFLECTS ON VETERANS' DAY
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today made the following statement in honor of Veterans' Day:  
   "Sixty years ago I returned home from World War II, having served alongside men and women who later became known as our 'Greatest Generation.' I am still humbled by their patriotism and bravery. 
   "Those of us left who lived through that dark period of history see the heroism and bravery of those who serve today - we know in our hearts the mantle has been passed. We have a new, all-volunteer 'Greatest Generation.' 
   "Only an extraordinary person can do the job asked of the men and women who wear our uniform. Our nation faces new threats and determined enemies, but they are preserving freedom and protecting our nation. 
   "When I was a boy, Veterans' Day was observed in memory of those who served during World War I. Today, it offers us a chance to reflect on and remember the valor of millions of Americans who have answered the call to serve throughout our history. My prayers - and the prayers of our grateful nation - are with each of these courageous men and women, and with those who have given their lives to continue to protect our freedoms.".
