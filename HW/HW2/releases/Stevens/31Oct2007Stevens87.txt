SENS. STEVENS, MURKOWSKI COSPONSOR LEGISLATION TO ALLOW FOR MENTION OF 'GOD' IN FLAG CERTIFICATES
  The United States Senate last night unanimously passed the Andrew Larochelle God, Family, and Country Act (S. 2198), a bill co-sponsored by Senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). The legislation will permanently allow for the acknowledgment of God on certificates for flags flown over the Capitol. 
   "Every morning the Senate opens with a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance. Both mention God," said Senator Stevens. "Religious expression is guaranteed by the First Amendment and this freedom is part of the fabric of American society. Any attempt to limit this freedom is not consistent with the values this country was founded upon. I applaud the Senate for swiftly passing this legislation."
   "Our country holds freedom as its most essential value," said Senator Murkowski. "I applaud the Senate for taking this action to protect free speech and the exercise of religion."
   Last month, Andrew Larochelle, a 17-year-old boy from Ohio, placed a request through Congressman Michael Turner (R-Ohio), that a flag be flown over the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2007, in honor of his grandfather. Andrew requested that the certificate issued by the Architect of the Capitol read as follows: "This flag was flown in honor of Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God, Country, and family." The Architect of the Capitol removed the word "God" from the certificate, citing Flag Services Rules, which prohibit "any religious or political expression" on flag certificates. S. 2198 would ensure that future expressions using the word God on flag certificates be permitted under Capitol rules. 
   The legislation is awaiting action in the House of Representatives. Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska) is cosponsoring the companion House legislation.
