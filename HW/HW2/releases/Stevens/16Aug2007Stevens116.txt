SEN. STEVENS ATTENDS OPENING OF SPENCER WHISTLE STOP
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today joined Senator Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii), Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and officials from the U.S. Forest Service and Alaska Railroad at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Spencer Whistle Stop.  
  "It's a grand partnership between the U.S. Forest Service and the Alaska Railroad," said Senator Stevens. "This is a beginning? as we get these new whistle stops set up along the railroad, hopefully we will follow them up with a series of cabins like some of the trails back east." 
  "We know that here in Alaska we have some of the most incredible scenery and the most incredible recreational opportunities, but access is always an issue," said Senator Murkowski. "When we can partner with the railroad to provide access into these beautiful areas, it is a win-win for everybody." 
  "This is simply unbelievable," said Senator Inouye, after the delegation hiked from the whistle stop to Spencer Glacier. 
  The Spencer Whistle Stop is the first station to be completed in the Whistle Stop Project, which the Forest Service and Alaska Railroad have partnered to construct. When complete, a total of five Whistle Stops will provide public access to the eastern edge of the Chugach National Forest. Passengers will be able to disembark from their trains for day hikes, camping, and sightseeing. 
  Approximately $1.6 million in federal funding was allocated to the Forest Service and Alaska Railroad to help design and create the whistle stops.
