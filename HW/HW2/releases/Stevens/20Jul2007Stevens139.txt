SEN. STEVENS ADDRESSES POSSIBLE LISTING OF COOK INLET BELUGA WHALE AS ENDANGERED SPECIES
  Today Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) spoke with Washington, D.C.-based Alaska reporters about the National Marine Fisheries Service's possible listing of the Cook Inlet beluga whale as an endangered species.  
  "If the belugas are listed as being endangered or threatened in the Cook Inlet, it's going to have an impact on sportfishing. It's going to have an impact on commercial fishing," said Senator Stevens. "It's going to have an impact on, really, the whole concept of what is the habitat that they must have and the food resources that they must have. So I think it is something that we have to take a long look at. I think that (the listing) is wrong?There are 100,000 beluga whales in the world, I'm told, and the belugas in Cook Inlet have increased from 278 to 302 this past year. Forty percent of the population is juveniles, and as these individuals become reproductive, we believe the population will continue to increase.".
