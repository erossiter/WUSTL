SEALASKA FORESTRY OFFICIAL TO TESTIFY AT U.S. SENATE HEARING ON CARBON SEQUESTRATION
  Mr. Ron Wolfe, Corporate Forester and Natural Resources Manager for the Sealaska Native Corporation based in Juneau, Alaska, has accepted an invitation from Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to testify at a hearing examining carbon sequestration technologies. The hearing will begin at 2:30 p.m. EST on Wednesday, November 7, 2007 in room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building.  
   The Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Innovation has asked Mr. Wolfe to discuss how Alaska's available land resources may be relevant to carbon sequestration demonstrations. Mr. Wolfe will also address the role of forest conservation and management in curbing greenhouse gas emissions. 
   During the hearing, the Committee will also hear the testimony of five other experts from government agencies, corporations, and academia on carbon sequestration technologies. Carbon sequestration is a method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing carbon dioxide from large point sources, such as power plants, and subsequently storing it safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. By using carbon sequestration technology, atmospheric greenhouse gases could be significantly reduced.
