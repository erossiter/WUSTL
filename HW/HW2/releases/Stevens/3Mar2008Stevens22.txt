SEN. STEVENS CO-SPONSORS BILL TO ASSIST RURAL TV STATIONS WITH DTV TRANSITION
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today signed on to legislation designed to better facilitate the digital television (DTV) transition for rural Americans. The bill would allow low-power television stations and translators to be reimbursed more quickly for analog-to-digital equipment upgrades. 
   "This legislation is vital to rural Alaska," said Senator Stevens. "It is important to ensure that rural America receives the same benefits of digital television as quickly as the nation's urban areas. Television in Alaska is not only entertainment, but also provides distance learning and important public safety announcements."
   Under current law, the Department of Commerce is not mandated to disburse reimbursement payments for the low-power TV and translator upgrade program until after October 2010, which is 20 months after the DTV Transition deadline of February 17, 2009. The delay in reimbursements could slow the analog-to-digital upgrades of low-power TV stations and translators in rural areas.
   The measure was originally sponsored by Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine).
