CONGRESS APPROVES AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR ALASKA
  Congress today approved the omnibus spending bill, which includes funding for the Department of Agriculture. The legislation funds a number of important programs that benefit Alaska, and particularly rural communities and villages. Much of this agriculture and rural development funding for Alaska was secured at the request of Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska).
   The State will receive $25 million** to enhance rural Alaska sanitation systems under the Rural Community Advancement Program. This is a continuation of funding received over the past two years and is bolstered this year by a $13.75 million national program to provide technical assistance for rural water systems. In addition, the Denali Commission will receive $437,000 to address deficiencies in solid waste disposal sites which threaten to contaminate rural drinking water supplies. 
   "Alaska faces many unique challenges, but perhaps none greater than bringing our villages and small communities into the 21st century," said Senator Stevens. "This effort has spanned several decades and continues with the passage of this year's spending bill. These funds help ensure that Alaskans have access to the same basic water and sewage systems that Americans in the Lower 48 take for granted. Without this assistance, rural Alaskans are at an increased risk of disease and sickness. Clean drinking water and proper waste removal are important building blocks to healthy communities."
   Alaska will benefit from other nationwide programs contained in the bill. Rural areas with extreme unemployment or severe economic depression will be eligible for a $14 million nationwide program to provide construction funds for facilities within these communities. To combat rising energy costs in the most remote regions, $20 million is appropriated for high energy cost grants. This program will provide grants and loans to utilities to provide low cost service to rural and small communities. The Denali Commission will receive at least half of this funding.
   The Appropriations Committee, recognizing Alaska's short construction period, included language to extend funds for housing projects. Generally, funds not obligated by September 30, 2008, would be forfeited. However, under this bill, the committee extends the deadline for the State to September 30, 2009.
   In addition, Congress approved funding for the following Alaska programs and projects:
