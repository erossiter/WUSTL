SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE APPROVES NATIONAL OCEAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM ACT
  Today, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation approved S. 39, the National Ocean Exploration Program Act, by unanimous consent. Sens.  
 Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), the Co-Chairmen of the Senate Commerce Committee, introduced the bill, which would establish a national program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to conduct interdisciplinary ocean exploration voyages in partnership with other federal agencies and academic institutions. 
   The program also gives priority attention to deep ocean regions and promotes the development of improved oceanographic research, communication, navigation, and data collection systems.
   Additionally, S. 39 establishes an exploration technology and infrastructure task force among agencies and non-governmental entities to facilitate technology sharing and authorizes interagency financing and increased appropriations of $45 million for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2011 and $55 million for each fiscal year 2012 through 2017. 
   There were no amendments offered.
