SEN. STEVENS SUPPORTS KULIS AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE REALIGNMENT
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) on Tuesday, Jan. 30, announced his support for the realignment of Kulis Air National Guard Base and the Alaska Air Guard's 176th Wing to Elmendorf Air Force Base.  
   "I support this new partnership between the Air Force and the Alaska Air National Guard. Units from Kulis have served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside their active duty counterparts, and this realignment initiative will pay dividends as our nation prepares for the future," Senator Stevens said. "The Air Force and Alaska National Guard will work together to develop a mutual basing plan that will accommodate the requirements of both the 176th Wing from Kulis and Elmendorf's 3rd Wing. Airmen from Kulis will soon have direct access to many of the new facilities Elmendorf has to offer. This will allow the Alaska National Guard to better complete its mission." 
   In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that elements of the National Guard, Reserve, and Active Duty Air Force integrate air power in Alaska. The commission determined the best way to achieve this would be to move units and aircraft from Kulis Air National Guard Base to Elmendorf Air Force Base. The realignment will take up to four years and involve 20 military construction projects to further expand the base at Elmendorf.
