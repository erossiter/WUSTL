SEN. STEVENS COSPONSORS BILL TO ENHANCE G.I. BENEFITS
  U.S. Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has joined a bipartisan group of 14 Senators in introducing S. 2575, the Montgomery G.I. Bill Educational Assistance Transferability Act of 2008. The legislation expands the eligibility of service members to transfer Montgomery G.I. Bill education benefits to immediate family members.  
  "Giving members of your family an opportunity to go to college is part of the American Dream. I would not have completed college without the G.I. bill, and allowing veterans who earn benefits to share them with their loved ones can make a big difference for these families," said Senator Stevens. "This is a bipartisan bill that Congress should send to the President as soon as possible."
  If enacted, this legislation will immediately allow all service members eligible for the G.I. Bill to transfer their earned educational funds to spouses or children. G.I. benefits generally cover 36 months of education at a value of about $40,000. Today, 97 percent of eligible service members enroll, but only 70 percent actually use the benefit, with very few using the entire amount. S. 2576 will enable soldiers to make full use of this earned benefit by transferring it to their immediate family.
  Sponsors of this legislation are asking the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders to bypass the committee process and have the full Senate approve this measure as quickly as possible.
