SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS EFFORT TO SUSTAIN ALASKA'S PUBLIC BROADCASTING PROGRAMS
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today applauded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for its efforts to ensure Alaska Public Media has the necessary funding to sustain a variety of original programming, including Alaska Public Radio's popular program "AK."  
   CPB will immediately release the remaining $175,000 of its original $570,000 contract to Alaska Public Media. CPB will also provide an additional $380,000 specifically for "AK" program costs and acquisitions. Pending Alaska Public Media board approval, these additional funds should keep "AK" on the air for the next 18 months, through March 2008. 
   "I was disturbed to learn that Alaska Public Media planned to cut staff and original programming due to a lack of funds," said Senator Stevens. "For Alaskans, programs like 'AK' are not just good entertainment; they provide critical news and information to those in the far corners of our state. My staff has been working with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and it is clear that the Corporation understands the importance of these programs in Alaska. I was pleased to receive the news that CPB will make additional funding available to Alaska's public broadcasting entities." 
   For over three decades, Senator Stevens has worked to secure funding for public broadcasting in Alaska. During his final year as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens secured more than $400 million for CPB through Fiscal Year 2007. In Fiscal Year 2008, CPB will also be funded at the $400 million level.
