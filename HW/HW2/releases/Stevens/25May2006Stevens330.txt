SEN. STEVENS APPLAUDS HOUSE PASSAGE OF ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE BILL
  Today, by a vote of 225 to 201, the U.S. House of Representatives approved H.R. 5429, the American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act. Introduced by House Resources Committee Chairman Richard W. Pombo (R-Calif.), H.R. 5429 allows oil and gas exploration and development on 2,000 acres of the Arctic Coastal Plain.  
   Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) applauded the passage of H.R. 5429. "A majority in both Houses of Congress - and 70% of all Americans - support environmentally-sensitive exploration and development on the Arctic Coastal Plain," he said. "Developing this area's vast resource potential will help stabilize energy prices, spur economic growth, and enhance our national security. I applaud the House of Representatives' passage of this important legislation." 
   The American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will enable the exploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources in the Arctic Coastal Plain. The Coastal Plain is believed to be the 2nd largest oil field ever discovered in North America, capable of producing 1 million barrels of oil per day. The National Defense Council estimates development of the Coastal Plain will create between 700,000 and 1 million American jobs.
