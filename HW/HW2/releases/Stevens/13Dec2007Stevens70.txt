CONGRESS PASSES SEN. STEVENS PROVISION TO ALLOW COMMERCIAL PILOTS TO FLY UNTIL AGE 65
  The United States Senate late last night unanimously approved the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act (H.R. 4343), a bill that will allow commercial airline pilots to fly until age 65. It is identical to a provision sponsored by Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) that was approved in September as part of the Department of Transportation Appropriations bill. 
   Since 1960, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations have specified that commercial airline pilots must retire upon reaching 60 years of age. The FAA announced earlier this year that it would begin a process to raise the retirement age of commercial pilots to age 65. By passing this Stevens-championed bill, Congress bypasses the agency rulemaking process and codifies this new "Age 65" rule.
   "Alaska is losing experienced pilots every day due to the FAA's outdated 'Age 60' rule," said Senator Stevens, who has long advocated for increasing pilots' retirement age. "I am pleased that Congress finally approved this legislation because it is important to ensure our most senior and seasoned pilots remain in the system."
   The Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act will specifically:
   * Raise commercial airline pilot retirement age to 65;
   * Sunset the "Age 60" rule and require the FAA to implement the new retirement standard immediately upon enactment;
   * Allow both pilot and co-pilot at commercial airlines to be up to 65 years old for domestic operations;
   * Subject international flights to the international standard that the pilot can be over 60 if the co-pilot is 60 or under;
   * Allow companies and unions to work out compliance issues regarding pensions and benefits; and
   * Require GAO to issue a report on the impact of this provision on aviation safety within 24 months.
   The House of Representative approved the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act on December 11. The bill now proceeds to the President for his signature.
