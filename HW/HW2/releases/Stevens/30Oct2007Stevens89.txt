CONGRESS PASSES SEVEN-YEAR INTERNET TAX BAN
  The House of Representatives today joined the United States Senate in approving a seven-year extension of the Internet tax moratorium. Congress established the moratorium in 1998 to protect consumers by preventing states and localities from taxing Internet access. It is set to expire on November 1, 2007.  
  "I am pleased that the House passed the bipartisan Senate compromise that extends the moratorium for another seven years, which is the longest moratorium to date," said Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). "Since the tax moratorium was first adopted, tremendous investment, growth, and innovation in broadband deployment has occurred. Affordable access to the Internet is particularly important to small businesses in rural communities in Alaska and across our nation. Passage of this bill will ensure that the Internet remains tax-free for many years to come." 
  The moratorium affects many services that American consumers have come to rely on, including wireless transmission devices, cable modems, and Internet service over phone lines. Congress has twice extended the moratorium to prohibit state and local taxes on consumer Internet access. 
  The legislation now proceeds to the President for his consideration.
