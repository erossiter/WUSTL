ON RECORD: SEN. STEVENS' STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF FEB. 12
  On the Democrats' refusal to allow Republican-sponsored amendments to bills being debated on the Senate floor  
   "This is a defining moment for the Senate?.If the Majority of one can go to the House and negotiate a bill and bring it back and say 'there are not going to be any amendments"?the Senate is totally irrelevant." (2/15/07) 
   More on the Democrats' refusal to allow Republican-sponsored amendments 
  "It is not right. It is not the Senate. I do not intend to stand by and see the Senate lose its role under the Constitution to be the second House of the Congress. This is not a rubberstamp for the House. That is what we will be if we follow the intention of the Majority Leader now." (2/15/07) 
   On why the Senate should be able to vote on the Gregg Amendment, which expresses total support for troops and funding for them so long as they are deployed 
   "I believe the message we are trying to send on this Iraq resolution is wrong. I think it is harming the people who represent us in Iraq and Afghanistan?Our people need support, and we need to be able to articulate the reasons why we support them." (2/15/07) 
   On the importance of working on a bipartisan basis in the Senate 
   "You get more done when you work with the minority than when you drive the minority into the corner and make them a solid, solid force. And history has shown that. The Senate works on a bipartisan basis. We represent 50 different states. There is no reason to have a political machine in the Senate. That is what you are seeing." (2/15/07)
