SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS SEAFOOD SAFETY
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Senator Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii) today introduced legislation to improve seafood safety in the United States. The bill would establish a federal program that would ensure commercially distributed seafood in America is fit for consumption. 
   "Wild-caught Alaska seafood has consistently set the worldwide standard for quality and sustainability," said Senator Stevens. "However, more than 80 percent of the seafood consumed in the United States is imported from countries whose quality standards are nowhere near those applied in Alaska. This bill would help bring those standards up and protect the health and safety of all Americans."
   This measure would expand the authority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) so the agency could work closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to test seafood imports, inspect foreign seafood facilities, and track domestic seafood shipments. The bill would also expand the authority of the FDA to hold seafood imports that are suspected of being contaminated for further testing. Funding to implement the program has been authorized at $15 million through 2013.
   Last summer, the FDA issued a broad import control order to restrict all Chinese farm-raised seafood entering America. This seafood contained residues of drugs not approved in the United States.
