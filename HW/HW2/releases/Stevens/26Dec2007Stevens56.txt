SEN. STEVENS SECURES OCEANS-RELATED FUNDING FOR ALASKA
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) played a key role in securing oceans-related funding for Alaska and other coastal states. By authoring several provisions in the Congress-passed omnibus spending bill, Senator Stevens continued his efforts to ensure that America's oceans and its resources remain healthy and sustainable.
   As part of the spending bill, Congress adopted Senator Stevens' amendment that would create a list of fishing vessels and vessel owners engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, a destructive practice that threatens to deplete important fish stocks around the world. The legislation also enables the Secretary of Commerce to take appropriate action against listed vessels and owners in accordance with U.S. and international fisheries and trade laws. 
   "This amendment fills a critical gap that exists in our efforts to combat global IUU fishing," said Senator Stevens. "The provision will ensure that our fishing industry can quickly and easily identify IUU 'blacklisted' boats and avoid conducting business with them. This will prove to be one of many tools needed for discouraging - and ultimately ending - IUU fishing."
   The omnibus spending bill provided appropriations to National Science Foundation (NSF), which includes $57 million for U.S. Coast Guard and NSF icebreaking services, and funds the Alaska region research vessel to be stationed in Seward. The President's budget funded this project at $42 million. Senator Stevens also secured $7.3 million for Magnuson-Stevens Act implementation and $2.3 million for the International Arctic Research Center, within the U.S. Department of Commerce. In addition, Senator Stevens successfully added funds to the President's request for crab stock rehabilitation for Kodiak and the Pribilof Islands, bringing the total to $1 million for the project.
   Other Stevens' championed programs funded by the omnibus at his request include:
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   * $67 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (Alaska can apply for grants within this fund)
   * $64 million in Coastal Zone Management Grants (Alaska is eligible to apply for funds)
   * $26.3 million for the NOAA Ocean Observation System
   * $11.7 million in competitive research grants for the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (University of Alaska can apply for grants)
   * $25.7 million for Regional Councils and Fisheries Commissions (North Pacific Fisheries Management Council will qualify for funding)
   * $1.3 million for Alaskan ocean current and tide data and ocean surveys
   * $940,000 for coast vulnerability studies due to climate change
   * $1.3 million for Alaska marine debris removal and high seas driftnet detection
   * $202,000 for the Alaska Sea Otter and Steller Sea Lion Commission
   * $141,000 for the Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission

   * $188,000 for the Gulf of Alaska Coastal Communities Coalition
   * $352,000 for Cook Inlet Beluga research
   * $1.6 million for National Weather Service data buoys in Alaska
   The bill also funds a variety of marine projects and programs that were included in the FY 2008 President's budget request, such as $7.5 million for National Marine Fisheries Service activities in Alaska, $1.48 million for the Alaska Seal and Steller Sea Lion research program, and $23 million for strengthening tsunami warning systems in the U.S.
