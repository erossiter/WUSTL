SEN. STEVENS COMMENDS DR. SYUN-ICHI AKASOFU'S RESEARCH ON GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Senate Commerce Committee Chairman, applauded Dr. Syun-Ichi Akasofu of the International Arctic Research Center for his work and research into global climate change issues. Following are the remarks made by Sen. Stevens today on the Senate floor:  
   Mr. President, The Voice of the Anchorage Times printed an article authored by my good friend, Dr. Syun-Ichi Akasofu. Dr. Akasofu is director of the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks. He is one of the world's leading experts on Arctic science and global climate change. 
   Given the interest that some of our colleagues have recently shown in this subject, I ask that Dr. Akasofu's article be entered into the Congressional Record. 
   I trust Dr. Akasofu's research and opinions. He has published more than 550 articles and is the author or co-author of 10 books. His work has shown that he is an expert in Arctic research. It has shown that while there is little doubt the earth's temperature is changing, there is still much debate about what is causing this change. 
   In his article, Dr. Akasofu says that the "[o]ne thing we do know is that there is no definitive scientific proof that all of the present global warming is attributable to humans, or caused by the greenhouse effect." 
   Some of the changes we are seeing are the most recent stage in a historic evolution. In Alaska, our glaciers have been receding since 1800, long before the advent of so-called greenhouse gases. 
   In the past 100 years, the sun has been giving off additional energy, which is likely responsible for one-third of the .6 degree Celsius increase in global temperature.
