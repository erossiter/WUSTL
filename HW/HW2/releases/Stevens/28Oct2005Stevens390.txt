SENATE PASSES COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005
  Late yesterday, the United States Senate approved the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2005, which was co-sponsored by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
   The bill reauthorizes the United States Coast Guard for Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 at a level of $8.2 billion and for FY 2007 at a level of $8.8 billion, not including funding relating to Hurricane Katrina. This authorization will enable the Coast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions, including search and rescue missions, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection. This bill also funds homeland security missions related to ports, waterways, and coastal security.  
   The 17th District of the Coast Guard is responsible for the waters around Alaska. Their activities include performing search and rescue missions, protecting the environment, and maintaining Alaska's waterways, specifically by icebreaking. 
   The Act authorizes funds for a pilot project allowing the Coast Guard in Alaska to utilize a satellite tracking system to conduct long-range tracking of up to 2,000 vessels. This project will be conducted with the assistance of the Marine Exchange of Alaska, a non-profit organization established to serve the Alaska maritime community by providing communications and services to ensure safe, secure, efficient, and environmentally responsible maritime operations. This partnership will use a satellite communications system to transmit data in an effort to aid the Coast Guard in responding to maritime emergencies and threats to maritime security. 
   "With satellite tracking, the Coast Guard will be able to better serve our mariners by locating vessels in trouble. Hundreds of search and rescues have been performed in the waters off of Alaska. This technology will allow for these life-saving activities to be conducted more quickly and easily," said Stevens. 
   Also contained in the bill is language authorizing the Marine Vessel and Cold Water Safety Education program that allows the Coast Guard to continue to use existing agreements with organizations that provide marine vessel safety training and cold water immersion education to fishermen and children. The Alaska Marine Safety Education Association (AMSEA) benefits from this initiative. AMSEA has trained more than 600 instructors and 200 teachers to provide cold water safety education to more than 100,000 school children, commercial fishermen, recreational boaters, and agency personnel. 
   The bill also included an amendment to aid the Coast Guard in helping victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
   The amendment does the following: 
   * Authorizes a supplemental $200 million for Coast Guard operations and maintenance associated with Katrina for FY 2005, as well as for the increased costs of fuel in FY 2005. 
   * Authorizes a supplemental $300 million for capital improvements for Coast Guard facilities in FY 2005, including air and vessel assets, and for equipment that needs to be replaced, including aids to navigation to ensure safe transit through shipping lanes. 
   * Officially commends the Coast Guard for its exemplary response to Hurricane Katrina and calls for the Coast Guard to play a major role in any future national emergency or natural disaster. 
   * Authorizes the Coast Guard to use its maritime safety and security teams for missions other than security missions, such as responding to natural disasters like Katrina. 
   * Directs the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General (DHS IG) to conduct an investigation into vessel charter contracts entered into by or on behalf of the U.S. Government as part of the Katrina recovery effort. This investigation will determine whether the contract price was fair, reasonable, and based on current, accurate, and complete.
