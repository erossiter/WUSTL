ON RECORD: SEN. STEVENS' STATEMENTS DURING WEEK OF JUNE 25
  On amnesty for illegal immigrants and why he voted against cloture for the Senate immigration reform bill 
   "One of the things I've been concerned about, and Senator Murkowski has been concerned about, are the amnesty provisions in this bill. We both said that we were not going to vote for a bill that contained any concept of amnesty for those who come into this country illegally? We wanted the Mexican border closed. We wanted a reason for illegal immigrants to come forward and admit they're illegal and give them an opportunity to work legally, but not to give them any rewards such as citizenship."
  On renewable energy and the development of oil and gas resources
   "I think the more you can convince people we're trying to find ways to use new technologies and new substances - alternative forms of energy - the more they will realize that as we are trying to develop those new resources and find ways to rely on them, we still have to have oil and gas to maintain us. The difficulty right now is that so many people who believe that we should turn to new technologies oppose developing any new oil and gas resources."
  On the Alaska natural gas pipeline
   "I think it should be constructed as soon as possible. If that pipeline is in place, then I think the industry, even the smaller companies, will go out and explore development of potential gas."
  On violence on television and the constitutional right to free speech
   "As a practical matter, what we've got to do is be mindful of the Constitution and do our best to put down the kind of regulation that will work. I do hope that we can achieve that. ... I hope that we can bring about some change, but I am fearful of going too far."
