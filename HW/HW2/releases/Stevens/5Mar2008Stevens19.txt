SEN. STEVENS PRESENTS 4-YEAR-OLD ALASKAN WITH NATIONAL 9-1-1 AWARD
  Last night during a ceremony sponsored by the E9-1-1 Institute, Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) presented 4-year-old North Pole resident Tony Sharpe with a national award for saving his mother's life. 
   "This year's Citizen in Action award goes to a remarkable young man from my home state, four-year old Tony Sharpe," said Senator Stevens. "Seeing his mother incapacitated, Tony called 9-1-1 and was able to guide firefighters to his apartment where they provided first aid, essentially saving her life. Tony's story reminds us all of the critical importance of 9-1-1 education."
   Tony Sharpe was recognized with a "Citizen in Action" award for his heroic efforts to save his mother after she collapsed and lost consciousness during a gallbladder attack last year. Tony had recently learned to call 9-1-1 from a book his grandmother had given him as a gift. Senator Stevens noted that the book, "It's Time to Call 9-1-1: What To Do in an Emergency," is a reminder of the important role even young children can play in saving a life.
   The award was presented on behalf of the E9-1-1 Institute, an organization devoted to increasing education and awareness about the importance of 9-1-1 and other emergency communications issues. Senator Stevens is a co-chair of the Congressional E9-1-1 Caucus and nominated Tony for the award earlier this year.
