SEN. STEVENS ENCOURAGES GREATER ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE SAFETY
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) has joined the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in promoting a new educational campaign designed to reduce the number of deaths and injuries related to the use of All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs).  
   The CPSC's campaign includes new television and radio public service announcements; the creation of www.ATVSafety.gov, a Web site for riders, parents, trainers, local and state officials, and the media; use of CPSC's Neighborhood Safety Network; and partnerships with organizations and officials dedicated to promoting ATV safety. In addition, CPSC is encouraging all riders to "take knowledge to the extreme" by participating in a training course and following core rules for safe riding. 
   "In the last decade, the number of ATVs in our country has more than tripled," said Senator Stevens, Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the CPSC. "In Alaska, we use ATVs for basic transportation. Many Alaskans use these vehicles as part of their jobs. Given the number of ATVs now being operated in our state, riders need resources like the CPSC's education campaign, which will share important information about proper riding habits." 
   The CPSC has also proposed new rules to make ATV riding safer. These include: 
   * Banning three-wheeled ATVs, which present three times the risk of injury compared to four-wheel ATVs; 
   * Making the current voluntary standard mandatory, which would require all ATVs to meet U.S. safety standards; 
   * Setting speed limitations for each youth model ATV; 
   * Requiring retailers to offer free training to all ATV purchasers and members of their immediate family; and 
   * Requiring retailers to provide purchasers with a written form that warns them about the dangers of allowing children to use adult ATVs and provides death and injury statistics related those activities. 
   "I am pleased the CPSC has undertaken a thorough review of ATV standards and safety issues," said Senator Stevens. "The CPSC, those in the ATV industry, and consumers must work together to ensure adults recognize the danger involved in placing a child on an adult-sized ATV. Many deaths and debilitating injuries can be prevented just by sharing this information." 
   From 1982 through 2004, there were nearly 6,500 deaths involving ATVs in the United States. In 2003, an estimated 740 people died in ATV incidents. About one-third of all ATV-related deaths and injuries involve children under 16 years old.
