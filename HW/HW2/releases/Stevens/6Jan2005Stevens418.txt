COMMERCE SECRETARY NOMINEE COMMITS TO VISITING ALASKA
  The Secretary of Commerce designee Carlos Gutierrez said at his Senate Commerce Committee nomination hearing yesterday that he would "be in Alaska as soon as possible."  
 Gutierrez's commitment to visit the State came as a response to an invitation from Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). The nomination hearing was Sen. Stevens' first as Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Transportation and Science Committee. 
   At the conclusion of the hearing, Senator Stevens told Mr. Gutierrez, "the only way to understand Alaska is to come see us. You have my invitation when you are Secretary to come soon. I look forward to introducing you to my State." As per his tradition, Stevens also invited Gutierrez to come fishing during his visit to the State. 
   Following the Secretary-designee's response, the Co-Chairman, Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), chided Gutierrez saying, "before proceeding with my questions, I'd like to most respectfully suggest to the Secretary-designee that when Chairman Stevens invites you to Alaska, there is only one answer - yes."
   While no specific date for the trip has been set, it will be Mr. Gutierrez's first to Alaska.
