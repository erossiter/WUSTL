SEN. STEVENS ANNOUNCES SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINEES
  Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today announced that he has nominated 30 Alaskans to the United States service academies for 2007, including 10 each to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 
   "This group of young men and women represents the very best of Alaska," said Senator Stevens. "Their desire to serve our country and their sense of patriotism is to be commended. I am confident these nominees will be up to the task if selected by the academies."
