SEN. STEVENS CONGRATULATES BALSIGER FOR BEING NAMED ACTING DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES SERVICE
  U.S. Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today congratulated Dr. Jim Balsiger for being appointed Acting Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Dr. Balsiger succeeds former director, Bill Hogarth, who retired in late December. 
   "Throughout his distinguished 31-year career he has served in many NMFS posts, culminating in his direction of the Alaska region for the past eight years," said Senator Stevens. "He has always been a key proponent of the scientific management of fisheries. Under his leadership, the Alaskan fishing industry is not only the most productive in the country, but it also has no overfished commercial stocks. Jim will bring these successes to NOAA fisheries nationwide."
   As Acting Director of NMFS, Dr. Balsiger is charged with directing federal scientists and regulators responsible for managing commercial and recreational ocean fishing. The agency is also responsible for protecting marine mammals and sea turtles, as well as their habitats.
   "Jim's appointment is evidence of President Bush's commitment to healthy, sustainable fisheries in the United States," said Senator Stevens.
   Dr. Balsinger's previous assignments include Regional Science and Research Director for the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, after serving as Deputy Director from 1991 through 1995. Prior to 1991, he managed a fish stock assessment program within the Center's resource ecology and fisheries management division.
   In 2002, President Bush awarded Dr. Balsiger a Meritorious Award for superior management of U.S. government programs and for noteworthy achievement in public service.
