SEN. STEVENS SHARES CONCERNS ON PROPOSED CRUISE SHIP RULE WITH SECRETARY CHERTOFF
  Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) today met with Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to discuss U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CPB) proposed rule under the Passenger Vessel Services Act. This interpretative rule could potentially impact cruise ships making stops in Alaska. 
   In the meeting, Senator Stevens highlighted the importance of the cruise ship industry to tourism-dependant communities in Alaska. Secretary Chertoff assured Senator Stevens that he would look into the issue.
   "The federal government already shut down the timber industry in Southeast Alaska," said Senator Stevens. "Our economy relies heavily on tourism now, and this rule could have devastating impacts on costal communities where cruise ships have ports-of-call."
   The meeting with Secretary Chertoff today follows Senator Stevens' submission of comments for the docket regarding the proposed DHS rule.
   In his comments, Senator Stevens wrote: "I urge you to carefully consider the significant negative impact the proposed rule, if applied broadly, could have on my State. Cruise ships bring a large share of the visitors to Alaska each year, supporting hundreds of local businesses and greatly benefiting Alaska's economy. Since the proposed rule was intended to address developments in the Hawaii cruise market, where foreign-flagged operators compete with U.S.-flagged carriers, it would be appropriate for the rule to apply only to Hawaiian cruises."
