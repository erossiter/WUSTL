following opinion article published in the Washington Times on September 24  The Washington Times  The new Hillarycare  There is a GOP alternative   September 24  2007 Monday   By Robert Goldberg  Special to The Washington Times   Section  Oped  A19 And now a few kind words about most recent model of Sen  Hillary Clinton s health plan  Yes  you read that right  There are some good  even important features  about her American Health Choices Plan  That they are there means that Republican presidential candidates are going to have to do a lot better to compete against Hillary in the health care department  Mrs  Clinton is perfectly willing to let Sen  Barack Obama and former Sen  John Edwards  etc  pander to the far left of her party on health care  She has learned bitterly from that mistake  and so this time she stole from the conservative playbook by refusing to herd people into regional health plans as did the Health Security Act  President Clinton s unsuccessful 1993 health care initiative   Not only can Americans keep the health care they have  but they can take it with them from job to job  And just so we are clear  she is telling everyone there is no new bureaucracy  only a public private partnership  Not only is this version of the Clinton health care express a hybrid  but it leaves the heavy load of Michael Moore s government run health system in Hollywood so it will run more efficiently in the general election  To be sure  it also runs on a lot of hot air  The numbers don t add up  Mrs  Clinton asserts her plan will cost  110 billion a year  But that doesn t count the  50 billion in SCHIP spending for families with incomes of up to  80 000 a year in Democratic congressional proposals  While she estimates that computerizing health records and adding an undefined menu of preventive care will generate  300 billion in savings  you first have to pay for them and the Congressional Budget Office rarely scores an expenditure as saving money  She buries the additional cost of forcing insurance companies to cover people who are buying insurance just to get a procedure paid for  That will drive up premiums and dump people into the waiting arms of government run health plans  And since you get the same rate whether you are sick or healthy  whether you take care of yourself or not  the savings of preventive care are pretty much out the window  In a matter of years  Medicare and Medicare will be the dumping ground for most of us as private sector premiums of one size fits all plans that we have to sign up for become pretty much unaffordable  At that point Mrs  Clinton s Best Practice Institute will become Central Command for rationing and price controls  But much of that deconstruction is beside the point if the Republicans fail to come up with a bold health care proposal of their own  a note to former Massachusetts Gov  Mitt Romney  a PowerPoint presentation doesn t qualify   Such a proposal should make health care affordable  convenient and continuous  The GOP is locked into an esoteric debate over tax credits and tax deductions no one except Kool Aid drinkers care about  In the past  Republicans have always used a mix of credits and deductions to promote consumer choice and investment in housing  education and child care  Now  all of a sudden  if you support health care tax credits you are no longer conservative  To quote Ronald Reagan  Those who would sacrifice principle to theory  those who worship only the god of political  social and economic abstractions  ignoring the realities of everyday life  They are not conservatives  At least one group of Republican lawmakers realize that the goal of policy making is to advance ideas that increase opportunity instead of maintaining loyalty among ideological shock troops  Sens  Richard Burr  North Carolina Republican  Tom Coburn  Oklahoma Republican  Mel Martinez  Florida Republican  and Bob Corker  Tennessee Republican have developed the Every American Insured Health Act  It take the tax subsidy for health insurance that now goes to corporations and give it individuals in the form of a tax credit  The credit could be deposited automatically in an account much like a health savings account or flexible spending account to buy insurance or medical care anywhere in the United States tailored to their budget and medical needs  For the first time health plans could reward doctors for preventing disease and compete for customers by keeping them healthy and happy  The legislation reflects a Republican vision for health care that offers people choice and hope  To that end  the senators should introduce their proposal in the wake of an anticipated presidential veto of the current SCHIP bill  Add on a provision to let Medicaid and SCHIP families convert their coverage into cash for private insurance  As a kicker they should add a provision giving people in the Veterans Administration  VA  health system the right to enroll in private plans  After all  as Mrs  Clinton told John Stossel of ABC News early this year  the VA health system is a model for health care everywhere  It will lose  but let the Democrats   and some Republicans   vote against personalized  convenient and portable universal health care for all Americans  There was bipartisan opposition to the Kemp Roth tax cut proposal prior to President Reagan taking office  Defeat should be no deterrent to a bold idea  Mrs  Clinton s GOP opponent will need a uniquely American health care system to counter her slimmed down version of Michael Moore s socialist solution  The Every American Insured Health Act can be the foundation of a forward looking response  Simply trying to scare Americans about Hillarycare is not enough  Robert Goldberg is vice
