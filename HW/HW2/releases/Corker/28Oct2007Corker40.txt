following news article published in the Knoxville News Sentinel  Knoxville News Sentinel  Bob Corker  Always on the run  Freshman senator finds balance in hectic U S  capital  purpose in policy   By Michael Collins   Sunday  October 28  2007   WASHINGTON   Daybreak is settling in slowly over the city when Bob Corker sets out on his morning run     He takes off from his apartment in downtown Washington a little past 6 30  sprints a few blocks through mostly empty streets  then turns right onto the National Mall     In the distance  he can see the obelisk that is the Washington Monument  To his back  the dome of the U S  Capitol rises against a sky of pink clouds that turn burnt orange as darkness gives way to daylight     The three mile jog is a morning ritual for Corker  a rare moment of solitude before the intrusion of the hectic workday ahead     It has been a year since the former Chattanooga mayor won one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country and nearly 10 months since he was sworn into office  But Corker hasn t slowed down yet  As Tennessee s newest senator and only freshman Republican senator elected in 2006  he is always on the run     In his first few weeks on the job  Corker dashed from one meeting to another  sometimes attending 25 or more a day  The nonstop pace left him feeling frustrated and ineffective     I didn t feel like I was making any difference at all  he said     He s more organized now  He has learned that  instead of trying to sit in on one meeting after another  his time is better spent identifying issues that may come up down the road  He and his staff then spend a lot of time on policy briefings on those subjects so that whenever the debate begins  he s ready     It s really like getting an MBA in many different topics  Corker said     It was an important lesson in the way the Senate works  one of many Corker has learned on the job     Around May  he began to feel more comfortable in the role of senator and started to sense that he was engaged in issues in a way in which he could make a difference     A Republican  he predictably stood with President Bush during some battles  most notably the war in Iraq     Not long after he took office  he was summoned to the White House for a couple of meetings about the war  Though the administration s explanation for some of its policy decisions left him somewhat underwhelmed  he ultimately went along with Bush s plan to send in more troops  During the next few months  he urged skeptics to give the change in military strategy time to work     On other issues  Corker has been a bit of a rebel     He backed an energy bill that his fellow Republicans tried to kill  He went against the White House and supported the expansion of a health insurance program for children     He tangled with the administration again over TennCare  the state s health care program for low income children  pregnant women and people with disabilities  He got personally involved in negotiations with the federal government over a waiver that was needed to renew the program  When he felt that the administration was dragging its feet  he played hardball  halting confirmation proceedings for all of Bush s nonmilitary nominees until the matter was satisfactorily resolved     Now that he has several months of on the job experience and is beginning to know how Washington works  Corker says he feels more privileged to serve in the Senate than he did the day he was sworn in     The reason is  every day that goes by  I see how the policies that we put into place don t just affect Tennessee and our country  he said  They affect the entire world     The demands of the job    To understand what he means  just follow him around for a day     On one recent Tuesday  less than an hour after he finished up his morning run  Corker was sitting down with other senators at a bipartisan breakfast meeting  The subject was the farm bill  a controversial law that is up for renewal this year  The law is supposed to govern the nation s farm policy but has been expanded over the years to take in other programs such as agriculture trade  conservation and food stamps     We went through the farm bill and talked about everything but farming  an amused Corker informed a small gathering of Tennesseans an hour later     The group of constituents was visiting Washington and had stopped in for coffee and doughnuts with Corker and the state s senior senator  Lamar Alexander  The senators host the monthly Tennessee Tuesday reception for whoever from back home happens to be in Washington at the time     Next on Corker s schedule was a closed door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  where he and other lawmakers on the panel received an update on security in the Persian Gulf     Later in the day  there was a weekly policy luncheon with other Republican senators  a meeting with a couple of health care administrators from Chattanooga  and a briefing with a GOP task force that is working on health care issues     Between meetings  Corker was back in his office near the Capitol  going line by line over a letter that would go out to 500 of his constituents  Corker estimates that his office has sent out more than 180 000 pieces of correspondence since he was sworn in  He personally signs off on each one     I think it s important for people to have a relationship with their senator  to know their senator  to know what they are like  he said  And I think it s very important for them to be able to communicate directly with their senator     To that end  Corker set out in February to tour all of the state s 95 counties  He started out in Sevier County and finished up two weeks ago with a town hall meeting in Monroe County  He went wherever he could draw a crowd   at Rotary Club meetings  at popular little diners  at county courthouses     He heard farmers talk about the freeze last winter and the drought last summer  He heard about the war in Iraq  And he got lots of questions from people who were just curious about how a former mayor was adjusting to life in Congress     I truly enjoyed doing it  Corker said  adding that the conversation was good for the state and good for him as a senator  It s the thing that keeps you from developing a beltway mentality  he said     Data and debates    Those who know Corker best doubt that he ll ever succumb to Potomac Fever  the malady that afflicts some politicians and causes them to lose touch with reality once they arrive in Washington     Oftentimes  people will go to Washington and they feel like they ve just got to be in the headlines and be on every talk show the minute they get there  said Susan Williams  a longtime friend of Corker and former chairwoman of the Tennessee Republican Party  Bob is a real different person from that prototypical politician  Bob  he is really a man who likes to make things happen     While Corker could hardly be labeled a maverick  he is clearly his own guy  said Jimmy Haslam  who was Corker s roommate at the University of Tennessee and served as his finance chairman during last year s campaign     He likes data  said Haslam  chief executive officer of Pilot Corp   which runs a chain of convenience stores and travel centers  If you ve ever been in a meeting with him  Bob will ask a tremendous amount of questions to make sure he has a good grasp of the issues  He s not the kind of guy to get bogged down in minutia  But on the other hand  he likes facts and details     He also likes using facts and details to persuade others to his way of thinking  Corker tells a story about how he passionately argued for a health care proposal during a luncheon with other Senate Republicans     As I walked out  this senator from the Northeast says   Corker  I wish that you would quit tormenting us with logic    Corker recalled  And I thought   This is exactly what I came here to do       What he didn t come to Washington to do  he said  was get his name on bills  While he has signed on to several pieces of legislation authored by other senators  he has been the lead sponsor on just a handful of bills  the most noteworthy being a proposal that would guarantee all Americans access to affordable health insurance through the free market     I m not going to be a guy that presents a bill on the floor every week  Corker said  That s just not who I am  I feel like much more of a policy person      I want to shape the direction of this country  What I don t want to do is just law it to death     Assessing the new senator    Like any politician  Corker has his critics     Wade Munday  a spokesman for the Tennessee Democratic Party  said Corker preached moderation and bipartisanship on the campaign trail but has practiced partisan politics in office     As an example  he cited Corker s refusal to back an amendment by Sen  Jim Webb  D Va   that would have given troops more time at home between deployments to Iraq  Democrats lobbied Corker to support the proposal  and  at one point  he seemed to be seriously considering doing so  In the end  however  he refused  and the amendment went down to defeat     Corker also caught flak from some Republicans for voting to increase funding for the State Children s Health Insurance Program by  35 billion over the next five years  The White House had wanted a  5 billion increase  and President Bush vetoed the bill     For Corker  the decision to support the larger increase wasn t a difficult one     I thought it was the right thing to do  he said  The Bush administration absolutely knew that  5 billion was not enough to fund the program  I found that to be somewhat disingenuous to say they wanted SCHIP to be extended but not fund it with enough money     Besides  If I have to make a call   a close call   on something  I m going to err on the side of people  of low income citizens in particular  having access to health care  he said     Corker s performance in office has earned him praise from some unexpected places     Gov  Phil Bredesen  a Democrat  said Corker s involvement in the TennCare negotiations and his decision to stand up to the Bush administration was pivotal in securing the federal waiver for the program     Bob Corker  I think because of his previous service as  Tennessee s  chief financial officer  just knew the subject forwards and backwards  Bredesen told reporters in Nashville earlier this month  He absolutely laid down on the track  We would not have nearly as good a deal today without Bob Corker laying down on the track the way that he did     Likewise  Brian Harris  president of Tennessee Right to Life  recently wrote Corker a letter thanking him for supporting anti abortion issues in the Senate     The organization had endorsed one of Corker s opponents in the GOP primary last year and refused to back Corker even after he won the Republican nomination  Harris even went so far as to call him pro abortion  partly because of comments Corker made in 1994 that he personally opposed abortion but didn t think it was the government s place to get involved     Corker now says he was wrong and that he opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother s life is in danger  And in the Senate  he has supported legislation backed by the anti abortion movement  For instance  he co sponsored an amendment that prohibited federal funds from going to organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning     He has not only voted for life  he has led on the pro life issue  Harris said  That is the kind of leadership Tennessee Right to Life and the state s pro life movement are looking for     Ask Corker how long he d like to stay in the Senate and he insists he s not looking that far into the future  He won t face re election for another five years  so for now  he said  his focus is on what he can accomplish in the next year     I see this next year as a year to say   Look  we ve laid a tremendous foundation  Let s really focus on some areas where we can make a greater difference than we have made in this last year      It s exciting to me to think about having a full year behind us   2007 The E W  Scripps Co
