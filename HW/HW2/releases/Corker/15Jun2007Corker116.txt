                                                                             Corker Clean Fuel Amendment Provides Additional Alternatives to Gasoline                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Friday  June 15  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senator Bob Corker  R TN  today introduced an amendment that expands the renewable fuel standard to allow additional clean fuels to displace the use of gasoline     If we are serious about energy security and reducing our gasoline consumption and dependence on foreign oil  we need to encourage a variety of fuels and technologies and not pick winners and losers by specifying particular fuels  said Corker  Limiting ourselves to one type of alternative is not good policy     H R  6  the energy bill currently under consideration in the Senate  would increase the countrys renewable fuel requirement to 8 5 billion gallons in 2008 and 36 billion gallons by the year 2022  and limits the eligible fuels that can be used to meet that standard to certain biofuels  including corn based ethanol     The U S  is currently only capable of producing about 15 billion gallons of ethanol from corn  which can only displace about 10 percent of the gasoline Americans consume     The Corker amendment expands that renewable fuel standard by adding a clean fuel definition so that any fuel meeting certain criteria may be a part of the 36 billion gallon mandate  The amendment does not replace the underlying fuels that currently qualify     The amendment defines a clean fuel as a fuel not derived from crude oil that has greenhouse gas emissions lower than gasoline  In addition  a clean fuel must either achieve reductions in harmful air pollutants or cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to gasoline     I am proud of the role Tennessee is playing with advancing the research and development of biofuels with the Tennessee Biofuels Initiative  a program developed by the University of Tennessee to position our state as a leader in the nation s efforts toward reduced dependence on petroleum  said Corker  They have set a goal of working with Tennessee farmers to produce one billion gallons of Grassoline annually  This level of production would replace approximately 30 percent of Tennessee s present petroleum consumption     Tennessee will play an important role in the future of biofuels  and I am confident that my amendment will create even greater opportunities for innovation in Tennessee and across the country
