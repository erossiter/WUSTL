                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Monday  August 13  2007  U S  Senator Bob Corker was mentioned in the followingarticle thatappearedin the Tennessee Journal on August 13  2007     The Tennessee Journal  Miserable at first  Corker now finds Senate invigorating   Vol  33  No 32  August 13  2007    Seven months into his six year term  U S  Sen  Bob Corker seems to be hitting his stride  He is serving on two high profile committees  Foreign Relations and Armed Services  and immersing himself in major  complex issues     And hes already managed to upset the White House  his party  and numerous constituents  voting Aug  2 for a  35 billion expansion of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  funded with a 61 cent hike in the federal cigarette tax  Of course  he would be taking some heat on that issue no matter how he voted     Back in Tennessee for the August recess  Corker held a series of town hall meetings last week and seemed almost to wear the SCHIP vote as a Purple Heart  Acknowledging that he didnt like some of the bills provisions and that it had been a tough vote  he nonetheless defended it as in the best interest of the country  his state  and children  He clearly is relishing his job  For someone who a year ago was running as an outsider  he seems to have caught on nicely to the rules  rituals  lingo  and acronyms of whats been called the worlds greatest deliberative body     But it wasnt that way from the beginning  He concedes he was not very happy his first month in D C  The Republicans had lost control of the Senate to the Democrats in the 06 election  in which Corker was the only newly elected Republican  making him dead last in seniority  He found himself attending meetings all day yet barely scratching the surface of the issues  And he asked himself why he had spent two years seeking such a job     Old question  Others had asked the question before  When Corker first announced his intention to run for senator  an oft stated misgiving in Republican circles was that he was better suited for an executive role  A successful entrepreneur and businessman who had served as state finance commissioner and mayor of Chattanooga  Corker had no legislative background     A lot of the talk  naturally  was stirred up by supporters of Ed Bryant and Van Hilleary  Corkers opponents for the 2006 Republican nomination  who wanted him to take on the incumbent Democratic governor  Phil Bredesen  rather than pursue the Senate seat being vacated by Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Nashville      Before jumping into the contest in late 2004  Corker himself wondered if the Senate was the right fit for his skills  Frist assured him that with hard work he could soon be making an impact     Change in approach  As someone with a CEO background who was accustomed to feeling on top of situations  Corker was frustrated when he reached the Senate and its seemingly non stop meetings  which he considered insufficiently productive     After a few weeks  he stepped back from it all and adopted a new approach  He decided to focus on the most important issues on the political horizon  particularly those on which he might have an impact  immersing himself in them until he understood their intricacies  He discovered that experts in virtually any field were willing to come to the office of a United States senator and talk     The issue with the most immediacy was the war in Iraq  He met with Gen  David Petraeus  the U S  commander  and other experts and spent time on the ground in the war torn country  He decided to oppose congressional efforts to impose a time frame for U S  troop withdrawal  arguing the best course was to give President Bushs troop surge time to work and then assess the situation in September  He will travel to Iraq again this month to prepare for the debate in September  when Petraeus is to give a status report     Contest watched  Corkers general election race with Democrat Harold Ford Jr  of Memphis was  to say the least  a widely covered contest  Corker was surprised how many people from all over the country  and even in other nations  had followed the election in which Ford came close to becoming the first African American popularly elected to the Senate from the South     Ford  a 10 year congressman and regular on cable news shows  often rattled off names of foreign dignitaries as easily as a baseball fan might toss out those of home run hitters  Corker emphasized his Tennessee roots and promised to use his business experience to solve complex problems in Washington  Plenty awaited him     In late February  after his return from Iraq  Corker crisscrossed the state to meet with constituents  He also visited the state Capitol  where reporters were both impressed and amused at his newfound familiarity with generals and Iraqi officials  When one joked that he sounded like Ford  Corker momentarily was taken aback  then smiled and said that must mean he sounded good indeed     Energy  Corker is a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  Despite pressure from the Republican leadership  which wanted to kill the Clean Energy Act  Corker voted for it  The bill promotes development of biofuel alternatives in which he believes Tennessee will play a significant role  A conference to resolve House and Senate differences will take place in September     He is taking a major interest in the global warming debate and has been studying the European cap and trade system in which an annual target of carbon dioxide emissions is set  with various sectors of the economy allowed to buy  sell  and trade credits to meet the target  That system is to be debated in the Senate this fall     Also  he was part of a Senate delegation that took a two day trip to Greenland with scientists to view ice sheets and glaciers and the effects of climate change  The senator says he wants to understand the issue in great detail and try to make sure the Senate doesnt react impulsively and enact something we cant reverse       if there are unintended negative consequences or our understanding of this issue evolves     Health care  Corker and Sen  Richard Burr  R N C   have introduced the Every American Insured Health Act  which aims to provide universal health insurance coverage through tax reform  Corker has said from the start that the bills purpose is to inspire meaningful debate  Last Wednesday  explaining the proposal to the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce  he drew laughs when he said he knows this bill is not going to pass     But it is attracting some interest  Sen  Lamar Alexander  R Maryville  has signed on as one of four co sponsors     No broad based health care plan is going to pass in the current Congress  But after the presidential election  regardless of which party wins  the issue likely will get serious attention     Under the Burr Corker bill  employers would continue to deduct what they spend on employee health insurance as a business expense  But the insurance would become a taxable benefit for employees     At the same time  refundable  advanceable flat tax credits of  2 160 per individual and  5 400 per family would be provided  offsetting the taxes owed except in the case of luxurious benefits  The same credit would be given to uninsured Americans  with the money directed to the health insurance plan of their choice  Whether a taxpayer has employer sponsored insurance or not  any leftover money from the credit would go into a health care spending account to help cover out of pocket costs  Everyone would receive the same credit regardless of income or employment status  except for those covered by Medicare  Medicaid  or another government program     Unlike now  the tax treatment of those with employer provided health insurance and those without it would be the same  The bill would eliminate pooled exclusions for out of pocket medical expenses and employee share insurance costs that are now enjoyed only by workers at companies that offer such cafeteria plan benefits     Health insurance would be portable  and in theory everyone could have it  The sponsors say the bill would be revenue neutral over 10 years  The Heritage Foundation  a conservative think tank  has praised the proposal as an alternative to greater government control over the financing and delivery of medical care  but Grover Norquists Americans for Tax Reform has trashed the plan as a tax increase     SCHIP  The Heritage Foundation also described the bill as a good alternative to expansion of SCHIP  in which the federal government offers a generous funding match to states for coverage of children  When the Senate passed the SCHIP bill  Corker was the only sponsor or co sponsor of Every American Insured to vote for it  Alexander  who also voted for SCHIP  signed on later  Corker said until a better plan could be enacted  he felt a moral obligation to err on the side of expanded coverage  The House bill contains a 45 cents per pack cigarette tax hike  The Senate version has a 61 cent increase  This is a sensitive topic for Corker and Alexander  since the Tennessee legislature this year raised the state tax by 42 cents  Apart from the tax issue  conservative opponents of SCHIP expansion have been more critical of the House plan  Corker told reporters last week he would vote to override an expected Bush veto if the bill emerges from conference in substantially the Senate form  But he said if it changes significantly  hell reassess his position     The right  Corker was assailed by opponents in the Republican primary as unacceptably moderate and even left leaning  He was especially attacked for past positions unfavorable to anti abortion efforts  though he insisted that he was now pro life and would vote that way  Tennessee Right to Life refused to endorse him even in the general election  By and large  despite the SCHIP vote  conservatives have generally been pleased with Corker  who  for instance  voted against Bush on an immigration bill with which the right was unhappy and with the pro life president on a major right to life issue  There have been three issues on which pro life forces have weighed in since Corker took office  and he voted with them on all three  The big one  against embryonic stem cell research  was politically difficult  Fellow Tennessean Alexander voted for the bill  citing enormous promise for lifesaving treatments for injuries and diseases  Corkers vote did not go unnoticed or unappreciated by Tennessee Right to Life  Nor did his signing of a letter in February urging President Bush to issue a letter to the congressional leadership serving notice that he would veto bills weakening present pro life policy     A difference  Whatever voters may be thinking of him  Corker assures them he is energized  thriving in his role  and firmly convinced that he is  in the parlance of state Sen  John Wilder  making a difference      The Tennessee Journal   Used with consent from the publisher  M  Lee Smith Publishers LLC
