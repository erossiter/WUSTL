editorial published July 28 in the Chattanooga Times Free Press     Chattanooga Times Free Press   Free Press Editorial   Sen  Corkers health plan   July 28  2007    Everybody wants everybody to have whatever medical insurance coverage anyone may need  But few suggest how to pay for it     Most people want health coverage but also wisely dont want socialized medicine     A major challenge of our times is how to provide the good that we want without the bureaucratic and bankrupting evils  After all  Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid already have bankrupting prospects  Surely  it would not be sensible to add greater unrealistic tax burdens     No one suggests the government should be responsible for providing food  clothing and shelter for us all  but somehow there are demands from some for government to provide medical care for everybody     Facing those daunting challenges and contradictions  Chattanoogas Sen  Bob Corker  R Tenn   and Sen  Richard Burr  R N C   have sought to address the problem in a reasonable way  They have been joined as co sponsors by Sen  Tom Coburn  a doctor   R Okla  Sen  Mel Martinez  RFla  and Sen  Elizabeth Dole  R N C     They are offering a Senate bill they call the Every American Insured Act  certainly a commendable goal  It seeks to provide all Americans  regardless of age  income or employer  with access to affordable  high quality health insurance through the free market     Most Americans have health insurance through their employers  who pay part of the insurance cost while employees pay the rest  Then there are many people who buy their own health insurance personally  as they would buy anything else  In addition  there is Medicare for the elderly  and there is Medicaid for the medically indigent  But there remain an estimated 45 million people  more than 820 000 in Tennessee  who do not have insurance  by choice of their financial priorities or because of cost     Sen  Corker and his Senate associates want to address the need of health insurance and personal choice by allowing each individual to own his own coverage  But what about paying for it  Their idea is to provide a refundable tax credit that would let each individual have cash to buy the health insurance policy he or she thinks best meets individual needs  The insurance would be portable  going with the individual with any job change     Their plan calls for a tax neutral approach that would allow a tax credit of  5 400 for a family of four  or  2 160 for an individual  to buy health insurance     Interestingly  Sen  Corker says the plan is not set in concrete  but is designed to open reasonable debate with the hope of gaining a nonpartisan  nonpolitical consensus finetuned for the best results for all     I believe  Sen  Corker said  the concept were introducing with this legislation should be at the center of a meaningful debate on true  broad health care and tax reform  It is a stepping stone to what I believe is the right direction for our country  a health care system that provides individuals the ability to purchase health insurance that is deeply rooted in the private market and is accessible to all Americans     Sen  Burr said  One of my greatest fears is that continuing high health care costs will force companies to dump their employee health care plans and millions of Americans and their families will be left without health care insurance  We must prevent this dangerous scenario by giving individuals control over their health care so they do not have to rely on their employers or the government for their health care      We encourage all Americans to own their own homes  so why dont we encourage people to own their own health care     Sen  Coburn said  As a practicing physician  I have seen inequities of our health care system firsthand  The vast majority of those inequities have been created by third parties  government and health insurance bureaucrats and politicians  This plan breaks the cycle by giving patients the right to choose their own plan  their own doctor and their own treatment     What could be better than free choice  with a tax credit to pay for it     If the debate on this and other ideas to provide fine tuning is constructive  it could be very beneficial in meeting real medical needs for all Americans  Let the debate begin     Copyright 2007  Chattanooga
