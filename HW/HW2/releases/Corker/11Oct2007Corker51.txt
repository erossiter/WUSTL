following news article published in the Memphis Flyer on October 11  Memphis Flyer  Corker Says Constituents and Common Sense Come Before Political Loyalties  By Jackson Baker  October 11  2007   10 37 AM   In a visit to Shelby County Wednesday  Bob Corker  the Republican who was elected to the U S  Senate last year over Democrat Harold Ford Jr  in a tight race that drew ample national attention  made it clear that partisan issues are the least of his concerns  Both in a luncheon address to Rotarians at the Germantown Country Club and in remarks to reporters afterward  former Chattanooga mayor Corker emphasized a common sense approach in which I strive to make sure that everybody in the state is proud of the way I conduct myself   to understand issues as they really are  devoid of some of the rhetoric that surrounds these issues    and  the political whims of the day  Take his response when asked whether embattled GOP senator Larry Craig  busted in the infamous wide stance airport restroom case  should resign for the good of the Republican Party  Corker said Craig s predicament was a matter for the people of Idaho and the Senate Ethics Committee  I don t try to get into all the political ramifications of this or that  The way to get a whole lot more done is to focus on issues  Somewhat disdainfully  he added  There are all these messaging amendments that we do  all about making one side look bad and the other side look good  Democrats do it  and Republicans do it  It s a total waste of time  Helping The Med As to how that even handed outlook affected his stand on issues  Corker was explicit  He talked of applying pressure on the Administration  especially on recent health care issues he considered urgent for his constituents  I know for a fact that I played a huge role in this  latest  TennCare waiver thing  I have to say I had to put a hold on the Bush nominations to make it happen  I thought it was important for our state  And there was his vote and enthusiastic support recently to expand SChip  the federal State Children s Health Insurance Program  so as to increase funding for Tennessee by  30 million and to permit Medicaid payments for patients at The Med from Arkansas and Mississippi  Both Corker and Tennessee GOP colleague Lamar Alexander strongly supported the bill  which passed but was vetoed last week by President Bush  I was glad to have worked out these issues that have plagued the Med for so long  It s ridiculous that people from Arkansas and Mississippi have used the facility for so long and don t pay for it  What s the logic in that  Corker said  vowing to try to get the Med friendly provisions re established in a veto proof compromise measure yet to be fashioned  Corker made a pitch for the Every American Insured Health Act  a bill he has sponsored that  he said  would modify the tax code so as to guarantee universal access to private health insurance but would not add a penny to the national deficit  Contending that what I m trying to do is to add to the equation a real debate  a real solution  the senator said his proposal had been slammed on the same day by both a conservative columnist and a liberal columnist  leading him to conclude  I m pretty sure we got it just about right  Corker said that executives of key national corporations  saddled with large health care costs for their employees  were walking the halls of Congress trying to get us to move to a government run system so they can alleviate that expense which makes them non competitive  Without some alternative form of universal access  he said  such a government run system was inevitable  With 800 000 Tennesseans and 47 million Americans lacking health care coverage  there was also a moral obligation to make coverage universal  Corker stressed  Relations with Iran and Syria As a member of both the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and the body s Armed Services committee  Corker says he is focusing hard on issues relating to war torn Iraq  a country he has visited twice  and neighboring Iran  subject of much speculation these days concerning possible future hostilities between that country and the U S  Here again  the senator stressed his determination to maintain independence of judgment  I ve had some very tense moments with this administration   in the first two months I was up there  in Washington  especially  There were some underwhelming meetings  Corker is dubious about the current political leadership of Iraq  things cannot go on as they are  but supportive for the time being of the current military strategy of General David Petraeus  with whom he stays in contact  On Iran  Corker said there was some concern in the Senate that the president might take action and emphasized that he  Bush would have to have Senate authority to do that  Corker reminded reporters that after his election he had said on CBS  Face the Nation that diplomatic negotiations with both Syria and Iran were necessary  We don t want to overplay our hand in Iran  he said  There s a group of people there who want to be our friends  If we move into Iran unilaterally others  in the region  will step back from being our friends  Corker  who was a construction executive before entering politics  related the current diplomatic situation to his experience in labor management negotiations in Tennessee  If you don t talk with your enemies they remain your enemies  There s a lot to be learned just to be in somebody s presence  he said   Copyright 1996  2006 Contemporary Media  Inc
