Corrected 3 20 07          WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Sens  Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker today released the text of a letter to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee  outlining concerns that a proposed change to the rules governing Medicaid program funding to states would force significant cuts in services to Tennesseans         According to state Medicaid administrators  cuts of the magnitude in this proposal could very well force significant cuts in services  including the elimination of entire fields of medicine  such as obstetrics and psychology   Alexander said         This proposed change would impact some of our state s largest urban hospitals as well as rural facilities  and I have serious concerns about the risk this could pose to the accessibility and quality of care Tennesseans receive   Corker said      The full text of the letter is below       March 19  2007      The Honorable Max Baucus  Chairman  Committee on Finance  U S Senate  219 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510   The Honorable Charles Grassley  Ranking Member  Committee on Finance  U S  Senate  219 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley       We are writing to express our concern about the proposed rule  CMS 2258 P  recently released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  that would change how states fund their Medicaid programs and their hospitals   Although we generally support efforts to control Medicaid spending  we are concerned about the impact this particular proposal would have on our state of Tennessee       The proposed rule imposes cost limits for public health care providers and alters the definition of  public  status   Specifically  the proposed rule would limit payments to safety net providers by capping reimbursement payments  redefining eligible public providers and imposing new restrictions on non federal funding sources   According to CMS  the estimated impact of these changes could reach  3 87 billion over five years       The proposed rule also imposes significant new restrictions on certified public expenditures  CPEs    Under the proposal  only hospitals meeting the new definition of public hospital and are reimbursed on a cost basis would be eligible to use CPEs to help states fund their programs   These restrictions would result in fewer dollars available to offset rising costs and would threaten hospitals  financial stability         Based on analysis from the TennCare Bureau  which administers Tennessee s Medicaid program  the proposed rule would cost our state s hospitals an estimated  1 3 billion over 5 years   Operating margins for 19 Tennessee hospitals  including 10 rural facilities  seven urban facilities and two safety net providers  will turn from positive to negative solely as the result of the loss of Medicaid revenue       Some of the hardest hit facilities in our state are safety net hospitals  such as the Memphis Medical Center   the Med   and Erlanger Hospital  which would most likely no longer meet the definition of a government hospital   A loss of federal funds would trigger a decrease in state funds going to these hospitals from TennCare   This one two punch for the region s largest safety net hospitals would cause certain closures of entire services for the community and perhaps even the hospitals themselves       Tennessee hospitals continue to face increasing costs for workers  drugs and biologics  professional liability coverage  and disaster readiness   Decreases in payments of this magnitude could result in staff reductions  as well as forcing our state s hospitals to reduce or eliminate services   such as obstetrical services and psychiatric units   that would put further pressure on their financial viability   Decreased payments will also make it more difficult for Tennessee hospitals to comply with the cost of federal mandates  such as greater reliance on electronic health records         In addition  the proposed rule would impact the cost of capital for hospitals as well as their basic access to capital   Hospitals that are governed or owned by cities and states frequently have bonds issued using the credit authority of the city or county   If these hospitals are no longer considered government facilities by CMS  they would likely experience a decrease in their credit rating   The resulting increase in the cost of capital   and in some cases the loss of access to capital altogether   would have real consequences ranging from deteriorating physical plants to an inability to provide the newest technology       We hope that we can work with the Finance Committee to address the shortcomings in this rule as originally proposed   We d be glad to furnish additional information  or your staff may wish to be in touch with Mary Sumpter Johnson with Senator Alexander at 224 2915 or Paul Palagyi with Senator Corker at 224 2945       Thank you for your attention to this matter       Sincerely      Sen  Lamar Alexander       Sen  Bob Corker
