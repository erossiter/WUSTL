                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Monday  July 16  2007  U S  Senator Bob Corker  R Tenn   was mentioned in the following article published July 16  2007 in The Daily News  Memphis   From Iraq to Memphis  Corker Settles Into Senate Life By ANDY MEEK   The Daily News   Six weeks into his new job as a U S  senator  fresh from a bruising  bare knuckled campaign  Bob Corker stepped aboard a C 130 military transport plane for a flight to Baghdad     During his brief visit to Iraq s war torn capital  the East Tennessee businessman met with several generals  the U S  ambassador to Iraq and six Tennessee soldiers  among others     Now  six months after taking office  Corker  the Tennessee Republican elected last November  already is making preparations for trip No  2  And  in a way  his visits to Iraq   along with the intensity he s poured into researching issues surrounding the U S  effort there   offer as good a starting point as any in determining how he s performed since January      Digging below the surface    Before that first Iraq visit  for example  Corker already had heard hours of congressional testimony  He s had private meetings with President Bush  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff     He d quizzed General David Petraeus  now the top U S  commander in Iraq  shortly before Petraeus  confirmation hearings  After all that  he figured he still needed to fly to the Middle East  to see things firsthand     Like the state catchphrase displayed on Missouri license plates  Corker  too  proclaimed Show Me everywhere he could     One of the things you find when you get up here  you can sort of be pulled from meeting to meeting to meeting and just sort of hit the tops or hit the surface of many of the issues  Corker said by phone from his D C  office  situated on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate Office Building     From his desk  flanked by the U S  and Tennessee flags  he has a street level view of Constitution Avenue and the Capitol Building  Family photos of his wife  Elizabeth  and daughters  Julia and Emily  adorn his office     But I think we ve done a really excellent job of digging into the issues  he said  We ve had people come in from around the country and around the world to talk about various issues  And not only do we have people come in  but before we entered into the  recent  debate on Iraq  I went there     He s planning to return some time before September  the month when Petraeus is scheduled to deliver a progress report of sorts to Washington lawmakers  That report ostensibly will spell out the effects of the so called troop surge  the extra U S  force sent to the country earlier this year to put a dent in the sectarian strife     Staying in touch    Corker s days in the hallways and meeting rooms of Washington  meanwhile  haven t all been about war and military matters     The numbers tell the story  Since taking office  he s built a staff of 35  He set up seven offices   one in Washington  six across Tennessee     Collectively  his staff has responded to more than 93 000 pieces of correspondence  Staffers already have visited each of Tennessee s 95 counties  which Corker said they ll do roughly every four months     I ve also been back to Tennessee almost every single weekend  he said  I ve made 49 visits to 36 counties     His Washington office location makes it easy to stay in touch with the public there  too     We feel really fortunate to be on the first floor because it s so accessible   both to the subway that connects the office buildings to the Capitol and to the Tennesseans who come to visit us  said Laura Lefler  a Corker spokeswoman     During the course of his campaign   against Memphis bred and then U S  Rep  Harold Ford Jr    Corker promised he wouldn t become a rubber stamp for Bush administration policies  That apparently doesn t mean he s strayed far from traditional conservative principles  either      A fine job     Local GOP stalwarts such as state Rep  Paul Stanley  R Germantown  say they ve been pleased with what they ve seen in Corker thus far     I ve known him for a long time  and I think he s done a fine job  said Stanley  who earlier this month had expressed interest in seeking the chairmanship of the Tennessee Republican Party  a position being vacated by Bob Davis  who s reportedly going to work for Fred Thompson s presidential campaign     I think from a party standpoint  early on people were wondering if he would hold the conservative line  and I think he s done that so far     Earlier this month  Corker took a brief vacation with his family  something he said he hadn t been able to do since last year s intense campaign  A little more than a month ago  he was in Memphis on a trip that included a focus on the region s growing biotech industry     One of the stops during that visit included touring the Memphis facility of Medtronic  the medical device manufacturer  After arriving there and having coffee  he toured the company s Museum of Modern Spinal Surgery  then sat down with Medtronic s senior management team to discuss health care and the spine industry     He later held a town hall meeting in Fayette County     I ve been to Memphis just about as much as any other place I ve visited in Tennessee  Corker said  We really pride ourselves in our constituent service  and we want to continue to set benchmarks to make sure we re doing the things we need to do to respond to Tennesseans  needs     Copyright 1995 2007 by The Daily News Publishing Co  Inc    All Rights Reserved
