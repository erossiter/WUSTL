                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Friday  October 05  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker today joined the other members of the Tennessee Congressional Delegation in asking acting U S  Agriculture Secretary Chuck Conner for the use of direct payments in assisting Tennessee farmers whose pastures have been devastated by the ongoing drought  Ive seen firsthand how Tennessee has been hit hard by the driest spell in more than a century  said Alexander who this summer visited with about 40 farmers at the family farm of David Richesin in Philadelphia  TN  Farmers have told me there hasnt been a drought in their lifetimes that has affected so many people and so many communities  Extraordinary disasters require extraordinary responses  and thats why the Agriculture Department should provide this direct assistance  We know that farmers across our state are continuing to struggle as a result of the ongoing drought conditions and that the existing assistance options cannot alleviate all of the drought related problems  said Corker  who visited farms in East and West Tennessee over the summer  Were committed to exploring any and all options that may be available   including these funds at USDA   which could be a potential source of assistance  Well continue working to ensure that if any funds are available  Tennessee has a chance to benefit from them  The letter  signed by all members of the states congressional delegation  requests that the Agriculture Department tap into its discretionary funds to make direct payments towards a pasture recovery program in Tennessee  Pasture and forage losses have totaled  140 million in Tennessee  crippling livestock feed supplies and those that rely on them  such as the cattle industry  The letter states that the effects of the drought will be less severe and the pastures will rebound faster if funds can be used for extensive reseeding of the pastures in severe drought counties  This summer the Agriculture Department issued a disaster declaration for all 95 Tennessee counties due to the drought  Alexander and Corker joined other members of the delegation in asking the Agriculture Department for this designation  which provided essential low interest emergency loans to qualifying Tennessee producers      A copy of the 10 05 07 letter is included below        October 5 2007   The Honorable Chuck Conner   Acting Secretary   U S  Department of Agriculture   1400 Independence Avenue  SW   Washington  D C  20250    Dear Mr  Secretary     The state of Tennessee has been hit exceptionally hard by drought this year  placing many of our state s farmers and ranchers in a precarious economic position  In the past 100 years  the growing season   of January through July 2007 was the driest on record with little relief from extreme heat  Record setting temperatures severely reduced soil moisture  and increased production costs have caused greate economic hardship for Tennessee producers     We are requesting your consideration of the use of direct payments through available discretionary funding  including Section 32 funds  to assist with a pasture recovery program in Tennessee  The drought has devastated pastures and severely impacted forage production capabilities  Pasture and forage losses have totaled  140 million  which negatively impacts all livestock feed supplies  including   wildlife and the related economy  Reseeding will be extensively required in the severe drought counties  If Tennessee pastures are properly managed through the reseeding program  the effects of drought will be less severe and pastures will rebound faster when precipitation is sufficient     We appreciate your support for Tennessee through your disaster designation due to losses caused by extreme drought earlier this year  This designation provided essential low interest emergency loans to   qualifying Tennessee producers  However  the drought continues to devastate our farmers and ranchers  and we regret that the current drought designation will not provide enough assistance to address   agricultural losses in Tennessee  Thank you for your consideration of this request     Sincerely     Lamar Alexander   United States Senator    Bob Corker   United States
