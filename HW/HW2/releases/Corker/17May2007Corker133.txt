                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Column by U S  Senator Bob Corker  Tennessee from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Thursday  May 17  2007  We are approaching the summer driving season  and from Mountain City to Memphis  Tennesseans are facing higher gasoline prices  The nationwide average price for a gallon of regular gasoline reached an all time high of  3 10 this week   an increase of more than 23 cents in the last three weeks   Unfortunately  we must begin to face the reality that the days of cheap gasoline might well be over       Historically high gasoline prices are a symptom of America s increasing dependence on foreign oil   For decades  U S  demand for gasoline has continued to grow and domestic production has not kept pace  forcing us to import more and more petroleum from dangerous and unstable markets in the Persian Gulf and Venezuela  Now that anti American political leaders like Venezuela s Hugo Chavez are nationalizing major oil reserves  and emerging markets in China and India are consuming more energy to fuel their expanding economies  we cannot afford to delay action any longer        Recently  the Senate took an important step towards reducing our dependence on foreign oil  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee  of which I am a member  passed a bipartisan energy security bill   the first major piece of national energy legislation since the Energy Policy Act of 2005   This measure promotes swift and continued development of biofuel alternatives to petroleum  increases energy efficiency standards  and promotes development of carbon capture and sequestration technology           The legislation encourages the continued production of alternative energy sources by promoting research and development of various biofuels  and will displace 15 percent of our gasoline use by 2022        Tennessee s climate and terrain make us ideally suited to produce the kinds of feedstocks used in the development and production of biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol   Researchers at the University of Tennessee are now working to develop a more efficient generation of biofuels  and West Tennessee farmers are helping lead the way in expanding this emerging industry   I am proud Tennessee will play an important role in meeting this new national biofuels standard           One easy way to reduce our energy consumption and make consumers  dollars go further is by increasing efficiency   Our bill codifies pending efficiency standards for various household appliances and requires all federal government buildings to transition to lighting that is energy star rated or designated as energy efficient by October 2010   If legislators are to change Americans  attitudes and behavior toward their energy usage  the federal government must practice what it preaches        Tennessee s work in the area of clean coal technology makes me particularly interested in the continued use of coal  America s largest energy resource  in an environmentally friendly way  One concern with using more coal for electricity and fuel is that it releases carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  Provisions in our bill expand research and development into technologies that can capture carbon dioxide from coal power plants and other industrial facilities and then sequester  or store  the gas underground  This will allow the U S  to take advantage of a huge domestic resource  while simultaneously disposing of a harmful gas         No silver bullet exists to end our dependence on foreign oil and reduce the rising energy costs facing consumers   Therefore  we must build upon legislation passed by the Energy Committee and diversify our energy portfolio to include  continued development of alternative fuels  nuclear power and renewable power sources such as solar and wind  investment in research and technology  the expansion of our refinery capacity to include biorefineries and coal to liquid facilities  conservation of our resources  and enhancing domestic oil and gas production in an environmentally friendly way   Creating new markets for domestic energy sources not only increases our national security  it creates tremendous economic opportunities for our state and our country        Securing America s energy future represents one of the central challenges facing our country today  and addressing this problem should not fall victim to partisan politics   I believe our Committee has taken a meaningful  bipartisan step towards making our country more energy secure  and I look forward to the debate in the full Senate   I hope this will only be the beginning of our progress on energy security in the 110th Congress
