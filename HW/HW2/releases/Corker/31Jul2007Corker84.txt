posted July 30 on the Heritage Foundation s website  Heritage Foundation   Beyond SCHIP  A Serious Proposal to Reduce Uninsurance   by Robert E  Moffit  Ph D    WebMemo  1577   July 30  2007 The Senate debate on SCHIP reauthorization is  in fact  a debate on the future direction of health care policy  In one direction is greater government control over the financing and delivery of medical care  in the other is greater personal freedom for individuals and families that empowers them to choose the health care options that they want and trust  Leading the way toward freedom are the five senators  Richard Burr  R NC   Bob Corker  R TN   Tom Coburn  R OK   Elizabeth Dole  R NC   and Mel Martinez  R FL   who are sponsors of the Every American Insured Health Act  S  1886   This bold and innovative proposal would reduce the number of uninsured by an estimated 24 million by eliminating the unfairness of the federal tax treatment for health insurance  providing tax relief for individuals and families in a budget neutral fashion and promoting reform of state health insurance markets to make coverage more affordable  Though a revolutionary break from the status quo  the legislation embodies an approach to reform that has been vigorously championed for decades by prominent health care economists and policy analysts  liberal and conservative alike     The Two Pillars of Comprehensive Reform    The Senate reform proposal has two main components  they are distinct but inseparable means of expanding patient choice and encouraging robust competition in the sector of the American economy where it is most conspicuously lacking     1  Replacement of the Current Tax Regime with a National Health Care Tax Credit  The bill would replace the existing tax exclusion for health insurance with a national system of health care tax credits  This is an entirely new tax policy  and working Americans and their families would be treated equally for the purpose of securing health insurance coverage  1  Individuals and families would receive a standard tax credit to purchase health insurance   2 160 for an individual and  5 400 for a family  2  For low income individuals and families  the credit would be refundable  meaning that these persons would receive the credit whether or not they file income taxes  Employers would still be able to deduct the provision of health insurance for employees as a regular cost of doing business  as they do today  Because the national tax credit program would replace the existing employee tax exclusion for health insurance  the Senate sponsors say that the legislation would be budget neutral over 10 years     The existing federal tax regime for health care ties favorable tax benefits for the purchase of health insurance almost exclusively to the place of work  making access to coverage an accident of employment  The professional literature  as well as independent academic and government studies  on the deficiencies of the current system is voluminous  It undermines portability of coverage  it fuels health care inflation  it distorts the health insurance markets  it is inequitable and profoundly regressive  and it undercuts the free market forces of consumer choice and competition in the health care system  3  That is why there has been growing bipartisan support for a tax credit strategy to reduce the number of uninsured  4     There is no effective way to resolve these many problems short of overhauling federal tax treatment of health care while providing help to low income persons to enter the private market  As Professor Regina Herzlinger of the Harvard Business School has explained     The academic health policy wonks and Beltway crowd will hold press conferences and write papers about tax neutrality  and interest groups will lobby to gain some tax advantage  But the debate boils down to two approaches  a tax deduction or a tax credit for my expenditures  The only difference between the two approaches is that the deduction is worth more to someone who is in a high tax bracket  while the value of the tax credit is independent of the tax bracket   5     The cost of health insurance varies radically from state to state and largely reflects the underlying costs of health care in the state  Under the Burr bill  in the event that an individual or family buys a health insurance plan that costs less than the value of the credit  the difference would be deposited into the individual s tax free health spending account  such as an HSA or an MSA     2  State Health Insurance Market Reform  States regulate health insurance markets  and these markets are often dysfunctional  They are balkanized under special interest driven law and complex regulations  with distinct sets of rules governing separate individual and group markets  they are increasingly uncompetitive  largely as the result of the relentless growth of oligopolistic concentrations of market power by a few geographically dominant insurance carriers  and they are over regulated  overburdened by complex and costly insurance rules and  according to the Council for Affordable Insurance  more than 1 800 specific provider and benefit mandates nationwide     Unlike other Senate proposals  the Burr bill would not displace existing state regulation or impose yet another layer of federal regulation on top of existing state regulation  Rather  the bill would create new incentives for state officials to reform their health insurance markets and make health insurance more affordable and flexible  The bill would accomplish this by tying the eligibility of states  low income residents for the refundable federal tax credit to state health insurance market reform     In pursuing state reform  state officials would have several options available to them  But the key provision is that  in order to secure the refundable tax credits  they must change state law and regulation to allow individuals and families to take advantage of an affordable health insurance option  In this case  an affordable health option would be a low cost plan with an average premium that does not exceed 6 percent of the state s median income     In addition  states could establish new high risk pools or reinsurance mechanisms to cope with adverse selection in the state markets  Another pooling option open to state officials would be to create a statewide health insurance exchange  subject to certification by the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to cover more state residents and to offer individuals and families the ability to secure the health insurance of their choice  6     With regard to statewide health insurance exchanges  the Senate bill is not prescriptive  the details would be left up to state officials  The bill broadly defines the functions of a statewide exchange  to ease access of low income persons getting the refundable credit  to enroll eligible persons and provide health plan information  and to develop and apply methods to reduce adverse selection or provide for more equitable distribution of risk  A statewide exchange could also serve as a mechanism for individuals enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP to get private health insurance  The bill also provides that states may enter into interstate compacts to establish multi state pooling arrangements to spread risk and make insurance portable and more affordable among their citizens     More importantly  the Senate bill specifies that any statewide health insurance exchange must be open to any willing health plan licensed in the state that wishes to compete for consumers dollars  that the exchange may not be a vehicle for imposing any new benefit mandates  and the exchange may not be a vehicle for imposing price controls or premium caps on health plans  thus preventing the exchange from evolving into a regulatory agency     Conclusion    The Senate debate on SCHIP is pivotal for the future of American health care  There are  at the end of the day  only two basic directions in health care  greater government control or more personal freedom for individual and families choosing the health care they trust in a robust and competitive health care economy     If Congress decides to go down the road toward SCHIP expansion  it means that more Americans will be dependent on government for their health care  taxpayers will be burdened by higher levels of government spending and increased taxation  and more Americans will lose their private health care coverage because of the crowd out that accompanies government expansion     If Congress decides instead to expand personal choice for individuals and families  it would unleash the powerful forces of the market economy to reduce health care costs  improve the quality of care  and increase patient satisfaction and family control  The Every American Insured Health Act is a visionary proposal that would change the federal tax treatment of health insurance  enabling millions of Americans to secure private coverage through health care tax credits  while harnessing the power of state innovation to make health benefit options more affordable and flexible in state health insurance markets  Beyond comprehensive tax reform  Congress should also consider other creative ways to finance refundable tax credits for low income families  including the use of existing government funding for various programs such as SCHIP to expand coverage of choice for low income families     The Senate debate on SCHIP is an opportunity to go beyond the standard rhetoric on the uninsured and act to address the problem  At the end of this debate  not one child in any American family should lose existing private coverage because of congressional incompetence or indifference     Robert E  Moffit  Ph D   is Director of the Center for Health Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation                                                                                       1  For those enrolled in Medicare  Medicaid  the Veterans Administration system  and Tricare  their coverage would not change  and they would not be eligible for the credit     2  This is in today s dollars  The credit amounts would be annually adjusted based on a blended index of the Consumer Price Index and the rate of medical inflation     3  A broad spectrum of health policy analysts  from those at the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation to those at the Urban Institute and the New America Foundation  have supported using a refundable tax credit to reduce the number of uninsured  For an excellent overview of the issue  see Grace Marie Arnett  ed    Empowering Health Care Consumers Through Tax Reform   Anne Arbor  University of Michigan
