                                                                            from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Monday  October 15  2007  U S  Senator Bob Corker  R TN  was mentioned in the following news article published in the Tennessee Journal on October 15  Tennessee Journal  TennCare gets 3 year renewal with hospital supplement cap   Vol  33  No  40   October 15  2007 The state got a new waiver last week for TennCare  the nearly 14 year old expanded Medicaid program that utilizes privatized managed care  But it didnt come easy  It took a year of negotiations  six temporary extensions of the old waiver  multiple trips to Washington by Gov  Phil Bredesen and other administration officials  and heavy involvement by the states congressional delegation  including some extraordinary action by Sen  Bob Corker  R Chattanooga   who Bredesen said just lay down on the track for the cause  The new waiver will cost the state  270 million over three years in forgone federal funding  But it could have been worse  A few months ago  the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  was insisting on a cap for supplemental hospital payments that would have slashed  385 million  The hit in the current year budget is  52 million  While unpleasant  this is manageable in a program with a  7 billion budget and large reserves  Most of the impact comes in the final year of the three year waiver  giving state officials time to adjust  Indeed  Bredesen was reasonably satisfied with the deal  He believes the management tools are in place to keep the TennCare budget under control for the rest of his second term and the next governors first few years in office     Cap  For 2007 08  TennCare has a  621 3 million pool of federal and state money budgeted for supplemental payments to hospitals to offset losses from charity care and TennCare  The payments are in three categories  certified public expenditures  CPE   essential access  and critical access  CPE  in which funds spent on charity care by public hospitals are used to draw down matching federal Medicaid dollars  is the most controversial  And after Congress thwarted an attempt to tighten the rules for CPE funding  CMS insisted on a cap in the states waiver  Supplemental hospital payments cant exceed  540 million a year  State officials do not intend to put the whole burden of the cutback on hospitals  though  They will devise a plan to spread it out  Meanwhile  only a moratorium imposed by Congress is blocking enforcement of a rules change in the 2006 Deficit Reduction Act under which only public hospitals directly owned by a county or city would qualify for CPE matches  The only Tennessee hospital that indisputably would qualify is Metro General in Nashville  Even the Regional Medical Center at Memphis would not  since it is set up as a 501 c 3 organization  The moratorium is likely to be extended  since a majority of states are in the same boat as Tennessee  Speaking to the Hospital Alliance of Tennessee on Tuesday  Finance Commissioner Dave Goetz said that if it isnt extended were toast     Process  With the TennCare waiver due to expire June 30 of this year  the state more than a year ago applied for a five year extension  CMS rejected that request  instructing the state to apply for a standard threeyear waiver  Officials communicated regularly with CMS  and everything seemed to be going fairly routinely  if slowly  In April  CMS sent a draft of a proposed agreement that concerned state officials  One problem involved the computation of CPE payments  a matter that was resolved when Congress imposed the moratorium  and another concerned a new requirement preventing graduate medical education funds from going directly to medical schools  With help from the congressional delegation  this too eventually was resolved    But in mid May  with those issues still hanging and the waiver due to expire in six weeks  Sens  Lamar Alexander  R Maryville  and Corker wrote Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt urging prompt action     Two days before the expiration  the state received what was supposed to be the final draft  Officials were stunned  because it contained a  480 million cap on supplemental hospital payments that had not been discussed  A twoweek extension was granted for further negotiations  The state lost its argument that there should be no cap  and it could not persuade CMS to raise the one it proposed  Bredesen made two trips to Washington to meet with Leavitt  and Goetz and TennCare director Darin Gordon spent far more time dealing with CMS than theyd have liked  Meanwhile  members of the delegation also got involved  especially Corker  who was familiar with the issues because of his previous service as state finance commissioner  More temporary extensions were granted  A tentative agreement was reached to raise the cap to  540 million  easing the fiscal pressure on the state  but it had to be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget  which clearly was in no rush    After a sixth temporary extension was granted  Corker placed a hold on confirmation of all non military appointees  which got the attention of the White House  On Oct  3  with OMB approval  CMS sent the state a draft  TennCare policy director Susie Baird  chief financial officer Scott Pierce  and others scrutinized the hundreds of pages line by line and found two new troublesome items  both involving administrative rather than financial matters  that had been slipped in by someone in the federal bureaucracy  One provision would have required the state to implement its new Standard Spend Down program for the medically needy within 30 days  instead of submitting its plan for implementation in that time frame  It will take at least six weeks from the date of approval to get the program going  The other new requirement was for six months of retroactive eligibility  That requirement was unworkable for Tennessee  which  unlike any other state  puts its total Medicaid population in managed care  Both issues were resolved  and the new waiver agreement was announced last Monday  first by Alexander and Corker and an hour later by the TennCare Bureau  Medically needy  When cutting 170 000 people from the rolls two years ago and implementing cost saving reforms in pharmacy and other areas  the state did not kick those in the Medicaid optional category of medically needy off the program  These are people who wouldnt be poor if not for their medical bills  But enrollment has been closed  except for children and pregnant women  for more than 18 months  Just as the federal government wanted a cap on CPE  Bredesen wanted a hard cap on the medically needy program and some management flexibility that CMS ultimately agreed to  The state will submit a plan to CMS in the next 30 days for opening enrollment in the category with a new Standard Spend Down program  CoverTN  The non TennCare program CoverTN  a Bredesen administration initiative to make private health insurance available to low  and moderate income workers at small companies that dont offer it  will continue to operate indefinitely without federal funds  Under the program  the employee  the business  and the state each pay a portion of the premium for basic coverage offered by a state contractor  Bredesen has talked about winning matching federal funds for the program  if this can be done without a loss of management control  but he said last week it isnt likely to happen soon  Considering the ordeal the state went through just to get a new TennCare waiver  its hardly the time to ask for something else  Copyright  2007   M  Lee Smith Publishers LLC
