                                                                           from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Monday  October 08  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   After an arduous negotiation process  U S  Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker today applauded CMS  Center for Medicaid Services  approval of TennCares waiver renewal application  keeping the 1 2 million Tennesseans who rely on TennCare for their health care coverage enrolled and insured  TennCares current waiver expired on June 30  and has been operating under a series of extensions since that date  Todays announcement from CMS renews TennCare for another three years  Todays renewal of TennCare is welcome news  The State has been negotiating dutifully with CMS for the months in order to continue providing critical health services to Tennesseans that need it the most  said Alexander  Senator Corker and I have been working closely together with the Governors office to ensure that any new requirements dont have an unintended impact on Tennessee  Senator Corker was able to do an especially effective job because of his background as a former chief operating officer for Tennessee  Now that the waiver renewal has been resolved  we can all focus on addressing the broader problem of the uninsured     We have been involved over the course of this negotiation process to ensure the current TennCare waiver would be temporarily extended without a lapse and that Tennessee is treated fairly under the new waiver  TennCares renewal will ensure that 1 2 million Tennesseans will continue to receive essential health care benefits  and it will protect our states safety net hospitals who take on significant costs from indigent care  said Corker  Addressing the 45 million Americans  including 800 000 Tennesseans  currently without health insurance remains a huge challenge facing our country and I am continuing to work on making high quality health care coverage accessible  affordable  and portable for all Tennesseans and all Americans  I am extremely grateful to Senator Corker  Senator Alexander and our entire congressional delegation for their unwavering support and their efforts to ensure Tennessee was treated fairly at the federal level  said Governor Phil Bredesen  I am pleased we were able to successfully negotiate a resolution that will help us better serve the Tennesseans who rely on this program  In May  with the TennCare waiver expiration fast approaching  Senators Corker and Alexander wrote a letter to U S  Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt inquiring about the status of TennCares application and reiterating the urgency of its renewal  The senators also successfully addressed two additional concerns facing TennCare funding  The first involved a proposed change to the rule regarding allocation of Certified Public Expenditures  CPE  that allows public hospitals to obtain federal Medicaid matching funds  If implemented  the rule change would have cost Tennessee hospitals an estimated  1 3 billion over five years and forced significant cuts in services to Tennesseans  Corker and Alexander voted for a one year moratorium on the proposed rule  which was included in the supplemental appropriations bill  and the senators urged CMS to amend language in TennCares renewal application guaranteeing the state would only be required to comply with the new regulation along with all other states after the one year moratorium on the CPE rule ends  Second  the senators ensured that Graduate Medical Education  GME  funds  which are meant to support the academic work of Tennessees medical students  would go directly to the states medical schools  instead of teaching hospitals where they could be reallocated for other purposes  Senator Alexander and I had serious concerns about the impact the proposed change in the CPE rule would have on the accessibility and quality of health care Tennesseans receive  Im proud we have been successful in suspending any cuts for at least a year and in guaranteeing fair treatment for Tennessee after the moratorium ends  said Corker  As a former Tennessee finance commissioner  Im pleased we were able to convince CMS of the importance of protecting education funds for Tennessees next generation of doctors from being diverted for other expenditures  TennCare was implemented on January 1  1994 as a five year demonstration program approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration  HCFA   now CMS  It replaced the Medicaid program in Tennessee expanding health care coverage to the uninsured and uninsurable who were not eligible for Medicaid  TennCare requires CMS approval in order to receive matching federal dollars which amount to 64 percent of the programs funding
