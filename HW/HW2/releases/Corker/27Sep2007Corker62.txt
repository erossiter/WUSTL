                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senators Also Secure Permanent Financial Fix in the Bill for Tennessee Hospitals Treating A Large Number of Uninsured from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Thursday  September 27  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and Bob Corker  R Tenn   today said reauthorization of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  will boost Tennessees efforts to provide coverage for the states neediest children  The SCHIP Reauthorization package  expected to be approved by the full Senate this evening  will also contain a permanent solution to help compensate Tennessee hospitals that treat a large number of patients who are unable to pay their bills  This legislation increases and expands health care coverage for the low income  uninsured Tennessee children who need it the most like the 10 000 children currently being served through the states CoverKids program  Alexander said  Thanks to this bill  more of Tennessees 127 000 uninsured kids will be able to take advantage of this valuable program  Now that Congress has passed SCHIP  it should reform the tax code to give uninsured Americans  including the 800 000 uninsured in Tennessee  the ability to afford to buy private health coverage    While the SCHIP reauthorization legislation is not perfect  I chose to err on the side of securing health benefits for millions of needy children  said Corker  Now that debate on this bill is temporarily over  we must find a way for all Americans to have access to affordable  private health care  I look forward to working with Senators on both sides of the isle to address this problem that we have a moral responsibility to solve  The State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   begun ten years ago  offers coverage for children in low income families who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but cant afford private insurance  This bills  34 9 billion expansion over five years will reduce the ranks of the nations uninsured children by boosting the programs enrollment to more than 10 million children  up from the current 6 6 million  In April  Tennessee began providing health care to the states low income  uninsured children through the CoverKids program  This program is available for free to children under the age of 19 who are living with families with incomes under 250 percent of the federal poverty level  There are 10 000 children enrolled in the program statewide  In addition  the bill provides for a permanent annual Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital  DSH  allotment for Tennessee of  30 million per year  DSH payments help compensate hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients  Tennessee and Hawaii are the only two states that do not have permanent DSH allotments  Alexander and Corker earlier secured a commitment to include this provision in this final version of the bill from the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Senator Max Baucus  D Mont   and the committees ranking Republican member  Senator Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  Alexander and Corker said hospitals providing care to a disproportionately high share of Medicaid and uninsured patients are placed at a disadvantage and need extra payments because Medicaid reimbursements dont always cover the actual cost of the medical bills  These payments will help keep Tennessee hospitals afloat  Alexander said  I want to thank Senator Corker and the Tennessee delegation in the House of Representatives for their help in making sure Tennessee hospitals are no longer penalized for helping those that are sick and disadvantaged  This bill also provides permanent federal funding for Tennessee hospitals  restoring a benefit almost every other state already receives  said Corker  These funds will be help alleviate the burden placed on providers and patients due to the extraordinary cost of uncompensated care  Securing this permanent solution was a major bipartisan effort in which members of the Tennessee delegation in both the House and the Senate worked together for the greater good of our state  I appreciate the work of all those who contributed to this successful effort    Alexander and Corker said the bill reauthorizing SCHIP explicitly prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving Medicaid and SCHIP benefits  This bill requires  for the first time  an established process for states to verify citizenship of enrollees in the Childrens Health Insurance Program  The bill also allows states to create a system using Social Security cards to enforce that citizenship requirement  For this purpose and other purposes  we need to make Social Security cards more secure  and I will support legislation to do so  Alexander said  Alexander said he will support legislation to require a data sharing agreement between the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security  which would allow the government to verify  for example  whether or not a Social Security number is held by a legal resident
