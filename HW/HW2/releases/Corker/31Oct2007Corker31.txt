                                                                           from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Wednesday  October 31  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Lamar Alexander  R TN  and Bob Corker  R TN  today joined other Senators in sending a letter to the Democratic leadership asking them to complete work on the appropriations bills that fund our troops and care for our veterans so Congress can approve them and send them to the president to sign into law     Our military men and women are fighting abroad so that we can be safe  and we owe it to them  and to those veterans who have fought in wars before them  to provide the support they need and deserve  said Senator Alexander  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Weve now set a twenty year record for failing to fund our troops and veterans in a timely manner  Congress should do its job  quit playing politics and come to an agreement by Veterans Day to support our troops and veterans    We spend a lot of time on messaging votes that do absolutely nothing  and yet we seem to be incapable of performing our actual constitutional responsibilities  passing appropriations bills to support our military men and women and care for our countrys veterans  said Senator Corker  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  I truly believe the American people expect us to do the jobs we were sent here to do     The letter asks that Congress complete work on the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 Military Construction Veterans Affairs  MilCon VA  and Defense appropriations bills and send them to the Presidents desk by Veterans Day  To date  Congress has not sent a single appropriations bill  the responsibility of Congress as outlined in the Constitution  to the president to sign into law     Full text of the letter is below      October 31  2007    Speaker Nancy Pelosi   House of Representatives   H 232 U S  Capitol   Washington  DC 20510    Majority Leader Harry Reid   United States Senate   S 221 U S  Capitol   Washington  DC 20510    Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid     We write this letter to request that federal funding for our nations troops and veterans not be further delayed and held hostage for partisan purposes  Congress must promptly complete its work on the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 Military Construction Veterans Affairs  MilCon VA  and Defense appropriations bills  and they should be sent to the Presidents desk as freestanding measures by Veterans Day     It has been nearly two months since both Houses passed their respective FY 2008 MilCon VA appropriations bills  and nearly one month has gone by since both chambers approved their FY 2008 Defense appropriations bills  Plenty of time has passed for these measures to go through conference and get signed into law  Yet to date  this Congress has still not sent a single appropriations bill to the President  a failure of accomplishment that has not happened in decades  Meanwhile  our brave soldiers are defending us overseas  taking the fight to the terrorists  and keeping our nation safe  Veterans continue waiting for increased funding  which the President already has signaled that he would approve and will lead to improved medical care and other benefits     Swift action on the MilCon VA and Defense appropriations bills is not only fitting with Veterans Day coming in less than two weeks  but it also is one of our highest responsibilities as lawmakers  Our soldiers and veterans already have done so much for our county  The Democratic Congressional Leadership should not now cynically use them to shoulder a bloated minibus funding bill up Pennsylvania Avenue and wrest billions in excessive spending  Leading veterans groups have expressed strong concerns about such an approach  For months  the President has said that he would oppose it     Our troops and veterans cannot afford unnecessary delay  and they rightfully expect Congress to put their interests ahead of politics  It therefore is irresponsible to attach VA and military funding measures onto a domestic spending bill which we know will get vetoed  Instead  we urge you to work with us in a bipartisan manner so we can quickly advance freestanding MilCon VA and Defense appropriations bills for the Presidents signature
