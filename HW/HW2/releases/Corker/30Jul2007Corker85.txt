                                                                             Corker Returns from Two Day Trip to Greenland to Study Climate Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Monday  July 30  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senator Bob Corker  R TN   member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee  returned Sunday from a two day trip to Greenland with other Senate colleagues to view the effects of climate change     We have a unique opportunity to marry concerns about energy security and concerns about carbon dioxide emissions into a policy that enhances our technological capability and gives our country a competitive advantage  said Corker  Obviously this should be done in a way that ensures that those generations coming after us enjoy an increased standard of living  so the growth of our gross domestic product is a critical part of this equation  We should also continue to study climate change and its effects because there is still a lot that is unknown     Greenland is an island with roughly the same area as Mexico  The ice sheet covers about 83 percent of the island  is up to two miles thick  and contains about 1 20th of the worlds surface ice and 10 percent of the worlds freshwater     On the trip to Kangerlussuaq and Ilulissat on Greenlands west coast  Corker saw ice sheets and glaciers  visited the Kangia Ice Fjord near Illulissat and toured iceberg filled Disko Bay by boat  Accompanying the Senators on the trip were Dr  Richard Alley  a professor at Pennsylvania State University and Dr  Minik Rosing  PhD   a Danish climate scientist  The Senators also met with Danish Environment Minister Connie Hedegaard and Greenland Minister of the Environment Arkalo Abelsen  Nine other Senators joined Corker on the trip to Greenland  which was led by Barbara Boxer  D CA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  EPW  and Johnny Isakson  R GA   Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure     This trip comes on the heels of a trip Corker took in May with Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman  D NM  to learn about the European cap and trade system  In general  a cap and trade program sets an annual target of carbon dioxide emissions and allows various sectors of the economy to buy  sell  and trade credits to meet that target     Climate change and reducing carbon dioxide emissions will likely be a major subject of debate this fall in the Senate  so as weve done with other key issues  were digging in to understand this issue in great detail so that we can play a meaningful role as it is debated  said Corker  We dont want to react impulsively and enact something that we cant reverse in the future if there are unintended negative consequences or our understanding of this issue evolves
