                                                                             Corker Votes for FDA Reauthorization to Improve Drug Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      from the Office of Senator Bob Corker  Wednesday  May 09  2007  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Bob Corker  R TN  today voted for S  1082  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Revitalization Act  which reauthorizes funding for FDA drug approval activities and adds new protections to certify that drugs on the market are safe for consumers  The bill passed by a vote of 93 to 1            I believe this bill will improve drug safety for American consumers by ensuring that the Food and Drug Administration can measure and react to safety concerns after drugs are already on the market   said Corker   The bill will also continue to incentivize and require drug companies to conduct clinical trials on pediatric populations to make sure that drugs are safe for children  help the FDA review pharmaceuticals and medical devices in a timely manner  and provide patients with better access to information about new drugs and devices that are still in clinical trials             The bill includes reauthorization of four programs  the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA   the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act  MDUFMA   the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  BPCA   and the Pediatric Research Equity Act  PREA         Much of the debate on FDA Reauthorization focused on amendments regarding drug importation  Sen  Byron Dorgan s amendment   990   which passed by voice vote  allows FDA approved drugs to be imported into the United States from permitted foreign countries  Sen  Thad Cochran offered a second degree amendment   1010   which passed by a vote of 49 40  requiring the Secretary of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to certify that drug importation is safe before it is authorized  Corker supported both the Dorgan and the Cochran amendments        I voted for Senator Cochran s amendment because I believe we should make certain that drug importation is safe for our citizens before we allow drugs to come into the U S  from foreign countries  Once we can ensure that drug importation is safe  I believe it can benefit Americans by helping lower the cost of their prescription drugs   said Corker         It s not certain that drug importation will be included in the bill that comes out of conference  but I hope that drug importation will be debated again and that we will be successful in passing a bill that ensures safety and lowers prices of prescription drugs  I also hope the final drug importation bill will focus on giving consumers the best possible information about the drugs they are buying  particularly information about which country produced their prescription drugs  When you go to a pharmacy you have a right to know whether the medicine you re buying is from our country or Canada or Bulgaria  That  imported from  information should be clearly labeled on your prescription         Corker added   I also hope this discussion of drug importation will lead to broader discussion and reform of trade policy  Our trade negotiations do not address the international disparity in drug pricing  As a result  a number of countries cap the prices at which prescription drugs are sold  leaving the American people to pay more than their fair share
