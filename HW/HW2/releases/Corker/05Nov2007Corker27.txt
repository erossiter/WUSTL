following floor remarks in honor of Dr  Benjamin L  Hooks  of Memphis  who today received the Presidential Medal of Freedom  the nations highest civil award  at a White House ceremony     Mr  President  I rise today to honor an exceptional Tennessean and a pioneer in the civil rights movement  Benjamin Hooks was born in Memphis  Tennessee in 1925  the fifth of seven children by Robert and Bessie Hooks     He grew up in a loving family who taught him to succeed in both education and life  After high school  Dr  Hooks began his higher education by taking pre law classes at Le Moyne College in Memphis  Prior to finishing his degree  he was drafted into the Army  honorably serving our country in World War II  When he returned home  he went to graduate school at Howard University and afterwards received a law degree from DePaul University in Chicago     As Dr  Hooks went through life and excelled in various endeavors  there was one experience that greatly molded the future direction of his life  being born into and growing up in the scourge of racial segregation  After Dr  Hooks graduated college  he returned home and vowed to do his part to end racial segregation     Initially  he fought the fight by becoming one of the first African American lawyers in Tennessee  It was during this time he met and married Ms  Frances Dancy  Frances was a school teacher and guidance counselor  Eventually  her career took a different path  and she became her husband s assistant  adviser  and traveling companion  They had one daughter together  Patricia Hooks Gray     As Dr  Hooks continued to practice law  he was called to fight for civil rights from another forum  the ministry  In 1956  he was ordained a Baptist minister and began to preach regularly at the Middle Baptist Church in Memphis  Tennessee  It was there he joined Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and became a pioneer in the NAACP sponsored restaurant sit ins and other boycotts     Through these efforts  he became a respected voice in the community and in the State  In 1965  Gov  Frank Clement appointed him to become the first African American criminal court judge in Tennessee history     His efforts as a preacher  judge  and civil rights pioneer eventually led Hooks to Washington  D C   to become the first African American appointee to the Federal Communications Commission  There he continued the civil rights fight by addressing numerous minority representation issues in the communications industry     In 1976  he was elected as the executive director of the NAACP  where he led that organization for more than 15 years  As a director  he helped to increase membership and fundraising efforts  as well as plan for the organization s future for 17 years     He also broadened the scope of the NAACP by exploring national issues such as energy  the environment  the criminal justice system  welfare  and national health insurance     Throughout his work as a civil rights advocate  he has received numerous awards  including the Humanitarian Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews  and the Freedom Award from the National Civil Rights Museum     The University of Memphis created the Benjamin L  Hooks Institute for Social Change  honoring Benjamin Hooks  The Hooks Institute works to advance understanding of the civil rights movement through teaching  research  and community programs and puts an emphasis on social movements  race relations  strong communities  public education  effective public participation  and social and economic justice     On Monday  I am pleased that Dr  Hooks will receive one more honor  one of the highest civilian awards  the Presidential Medal of Freedom  This medal is given to individuals who have made an especially meritorious contribution to society     Dr  Hooks is a living example of that type of person  His life is an example that even while facing adversity through hard work  you can accomplish revolutionary change  His legacy will not only continue in our State but also throughout our Nation     So it is only fitting that through this award he once again joins the ranks of other civil rights pioneers such as Martin Luther King  Jr   Clarence M  Mitchell  Leon Howard Sullivan  and Roy Wilkins     It is an honor and a privilege to serve in the Senate on behalf of Tennesseans such as Dr  Hooks  who have exemplified the great courage that has not only positively affected our State but our country as well    Established by Executive Order 11085 in 1963  the Presidential Medal of Freedom may be awarded by the President to any person who has made an especially meritorious contribution to  1  the security or national interests of the United States  or  2  world peace  or  3  cultural or other significant public or private endeavors
