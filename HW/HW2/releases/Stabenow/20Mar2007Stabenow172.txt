SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF U.S. ATTORNEYS BILL
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Tuesday, March 20, released the following statement on the Senate passage of the U.S. Attorneys bill (S.214):  
   "Recent revelations regarding the firing of U.S. Prosecutors from across the country has again highlighted the need for strict Senate oversight of Administration appointees, especially when those appointees are required to impartially enforce our laws. 
   "Only by following our tradition of checks and balances and insisting on Senate confirmation for Federal Prosecutors will we be able to take politics out of the equation and keep it out of the courtroom. I support this effort and feel that the 120 day time limit for temporary appointments should be enforced immediately."- U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
