SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $270,000 COMING TO GRAND RAPIDS FOR CRIME PREVENTION AND NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that the city of Grand Rapids will receive $272,887 for neighborhood-based crime prevention activities. The funds were awarded under the Department of Justice FY 2007 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program.  
   "Preventing crime in our cities and neighborhoods requires the implementation of new strategies and ideas," said Stabenow. "This program gives the city of Grand Rapids and law enforcement officials the resources needed to continue their great work, keeping families safe." 
   "Adequately funding our local law enforcement agencies is one of the most important steps we can take towards protecting our homes and communities," said Levin. "We depend on local police officers for our basic safety, and this federal funding will help provide them with the equipment and resources they need."
   The city of Grand Rapids and Kent County will use the funding to improve neighborhood safety, encourage internet-based reporting, and to upgrade their information technology systems. The internet-based reporting allows citizens to report less serious incidents online to reduce long waiting periods for citizens choosing phone-based reporting. 
   The Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program (JAG) allocates funds to states, tribes, and local governments for crime prevention initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice for any one of the following purpose areas: law enforcement programs, prosecution and court programs, prevention and education programs, corrections and community corrections programs, drug treatment programs, and planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.
