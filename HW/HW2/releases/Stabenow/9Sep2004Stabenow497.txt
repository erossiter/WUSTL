SEN. STABENOW SPONSORS EFFORT TO FULLY FUND FIRST RESPONDERS
  Despite the fact that a blue-ribbon panel warned more than a year ago that the United States is not providing adequate resources to local emergency responders, the Senate today failed to pass an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, authored by Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT), that would implement the panel's recommendations. 
   It was Stabenow's second attempt to provide an additional $15 billion to train and equip first responders, a legislative proposal based on the recommendations of a task force headed by former Republican Senator Warren Rudman and including Nobel laureates, U.S. military leaders, former high-level government officials and other senior experts. The panel's findings were released in June 2003 in a report titled "Emergency Responders: Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared."
   Stabenow expressed great concern today that the failure of her amendment represents a willingness of Senate leadership to talk about homeland security but an unwillingness to take strong action to strengthen it. The amendment failed on a procedural point of order, which raises the number of votes needed for passage to 60 instead of a simple majority.
   "As a result of my meetings all across the state of Michigan with first responders in the past two years, I have learned first-hand how desperately our police officers and firefighters need federal assistance to protect their communities from a wide variety of potential terrorist actions," Stabenow said. "The Rudman report confirmed at the national level what I observed at the state level, and it gave specific recommendations on how to meet these new threats. The amendment Senator Dodd and I offered is based on a sense of urgency that we need to implement these recommendations now."
   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill contains approximately $5 billion for first responders. The Rudman report recommended $98.4 billion over five years, and the Stabenow-Dodd amendment would have raised first responder funding for one year to $20 billion, in line with the report.
   "The Rudman report made clear that every piece of equipment you could name that might be needed in a chemical, radiological or biological attack - masks, protective clothing, or laboratory facilities - is in short supply or not available in our communities," Stabenow said. "Even the most basic tool of first responders - communications equipment - is not available to all personnel or does not effectively link all agencies that may respond to a potential terrorist incident. This is simply unacceptable for our families.
   "Even as we move to consider the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, I am deeply concerned about Congress' unwillingness to act, based on this earlier report on homeland protection," Stabenow said. "Because I represent Michigan - a state with a long international border - I feel a special obligation to the people of my state and the nation to press this issue, and I will continue to press it until the actions of Congress and the administration to protect our homeland match their promises."
   A comparison of funding under the bill's original language and the Stabenow-Dodd amendment follows:
   First Responders Amendment ("Stabenow-Dodd")
   The Amendment increases funding four-fold for programs effecting first responders in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill.
   In the current language:
   * State and Local Programs are funded at $2.8 billion
   * Emergency Management Performance Grants are funded at $180 million
   * Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate (operating expenses) is funded at $461.4 million;
   * Firefighter Assistance Grants are funded at $700 million
   * Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is funded at $181.4 million
   * Staffing for Adequate Firefighter and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants is not funded.
   Total: Less than $5 billion ($4.8 billion) for first responders in FY2005
   If the Stabenow-Dodd amendment were adopted:
   * State and Local Programs will be funded at $11.5 billion
   * Emergency Management Performance Grants will be funded at $660 million
   * Emergency Management Performance Grants (operating expenses) will be funded at $3.3 billion;
   * Firefighter Assistance Grants will be funded at $3 billion
   * Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate will be funded at $3.3 billion
   * Federal Law Enforcement Training Center will be funded at $690 million
   * Staffing for Adequate Firefighter and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants will be funded at $1 billion
   Total: more than $20 billion ($20.15 billion) for first responders in FY 2005.
