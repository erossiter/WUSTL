SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING NEGOTIATION OF KOREAN TRADE AGREEMENT
 Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the United States Trade Representative's official announcement of its intent to enter into negotiations for a free trade agreement with South Korea: 
   "Today's news couldn't have come at a worse time for Michigan. 
   "We already know that trade between the United States and South Korea is skewed heavily against American automakers. Last year, only 5,415 American-made vehicles were allowed to be sold in South Korea, while nearly 700,000 South Korean cars and trucks were sold here in the United States. 
   "The President must take immediate action to ensure a level playing field for American automakers. He must insist that countries like China and Japan stop violating our trade agreements. And he must ensure that any new trade agreements won't make things worse for American manufacturers. 
   "I will do everything in my power to fight any agreement that does not rectify this outrageous imbalance in the auto trade."
