SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $453,920 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR EIGHT MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that eight fire departments in the state of Michigan have received $453,920 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 Each community will use the funds for fire operations and firefighter safety programs.
  "When disaster strikes our firefighters are the first to respond, ready to risk their lives to protect others," said Levin. "These grants will help ensure that these brave men and women have the proper training and equipment necessary to do their jobs." 
   "The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program enables firefighters to enhance their ability to do their jobs, improve safety and preserve lives," Stabenow said. "This round of grants will enable eight Michigan fire departments to provide better firefighting protection for the communities they serve."
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Fire Administration. The fire operations and firefighter safety programs provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. 
   Fire departments receiving operations and firefighter safety grants are:
