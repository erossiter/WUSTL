SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON BRAC ANNOUNCEMENTS ON MICHIGAN MILITARY FACILITIES
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) offered the following comments today on the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission regarding Michigan's military facilities:  
   "This is good news for Michigan's military, their families and our communities. The Secretary of Defense's recommendations will result in a net increase in jobs for Michigan. I am pleased that the Department recognizes the unique and valuable expertise our Michigan military installations bring to our nation's homeland security.
   "Making the case about the importance of Michigan's military installations to our nation's homeland security has been a top priority for me, and I am proud we were successful. I worked hard with my colleagues in the Michigan delegation, Governor Granholm and the communities involved to ensure that these facilities can continue their excellent work.
   "Our nation is facing great challenges at home and abroad, and we need to continue to maximize our military's fighting capability and efficiency for the safety of all of America's communities."
