SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $50 MILLION FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN MICHIGAN
  Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that the Senate-passed military construction appropriations bill includes over $50 million for projects in Michigan. The Senate approved the legislation last night by a vote of 91-0.  
   "The military construction bill funds much of the infrastructure for our military facilities in this country and across the world," said Levin. "Michigan's National Guard and Reserve play critical roles in both our homeland security and national security. The new construction and safety improvements included in this legislation will contribute significantly to the training and readiness of the men and women in the Guard and Reserve in Michigan."
   "Almost 40 percent of the U.S. forces in Iraq are Guard and Reserve units," Stabenow said. "Our modern Army could not conduct operations without these units, and their training facilities need to be first-rate. This bill will provide much-needed infrastructure upgrades at Michigan facilities. I was especially pleased that in the Senate we were able to add $9.7 million for a military police facility at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and $8.5 for a squadron operations training facility at the Combat Readiness Training Facility in Alpena."
   The military construction appropriations bill includes funding for the following Michigan projects: 
   * $27.6 million for an Army Aviation Support Facility in Grand Ledge. This funding will be used to construct a new Army Aviation Support Facility to accommodate the new mission of 22 UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that the Michigan Army National Guard is authorized to receive as part of the Army National Guard Aviation Transformation Program.
   * $8.5 million for a Squadron Operations Facility at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center. This new facility will replace six existing buildings that date back to the 1940s. The new facilities at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center will provide a more realistic environment for how the Guard deploys today.
   * $5.1 million for a new Fire Crash Rescue Center at Kellogg Air Field, the home of the 110th Fighter Wing. The facility currently fails to meet the needs of Air National Guard unit stationed at W.K. Kellogg Field in Battle Creek. The current conditions lead to overcrowding and reduce the ability of the unit to train and execute its fire protection plan for the fighter wing.
   * $9.7 million for a new Joint Security Forces Operation Center at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. This project will enable both Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard security forces to consolidate their missions. Currently, both security forces lack the space needed to fulfill their duties. This facility will promote "jointness" while unifying operations that are currently conducted in several aging facilities at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
   The House passed the military construction appropriations bill in July. The legislation now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to work out the differences between the two bills.
