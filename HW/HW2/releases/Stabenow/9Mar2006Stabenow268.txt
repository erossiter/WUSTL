SEN. STABENOW FIGHTS BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT WILL HURT AMERICA'S VETERANS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) has led an effort calling on Senate Budget Committee members to reject President Bush's plan to double the cost of prescription drug co-payments and charge an annual enrollment fee for middle-income veterans. The President's budget could increase health care costs for as many as 39,000 Michigan veterans.  
   In a letter to Budget Committee leaders, Stabenow and 18 of her Senate colleagues called these proposals "unacceptable" and "harmful to America's veterans." 
   "The President's budget increases the co-pay for a 30-day supply of prescription drugs from $8 to $15 and imposes an annual $250 enrollment fee for middle-income veterans," the senators wrote. "It is unacceptable to place the burden of needed increases for veterans' health care on the shoulders of America's veterans themselves."
   As of June 2005, approximately 393,000 veterans that have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have entered the VA health care system. More than 100,000 of these veterans have already sought treatment from VA medical centers. 
   "When we have thousands of brave men and women returning home we should not be asking them to pay for medical care they were promised," wrote the senators.
