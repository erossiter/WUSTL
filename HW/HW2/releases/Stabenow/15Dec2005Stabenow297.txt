SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $323,895 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR MICHIGAN
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that seven fire departments in Michigan have received a total of $323,895 in grants under the terms of the fiscal year 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Michigan's local fire departments, like other first responders, need to enhance their training, improve their equipment, and add manpower as necessary to meet new threats and challenges," Stabenow said. "This funding will aid these seven fire departments in their efforts to make their communities safer."
   "Keeping Michigan's fire departments well-trained and fully staffed is an important goal," said Levin. "This is a significant step in helping these communities to effectively fight fires and respond to natural disasters."
   The Operations and Firefighter Safety Program provides funding for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The Recruitment and Retention of Volunteer Firefighters grants are intended to increase the number of competent firefighters who are trained, certified, and capable of responding to emergencies likely to occur within the fire department's geographic area.
