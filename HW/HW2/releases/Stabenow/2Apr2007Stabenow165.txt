SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON SOUTH KOREAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Monday, April 2, 2007, released the following statement on the Bush Administration's announcement of a South Korean Free Trade Agreement.  
   "The South Korean trade agreement is a bad deal for American workers and American businesses. By hastily pushing through this deal with South Korea before the fast track deadline the Administration has delivered another agreement that will increase our trade deficit, cost us jobs, and hurt our automobile industry and other manufacturers. 
   "Trade only works when the playing field is level, and there is nothing fair about an agreement that allows over 750,000 South Korean automobiles into America annually while South Korea continues to use high tariffs and other trade barriers to limit the number of American cars they import to fewer than 5,000 a year. The automobile industry built the middle class in this country, and by supporting this agreement the Administration has turned its back on our working families.
   "American workers deserve an agreement that is fair for America. A truly fair agreement should raise the standard of living, ensure market access to both countries, and uphold competition, and this agreement fails on all counts. I will do everything in my power to defeat this agreement and ensure that any future fast-track authority includes provisions guaranteeing that American businesses and workers can get a fair deal."-US Senator Debbie Stabenow.
