SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: DEQ FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CANADIAN TRASH AGREEMENT
  In an annual report to the State Legislature, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality today released a report documenting a 1,101,923 cubic yard reduction in imports of Canadian waste being dumped in Michigan landfills. This reduction is consistent with the benchmarks established in an agreement between Senators Stabenow and Levin in 2006 with Canadian officials to phase out municipally-managed waste from Ontario being dumped in Michigan. While the DEQ report does not make conclusions regarding the reasons for the reduction in waste, the report references "Ontario's commitment to phase out its exports of municipally managed solid waste to Michigan," as a factor in the reduction of waste.
   "For the first time this decade, trash imports from Canada have finally gone down," said Stabenow. "I'm encouraged by this progress and will continue to work with Ontario officials to ensure the terms of our agreement with Canada are met and all municipally-managed waste from Canada stops in 2010." 
   "The DEQ report indicates that the agreement with Ontario to phase out municipally managed waste shipments seems to be working," Levin said. "One way or another Canada needs to stop filling up Michigan landfills, clogging up bridges and highways, and threatening our environment, health and security."
   Facts & Figures:
   Under the terms of the Stabenow-Levin agreement, Ontario committed to a 20% reduction of Canadian municipally-managed solid waste by the end of 2007. The agreement calls for a total reduction of 40% by the end of 2008 and a complete stop to all municipally-managed trash by the end of the 2010 calendar year.
   In August 2006, Ontario municipalities were shipping 1.48 million tons (1.34 million metric tonnes) of municipally-managed waste to Michigan. A 20% reduction equates to 296,000 tons or 888,000 cubic yards (based on a DEQ estimate of trash density that 1 ton of trash is 3 cubic yards in volume).
   The January 31, 2008, DEQ report to the Legislature reflects imports through September 30, 2007. (The deadline for the first 20% benchmark noted in the agreement is by the end of 2007.)
   This report shows a reduction of Canadian imports of 1,101,923 cubic yards or 367,308 tons from Oct 1, 2006, to September 30, 2007, which is consistent with the agreement.
   It is complicated to compare Canadian reports and Michigan reports. Ontario reports only their municipally managed trash exports by metric tonnes. The DEQ reports imports by cubic yards. Moreover, the DEQ definitions of municipal waste (Type II) and industrial waste (Type III) are different than how the Canadians define municipally-managed waste.
   As reported by the DEQ, the difference in total Canadian trash imports from Canada between FY 2006 and FY 2007 represents an overall percentage decrease of over 9%. Assuming commercial and industrial trash imports are constant, a 20% reduction in municipally-managed trash, as defined by the Stabenow-Levin agreement, would be consistent with the DEQ data.
   In contrast to the DEQ whose report reflects imports through September 30th, Ontario officials are reporting their exports through December 31st and are still in the process of collecting data. However, Ontario officials have stated that they are on track to meet their 2007 reduction target outlined in the agreement. Their efforts include the approval of 55 million tons of new landfill capacity in Ontario in the last two years, which should impact future reductions.
