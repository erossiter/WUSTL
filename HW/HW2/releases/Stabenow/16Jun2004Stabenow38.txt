SEN. STABENOW: INCREASE IN ALZHEIMER'S FUNDING WOULD BE A FITTING TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow and a bipartisan group of senators are introducing legislation - named in honor of the late President Ronald Reagan - that seeks to double funding for Alzheimer's research and significantly boost funding for caregivers and support services. 
   Stabenow is also one of 58 senators who wrote President Bush on June 4, urging the president to expand embryonic stem cell research to help understand diseases like Alzheimer's. She addressed both stem cell research and Alzheimer's funding in her tribute to Reagan on the Senate floor, saying that increased research on this disease was a fitting way to honor the late president.
   "We need to go beyond the erecting of a monument or the etching of a portrait," Stabenow said. "Instead, we need to act to help the many Americans who needlessly suffer from the debilitating effects of Alzheimer's disease, and we can do that with quick passage of the 'Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004.'"
   Key provisions of the bill would:
   * Double to $1.4 billion the funding for Alzheimer's research at the National Institute of Health
   * Double to $250 million the authorized funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program.
   * Reauthorize the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program, increase its authorized funding, and expand the program to every state to fill in gaps in Alzheimer's services, such as respite care, home health care and day care.
   * Authorize $7 million for a public education campaign to inform the public about prevention techniques.
   * Provide a tax credit of up to $3,000 to help family caregivers with the cost of caring for a loved one, such as a family member, with Alzheimer's.
   "In her unwavering commitment to her husband, former First Lady Nancy Reagan not only provided a testament to their love but also extended hope and empathy to countless Americans who share in the role of care-giver," Stabenow said. "We must build on her example with a national commitment that supports hope with real research, and love with financial assistance."
   "This great national effort - and the prospect of a victory over this terrible disease - is the greatest tribute we could offer President Reagan and his family, and the greatest gift we could give all the families whose lives are affected by Alzheimer's," Stabenow said.
