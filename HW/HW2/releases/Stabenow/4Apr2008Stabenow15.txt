SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. ASSASSINATION
  "Today, we pay tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was killed 40 years ago in Memphis, Tennessee. We look back on this day to honor a man whose life, though it ended prematurely at the age of 39, dedicated his time on this earth to promoting peace, equality, and economic justice. We don't celebrate a single victory, but rather the continuing drive that has moved generations to action. And in doing so, we are reminded of how much progress we have made in the last 40 years while acknowledging that there's still plenty of work to do." 
   "Forty years later we are again fighting another war that is costing thousands of young American lives and turning the attention and resources away from our economic problems here at home. We still live in a country where over 47 million people lack health insurance and too many African Americans live in poverty."
   "But we only need to look at our presidential candidates this year to realize we have made progress and change is always possible. Today is a reminder that each one of us is an agent of change, as Dr. King was and that each one of us truly can make a difference in this world."
   -U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
