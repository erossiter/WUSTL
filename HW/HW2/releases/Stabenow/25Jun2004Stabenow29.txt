With the help of Senator Levin, the 127th Fighter Wing at Selfridge Air National Guard base was among the first units in the nation to have this technology, which enables pilots to better deliver precision guided munitions. These pods have been used by Selfridge pilots when deployed overseas, and these additional pods will be used by National Guard units, including those at Selfridge, as they are deployed.
   Manufacturing Extension Program: The bill included an amendment that would make available additional funds for the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP). The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) helps small and mid-sized American manufacturers modernize and stay competitive in a global marketplace by boosting. The administration's 2004 budget reduced funding for this program by 88 percent.
   This amendment clarified that the Department of Commerce has the ability to transfer and reprogram $21.8 million to the MEP Program in fiscal year 2004. The Department of Commerce had argued that it was only able to reprogram up to $3.9 million for this program. This language will enable additional funds to be provided to our nation's 60 MEP centers. These centers are public-private partnerships that prove technical assistance and business support services to small manufacturers so that they can compete in the global market place.
   The House of Representatives passed the defense appropriations bill on June 22. The differences between the two bills will now be worked out in a conference committee.
