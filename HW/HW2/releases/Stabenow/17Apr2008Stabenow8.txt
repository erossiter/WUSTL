SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: $8 MILLION ALLOCATED TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO DOWNTOWN SAGINAW
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced Senate passage of a bill to provide technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The legislation includes language that would provide $8 million in funds to construct an interchange at I-675 and Warren Avenue near downtown Saginaw. 
   "Construction of this downtown Saginaw interchange will provide direct access to downtown Saginaw," said Stabenow. "This funding offers an economic boost to the city of Saginaw while improving safety for neighborhood residents and protecting the Saginaw River."
   "Providing easy access to downtown Saginaw from I-675 will benefit residents and businesses alike," Levin said. "With the passage of this bill, construction of the interchange at I-675 and Warren Avenue can now move forward."
   In the 2005 transportation bill, the Michigan Department of Transportation received federal funding in the amount of $8 million to construct the interchange at I-675 and M-13 (Washington Avenue) northbound exit. The intended purpose of the legislation was to finance a project which would provide direct access to the Saginaw Central Business District from the I-675 corridor. However, it was determined by Saginaw businesses, residents, and religious groups that an interchange at I-675 and Warren Avenue would be a better location, and funding could not be allocated without amending the language in the bill. Today's legislation amends that language to relocate the construction of the interchange.
   The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for final passage and then sent to the President for his signature into law.
