SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON GM, UAW TENTATIVE LABOR CONTRACT AGREEMENT
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the tentative labor contract reached between General Motors and the UAW.  
   "I am very pleased that after months of hard work on all sides General Motors and the UAW have been able to come together to support an agreement that they believe makes sense for our working families while helping one of America's top employers stay competitive in a global marketplace. This administration's total lack of a cohesive manufacturing policy that makes sense for America has left our businesses and our workers in a tough spot, and only by working together will we be able to turn things around and level the playing field against international competition."
