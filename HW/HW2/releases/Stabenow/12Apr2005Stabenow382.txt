SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $1.9 MILLION IN HEALTH GRANTS TO HELP MICHIGAN RESIDENTS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE
  Three Michigan health centers, which deliver preventive and primary care to patients regardless of their ability to pay, have received grants totaling more the $1.9 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Sens.  
 Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin said today. 
   "Michigan's health care centers provide important basic and preventive health care, and I have supported the requests of these three centers for this vital funding," Stabenow said. "These grants will help preserve access to vital health care services for uninsured and medically underserved residents in the Upper Peninsula and southeastern Michigan."
   "It is comforting to know that if you lose your health benefits because of layoffs, or are not able to afford increasing health costs, there are heath centers that will still be able to offer care for you and your family," said Levin. "This funding will help the very important mission of these three health centers to expand access to heath care in their communities." 
   The grants are a continuation of a five-year initiative to help communities across the country create or expand access to comprehensive primary health care services. Almost 40 percent of the patients treated at health centers have no insurance coverage, and others have inadequate coverage. Charges for health care services are set according to income.
