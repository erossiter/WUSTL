SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR FIRE SAFETY IN MICHIGAN
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that Rescue 1 Fire Safety for Kids of Jenison will receive $38,000 and E.S.C.A.P.E. Inc. of Kalamazoo will receive $25,000 for fire prevention and safety programs. The funds are awarded under the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP).  
   "Protecting our communities from fire and hazards must start with public education and public awareness," said Stabenow. "I'm grateful this funding will provide Jenison and Kalamazoo the resources needed to prevent fire and other hazard-related accidents."
   "It is enormously important that we do everything we can to keep our children safe from fire-related hazards," said Levin. "This funding will help emergency personnel in Jenison and Kalamazoo prepare for and prevent such a disaster."
   The primary goal of the AFGP Fire Prevention and Safety Program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, is to mitigate or prevent the danger to the public and first responders posed by fire and other hazards. Projects supported by the program include fire prevention and public safety education campaigns, media outreach, and arson prevention and awareness programs.
