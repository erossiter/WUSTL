SEN. STABENOW REACTION TO BUSH'S NATIONAL ADDRESS ON IRAQ
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Wednesday, Jan. 10, issued the following statement in reaction to President Bush's national address calling for more troops in Iraq: 
   "The President's proposal to escalate the number of American troops in Iraq is a mistake. We must do everything we can to support our men and women in Iraq, but it is wrong to put more of our troops in harms way when we have no clear strategy for success. I was hopeful that the President would set out a new policy for Iraq that included measures of accountability and was achievable, but again I was disappointed. Our men and women in uniform deserve better, and we should expect more from our Commander in Chief. 
   "It is time for the Iraqi government to step up and begin to take care of its own security so that our troops can begin to step back. That process should begin not with more American boots on the ground, but with political pressure from the White House that will shift responsibility for Iraq to the Iraqis. Escalation is not the solution, and committing more American troops without an exit strategy will not lead to greater security and stability in Iraq or get us any closer to bringing our men and women home."--Senator Debbie Stabenow.
