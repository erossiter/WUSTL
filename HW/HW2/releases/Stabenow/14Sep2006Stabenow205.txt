SEN. STABENOW: NEW REPORT SHOWS INVESTMENTS IN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY WILL BRING JOBS TO MICHIGAN
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today joined the Apollo Alliance and the Economic Policy Institute in releasing a new report on jobs created by alternative energy legislation she has sponsored in the Senate. The report finds that more than 29,000 new jobs would be created in Michigan by the provisions included in the Clean EDGE Act (S. 2829). Michigan would rank third in the nation in terms of jobs created by alternative energy investments.  
   "Investments in alternative energy will create thousands of jobs in Michigan," Stabenow said. "That's why this new report is great news for us. These good-paying jobs would benefit many parts of Michigan's economy, boosting our manufacturers, farmers, automakers and research centers."
   Michigan has lost nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. According to the Apollo Alliance/Economic Policy Institute report, if the Clean EDGE Act is fully implemented by 2009, it would create 530,000 jobs in the U.S. Nearly half of the new jobs created would be manufacturing jobs.
   "Americans are looking forward to a future where we buy fuel produced in the Midwest instead of the Middle East," Stabenow said. "It is also clear our energy independence plans mean jobs for the future. Michigan has the innovators, the engineers and the talented workforce that makes it the perfect place to develop these new technologies and jobs."
