SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today released the following statement following Senate passage of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King and Cesar E. Chavez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization Act of 2006:  
   "There is nothing more fundamental to our democracy than the right to vote. After a fight that lasted far too long, the 1965 Voting Rights Act ensured that all Americans have this basic right.
   "Our country has made great progress in civil rights since the original law was enacted, but there is a lot more that needs to be done. There are many subtle forms of voter intimidation and suppression that still exist today, from voters being told to go to the wrong polling place to hours-long lines for under-staffed and under-equipped polling stations in urban communities.
   "These practices are a reminder that our laws are only as good as the people enforcing them. Passing this bill is an important first step, but as a Congress, we need to do more than just support the Voting Rights Act. We need put a stop to these subversive forms of voter intimidation and harassment that continue to undermine this most fundamental right in our communities.
   "This bill is named for four of our country's most beloved civil rights leaders, including Detroit's own Rosa Parks, whose courage led her to be called 'the mother of the civil rights movement.' I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation.".
