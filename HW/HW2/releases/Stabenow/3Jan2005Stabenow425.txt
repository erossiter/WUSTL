SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $311,040 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN ALGER, GARDEN CITY MICHIGAN
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that two fire departments in the state of Michigan have received $311,040 in grants from the Department of Homeland Security.  
 Garden City Fire Department will receive $85,140 for fire operations and firefighter safety programs and Wildwood Fire Department in Alger will receive $225,900 for the firefighting vehicle acquisition program. 
  "We must ensure our firefighters have the necessary resources to do their jobs," said Levin. "This funding will strengthen each department's ability to respond to emergencies while minimizing the risks to the men and women who work so hard to protect our lives," Levin said.
   "Every fire department in Michigan faces critical challenges in protecting local residents and their property, " Stabenow said. "These grants will help the Wildwood and Garden City Fire Departments obtain the equipment and training they need to meet these challenges. "
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Fire Administration. The fire operations and firefighter safety programs provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. The vehicle acquisition program allows departments to purchase vehicles, such as tankers, rescue vehicles, foam units and ambulances.
