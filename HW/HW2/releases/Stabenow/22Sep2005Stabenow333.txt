SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE FUNDING IN AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR EMERALD ASH BORER, BOVINE TB, CORMORANT CONTROL
  The fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill approved by the U.S. Senate today provides funding to address important Michigan agriculture concerns, targeting such problems as the apple fire blight, bovine tuberculosis, cormorant control and the emerald ash borer.  
   "Michigan faces some unique challenges like bovine TB and the emerald ash borer that could easily become national problems if not contained and eliminated," Stabenow said. "Michigan's fishing and tourism industries are also severely challenged by the growing flocks of cormorants along our shores. "Our efforts in addressing these problems, as well as Michigan's economy in general, will benefit greatly from the funding for these programs and projects."
   "Michigan's vibrant agricultural sector is a vital part of the state economy," said Levin. "As we face threats such as the emerald ash borer, it is critical that we have the resources we need to adapt and prevent these problems from doing severe damage. This funding will not only help keep a number of potential dangers under control, it will also provide Michigan's farmers with an important boost in fruit production and sustainable practices."
   The Senate bill contains the following funding for Michigan:
   * Cormorant control - $100,000
   * Armillaria root rot - $151,000
   * Improved fruit practices - $212,000
   * Bovine tuberculosis - $356,000
   * Sustainable agriculture - $384,000
   * Phytophthora research - $500,000
   * Apple fire blight (joint with NY) - $483,000
   * Wood utilization (Joint with AK, OR, MS, MN, NC, ME, ID, TN, WV) - $6,235,000
   In addition, Senate appropriators have agreed to request of Stabenow and Levin, that the final version of the bill after a House-Senate conference contain the $14 million to combat the emerald ash borer, the House-approved funding amount. This will be an $8 million increase over the amount included in the Senate bill.
