SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF KELLOGG CEO GUTIERREZ TO SERVE AS SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) made the following statement today in reaction to the report that Carlos Gutierrez, chairman and chief executive officer of Michigan-based Kellogg Co., has been nominated to serve as secretary of commerce: 
  "I am pleased that Carlos Gutierrez has been nominated by President Bush to serve as Commerce Secretary, and I support his nomination. Carlos Gutierrez and the Kellogg Company are both Michigan success stories, and it's good for Michigan when we have a voice at the Cabinet table reflecting Michigan values and concerns.
   "Carlos Gutierrez has a strong track record of working on a bipartisan basis, a quality that will become increasingly important as we tackle difficult issues like the ballooning deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs that plague Michigan and the nation. He brings to the job first-hand knowledge of the global economy, a perspective that is essential to his new role.
   "The Commerce Department has been slow to react in the last four years to our continuing loss of manufacturing jobs. I look forward to working with the new secretary to protect America's and Michigan's manufacturing jobs."
