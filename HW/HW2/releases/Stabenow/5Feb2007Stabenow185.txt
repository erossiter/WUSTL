SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON BUSH'S FY 2008 BUDGET PROPOSAL
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Monday, Feb. 5, issued the following statement on the release of President Bush's FY 2008 budget:  
   "The budget should be a reflection of our national priorities, but once again President Bush has shown he is out of step with the majority of Americans. The President's budget sends billions of dollars in new reconstruction funds to Iraq, while cutting vital domestic programs here at home.
   "President Bush also continues to ignore the need for fiscal responsibility, failing to make the tough choices to address our overwhelming deficit. The policies of the Bush White House have cost us jobs and saddled our country with an enormous debt.
   "Michigan, and America, deserve better. 
   "The White House has again missed an opportunity for true bipartisanship and refused to address the long term fiscal challenges that face America. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to develop a more responsible budget that reflects our values and priorities and works for the people of Michigan." -U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
