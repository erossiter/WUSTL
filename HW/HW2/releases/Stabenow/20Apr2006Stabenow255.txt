SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON CHINESE PRESIDENT'S WHITE HOUSE VISIT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding Chinese President Hu Jintao's White House visit and meeting with President George W. Bush:  
   "China's illegal trade practices are a growing crisis for American workers and American manufacturers. Nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last five years alone. This Administration must stop ignoring the problem.
   "We know that China is cheating. We know that they manipulate their currency, making their products artificially cheaper than American-made goods. We know that they dump counterfeit auto parts and other products in our markets. We know that they steal our patents and violate intellectual property laws. 
   "American workers and American businesses can compete with anyone in the world on a level playing field. Now is the time for the President to get tough and demand that China stop these violations immediately. Unless we take action, American jobs, American industries and our very way of life are at stake. We need the President to stand up and fight for us."
