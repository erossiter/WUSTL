SEN. STABENOW SUPPORTS SENATE CONFIRMATION OF GUTIERREZ AS COMMERCE SECRETARY
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and her Senate colleagues on Monday confirmed President Bush's selection of Carlos Gutierrez, former chairman and chief executive officer of Michigan-based Kellogg Co., to serve as U.S. Secretary of Commerce.  
   Earlier this month Stabenow introduced Gutierrez to the Senate Commerce Committee, which held a hearing on the appointment in advance of the Senate vote. Stabenow testified in support of the Gutierrez nomination, saying that Gutierrez was, "without a doubt the right man for the job." 
   Stabenow reaffirmed her support for Gutierrez today, noting his leadership skills but also calling attention to the serious and immediate challenges the new cabinet secretary will face. 
   "Mr. Gutierrez has been an effective and visionary leader at Kellogg. When he began his leadership, sales were flagging. He turned things around. He reduced the company's debt and increased net sales by 43 percent - helping to make Kellogg the number-one cereal maker in the United States.
   "Now more than ever, our nation needs a strong leader to create jobs here at home." Stabenow said. "The loss of 2.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and increased outsourcing continues to hurt millions of American families. We especially need his help in Michigan, where we have lost 225,000 jobs over the last four years. That number puts Michigan near the top of the list of states in the country with the highest number of recent job losses.
   Stabenow - who has introduced Senate bill S.14 to expand economic opportunity for all Americans by protecting U.S. jobs, enforcing trade agreements, and investing in infrastructure and innovation - said she looked forward to working with Gutierrez on these critical issues.
