SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $350,000 FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION PROGRAM FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, FAMILIES IN SAGINAW
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women is awarding $350,000 to Saginaw County to fund a supervised visitation and exchange program for families with a history of domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault or stalking.  
   "Domestic violence tears families apart every day and it is imperative that we do everything we can to help them recover," said Levin. "This funding will give families in Saginaw the opportunity to put their lives back together in a safe and positive environment. This will be a valuable program for children and families in the Bay Thumb area."
   "Kids who have suffered from or witnessed violence at home should not have to worry about more violence during family visits," Stabenow said. "With SafePlace, we have one more resource to help break the cycle of violence in Michigan homes and communities." 
   Saginaw County will collaborate with the 10th Circuit Court of Michigan, Saginaw County Court and the Underground Railroad, Inc. to establish SafePlace, a supervised visitation and exchange program aimed at providing greater options for families with a history of violence and/or abuse. Specifically, the 10th Circuit Court and Saginaw County Court will submit referrals to the program and provide staff training on the role of the legal system in situations of domestic violence. The program will also collaborate with the Police Chief's Association, the City of Saginaw Police Chief and the director of Saginaw County 911 to develop an emergency response protocol, provide input on proposed safety policies and procedures and draft an orientation booklet that clearly outlines the program and its guidelines.
