SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the Senate's passage of the Military Commissions Act:  
   "There is nothing more important than keeping America safe from those who would cause us harm. It is critical that we have a system in place to handle enemy combatants in the war on terror and bring them to justice, which is why I supported this legislation. If we had not passed this bill, our military would not have been able to move forward with trials against suspected terrorists now in U.S. custody. I voted for a number of amendments that would have strengthened this bill, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to make these improvements."
