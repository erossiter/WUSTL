SENS. STABENOW, BROWN EFFORT TO PROMOTE FAIR TRADE PASSES SENATE IN COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE BILL
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced Senate passage of an amendment to promote U.S. businesses and fair trade, as part of the Commerce Justice Science Appropriations Bill. The Stabenow-Brown-Byrd-Rockefeller-Levin amendment is intended to ensure that the federal government is effectively enforcing the U.S. trade laws and taking action when those laws are infringed. Senators Stabenow and Brown released the following statements: 
   "This administration's refusal to properly enforce trade agreements has hurt the middle class in Michigan and across our country. It is time for a new trade agenda in this country- one that ensures our trading partners are following the rules and has the right enforcement to prevent unsafe products that are currently getting into the hands of our children."
   - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
   "It's a new day. The Senate finally understands what Americans have known for years- U.S. trade policy needs a new direction. Today's vote sends a message to the Bush administration that they need to vigorously enforce our trade laws. Unfair trade practices hurt our manufacturers and workers. In the past six years, the U.S. lost 3 million manufacturing jobs, and Ohio lost more than 180,000. Too many countries have repeatedly exploited loopholes to gain an unfair advantage. American industry can compete with anyone in the world, when the rules are fair."
   - U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown
