SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF MICHAEL MUKASEY TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF U. S.
 U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the nomination of Judge Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States.  
   "At a time when the Justice Department is suffering from poor morale and our treatment of detainees has sullied our reputation overseas, we need an Attorney General who speaks with independent, moral clarity. 
   "Unfortunately, Judge Mukasey's answers to questions put forward to him by members of the Judiciary Committee were evasive, overly legalistic and nearly identical to White House policy. In other words, I believe that Judge Mukasey will simply give us more of the same at the Justice Department and that is why I am opposing his nomination."-U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
