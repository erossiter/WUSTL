SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $68,000 COMING TO MICHIGAN STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE FOR IDLEWILD, MARY'S CITY OF DAVID
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office will receive $68,843 to support heritage tourism in Idlewild and at Mary's City of David in Benton Harbor. The funds were awarded under the 2007 Preserve America Grant program.  
   "Developing and maintaining our state's historical communities helps to preserve our past, while improving local economies," said Stabenow. "I'm thankful this grant will provide Mary's City of David and Idlewild with the resources needed to further develop these locations as tourist destinations."
   "This federal funding will help promote the preservation and the appreciation of Michigan's cultural heritage," said Levin. "I am pleased that visitors will have the opportunity to learn about these important pieces of Michigan history."
   The primary goal of the Preserve America Grant program is to preserve historic and cultural sites by supporting resource management strategies and sound business practices. State and tribal historic preservation offices, designated Preserve America Communities and certified local governments that have applied for Preserve America Community designation are eligible to apply for Preserve America Grants. The 2007 federal budget contains approximately $5 million for grants to support community efforts.
