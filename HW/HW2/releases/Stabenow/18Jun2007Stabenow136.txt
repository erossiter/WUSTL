SEN. STABENOW TOURS GRAND RAPIDS HOME FOR VETERANS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today met with residents, family members, and administrators after touring the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans. The Senator made a visit to the Home to hear concerns and comments about current issues facing our veterans.  
   "We must take the necessary steps to provide quality health care for our veterans," said Stabenow. "I am pleased the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans is committed to serving and assisting area veterans and serves as a model for veteran homes across the country."
   Michigan is proud to be home to over 780,000 men and women who have served in uniform. As a member of the Senate Budge Committee, Senator Stabenow played an important role in the passage of this year's budget resolution, which sets aside an additional $3.5 billion in 2008 alone to address shortfalls in veterans' health care. In 2006, over 60,000 of our Michigan veterans received medical care from the VA.
