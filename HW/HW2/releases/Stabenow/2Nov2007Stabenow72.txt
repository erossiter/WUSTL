SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S VETO OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the President's veto of the Water Resources Development Act: 
   "I was extremely disappointed when the President chose to veto this bipartisan bill that serves as a critical framework for protecting and maintaining the lakes, rivers, harbors and other waterways that are such a crucial part of Michigan's identity and economy. The President has said 'no' to legislation that would serve to benefit our Great Lakes and communities across our state. 
   "I am hopeful that the House can override the President's veto and working with my colleagues in the Senate I believe we can do the same. This legislation, which is of crucial importance to Michigan, will create jobs, strengthen our communities and protect the waterways that are so central to our way of life." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
