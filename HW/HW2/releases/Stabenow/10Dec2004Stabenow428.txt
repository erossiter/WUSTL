SEN. STABENOW ANNOUNCES 31 MICHIGAN STUDENTS NOMINATED TO MILITARY ACADEMIES
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that she has nominated 31 Michigan students for placement at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y., the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo.  
   "I am proud that so many exceptional students from Michigan are willing to serve our country through military service," Stabenow said. "They have already demonstrated excellence, and I am confident that they will represent our state well." 
   Students seeking appointment to a service academy must first obtain the nomination of their U.S. senator, their U.S. representative or the president. Students nominated by Stabenow's office went through a rigorous application process that included interviews by community leaders. Now that the students have been nominated, they must await acceptance for admission by the academy to which they have applied.
