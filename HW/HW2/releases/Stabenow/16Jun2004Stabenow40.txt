SEN. STABENOW: FAMILIES USA REPORT REVEALS MANY MICHIGANIANS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE
 A report issued today by Families U.S.A. reveals that one of four people in Michigan under the age of 65 - and one of every three nationally - went without health insurance for all or part of 2002 and 2003.  
   "The figure of 43 million people without health insurance has been widely quoted, but this Families USA report reveals that the national problem is twice as bad - with 81.8 million Americans uninsured at some point during 2002 and 2003," Stabenow said.
   "These new figures make clear that this is a problem that affects not just low-income Americans but middle-class working Americans as well, and it sounds a loud and clear call to action at the national level," she said.
