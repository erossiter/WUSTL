SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $1.4 MILLION FOR GRAND RAPIDS, MARQUETTE VETERANS
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded $1,482,332 to the State of Michigan for upgrades and renovations to State Veterans Homes in Grand Rapids and Marquette.  
   "It is critically important that we honor our veterans' service whenever possible, and this funding is a step in the right direction," said Levin. "These federal dollars will help to ensure that veterans facilities in Michigan are the best and most up-to-date we can provide."
   "Just as we support our troops overseas with the equipment they need, we must do everything we can to meet the needs of the one million veterans in Michigan," Stabenow said. "This funding for the Grand Rapids and Marquette facilities helps us fulfill our promise to those who have served our nation in the military." 
   The $786,274 Grand Rapids grant will help to fund Life Safety Code renovations at the State Veterans Home. In Marquette, the $696,058 in federal assistance will be put towards Life Safety Emergency Generator and Fire Safety upgrades. Both grants will fulfill 65 percent of the anticipated cost of the work, with the remainder guaranteed by the state.
