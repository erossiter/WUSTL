SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE MICHIGAN PROJECTS INCLUDED IN TRANSPORTATION, HUD APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., today announced the Michigan projects included in the transportation and housing and urban development appropriations bill for the 2006 fiscal year, which the Senate approved today by voice vote. The bill now goes to the president for his signature into law. 
   "This measure is responsive to the needs of communities across Michigan," said Levin. "It will fund the necessary improvements and expansions for Michigan's highways, airports and public transportation hubs. It will also bring more people to Detroit's West Riverfront and a great deal of hope to the homeless in Traverse City and Benton Harbor. This bill helps Michigan in a number of areas, and I am happy to support it." 
   "The funds in this bill will help address the practical and cultural needs of needs of our Michigan families, communities, and businesses," Stabenow said. "It will fund neighborhood revitalization projects in Detroit, Saginaw and Benton Harbor; fund buses and airports to improve our transportation systems throughout the state; and provide support to two important cultural institutions - the Armory Arts Project in Jackson and the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn."

   The Arab American National Museum and Cultural Center, Dearborn $1,150,000 
   The Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS) has helped to establish a museum dedicated to the history and culture of the Arab American community. The 38,500 sq. ft. museum and cultural center, located in Dearborn, will preserve and document the experiences and accomplishments of Arab Americans in the United States, celebrate and support the work of Arab American artists, and present the cultural heritage of the Arab American community to a wider American and international audience. 
   Focus: HOPE MicroGrid Enhancement, Detroit, Michigan $300,000 
   This funding will be used to renovate, upgrade and expand the existing Focus: HOPE cogeneration capacity to include its entire 40-acre campus by installing a north campus loop (microgrid) and adding 2000 kW of new electric generation capacity. Additionally, the cogeneration facility's computer control system will be upgraded system-wide. The proposed renovation will result in significantly lower operating costs, the ability to continue all campus functions and activities independent of potential power outages and increased cogeneration efficiency. The cogeneration process essentially burns energy once (natural gas), but uses it twice (electricity/thermal) to maximize energy efficiency. Focus: HOPE expects a significant reduction in the cost of its electricity and its overall energy costs as a result of these upgrades. Moreover, the microgrid and its capabilities will serve as a national demonstration site for cogeneration, fuel cell and/or other novel and emerging technologies. 
   Goodwill Inn Homeless Shelter, Traverse City, Michigan $250,000 
   The funding will be used for a new 22,734 sq. ft. facility, the Goodwill Inn Homeless Shelter, the largest homeless shelter in Northern Michigan.

The Inn will contain classrooms, training areas, childcare facilities and meeting rooms for case management. The building will house a commercial kitchen for the Meals on Wheels Program, as well as expanded meal options for residents. The new Inn will contain a dedicated Youth Wing, operated in partnership with Third Level Crisis Center, to accommodate the increase in homeless youth in the area. 
   Harbor Habitat for Humanity, Benton Harbor, Michigan $200,000 
  This funding will assist Harbor Habitat for Humanity in constructing 30 new homes in the City of Benton Harbor. Costs to complete this project include asbestos removal costs, sidewalk construction, sewer and water hookups, and tree removal and trimming.
