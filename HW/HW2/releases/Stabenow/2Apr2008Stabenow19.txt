SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $270,000 FOR FIRE PREVENTION
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that seven Michigan organizations have been awarded $274,719 for fire prevention and safety programs. The funds are awarded under the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). 
   "This grant will enhance our local firefighters' and first responders' ability to do their jobs, improve safety and save lives," Stabenow said. "I am pleased this funding will help these organizations provide better fire protection for their communities."
   "It is enormously important that we do everything we can to keep our children safe from fire-related hazards," said Levin. "This funding will help emergency personnel across Michigan prepare for and prevent such a disaster."
   The primary goal of the AFGP Fire Prevention and Safety program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, is to mitigate or prevent the danger to the public and first responders posed by fire and other hazards. Projects supported by the program include fire prevention and public safety education campaigns, media outreach, and arson prevention and awareness programs.
