SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $209,284 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR FOUR MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded $209,287 in grants to four Michigan fire departments under the terms of the fiscal year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Every fire department in Michigan faces critical challenges in protecting local residents and their property," Stabenow said. "Through these grants, we help ensure that Michigan's firefighters have the equipment and training they need to respond to all threats and hazards."
   "Everyday our firefighters go to work willing to risk their lives to protect us," said Levin. "We owe it to them to provide the necessary vehicles and equipment. This funding will strengthen each department's ability to respond to emergencies while minimizing the risks to the men and women who work so hard to protect our lives."
