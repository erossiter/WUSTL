SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $666,961 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR MICHIGAN
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that seven fire departments in Michigan have received $666,961 in grants under the terms of the fiscal year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "The flexibility of the FEMA firefighter grant program allows communities all across Michigan to address their own local needs, such as improved training, equipment purchases or enhanced fire prevention efforts," Stabenow said. "These grants provides for better local firefighting response and safer communities."
   "For our fire departments to do their job well they need the best training and equipment possible," said Levin. "These grants will go a long way toward helping each fire department meet the challenge of keeping their community safe."
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Fire Administration. The Operations and Firefighter Safety programs provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. The Fire Prevention program includes such activities as fire code enforcement, the purchase and installation of smoke alarms and fire suppression systems, and arson prevention and detection.
