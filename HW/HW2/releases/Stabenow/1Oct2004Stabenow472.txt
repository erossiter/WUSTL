SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL DISASTER LOANS AVAILABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN LENAWEE, MONROE COUNTIES
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is offering low interest federal disaster loans to help small agricultural-dependent businesses and agricultural cooperatives recover from the effects of severe weather in Lenawee and Monroe Counties in May 2004.  
   "Small businesses in Lenawee and Monroe Counties that depend on agricultural producers need help to recover from the effects of the severe weather in early May," said Levin. "Federal disaster loans will help these small business owners get back on stronger economic footing." 
   "Businesses in Michigan that are otherwise healthy and well-run have sustained serious losses, either directly because of weather conditions, or because their customers have been hurt by bad weather," Stabenow said. "This low-interest loan program is an extremely important tool in helping these businesses maintain their cash flow through this rough spot."
   These loans are designed to help recovery efforts following severe weather that hit the area on May 1, 2004. The interest rate on the loans is 2.75 percent, with a term of up to 30 years. Ohio counties are the primary recipients of the loans but Lenawee and Monroe Counties are also eligible because they are adjacent. These loans are not available for agricultural producers. 
   Applications for loans must be returned to the SBA by April 27, 2005. Business owners interested in applying for the loans should contact the SBA at 1-800-359-2227 or at the SBA Disaster Area 2 Office, One Baltimore Place, Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30308.
