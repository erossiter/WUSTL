SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement in response to comments President Bush made to the Wall Street Journal regarding U.S. automakers:  
   "I think it's unfortunate that President Bush would prefer to take potshots at our American automakers rather than engage in a real effort to help them at this critical juncture.
   "There are things we can do right now to help our auto industry - enforcing trade laws, helping with the high cost of health care and securing their pensions - but this Administration has been frustratingly slow to listen and dangerously slow to act.
   "Our way of life is at stake. I urge the President to join with our bipartisan Michigan delegation to help level the playing field for our automakers instead of standing on the sidelines offering criticism."
