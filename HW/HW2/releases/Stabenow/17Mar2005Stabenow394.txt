SEN. STABENOW, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS RESTORE CDBG FUNDING FOR SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN ELIMINATED IN PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and a bipartisan group of senators today won passage of an amendment to a Senate budget resolution that restores funding to the Community Development Block Grant Program. The CDBG program in 2005 is bringing $147.6 million to Michigan to develop neighborhoods, revitalize small community infrastructure, improve low-income housing, and help create and protect jobs in southeastern Michigan and across the state.  
   Senate efforts to restore the funding came on the heels of an administration effort to zero out the program in its own proposed budget. Sixty-five other senators joined Stabenow in support of adding $4.7 billion back in the fiscal year 2006 budget currently being debated in the Senate. 
  e than $147 million for assistance to Michigan communities and projects in the current fiscal year. 
   "In fiscal year 2004, economic development projects funded by CDBG helped create or retain more than 90,000 jobs for Americans," Stabenow said. "Just as important for our state and the nation, CDBG helped ensure that more than 80 percent of the businesses assisted through the program were still in operation after three years.
   "CDBG grants help keep our communities strong, positively impacting the quality of life of residents all across Michigan, from our largest cities to our most rural communities," Stabenow said. "Whether the grants are used to develop housing in large urban areas, to upgrade essential services like sewer and water in rural areas, or create jobs in any part of the state, this is a vital program for Michigan."
   To demonstrate the versatility of the CDBG funding, Stabenow cited the following examples of how communities in southeastern Michigan have been helped by the program:
   * Royal Oak - $1.6 million in funding to help provide services at the Mahany Meininger Senior Community Center and the Jack and Patti Salter Community Center, to upgrade homes through the Royal Oak Housing Rehabilitation Program, to make improvements at Elks and Lockman Parks, and to help resurface N. Alexander Ave., among other projects.
   * Detroit - $14.2 million in 2004-05 targeted to more than 150 Community Based Organizations serving Habitat for Humanity, health services, boys and girls clubs, academic organizations, and a wide variety of other community programs.
   Stabenow and the other senators noted that the block grant program has been especially important for states and cities "in times of tightening budgets, which place greater demands on existing services." Those demands - and the impact of the president's proposed cuts, are reflected in correspondence Stabenow and others have received from Michigan communities:
   * In Westland, which expected to receive $1,207,249 in the coming fiscal year, Department of Housing and Community Development Director James Gilbert wrote that the loss would be "devastating . . . . It is questionable at what level senior services could be maintained in our city."
   * In Canton, the cuts would mean a loss of $420,000 and the loss of a proposed teen center, a proposed senior center expansion, improvements to a school that houses Head Start, and support for low-income residents to participate in recreation programs, among other cuts.
   * In Livonia, Mayor Jack Engebretson wrote he was "concerned that vital housing and community development programs will struggle to operate and/or will be eliminated should the fiscal year 2006 budget be adopted in its current version."
   * In Lansing, projects supported by the $2.4 million the city would expect to receive included home rehabilitation and emergency repairs, neighborhood cleanups, business development, job placement, a youth camp, and repairs to lighting, streets and sidewalks.
   Stabenow and the other senators echoed the concerns of Michigan officials in a letter opposing the president's elimination of funding. Citing the importance of the CDBG grant program as one that allows each community to determine how the funds will be used, the senators said, "We must continue to support and build upon programs that work, those that have a proven record of flexibility and the ability to fit in with locally determined needs. CDBG is such a program and ranks among our nation's oldest and most successful program."
   The comments were in a letter sent last week to Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND), the chairman and ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee.
