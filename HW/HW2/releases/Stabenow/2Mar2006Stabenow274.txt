SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECURITY RISKS OF CANADIAN TRASH SHIPMENTS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General on the security risks of Canadian trash shipments to Michigan landfills:  
   "Serious concerns about the security of Canadian trash trucks are what led me along with Senator Levin and Congressman Dingell to request a report from the Inspector General in October 2003. The report confirms what we already know - these trash shipments are a hazard to public health and security. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security refuses to release these findings to the public, and I join Senator Levin and Congressman Dingell in urging them to reconsider. 
   "We have taken some action in addressing this issue, such as the law I authored in 2003 that requires the use of high tech screening equipment for inspections at the border, but this report highlights the urgent need for the President and the EPA to enforce our treaty with Canada and stop the trash right now."
