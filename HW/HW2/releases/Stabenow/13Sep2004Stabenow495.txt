SEN. STABENOW ASKS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY TO PURCHASE STORM-DAMAGED APPLES FOR FOOD BANKS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) has asked the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to use her authority to purchase up to $500,000 worth of storm-damaged Michigan apples - which are still perfectly edible but have sustained cosmetic damage - for distribution to food banks and other charitable outlets.  
   "The storms that struck Michigan this spring caused hail damage to approximately 2.3 million bushels of apples," Stabenow said today. "While the commercial value of these apples has been diminished, they are still of high quality, and groups such as the Food Bank Council of Michigan and America's Second Harvest have assured me they can be put to good use.
   "With the assurance of these organizations that these apples can be used in emergency food distribution, I have asked U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman to use her authority to purchase these apples for our food-bank network.
   "This would be a win-win for Michigan's apple-growers and for hungry children who would benefit from this nutritious food," Stabenow said.
