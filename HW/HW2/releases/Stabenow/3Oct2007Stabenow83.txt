SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON PRESIDENTIAL VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE
 U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding today's Presidential veto of Children's Health Care legislation. 
   "This is about values and priorities, and this Congress has said that America's children deserve quality, affordable health care. Sadly, the President has used his veto to say 'no'.
   "The fact that he has said 'no' to a bill that has the overwhelming bipartisan support of Congress and the American people ? the fact that he has said 'no' to providing coverage to 10 million children ? shows just how out of touch this President is with the values and priorities of America's working families.
   "But just because the President has vetoed this critical program, doesn't mean the fight is over. Working together, Congress can override the President's veto and make health care a reality for 10 million American children." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
