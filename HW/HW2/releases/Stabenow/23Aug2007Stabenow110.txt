SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON BP AMERICA'S DECISION TO NOT EXPAND DUMPING INTO GREAT LAKES
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding BP America reversing their decision to dump more pollutants into Lake Michigan: 
   "When my colleagues and I met with BP officials earlier this summer, we made it clear that increased dumping of ammonia and solids into Lake Michigan was not an option. I applaud BP for listening to these concerns and exploring options that can both expand economic opportunity and protect the Great Lakes. This is a victory for the Great Lakes and Michigan families."
