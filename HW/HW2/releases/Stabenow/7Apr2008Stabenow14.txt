SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S COLUMBIA TRADE PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding President Bush's Columbia Trade Proposal. 
   "Once again the administration is trying to put the cart ahead of the horse. As middle-class families across Michigan and throughout this country are struggling, now is the time to create jobs, not to sign another unenforceable agreement that ships vital jobs overseas.
   "I cannot support another trade agreement ahead of enforcing our trade laws, improving product safety, keeping our promises to working Americans and ensuring a level playing field for businesses and workers. What we need in this country is a comprehensive trade policy that puts American workers and businesses first."- U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
