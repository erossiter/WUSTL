SEN. STABENOW HONORS 'GIVE KIDS A SMILE' PROGRAM
 Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today introduced a bipartisan resolution commending the American Dental Association for sponsoring the fourth annual "Give Kids a Smile" program.  
 The "Give Kids a Smile" program works to improve children's access to dental care. 
   "Tooth decay is one of the most common chronic diseases for children," said Stabenow. "Without proper treatment, kids with tooth decay have trouble eating, sleeping and paying attention in school. Thanks to the dedication of the dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants who volunteer their time and services, hundreds of thousands of kids across the country will be able to smile." 
   Stabenow noted that children from low-income families are three to five times more likely than other kids to suffer from untreated dental problems. 
   Nearly 11,000 dentists participated in last year's "Give Kids a Smile" program. Approximately 500,000 children received $33 million in free dental care from the dentists that volunteered their services. In Michigan last year, 330 dentists took part in "Give Kids a Smile" events across the state. These dentists, along with more than 1,000 staff members and volunteers, provided dental treatment and oral health information to 17,430 needy children.
   "I especially want to thank the Michigan Dental Association for continued support for 'Give Kids a Smile,'" Stabenow said. 
   Senators Norm Coleman (R-MN), Thad Cochran (R-MS) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) cosponsored the "Give Kids a Smile" resolution.
