SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE VOTE TO STOP CANADIAN TRASH
  Sen. Stabenow Statement Regarding House Vote to Stop Canadian Trash  
   Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the passage of the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. Sen. Debbie Stabenow is the sponsor of the Senate companion to the House-passed measure and called for a Senate hearing on the bill last year: 
   "I am pleased the House has passed legislation to prevent Canada from sending its trash to Michigan landfills. I strongly support this bill and I urge Senate leadership to schedule a vote as soon as possible." 
   "Stopping the trash should not be a partisan issue - we must work together to keep Michigan from being Canada's dumping ground. That's why Senator Levin and I negotiated a phase-out of municipally-managed waste from Ontario over the next four years. I welcome this bill and any additional solutions to stop the waste that still needs to be addressed."
