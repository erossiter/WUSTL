SEN. STABENOW ANNOUNCES EMERALD ASH BORER MUNICIPALITY ACT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced the Emerald Ash Borer Municipality Act, which would allow the United States Department of Agriculture to issue loans for up to $5 million to municipalities to purchase equipment to dispose of infested trees and help fund their replacement on municipal government land. The act would also provide local communities with access to state funding. 
   "Funding and support must be readily available to cope with the devastating effects of the Emerald Ash Borer," said Stabenow. "I am pleased this act will help our local communities purchase much-needed equipment, plant healthy trees, and work closely with state officials for assistance."
   Currently, municipalities are not reimbursed or supported for costs related to Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) prevention. State government funding provided by the USDA is not shared with municipal governments, nor are state governments required to enter into supportive funding agreements with local governments to combat EAB. The 2% low-interest loans do not have to be repaid for 20 years.
   The Emerald Ash Borer is an exotic green beetle which feeds on the bark of ash trees, preventing the trees from transporting needed water and nutrients. EAB has killed over 20 million trees in the State of Michigan.
