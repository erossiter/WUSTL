SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $250,062 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR SEVEN MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that seven fire departments in the state of Michigan have received $250,062 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Each community will use the funds for fire operations and firefighter safety programs. 
   "In order to keep our communities safe, we must ensure that our firefighters have the necessary tools and resources," said Levin. "With this latest round of firefighter grants, these Michigan fire departments will be able to improve or update facilities, training programs and equipment."
   "In their efforts to protect their communities, firefighters must constantly upgrade equipment and training to be able to deal with new fire and chemical hazards," Stabenow said. "These grants will help Michigan firefighters improve their firefighting skills and equipment to meet these new public safety challenges."
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Fire Administration. The fire operations and firefighter safety programs provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities.
