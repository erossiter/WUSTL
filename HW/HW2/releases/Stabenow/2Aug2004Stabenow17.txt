SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $37,241 IN GRANTS FOR THREE MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that three Michigan fire departments have received $37,241 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The grant recipients are DeWitt Township Fire Department, the LSW Fire Department serving the town of Laingsburg and the townships of Sciota and Woodhull in Shiawassee County, and the Chesterfield Fire Department.
   "These three grants will provide the support needed to educate our youth about fire safety," said Levin. "Education regarding fire safety and prevention is critical to the lives and well-being of Michigan's children."
   "These FEMA firefighter grants allow communities all across Michigan to address their own local needs, whether they include improving firefighting skills or enhancing local fire prevention efforts," Stabenow said. "In this way, local fire departments are made stronger and our communities safer."
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Fire Administration. They provide assistance at the local, state, regional and national levels and are designed to help enhance the ability of fire departments to teach children about fire safety and prevention. With these funds, the fire departments are able to target at risk groups such as children and help prevent fire related injuries through education.
