FUNDING FOR ONTONAGON HARBOR DREDGING ADVANCES TO VOTE BY FULL SENATE
  At the request of Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI), a federal funding bill moving through Congress includes $300,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the mouth of the Ontonagon River, a project the Corps had cut because of budget concerns.  
   "Dredging in Ontonagon is vital to help protect the community from spring floods and to ensure that the community's largest employer - Smurfit-Stone Container - has a usable harbor to ship its products," Stabenow said. "In addition, a two-year state and federal highway project is scheduled to begin this year, and costs on this project could rise if materials can't be off-loaded at the local docks.
   "The Army Corps' decision to discontinue funding for dredging lower-usage commercial harbors could devastate the Ontonagon businesses that depend on the waterway," Levin said. "We worked to find an alternative source to fund the dredging of the harbor to make sure that businesses in Ontonagon are not hurt. I'm glad that the committee saw the need for this funding, and I'm hopeful that it wins Congressional approval."
   The senators noted that Ontonagon Harbor, a deep-draft harbor, is a refuge for small watercraft on Lake Superior along the western shore of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Dredging for this harbor was previously funded in the Army Corps' budget for annual maintenance dredging.
   The funding for Ontonagon dredging is included in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which has been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee and is awaiting a vote by the full Senate.
