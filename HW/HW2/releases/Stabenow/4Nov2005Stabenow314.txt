SEN. STABENOW TO NEW EPA ADMINISTRATOR: STOP CANADIAN TRASH SHIPMENTS NOW
  In a meeting Thursday, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) urged the Environmental Protection Agency's new Administrator, Stephen Johnson, to take immediate steps to stop Canadian trash shipments into Michigan. Stabenow also asked for Administrator Johnson's support for legislation in Congress that will allow states to ban imports of Canadian trash.  
   "Nearly 415 trash trucks roll into Michigan from Canada every day." Stabenow said, "These trucks dump more than 11.5 million cubic yards of trash into Michigan landfills every year, threatening our health, our environment and our homeland security."
   At the meeting, Stabenow presented Administrator Johnson with a petition signed by more than 170,000 Michiganians urging the EPA to stop the trash. Stabenow has collected signatures from residents of all 83 Michigan counties through her online petition drive. 
   "Michigan residents don't want Canada's trash," said Stabenow. "We are counting on Administrator Johnson to put a stop to these shipments by enforcing existing treaties and supporting our efforts in Congress."
   Stabenow called on Johnson to support a bill she introduced with Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), the International Solid Waste Importation Act (S. 1198), along with a companion measure in the U.S. House led by Michigan Representatives John Dingell and Bart Stupak. The legislation would give each state the authority to ban imports of Canadian trash. 
   "The support of the EPA is critical to our efforts to get a bill passed in Congress to give Michigan the authority to stop the trash," Stabenow said. "But the EPA has the authority to act now. An existing treaty between the U.S. and Canada gives the EPA the authority to halt trash shipments, and I asked the Administrator to begin rejecting Canada's trash by year's end."
