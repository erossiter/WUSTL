SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $387,000 FOR FIRE SAFETY
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that five Michigan organizations have been awarded $387,235 through the Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety and to purchase vehicles.  
   "Communities throughout Michigan rely on local firefighters and first responders to protect them when emergencies arise," said Stabenow. "These brave men and women deserve nothing less than the best possible equipment and training, and these grants will help these fire departments and organizations reach that goal."
   "Firefighters and first responders are vital to the safety and security of our local communities," said Levin. "We owe it to these men and women to provide them with the best possible training and equipment so they can effectively do their jobs and protect Michigan families."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. Grants are awarded competitively through an application process. More information can be found at http://www.firegrantsupport.com/.
