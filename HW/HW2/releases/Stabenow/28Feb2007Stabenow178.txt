SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $1 MILLION COMING TO FIFTEEN MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced on Wednesday, Feb. 28, that fifteen Michigan fire departments will receive $1,041,244 to pay for fire operations and fire safety programs, including training, equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The funds are awarded through the fiscal year 2006 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Keeping our communities safe begins with providing our first responders the resources they need," said Stabenow. "This funding will enable these fire departments to continue their great work protecting Michigan families." 
   "Fire fighters and emergency medical personnel play a vital role in protecting the citizens of their community," said Levin. "These grants will help each fire department with the necessary training and equipment to continue to do their job effectively."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism.
