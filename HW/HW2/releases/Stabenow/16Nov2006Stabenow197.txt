SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $300,000 COMING TO FIVE MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that five Michigan fire departments will receive $319,718 to pay for fire operations and fire safety programs, including training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The funds are being awarded through the fiscal year 2006 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
 "Communities throughout Michigan rely on local firefighters to protect them when emergencies arise," said Stabenow. "Our state's first responders deserve nothing less than the best possible equipment and training, and these grants will help these five fire departments reach that goal."
 "Directing resources to our firefighters and first responders is an important way to ensure the safety and protection of communities across Michigan," said Levin. "Better training and equipment will help these brave men and women do their jobs effectively."
 The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the fifth round of supplemental awards for fiscal year 2006, with five fire departments in Michigan receiving a total of $319,718 in federal funds.
