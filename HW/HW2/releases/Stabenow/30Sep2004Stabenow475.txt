SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $910,000 IN FUNDING FOR THREE MICHIGAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
  Three Michigan community development financial institutions, which help provide credit, capital and technical assistance for local community services and business development, have received a total of $910,000 in federal funding, Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today.  
   The funding is being provided by the U.S. Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.
   "These community development agencies play an important role in helping to foster business startups and expansions in rural areas. They also provide assistance for community programs not otherwise served by traditional financial services," Stabenow said. "In the end, these grants pay for themselves in terms of business growth and community improvements."
   "These grants will provide an immediate boost to each of these community development financial institutions as they work toward laying a foundation for long-term economic development," said Levin. "The communities served by these agencies will benefit in many ways including improved technology and development, consulting services, and economic expansion."
   The grants were awarded as follows:
   * $750,000 to Northern Economic Initiatives Corporation, Marquette. Since its inception in 1992, NEIC has served the diverse economy characterized by growing numbers of entrepreneurs, in the fifteen counties of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
