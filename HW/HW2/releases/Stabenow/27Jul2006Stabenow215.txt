SEN. STABENOW STATEMENT ON DEATH OF MARYANN MAHAFFEY
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the death of former Detroit City Council President Maryann Mahaffey:  
   "Until the very last moment of her life, Maryann Mahaffey was a fighter. Just weeks ago, she attended a briefing on the campaign to save affirmative action and she stood with peace activists at a protest in Ferndale. She championed countless important causes with verve, dignity and gusto. 
   "Maryann was a social worker before she became an elected official. Coupled with her unshakable character, her experiences as a social worker instilled in her an abiding compassion for those in need. Her legislative record reflects her total commitment to housing the homeless, feeding the hungry and giving hope to those who need it most. 
   "Maryann was a friend, a mentor and a unique voice for peace and justice. While her heart belonged completely to her beloved Detroit, she is admired, loved and remembered throughout the state and world on this sad day.".
