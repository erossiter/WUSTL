SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $4.45 MILLION IN BROWNFIELD GRANTS
 Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that Michigan has been awarded $4,450,000 in brownfields grants by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The grants will fund numerous cleanup activities aimed at improving the quality of the land at brownfield sites, making properties safer and enabling them to be used by local communities to improve their economies.  
   "These grants are so important for both environmental and economic reasons," said Levin, co-chair of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force. "The cleanup and development of brownfield sites revitalize our towns and cities by providing the opportunity to create jobs, build housing and provide recreational space."
   "This funding, which will help restore former commercial and industrial land to new and productive uses, is a wise and important reinvestment in our communities," Stabenow said. "This clean-up of useable land makes sense for Michigan in terms of land use, property tax base, economic development and the use of limited resources for environmental clean-up."
   Brownfield contamination can be a serious problem, both environmentally and economically. Because brownfields are idle or abandoned industrial properties with real or perceived contamination, expansion and redevelopment by local industry are rare. By providing grants to these Michigan communities, the EPA is helping to jumpstart the redevelopment of the land, allowing cities to attract businesses.

   Some of the funds will be use for Phase I and Phase II site assessments. Phase I is where historical occurrence of contamination is evaluated and a Phase II is where the extent of contamination is determined.
