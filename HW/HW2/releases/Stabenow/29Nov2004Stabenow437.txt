SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $442,856 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR EIGHT MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded $776,500 in grants to eight Michigan fire departments under the terms of the fiscal year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. 
  "Any effort to improve our ability statewide to respond to homeland security emergencies must include improving the response capability of our individual fire departments," Stabenow said. "These grants are part of that effort, enabling firefighters to improve their equipment and training, thereby enhancing their ability to protect the communities they serve.
   "Firefighters are the first to respond when a disaster strikes," said Levin. "These grants will help prepare our first responders to better protect our communities and keep us safe."
   The grants were awarded for the Fire Operations and Firefighter Safety program, which provides firefighters with funding for equipment, training and modifications to facilities. 
   The grants were awarded as follows:
