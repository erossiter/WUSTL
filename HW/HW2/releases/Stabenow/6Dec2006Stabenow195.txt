Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement on the release of Iraq Study Group report: 
 "This bipartisan report confirms that the President's strategy for Iraq is not working, and we need a real plan to complete the mission and bring our troops home quickly and safely. The Iraq Study Group report reinforces the need to change the course in Iraq and it is critical that President Bush uses their findings to move us in a new direction.".
