SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $9 MILLION IN GRANTS TO HELP REVITALIZE BROWNFIELDS SITES
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that more than $9 million in grants from the Environmental Protection Agency will help communities across the state clean up and redevelop abandoned and contaminated or potentially contaminated property.  
   "It makes environmental, economic, and common sense to clean up and bring new uses to brownfields," Stabenow said. "These federal grants will help Michigan communities create jobs and increase their tax base by making local abandoned residential and commercial property available for new investment."
   "The Brownfields program is a great investment in the vitality of communities across Michigan," said Levin. "Cleaning up and improving these sites will create jobs now and pay even bigger dividends down the road."
   The cleanup grants will fund direct cleanup activities at brownfields sites. The assessment grants will permit planning for eventual cleanup, and the revolving loan fund grants will allow for low-interest loans to be made for brownfields cleanups.
