SEN. STABENOW: MEDICARE DEADLINE MUST BE EXTENDED
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the Medicare Prescription Drug Program enrollment deadline coming up May 15, 2006: 
   "I have received thousands of calls and letters from people across Michigan about the trouble they are having with the new Medicare Prescription Drug Program. Choosing a plan is a challenging and often confusing process for seniors and people with disabilities. In Michigan alone, there are at least 79 different plans to choose from. Each plan has a different premium, a different co-payment and covers different medications." 
   "Under current law, seniors have until May 15, 2006, to enroll in a prescription drug plan. Anyone waiting to choose a plan after May 15th will pay a lifetime financial penalty."
   "I am leading the bipartisan effort in the Senate to extend the May 15th enrollment deadline and give seniors through the end of the year to make the choice that's right for them. I will keep fighting to make sure Michigan seniors and people with disabilities have the extra time they need."
