SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $140,000 FOR FIRE SAFETY IN MICHIGAN
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced on Wednesday, Jan. 10, that four Michigan fire departments have been awarded $144,055 through the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety.  
   "Michigan's first responders play a vital role in ensuring our safety and security," said Levin. "These federal dollars are an important step in providing them with the resources they need to prepare for a wide variety of potential dangers."
   "Communities throughout Michigan rely on local firefighters to protect them when emergencies arise," said Stabenow. "Our state's first responders deserve nothing less than the best possible equipment and training, and these grants will help these fire departments reach that goal."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. Grants are awarded competitively through an application process.
