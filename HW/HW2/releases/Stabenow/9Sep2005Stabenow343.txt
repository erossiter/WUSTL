SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $1.03 MILLION IN ?SECURE OUR SCHOOLS' GRANTS TO NINE MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Nine Michigan communities will receive a total of $1,038,823 from the U.S. Department of Justice to provide enhanced security for their local schools, Sens.  
 Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today. The grants are awarded under the Secure Our Schools Initiative, a program of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Service, commonly called COPS. 
   "The COPS program has been a great partnership between the federal government and local communities, and this partnership is especially important in enhancing school safety," Stabenow said. "It is an essential task of law enforcement to keep our children safe in school, allowing them to learn and grow. These grants will aid in that effort."
   "The safety of our children is paramount," said Levin. "These funds will go toward measures that will help improve the security of schools and in my mind, that's money well spent."
   The SOS Initiative grants pay up to 50 percent of the cost of metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other security measures. The grants will also pay half the cost of security assessments, security training for students and personnel, coordination with local law enforcement, and other measures that could significantly increase the school's security.

   City of Battle Creek: $72,398.00 
   Belleville Police Department: $2,310.00 
   Benton Harbor Police Department: $100,750.00
