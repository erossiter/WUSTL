SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON WTO DECISION ON AUTO PARTS
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the World Trade Organization's initial finding that China's auto parts import policies violate WTO rules.  
   "I am pleased by today's WTO decision, but it does not come soon enough for many companies across our country and especially in Michigan that have been hurt by China's unfair trade policies. While our workers and businesses have waited for this ruling, six of our nation's largest auto suppliers have declared bankruptcy. 
   "Today's decision is just more evidence of why we need a comprehensive trade policy in this country that puts American workers and businesses first. We need to be enforcing more of our trade laws, improving product safety, keeping our promises to working Americans and ensuring a level playing field." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
