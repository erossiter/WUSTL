SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON MISHANDLING OF FOREIGN AID FOR HURRICANE KATRINA VICTIMS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding reports of the mishandling of approximately $854 million in foreign aid offered in response to Hurricane Katrina and Rita.  
   "In a time of national tragedy, people from all over the world were kind enough to lend their help and support to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Rita. But this week we learned that in yet another example of administration mismanagement, only $40 million of the over $850 million pledged by our allies has been used to aid disaster victims and for reconstruction. This should be of concern to all Americans and I fully support Senator Landrieu in her calls for an investigation." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
