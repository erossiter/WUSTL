SENATE PASSES SEN. STABENOW'S BILL RENAMING DETROIT BUILDING 'ROSA PARKS FEDERAL BUILDING'
 Acting on legislation introduced earlier this year by Sen.  
 Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), the Senate today approved legislation that renames the building currently housing the Federal Homeland Security Office at 333 Mt. Elliott Street in Detroit the "Rosa Parks Federal Building." 
   "The people of Michigan take great pride in the fact that Rosa Parks became a part of our community when she made Detroit her home in 1957," Stabenow said. "Rosa Parks devoted her life to public service, to helping people and to serving as a role model for our children. This historic building will now stand as a permanent tribute to Mrs. Parks for her courage, strength and history-making sacrifice and a symbol of the deep gratitude of our community, our state and our nation." 
   This year marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks' historic act of civil disobedience and her arrest that brought the issue of civil rights before the American people. The bus boycott spurred by Mrs. Parks' heroic act lasted 381 days and directly led to the desegregation of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus system the following year. 
   Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) is a co-sponsor of Stabenow's Senate bill. Representative Carolyn C. Kilpatrick (D-MI) has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
