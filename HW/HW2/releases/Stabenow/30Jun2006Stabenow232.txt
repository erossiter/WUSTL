SEN. STABENOW STATEMENT ON BUSH'S MEETING WITH JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding President Bush's meeting and trip to Graceland with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi:  
   "Despite the fact that the President has cancelled three scheduled meetings with the Big Three automakers, he has managed to find time in his busy schedule to accompany Prime Minister Koizumi on a trip to Graceland. This sends a message loud and clear to Michigan about this Administration's priorities when it comes to manufacturing."
   "I hope he will use this trip as an opportunity to stand up for American manufacturers, and insist on fair trade policies and a level playing field. Michigan is losing jobs every day because of Japan's currency manipulation and unfair trade practices. The President must get tough and demand that Japan play by the rules."
