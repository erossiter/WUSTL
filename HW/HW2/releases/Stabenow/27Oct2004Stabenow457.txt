SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $1.81 MILLION IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR 29 MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded $1,811,733 in grants to 29 Michigan fire departments under the terms of the fiscal year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Our communities across the state need assistance to meet new challenges in protecting their citizens and property, and this grant program helps meet that need," Stabenow said. "This round of grants will improve the training of firefighters, their level of preparedness, and the quality of equipment in 29 communities throughout Michigan." 
   "Proper training and the right equipment are the best tools we can give our firefighters as they continue to save lives," said Levin. "These grants will also provide these Michigan fire departments with funds for needed vehicle acquisitions." 
   Grants for Fire Operations and Firefighter Safety provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. The Firefighting Vehicle Acquisition Program helps communities buy such vehicles as pumpers, brush trucks, tankers, rescue vehicles, ambulances, aerials, fireboats, and multiple feature vehicles known as quints.
