BRAC COMMISSIONER TO VISIT BATTLE CREEK
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that Samuel K. Skinner, one of the commissioners on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC), will visit W.K. Kellogg Air National Guard Base and the 110th Fighter Wing in Battle Creek on a date yet to be determined.  
  "I am pleased that the Commission has granted our request for a base visit to W.K. Kellogg Air National Guard Base," Levin said. This will give the Commission the opportunity to see the 110th Fighter Wing firsthand."
   "I am very pleased that the commission followed our recommendation and will visit Battle Creek," Stabenow said. "They will see firsthand an A-10 fighter wing that is one of the most experienced, decorated and capable in the Air National Guard, and a base that is one of the most modern in the Guard. Most importantly, I believe the commission will see that the value of maintaining the 110th in Battle Creek is clear and compelling."
   In May, the Secretary of Defense submitted a list of proposed base closures and realignments to the BRAC Commission. As part of its review of the Pentagon list, the BRAC Commission is holding hearings, visiting sites and soliciting input from affected communities. Levin and representatives from the Battle Creek area testified at a regional BRAC hearing in St. Louis on June 20. Levin and Stabenow wrote to the Chairman of the BRAC Commission, Anthony Principi, on June 28, urging the Commission to visit Battle Creek this summer.
