SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON LATEST CANADIAN TRASH SPILL
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement after a Canadian trash truck spilled part of its load onto a Huron Township overpass: 
   "This isn't the first time Canadian trash trucks have spilled their garbage onto our Michigan roadways, but it should be the last. Canadian trash is a hazard to our health and our security and I once again urge the President to take a strong stand for Michigan by immediately suspending all trash shipments from Canada.".
