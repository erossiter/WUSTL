SENATE PASSES SENS. STABENOW, DOLE RESOLUTION MAKING SEPTEMBER 'NATIONAL OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH'
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) today announced that the Senate has unanimously passed their resolution, designating September as "National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month." This year alone, an estimated 15,000 women will die of ovarian cancer, and 20,000 more women will be diagnosed with this disease. 
   "By recognizing September as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we are able to help educate the community and shed some light on this issue," Stabenow said. "The best way to honor ovarian cancer survivors and their families is to increase awareness and join in the fight to conquer this disease."
   "Early detection is critical to surviving ovarian cancer," said Dole. "Tragically, many thousands of women die from this disease each year, largely because it is difficult to diagnose and many women do not know the warning signs. We must continue to heighten women's awareness of the symptoms until an effective screening test is developed."
   According to the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, if the disease is detected and treated before it has spread, approximately 93 percent of women will survive for more than five years after diagnosis. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer is usually caught in the most advanced stage, meaning there is only a 29% survival rate over five years. We must acknowledge these statistics and overcome the challenges of diagnosing this deadly disease. The Stabenow-Dole resolution is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Patty Murray (D-WA).
