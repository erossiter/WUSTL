SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE ALMOST $5 MILLION FOR LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION IN MICHIGAN HOMES
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has awarded $4 million for the city of Grand Rapids to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible, low-income, privately-owned housing.  
   HUD has also awarded $989,717 to the state of Michigan to address the problem of lead-based paints in approximately 300 homes in Lansing and Ingham County. One of only a few demonstration grants awarded nationwide, the grant will allow inspectors to look beyond lead problems alone to help eliminate other health threats, including fire hazards and the presence of allergens.
   "Young children are very much at risk from lead-based paint, because elevated blood lead levels can affect learning and development and can even cause seizures and death," Stabenow said. "Homes should always be safe havens for our children and families, and this funding will help ensure that older homes become such havens."
   "Lead contamination is a silent threat to our young people that we must continue to monitor," said Levin. "It is crucial that we do everything we can to protect Michigan's communities from the dangers of lead. These grants will go a long way towards ensuring that our homes are safe."
   The Grand Rapids grant will be used for lead evaluation, lead abatement, and lead-safe construction and maintenance work practices. The goal is to make housing lead-safe, free of lead-based paint hazards. 
   As a demonstration project, the state grant, in general, seeks to develop, demonstrate and promote cost-effective, preventive measures to correct multiple safety and home health hazards that produce serious diseases and injuries in children of low-income families.
