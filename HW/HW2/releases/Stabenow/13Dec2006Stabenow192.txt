SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $1.2 MILLION FOR FIRE SAFETY IN MICHIGAN
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that ten Michigan fire departments have been awarded $1,220,928 through the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety and purchase firefighting vehicles.  
   "Assistance to Firefighters grants play a critical role in protecting Michigan's communities," said Levin. "Firefighters and emergency personnel perform an invaluable service and this federal support will help provide them with the resources they need to do their jobs safely and effectively."
   "Michigan's first responders work tirelessly every day to protect our neighborhoods and our families," said Stabenow. "We owe it to these brave men and women to provide them with the best training and equipment available."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. Grants are awarded competitively through an application process.
