   "This is an exciting day. I am thrilled that Greenville was selected as the site for this new state of the art solar cell manufacturing facility. Not only will this plant add 200 new jobs, it will help decrease our dependence on foreign oil and reduce pollution by promoting the use of alternative energy sources.
