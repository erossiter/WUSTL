SEN. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $150,000 COMING TO HELEN NEWBERRY JOY HOSPITAL
  Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin today announced that the Helen Newberry Joy Hospital, and its consortium partners, Marquette General Health System and Mackinac Straits Hospital, will receive a $149,988 federal grant for the Shaping Our Children's Future: Pediatric Weight Management program. The funds, awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be used to reduce the proportion of children and adolescents who are overweight or obese in Luce, Mackinac, and Marquette counties. 
   "I am proud to support this cooperative effort to combat childhood obesity and improve the health of the community," said Stabenow. "Setting a healthy foundation for our children today is critical for Michigan's tomorrow, and these funds will make health education for families a priority."
   "Childhood obesity is a serious health problem both here in Michigan and across the United States," said Levin. "I'm hopeful that this grant will help Newberry develop an effective program to identify and address this growing health risk."
   The Shaping Our Children's Future program will develop education curriculum, offer local screenings for risk factors associated with obesity, and deliver treatment programs that will demonstrate weight loss and prevention of chronic illness.
   Michigan has the third highest obesity rank in the country, with 62% of adults being overweight or obese. Eleven percent of children are considered overweight or obese, and 13% are at risk for becoming overweight.
