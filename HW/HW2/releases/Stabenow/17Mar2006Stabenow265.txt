SENATE PASSES SEN. STABENOW 'NATIONAL SUPPORT TROOPS DAY' RESOLUTION
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow today said that the Senate has unanimously supported her resolution designating March 26, 2006 as "National Support the Troops Day." The Sen. Stabenow resolution is the companion measure to the House resolution introduced by U.S. Rep. Joe Knollenberg (R-MI).  
   "Everyone knows that November 11th is a day to honor our nation's veterans," Stabenow said. "But up until now, there was no official day to recognize and appreciate the men and women who currently serve in our Armed Forces. Our active-duty troops and their families make enormous sacrifices in service to America, and we owe them our eternal gratitude."
   "National Support the Troops Day" was the idea of sixteen-year-old Alexandra McGregor of Waterford, Michigan. The resolution states that "all people in the United States should participate in a moment of silence to reflect upon the service and sacrifice of members of the Armed Forces both at home and abroad.".
