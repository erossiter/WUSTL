SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE THREE MAJOR HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS
  When Congress reconvenes before year's end to complete work on long-overdue legislation to fund the federal government, it will be acting on bills that contain billions of dollars in essential homeland security funding, including millions of dollars in projects for Michigan's first responders.
   "This is extremely important funding for Michigan, because it allows us to improve the ability of our police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians to respond to disasters and terrorist threats," Stabenow said. "I am very pleased to have been able to help get this funding included in the Senate version of these appropriations bills. Now it's time for Congress to get back to work and pass them." 
   "This funding would help to keep our communities safe and enable our first responders to get the resources they need to do their jobs," Levin said. "Hopefully Congress will act on these measures quickly so that we can move this funding out of Washington and put it to use in enhancing our homeland security efforts."
   As of its mid-October recess, Congress had failed to complete nine of the 13 appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government. This left millions of dollars worth of homeland security projects in Michigan and billions nationwide in a kind of funding "twilight zone," Stabenow said. 
   "Millions of dollars of assistance important to enhancing homeland security in Michigan is sitting in Washington instead of aiding our communities and our local law enforcement agencies," Stabenow said. "Approval of this important funding needs to be the top order of business when Congress resumes its work after the election."
   The following list details homeland security projects that have been included in the Senate version of appropriations bills that are still awaiting reconciliation with a companion House bill and then a vote on final passage in both the House and Senate. These key homeland security line items are in the appropriations bill that funds the executive departments of Commerce, Justice and State.
   * $1 million for wireless voice communications system for Macomb County Macomb County first responders currently operate under 91 different radio frequencies. This makes communications between and among police, fire, and emergency services in the County extremely difficult. Inter-county communications are similarly challenging. Macomb County plans to use the requested funding to establish a countywide interoperable communications system for first responders. The system will enhance public safety by significantly improving the County's ability to coordinate its emergency response services.
   * $1 million for the sheriff's department communications towers and equipment upgrades for St. Clair County There have been numerous occasions where emergency calls in St. Clair County have been undecipherable to local police because reception signals are so poor in the area. In order to improve system performance, St. Clair County needs to add two towers to its communications system to enhance the radio signal area currently monitored by county police. This funding would also fund the purchase of new radio equipment. These new towers and the radio equipment will enhance communications between police forces at the local, state, and federal levels.
   * $500,000 for communications equipment for the Downriver Mutual Aid Network. The Downriver Mutual Aid (DMA) network consists of eighteen community governments located in southern Wayne County. This densely populated area needs advanced equipment for the region's police departments to effectively communicate with each other and respond to emergency situations. This funding would allow the DMA's police departments to use new mobile command center equipment, such as radios and computers, to better protect the region's infrastructure and population.
   In addition to these specific Michigan projects, Congress must still approve funding for task forces and initiatives and the national level, and grant programs to aid state and local law enforcement agencies in Michigan and other states.
   * $2.576 billion for Office of Justice Programs. This key funding package provides funding for extremely important and valuable state and local law enforcement assistance, including programs to hire and train officers and improve interagency coordination and communications. It includes the COPS program, Byrne Formula Grants, Byrne Discretionary Grants, the Law Enforcement Technology Program, and Regional Information Sharing Systems
   * $502.8 million for programs that directly address the issue of terrorism at the national level. This includes the Joint Terrorism Task Forces, the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, and Terrorist Screening Center and other counterterrorism research and development efforts.
