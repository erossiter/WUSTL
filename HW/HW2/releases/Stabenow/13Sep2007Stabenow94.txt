SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE NEARLY $330,000 TO FIGHT CRIME IN GRAND RAPIDS
  U.S. Senators Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice is awarding $329,292 to the City of Grand Rapids for an initiative aimed at fighting violent crime. The funding comes as part of the Bureau of Justice Assistance Edward Byrne Memorial Discretionary Grant Program.  
   "This funding will bring local, state and federal law enforcement agencies together to fight back against violent crime in Grand Rapids," said Levin. "I am hopeful that this initiative will help bring criminals to justice and prevent crime in the future."
   "Fighting incidents of violent crime requires a collaborative effort from law enforcement agencies at all levels of government," said Stabenow. "I am pleased this funding will help keep the Grand Rapids community safe from violent crime."
   The City of Grand Rapids will use this funding for the Grand Rapids Violent Crime Initiative, a multi-pronged approach to reducing violent crime. The Kent County Sheriff's Office, the Michigan State Police and other county law enforcement agencies will coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to bolster information technology and crime analysis capabilities, expand crime prevention and enforcement efforts, and increase regional data sharing.
   The Byrne grant program assists state and local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to improve the criminal justice system at all levels and respond to increases in crime.
