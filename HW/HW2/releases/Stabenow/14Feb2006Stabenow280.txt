SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING NEW CHIEF COUNSEL FOR CHINA TRADE ENFORCEMENT
 Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement in response to the Bush Administration's announcement it will name a new chief counsel for China trade enforcement within the office of the U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman:  
   "Just last week, I personally urged Mr. Portman to get tough on China and Japan and asked him to support my efforts to create a Chief Trade Prosecutor that will stand up for our Michigan manufacturers. 
   "For years, we've seen tough talk, but very little action out of this Administration in combating unfair trade. They have so far refused to take any action to stop China and Japan from manipulating their currency. They have pushed ahead on a trade agreement with South Korea, despite that nation's policies to shut out American automobiles. 
   "This new chief counsel is a meaningless position, unless this administration changes its trade policies towards China, Japan and others, and stops ignoring flagrant unfair trade practices like currency manipulation."
