SEN. STABENOW REACTS TO REJECTION OF HER EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow issued the following statement following the defeat of her amendment to provide $5 billion in immediate funds for interoperable communications.  
   "I am deeply disappointed that less than two weeks after our nation's greatest natural disaster, the Senate Majority has again rejected efforts to provide the funds our nation's first responders need to be prepared for the next emergency.
   "In a disaster, having state of the art communications equipment could literally be the difference between life and death.
   "I have heard this directly from first responders throughout the state of Michigan, who approach my office seeking funding for communications equipment. And for the last two weeks all of us have heard from first responders in Gulf how police, fire and rescue and emergency medical personnel could not communicate with each other, or with state and federal emergency personnel. 
   "We heard the same message after 9/11, and I want to be sure that we do not hear it again after the next hurricane or terrorist attack.
   "I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress, and with our nation's brave first responders to demand that we finally and fully fund this basic yet essential equipment."
