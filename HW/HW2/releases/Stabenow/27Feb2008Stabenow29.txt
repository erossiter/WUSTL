  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that three Michigan organizations have been awarded $146,500 through the Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety.  
   "Families and communities throughout Michigan depend on their local first responders to answer the call in the event of an emergency," said Stabenow. "These grants will help strengthen these organizations' ability to respond by providing them with critical training and equipment."
   "These federal dollars will help purchase the personal protective equipment that Michigan's firefighters and first responders need to do their jobs safely and effectively," said Levin. "Communities throughout Michigan depend on the protection they provide, and this funding will help them prepare for the dangers they face on a daily basis."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States.
