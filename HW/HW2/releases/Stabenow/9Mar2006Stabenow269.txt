SEN. STABENOW BILL TO PRESERVE MICHIGAN LIGHTHOUSES, PROMOTE TOURISM CLEARS SENATE HURDLE
  Clearing the bill for a vote by the full U.S. Senate, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has approved Sen. Debbie Stabenow's (D-MI) legislation to preserve and promote Michigan's lighthouses. 
   "The Great Lakes are an important part of Michigan's history and identity and the lighthouses that define our shores draw thousands of tourists every year," Stabenow said. "Because tourism creates jobs and fuels Michigan's economy, it is critical that we protect and promote these historic treasures. I hope the Senate will act quickly to pass this important legislation."
   First introduced in July 2005, Stabenow's Michigan Lighthouse and Maritime Heritage Act would create a federal, state and local partnership to preserve Michigan's lighthouses and promote the maritime culture of the Great Lakes. U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) is a cosponsor of the bill. 
   The bill would require the National Park Service to work with the State of Michigan and local communities to study and make recommendations to Congress on the best ways to promote and protect Michigan's lighthouses and increase tourism, including the creation of a Michigan Lighthouse Trail. The study would also identify sources of funding available to Michigan communities for the preservation and restoration of their local lighthouses. 
   Michigan has more lighthouses than any other state in the nation, with over 120 along the shores of the Great Lakes. Michigan also has a number of historic shipwreck sites, maritime museums and lighthouse museums that attract many visitors to the state every year. The Stabenow bill would take the first steps toward coordinating all elements of Michigan's maritime heritage for Michigan residents and visitors to explore. 
   Congressmen Dave Camp (R-MI) has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
