SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: $12.6 MILLION ALLOCATED TO RELIEVE PORT HURON TRAFFIC CONGESTION
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced Senate passage of a bill to provide technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The legislation includes language that would provide $12.6 million in funds to resolve major traffic congestion at the Michigan Road highway and rail crossing in Port Huron. 
   "This intersection has not only caused major frustration to drivers, but has also severely limited first responders' ability to respond to emergencies quickly," said Stabenow. "This funding will provide the resources needed for this important project to progress, creating jobs and improving the safety of families in Port Huron."
   "Our police and fire fighters respond daily to emergencies where every minute counts," Levin said. "This project will fix the longstanding problem of trains blocking Michigan Road, forcing first responders to take long detours to reach the emergency."
   Michigan Road is frequently blocked by trains using the St. Clair River Tunnel. According to the St. Clair County Road Commission, the road is blocked for an average of 5.5 hours per day, causing emergency response vehicles to use long detours when responding to calls for assistance. Not only does this contribute to unbearable traffic congestion, but also poses a significant threat to the safety of the community and their first responders. The overall project will provide connecting roads to allow traffic to cross the tracks at the same time trains are waiting to pass through the St. Clair Tunnel.
   The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for final passage and then sent to the President for his signature into law.
   The bill also includes the following House sponsored projects in Southeast Michigan:
   * $2.9 million - Bicycle and pedestrian trails in Harrison Township.
   * $880,000 - Widen M-24 from two lanes to four lanes with a boulevard from I-69 to the Lapeer County line.
   * $486,400- Construct hike and bike path as part of Bridgeview Bridge replacement in Macomb County.
   * Change the construction of a hike and bike path to now run from Riverbends Park to the south of the City of Utica.
   * Intersection improvements at Belleville and Ecorse Roads and approach roadways, and widen Belleville Road from Ecorse to Tyler, Van Buren Township.
   * Resurface Martin Road in Roseville.
