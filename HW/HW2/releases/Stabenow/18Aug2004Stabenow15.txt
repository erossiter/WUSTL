SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE CROSWELL POLICE DEPARTMENT, LIVINGSTON COUNTY TO RECEIVE $225,000 TO HIRE POLICE OFFICERS
  Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that the Department of Justice has awarded $75,000 to the Croswell Police Department for the hiring of one police officer and $150,000 to Livingston County for the hiring of two police officers.  
 The grants are part of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Universal Hiring Program.
  "Placing more officers on the streets and involving them in the community has proven to be a great success in making neighborhoods safer," said Levin. "I am confident that the investment of these police officers will serve Croswell and Livingston County well."
   "Community policing continues to prove itself as an effective means of preventing and solving crime, and the COPS Universal Hiring Program is a key tool for implementing this program," Stabenow said. "The officers hired with these grants will be valuable assets to their agencies and the communities they will serve."
   The COPS Universal Hiring Program provides up to 75 percent of the total salary and benefits of each new officer for three years. All jurisdictions that receive grants must retain the COPS-funded officer position for at least one year following the three-year federal funding period.
   To date, the COPS program has provided more than $5 billion to hire law enforcement professionals. For additional information please visit www.cops.usdoj.gov.
