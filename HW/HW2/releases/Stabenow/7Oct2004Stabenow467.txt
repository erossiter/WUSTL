SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $121,824 IN COPS SCHOOL SAFETY GRANTS FOR THREE MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  The cities of Wayne and Coldwater and the township of Kalamazoo have been awarded Department of Justice grants totaling $121,824 to improve security at schools and on school grounds, Sens.  
 Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) said today. 
   "Our children spend more time in school than almost any other place outside the home, and we must do everything we can to ensure that schools are safe places for children to learn, play and grow," Stabenow said. "These School Safety grants reaffirm the important collaboration of school officials and law enforcement in making and keeping schools safe."
   "To create the best learning environment for our kids we must also create a safe environment for our kids," said Levin. "Small improvements to security, such as better lighting, can make a huge difference in deterring crime and I hope these schools can use the grants to do just that."
   Awarded through Community Oriented Policing Services, commonly called COPS, the grants provide up to 50 percent of the total cost for municipalities to install metal detectors, locks, lighting and other equipment to help deter crime. The grants can also be used to pay half the cost of security assessments, security training and other measures that will provide a significant improvement in security.
   The grants were awarded as follows:
   * $15,000 - City of Coldwater
   * $10,153 - Township of Kalamazoo
   * $96,671 - City of Wayne Police Department
