SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR DETROIT RIVERFRONT, THUNDER BAY SANCTUARY, FIRST RESPONDERS IN APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The fiscal year 2006 Science-State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill, given final approval by the Senate, contains $3 million for the Detroit West Riverfront and $1 million for Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) said today. In addition, the bill gives broad support for law enforcement programs across Michigan.  
   "I have led the fight in Congress to ensure that first responders have the communications equipment they need to work together in an emergency, and this legislation will help Michigan's first responders move toward that goal," Stabenow said. "In addition, this bill makes important investments in science, business, and tourism, which means jobs for the state. This is important legislation for Michigan."
   "Keeping Michigan's families safe and secure is one of my most important concerns," said Levin. "This measure contains critical funding for the law enforcement officials and first responders on whom we all depend. It will also provide a significant boost to the West Riverfront in Detroit and the Thunder Bay Marine Sanctuary, among other worthy projects. I'm pleased that we were successful in securing funding for such a wide array of Michigan's top priorities."
