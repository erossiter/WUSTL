SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement marking the five year anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks:  
   "Today, I join all Americans in honoring the memories of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. My thoughts and prayers go out to their families and loved ones. We can never forget the firefighters, police officers and everyday citizens who showed us all what it really means to be a hero - reaching out to their neighbors and putting themselves at risk to help those in need."
   "We should also take this time to remember the spirit of community that took hold in America in the dark days following the attacks. The sense that we are all in this together gave us hope and unity that showed the world the terrorists will never defeat us."
   "We must use this anniversary to recommit ourselves to keep Americans safe and prevent such an attack from ever happening again. We should not let another anniversary pass before fully implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission."
