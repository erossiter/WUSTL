SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $350,000 FOR REGIONAL COMMUNITY POLICING INSTITUTE AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that Michigan State University, as a lead agency for the Michigan Regional Community Policing Institute, has been awarded $350,000 from Community Oriented Policing Services to help train law enforcement officers.  
 Within the grant, $50,000 has been earmarked for counter-terrorism training. 
  "The Regional Community Policing Institute at MSU has an important goal of trying to make community policing the basic model for local law enforcement," Stabenow said. "Establishing local partnerships and meeting community needs becomes even more important as we confront new homeland security concerns. MSU's RCPI will help train law enforcement officers to meet these new challenges." 
   "Our officers must be properly trained for any law enforcement initiative to be effective," said Levin. "These COPS grants will provide Michigan State University's RCPI with needed funds so that their officers can have the training and flexibility to handle any and all security challenges"
   The RCPI at Michigan State is one of 27 such centers in the U.S receiving funding in this round of grants. The centers provide community policing training and technical assistance to both law enforcement officers and members of the community that work collaboratively with local law enforcement. 
   Training provided by the RCPIs covers topics such as rural community policing, cultural diversity, community mobilization, conflict resolution, crime mapping and analysis, violence prevention, organization change management, and ethics and integrity within a law enforcement agency.
