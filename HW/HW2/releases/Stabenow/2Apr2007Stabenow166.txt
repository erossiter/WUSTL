SEN. STABENOW SECURES VETERANS HEALTH CLINIC IN ALPENA
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Monday, April 2, 2007, announced that the business plans for a VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Alpena have been approved for fiscal year 2007. The new Alpena clinic will ease the burden of veterans in Alpena and the surrounding area who regularly make long and often difficult trips to VA hospitals in other parts of the state to receive basic medical services.  
   "This is great news for our Alpena veterans and families," said Stabenow. "I am extremely happy this health clinic has been approved - it's high time that our Alpena-area veterans who selflessly served our country have access to the health care services they need and deserve."
   "There is an old saying that success has many fathers, and this is an example of that," said John A. McVeety, CEO of Alpena Regional Medical Center. "The efforts of Senator Stabenow and the many veterans in our area and the folks here at Alpena Regional Medical Center have made this possible. The availability of a VA clinic will be a major improvement in the lives of those who have given so much for our country." 
   Stabenow has led the fight to secure this Alpena VA health clinic and strengthen veterans' access to health care in the Alpena region for nearly four years. She has worked with many area veterans and community leaders, as well as the Alpena Regional Medical Center to gain approval for this facility. She also sent numerous letters and a petition that included over 1,000 signatures urging the VA to increase access to veterans' heath care in the Alpena region, and introduced legislation directing the VA to create this clinic.
   "Just as we support our troops overseas with the equipment and armor they need, we must do everything we can to meet the needs of veterans when they come home, and this clinic will greatly enhance the health and quality of life of our veterans living in northern Michigan," said Stabenow.
