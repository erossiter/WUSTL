SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $800,000 COMING TO NINE MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that nine Michigan fire departments will receive a total of $813,338 in federal funds for fire operations and fire safety programs, including training, equipment, and facility enhancements. The funds are awarded through the fiscal year 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   "Michigan's first responders work tirelessly every day to protect our neighborhoods and our families," said Stabenow. "This grant will help to provide fire departments and first responders in Michigan with the best equipment and training available."
   "Firefighters are essential to the safety and security of our local communities," said Levin. "We owe it to these men and women to provide them with the best possible training and equipment so they can effectively do their jobs and protect Michigan families."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the first round of supplemental awards for fiscal year 2005.
   Due to the additional burden on local agencies since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many Michigan fire departments rely on funds from the FIRE Act and state formula grants to hire additional personnel, purchase new fire trucks, radios, and other equipment, and establish general fire-prevention programs.
   In the last completed awards year (2004), 287 Michigan fire departments and organizations received over $21 million from this program. Stabenow and Levin are fighting to restore over $300 million to the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program, which was cut under the Bush Administration's fiscal year 2007 budget.
