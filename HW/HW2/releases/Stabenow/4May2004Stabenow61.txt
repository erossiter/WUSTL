  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that $48,885,379 in grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation will help fund runway, facility, security and equipment improvements and enhancements around the state.  
   "Like all our other transportation infrastructure, our airport facilities need constant improvement and added security," Stabenow said. "This funding will improve travel for Michigan residents and visitors, and it aid state business and commerce - building jobs and making the state an excellent place to live and work."
   "Our airports continue to work to improve safety and efficiency for travelers in Michigan," said Levin. "These latest grants will provide our airports with much needed funding to make the necessary improvements." 
   The senators noted that several grants announced last week did not include the full funding available for the ongoing projects.
