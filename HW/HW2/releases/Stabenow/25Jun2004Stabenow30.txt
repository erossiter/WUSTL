SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE LANSING, WESTERN MICHIGAN PROJECTS INCLUDED IN SENATE-PASSED DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that funding for many projects in the Lansing area and Western Michigan is included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005, which the Senate passed last night by 98-0. 
   "This bill makes critical investments in two vital areas: winning the global war on terrorism and restoring our country's industrial and technological dominance," said Levin. "Every day in military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world, we see the contributions of Michigan's military community and our state's industries and universities. Michigan, with its dynamic and evolving industrial and technology sectors, continues to play a critical role in enhancing our national security."
   "For generations Michigan industries and Michigan workers have been key suppliers of quality materials for the nation's defense, and this bill continues that tradition," Stabenow said. "I am especially pleased that this bill will provide critical equipment to enhance the readiness and capability of the Michigan National Guard."
   Specific projects for the Lansing area and Western Michigan follow:
   Procurement and Advanced Technology Projects:
   * $8 million for the Army to purchase fleece liners for their Extended Cold Weather Clothing System, $2 million for the Army National Guard to purchase the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System and $5 million for the All Purpose Environmental Clothing System for Marines. In addition, as part of the $25 billion Iraq Contingency Emergency Reserve Fund, a portion of the $390 million allocated to the Army's Rapid Fielding Initiative is for the purchase of fleece clothing. The Rapid Fielding Initiative seeks to get items vital to soldiers into their hands in a more timely manner than possible through traditional military procurement practices. Polartec fleece products used by the military are assembled by Peckham Vocational Industries in Lansing.
   * $10 million for the Army's Advanced Lightweight Structures Initiative, which develops next generation titanium, ceramic, and aluminum materials for cannons, vehicles, and armor systems. Howmet Castings in Whitehall and Alcoa Automotive in Fruitport are among the partners in this initiative.
   * $10 million for the Air Force's Metals Affordability Initiative, a government-industry cooperative program to develop new aerospace materials and alloys. Howmet Castings in Whitehall is developing new materials that will reduce aircraft engine maintenance costs and help enable the next generation of fighter aircraft and unmanned air vehicles.
   * $4 million for the Army's Advanced Lightweight Structures Initiative, which develops next generation titanium, ceramic, and aluminum materials for cannons, vehicles, and armor systems. Howmet Castings in Whitehall and Alcoa Automotive in Fruitport are among the partners in this initiative.
   * $2 million for Copper Based Casting Technology. This program will develop new casting technologies for high melting point copper and copper based alloys. A Belding, Michigan, company, Extruded Metals, Inc., is a potential participant in this program.
   * Over $1.4 billion for fundamental research to support the military at our nation's universities and government laboratories. Many Michigan universities, including the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State, Oakland University, Eastern Michigan University, Kettering University, Lawrence Technological University and Michigan Technological University, perform high quality fundamental research for the Department of Defense in all fields of science and technology.
   Michigan National Guard Projects:
   This bill included funding of projects that will enable the Michigan National Guard to procure materiel that it needs to fulfill its mission. Included among those projects are the following items:
   * $10 million for research and development of engine upgrades for the A-10 aircraft which are used to provide close air support for ground forces. The 110th Fighter Wing at W.K. Kellogg field, in Battle Creek, is home to some of these aircraft, which are scheduled to be used until 2028. These funds will enable them to ensure that this aircraft is modernized and able to perform its missions.
   * $ 7 million for three dimensional modeling, design and engineering assessments of the A-10 aircraft. These funds will also play a role in sustaining these aircraft.
   Manufacturing Extension Program: The bill included an amendment that would make available additional funds for the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP). The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) helps small and mid-sized American manufacturers modernize and stay competitive in a global marketplace by boosting. The administration's 2004 budget reduced funding for this program by 88 percent.
   This amendment clarified that the Department of Commerce has the ability to transfer and reprogram $21.8 million to the MEP Program in fiscal year 2004. The Department of Commerce had argued that it was only able to reprogram up to $3.9 million for this program. This language will enable additional funds to be provided to our nation's 60 MEP centers. These centers are public-private partnerships that prove technical assistance and business support services to small manufacturers so that they can compete in the global market place.
   The House of Representatives passed the defense appropriations bill on June 22. The differences between the two bills will now be worked out in a conference committee.
