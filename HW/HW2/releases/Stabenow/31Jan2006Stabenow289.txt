SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
 Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement reacting to President Bush's State of the Union address:  
   "Tonight's speech was yet another missed opportunity. We are in a fight for our way of life in America, and we need the President to lead for American businesses and American workers.
   "Just last week I sent the President a letter urging him to use tonight's speech to lay out a comprehensive action plan to protect American jobs. There are concrete steps that the administration can take to protect American workers both on the job and in retirement, lower health care costs that are crippling our manufacturers, and put an end to the unfair trade practices that give our competitors an advantage. Unfortunately the President chose not to address these issues tonight in a meaningful way."
