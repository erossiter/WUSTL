SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $115,000 IN FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY-BASED SOLUTIONS TO CRIME IN SAULT STE. MARIE
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is awarding $115,272 to the Sault Ste.  
 Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians to fund a community-based problem-solving initiative. 
   "This is great news for Sault Ste. Marie's Chippewas," said Levin. "It is critical that we stay up-to-date when it comes to fighting crime in Michigan's communities. These federal dollars will allow local authorities to develop innovative new strategies for preventing crime, punishing criminals and assisting victims."
   "The Problem-Solving Court movement has shown great promise in focusing the efforts of both prosecution and defense in addressing the problems of crime and looking for solutions that may be unique to each defendant and each community," Stabenow said. "It is hoped that these judicial innovations will reduce crime and ensure that our courts are viewed by all as effective and fair." 
   This marks the first time that the Bureau of Justice Assistance, a component of DOJ's Office of Justice Programs, has funded a Problem-Solving Criminal Justice Initiative. Research has shown that if implemented properly the problem-solving approach can decrease recidivism, reduce crime, improve coordination among justice agencies, enhance services to victims, and increase trust in the justice system. Specifically, this grant will fund a Peacemaker Court (Bemaadziiwiin), in partnership with the Peacemaker Steering Committee, as a culturally appropriate criminal justice alternative.
