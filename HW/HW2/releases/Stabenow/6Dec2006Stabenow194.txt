SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF U.S. MANUFACTURING CZAR
Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the announced resignation of Al Frink, the Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing and Services:  
 "The President now has an opportunity to appoint a U.S. manufacturing czar who is committed to tackling the issues our automakers and American manufacturers care about. Unfortunately, Mr. Frink was not actively engaged in working for an agenda that helps our manufacturers and protects American jobs. 
 "The next manufacturing czar must be someone who works every day to promote a 21st century manufacturing strategy that will ensure a level playing field and create good-paying middle class jobs for Americans.".
