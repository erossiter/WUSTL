SEN. STABENOW: GRANT WILL PROTECT MICHIGAN JOBS, ENHANCE COMPETITIVE EDGE OF U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) commented today on the $5 million automotive industry training grant awarded by the Department of Labor to the Downriver Community Conference, which represents 18 Downriver communities in Wayne County. 
   The grant will be used to train more than 1,300 hourly and salaried workers for Auto Alliance International, a joint venture between Mazda Corp. and the Ford Motor Co. in Flat Rock. The facility will be the production site for the 2005 Ford Mustang.
   "I applaud the hard work that the Auto Alliance and the Downriver Community Conference have put forth to receive this award from the Department of Labor," Stabenow said. "I have supported this project since I came to the Senate, because it will benefit the workers and their communities and will help keep Michigan's automotive industry competitive and on the cutting edge of production technology.
   "Michigan workers can produce products that rival the quality of work anywhere in the world, and they are willing to embrace new manufacturing technologies. This grant will aid them in that goal."
