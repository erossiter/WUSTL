SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON PERU TRADE AGREEMENT VOTE
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding today's Senate vote on the Peru Trade Agreement.  
   "I appreciate all the hard work my colleagues have put into having this agreement reflect our country's values when it comes to labor and environmental standards. Getting the right words on paper is certainly important. But, for me, the right words on paper aren't enough. I cannot support another trade agreement ahead of enforcing our trade laws, improving product safety, keeping our promises to working Americans and ensuring a level playing field for businesses and workers. What we need in this country is a comprehensive trade policy that puts American workers and businesses first. It is time to stand up for the middle class in this country, who have worked so hard to make this country great."--U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
