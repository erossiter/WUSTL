SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW INTRODUCE BILL TO ESTABLISH RESTORATION STRATEGY FOR GREAT LAKES
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) today teamed with a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce a Great Lakes restoration bill that would help to reduce the threat of invasive species in the lakes, restore fish and wildlife, clean up contaminated sediments, and coordinate water quality management in the Great Lakes basin.  
   "The Great Lakes are a unique American treasure, and we must recognize that we are only their temporary stewards," said Levin, who co-wrote the bill with Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio). "If Congress does not act to keep pace with the needs of the lakes, the current problems - such as invasive species and contaminated sediments - will continue to build, and we may start to undo some of the work that has been done. We must be good stewards by ensuring that the federal government meets it ongoing obligation to protect and restore the Great Lakes." 
   "For the people of Michigan, the Great Lakes are more than just one-fifth of the world's fresh water and a unique ecosystem - they are part of our identity," said Stabenow. "This rich abundance of natural resources has made the outdoors a critical part of Michigan's economy, bringing billions of tourism dollars to our state and creating jobs. The future of our state is directly linked to the future of the Great Lakes."
   For the past year, more than 1,500 people who make up the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration have worked to compile recommendations on how to best restore the Great Lakes ecosystem, and their recommendations were released in December 2005. The purpose of the bill introduced today is to implement the recommendations made by the collaboration.
   The DeWine-Levin Great Lakes Collaboration Implementation Act of 2006 notes that deterioration of the Great Lakes ecosystem is accelerating, and it lays out restoration plans for the Great Lakes basin. Some of the specific provisions of the bill include the following:
   * The bill would reduce the threat of new invasive species by enacting comprehensive invasive species legislation and put ballast technology on board ships. It specifically targets Asian carp by authorizing the operation and maintenance of the dispersal barrier. 
   * It would restore fish and wildlife habitat by reauthorizing the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act. 
   * The bill provides additional resources to states and cities for their water infrastructure. 
   * The bill would provide additional funding for contaminated sediment cleanup and would give the EPA additional tools under the Great Lakes Legacy Act to move projects along faster. 
   * The bill would create a new grant program to phase-out mercury in products. 
   * It would authorize additional research through existing federal programs as well as our non-federal research institutions, and it would authorize coordination of federal programs.
   Levin and DeWine introduced the Senate bill, which is cosponsored by Stabenow, Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio), Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). Reps. Vern Ehlers (R-Mich.) and Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) have introduced a companion measure in the House of Representatives.
