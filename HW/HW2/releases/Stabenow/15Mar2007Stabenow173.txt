SEN. STABENOW PASSES HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Thursday, March 15, announced passage of her Health Information Technology Reserve Fund amendment during the Senate Budget Committee markup of the FY 2008 Senate Budget Resolution. The Sen. Debbie Stabenow amendment will provide a critical first step for the federal government to implement health Information Technology systems and services that could save our country up to $100 billion annually in health care costs. The budget will now go to the full Senate for a vote, which is expected to occur next week. 
   "We know the promise health information technology holds for lowering our nation's sky-high health costs and providing better service to patients," said Stabenow. "Now we need to get these systems in place so we can realize the cost benefits for patients and employers, and this amendment is an essential first step." 
   Businesses across the country are struggling to remain competitive in a global marketplace as health care costs continue to rise. Many of our nation's major employers, including our automakers, cite health related expenses as one of their most crippling business costs. 
   The United States currently spends 31 cents of every health care dollar on administrative costs and tens of billions of dollars annually providing duplicative care and treating medical errors, much of which could be prevented through the ability to better share information among patients and medical professionals.
   "American families and businesses feel the consequences of not having a fully-wired health care system," Stabenow said. "With all of America's resources, it is unacceptable to continue to let paperwork drive up health care costs and drag down quality of care."
   To protect patient privacy, the Stabenow reserve fund would only apply to any health information technology legislation adopted that ensures the privacy and security of personal medical information.
