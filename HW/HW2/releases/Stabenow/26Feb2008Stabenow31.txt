SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON REPORT FINDING HEALTH CARE SPENDING TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT DECADE
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the report released today by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) showing projected health care spending through 2017.  
   "One of the most troubling aspects of this report is that it shows overall health care costs are expected to continue to rise much faster than inflation. It is simply unacceptable that in the greatest country in the world, so many middle-class families are struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing costs of health care. That's why I will continue my fight to ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. 
   "Fortunately, we are beginning to see the political will we need to effect real change and lower costs. Last year, I led the successful fight to change FDA rules to allow more generics into the marketplace. This new law is increasing competition, which means lower prices for consumers and employers. 
   "Reducing the costs of prescription drugs is a critical component in reducing overall spending, staying competitive in a global economy and protecting American jobs." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
