SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT OF $979,814 FOR MICHIGAN STATE POLICE
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Michigan State Police have received a grant for $979,814 from the Department of Homeland Security.  
 The grant will be used to implement an information sharing system that will allow several Michigan law enforcement agencies to communicate more efficiently. 
   "The ability to effectively share and evaluate information among police departments and agencies is critical for our homeland security," said Levin. "This grant will provide the Michigan State Police needed resources so they can enhance their information sharing capabilities."
   "Our efforts to combat terrorism have made clear the need to share information among law enforcement agencies," Stabenow said. "This systems integration project will be a valuable tool in helping Michigan law enforcement to stay one step ahead of potential terrorist or criminal acts."
   The Michigan State Police will use these funds for their Systems Integration and Sharing Pilot project. The focus of this grant is to integrate many Michigan law enforcement agencies' information capabilities without changing their existing computer systems. This will allow departments all across the state, including court and prosecuting attorneys' offices to access the same information. This integration will help in first response and information sharing and will be cost efficient, as the departments will not have to change computer systems to become integrated. This system will also be the first of its kind to use wireless hand held computers in aiding law enforcement.
