SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON SENATE'S FAILURE TO EXTEND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) offered the following comments today on the Senate's rejection of legislation that would have reinstated and extended unemployment benefits: 
  "I am extremely disappointed by the failure of the U.S. Senate today to extend unemployment benefits for laid-off workers
   "On March 31 I released a report that showed an estimated 35,800 workers in Michigan lost their jobs in the first three months of 2004 and that an additional 88,328 workers were expected to lose their benefits in the second quarter of 2004, if benefits were not extended. 
   "The Senate had an opportunity to provide relief for these workers and their families - and more than a million more nationwide - whose jobs have been shipped overseas or have lost their jobs due to a poor economy, but we failed as a body to use this opportunity to provide relief.
   "It is bad enough that many of these job losses are due to trade policies and practices, praised by the administration, that send good-paying jobs overseas, but it is extremely unfortunate that the administration and Senate Republican leadership have turned their back on unemployed Americans as they struggle to find work in a weak economy.
   "Michigan, one of the states suffering the greatest loss of manufacturing jobs, was doubly hurt by this vote. Not only will Michigan's unemployed workers continue to struggle without unemployment benefits, but the state itself will suffer the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits that would have served as a great economic stimulus."
