SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S FY 2009 BUDGET PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today issued the following statement on the release of President Bush's FY 2009 budget: 
   "Any budget is about values and priorities, and this President's final budget is clearly out of sync with the values and priorities of middle-class families across Michigan and across our country.
   "At a time when our economy is hurting, this President's budget once again flies in the face of fiscal responsibility by running up some of the largest deficits ever, all while trying to make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
   "It includes massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that will harm the most vulnerable among us - seniors, people with disabilities and those that can't receive health coverage anywhere else.
   "The proposal also cuts other critical domestic programs including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the Social Services Block Grant program that helps states protect children from neglect and abuse.
   "And once again this President has failed to make the investments necessary to support American manufacturing and keep jobs here at home.
   "This President's priorities are clear.
   "As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop a responsible budget that invests in America's working families and creates jobs here at home." -U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
