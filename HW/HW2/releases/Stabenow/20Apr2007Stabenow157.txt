SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S VISIT TO EAST GRAND RAPIDS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today released the following statement on President Bush's remarks on the Iraq war:  
   "Once again the President has provided slogans when we need a real solution in Iraq. Our men and women in uniform are doing their job every day under the most dangerous conditions imaginable, and truly supporting our troops means having a plan for success that will allow them to come home safely. The administration's strategy, which has dragged our troops into the middle of a bloody civil war, is clearly not working." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
