SEN. STABENOW: RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS DEMAND ACTION
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today was joined by Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA to release a new report highlighting the rising cost of prescription drugs under current Medicare Part D plans. Earlier today, the Republican minority blocked a bill that would allow Medicare to bargain for cheaper prices.  
   "Seniors are paying too much for their prescription drugs, and this report confirms that," said Stabenow. "Only special interest groups benefit from the current policy, and I am disappointed that a minority of the Senate blocked our efforts to change that policy this morning. The fight to let Medicare negotiate lower drugs will continue - it is in the best interest of seniors, families, and taxpayers."
   The report examines Part D drug plan price changes from April 2006 to April 2007 for the top 15 drugs prescribed to seniors, such as Celebrex, Fosamaz, and Lipitor. According to the report, the median Part D drug price increase was 9.2 percent - almost four times the latest inflation rate (2.4 percent) and almost three times the increase in this year's cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security (3.3 percent). 
   The Families USA report examines changes in the lowest drug prices charged to seniors among the plans offered by the five largest insurers: UnitedHealthcare, Humana, WellPoint/Unicare, Member Health, and WellCare. Together these plans enrolled almost two-thirds of all Part D beneficiaries. Since these plans have the largest enrollment, they are in the best position, among Part D plans, to secure optimal prices from the pharmaceutical companies.
