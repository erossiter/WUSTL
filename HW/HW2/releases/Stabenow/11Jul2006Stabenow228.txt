SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON KEY PRESCRIPTION DRUG REIMPORTATION VICTORY
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the passage of an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill protecting individuals who import Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescription drugs from Canada:  
   "The Senate took an important step today, voting to protect the rights of individuals to purchase their prescription drugs from Canada. I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of this amendment, which passed with strong bipartisan support. Now that thousands of Michigan seniors are falling into the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, removing roadblocks to affordable medicine is more important than ever. 
   "Today's vote was just the first step. Now the Senate must pass legislation permitting American pharmacies to reimport cheaper medications from Canada, insuring that seniors and families in Michigan have full access to affordable prescription drugs.
