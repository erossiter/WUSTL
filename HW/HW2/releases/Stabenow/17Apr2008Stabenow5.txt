ALGER COUNTY TRANSPORTATION PROJECT TO BENEFIT FROM CHANGES IN TRANSPORTATION BILL
  A federally funded transportation project for the paving of Alger County Road H-58 in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore will be able to move forward thanks to a technical corrections bill that passed the Senate today, Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow (both D-Mich.) announced. The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for final passage and then sent to the President for his signature into law. 
   The technical corrections bill amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to fix some problems that became apparent in the transportation bill passed by Congress almost three years ago.
   "Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is a valued treasure here in Michigan that travelers across the country should have access to visit," said Stabenow. "This technical correction will improve access to the park and help provide an economic boost to Pictured Rocks and the region."
   "Sometimes a small correction makes a big difference," Levin said. "Once this paving project is completed, visitors to Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore will appreciate the easy access through the park."
   The technical correction affects a paving project in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. In the 2005 transportation bill, Levin and Stabenow secured the funds to pave two portions of Alger County Road H-58: between Buck Hill and Little Beaver Road and between Little Beaver Road and Sullivan Creek. The legislation inadvertently left out a short section of H-58, and according to the Federal Highway Administration, construction could not continue until this was amended. The technical corrections bill adds the missing section of H-58 to the area to be paved.
   During consideration of the 2005 transportation bill, the Senate included $12 million for the H-58 paving project while the House included $1,280,720.
