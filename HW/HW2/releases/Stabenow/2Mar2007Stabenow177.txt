SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $70,000 EPA CONTRACT FOR SMALL BUSINESS RESEARCH IN UPPER PENINSULA
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced on Friday, March 2, that the U.S. EPA has awarded a $70,000 Small Business Innovation Research contract to Lesktech Limited in Negaunee, Michigan. The funds will be used in partnership with Michigan Technological University to develop a method for treating waste from copper mines along the shores of Lake Superior for use in the production of roofing shingles. 
   "This is a win-win situation for the U.P. and for the health of our Great Lakes," said Levin. "This SBIR contract will help to fund important research, and I'm hopeful that it will also help to clean up the shores of Lake Superior in the future."
   "Collaboration between our state's universities and small businesses provides exciting opportunities for innovation and economic development," said Stabenow. "I applaud Michigan Tech and Lesktech Limited for coming together to preserve the beauty of Michigan's northern coast."
   The SBIR program is designed to help small businesses play a more significant role in federally funded research and development and help develop a stronger national base for technological innovation. Lesktech is one of 36 companies nationally to receive an SBIR contract.
