SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $640,000 COMING TO EIGHT MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that eight Michigan fire departments will receive $647,306 to pay for fire operations and fire safety programs, including training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The funds are being awarded through the fiscal year 2006 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
 "This grant program provides funding directly to local fire departments to improve their ability to respond to fires and fire-related emergencies in their communities," Stabenow said. "Our state's first responders deserve nothing less than the best possible equipment and training, and I'm pleased these grants will help these eight Michigan fire departments attain that goal."
 "Michigan's firefighters and first responders deserve the best equipment and training we can provide," said Levin. "These men and women are ready to risk their lives every day to protect our lives, homes and communities, and I hope this funding will help ensure their success and safety."
 The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the sixth and seventh rounds of supplemental awards for fiscal year 2006, with eight fire departments in Michigan receiving a total of $647,306 in federal funds.
