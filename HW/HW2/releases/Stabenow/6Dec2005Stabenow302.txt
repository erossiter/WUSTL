SENS. STABENOW, LANDRIEU: NO MORE DELAYS IN FUNDING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS, FIRST RESPONDERS
  In a news conference today, Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA) said that Congress must take immediate action to provide adequate funding for emergency preparedness and our first responders.  
   "Four years ago, this nation suffered a devastating terrorist attack, and in June 2003 a blue-ribbon commission headed by former Republican Senator Warren Rudman told us that America's first responders were vastly under-equipped for any new terrorist incident," Stabenow said. "Yesterday the nation received yet another warning from the 9/11 Commission that we are failing to prepare for future emergencies. We know what needs to be done - we need the leadership and the political will to take action."
   Stabenow noted that the Senate has had five votes in the last three years that would have provided the resources for first responders that have been recommended by the 9/11 Commission. For the last three years, Senators Stabenow and Christopher Dodd (D-CT) have offered an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bills to increase funding for first responders by $15 billion - providing resources for firefighter assistance grants, funding for compatible communications equipment and first responder training. Each time it was rejected by the Senate.
   * July 24, 2003 offered to the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations bill and rejected by a vote of 41-54.
   * September 9, 2004 offered to the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill and rejected by a vote of 41-53.
   * July 13, 2005 offered to the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill and rejected by a vote of 36-60.
   Stabenow also offered amendments to create a first responder communications equipment grant program and fund it at $5 billion each year for three years. This would ensure that all emergency responders would be able to communicate with one another during a natural disaster or terrorist attack. This amendment was rejected by the Senate twice.
   * July 14 2005, offered to the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill and rejected by a vote of 35-63. 
   * September 14, 2005 offered to fiscal year 2006 CJS appropriations bill and rejected by a vote of 40-58.
