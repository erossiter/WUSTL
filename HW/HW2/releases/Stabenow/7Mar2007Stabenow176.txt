SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $640,000 COMING TO THIRTEEN MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced on Wednesday, March 7, that thirteen Michigan fire departments will receive $644,495 to pay for fire operations and fire safety programs, including training, equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The funds are awarded through the fiscal year 2006 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Michigan's first responders work tirelessly every day to protect our neighborhoods and our families," said Stabenow. "I'm pleased this funding will provide our firefighters with the critical resources they need to stay safe while keeping their communities safe."
   "Firefighters are essential to the safety and security of our local communities," said Levin. "We owe it to these men and women to provide them with the best possible training and equipment so they can effectively do their jobs and protect Michigan families."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism.
