SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE CENTRAL, NORTHERN MICHIGAN, UPPER PENINSULA PROJECTS INCLUDED IN SENATE-PASSED DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that funding for many projects in Central and Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula is included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005, which the Senate passed last night by 98-0. 
   "This bill makes critical investments in two vital areas: winning the global war on terrorism and restoring our country's industrial and technological dominance," said Levin. "Every day in military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world, we see the contributions of Michigan's military community and our state's industries and universities. Michigan, with its dynamic and evolving industrial and technology sectors, continues to play a critical role in enhancing our national security."
   "For generations Michigan industries and Michigan workers have been key suppliers of quality materials for the nation's defense, and this bill continues that tradition," Stabenow said. "I am especially pleased that this bill will provide critical equipment to enhance the readiness and capability of the Michigan National Guard."
   Specific projects for Central and Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula follow:
   Procurement, Advanced Technology and Research and Development Programs:
   * $10 million for research into silicon substrates for solar cells. This program, run by DOW Corning in Midland, Michigan, is focused on developing silicon substrates for advanced solar cells.
   * $8 million for the Army's Flexible Display Initiative to develop lightweight, high definition, full color displays for soldiers and vehicles. Dow Corning in Midland, Michigan, is a major participant in this industry-wide technology development program.
   * $6.1 million for research, development, and demonstration of ground support equipment powered by fuel cells. The first phase of the project will involve a large-scale field trial using current generation proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in ground support equipment ranging from light carts to aircraft loaders. The second phase of the project will include development and delivery of next-generation PEM fuel cell technology for mobile power applications on military bases. Project partners include Ballard Power Systems, TACOM, Kettering University and the Air Force. Testing of these systems would take place at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. This includes over $46 million in funds for this region.
   * $6 million for the Army's Modular Causeway System. Oldenburg Lakeshore, Inc. of Iron Mountain, Michigan, produces the system.
   * $6 million for research into the advanced power electronics needed for many systems that depend on the development of new materials capable of significantly higher power, higher speed, and higher temperature operation. This research could help improve the capabilities of Navy airborne radar platforms, such as the E-2 Hawkeye. Dow Corning of Midland is a leader in producing these materials, known as wide bandgap semiconductors.
   * $3.5 million to continue the National Automotive Center (NAC) program to develop an advanced thermal management system for Army vehicles. Engineered Machined Products in Escanaba, Michigan, has partnered with the NAC in the development of these systems.
   * $2.9 million for the development of computer models for the Defense Department's Chemical & Biological Defense Program to predict how long chemical agents remain dangerous after an attack. This will help our military forces to better protect themselves and operate in contaminated environments. Kettering University, of Flint, is a technology leader role in developing these computer models.
   * $2.5 million for research on nanotechnology to develop revolutionary molecular-sized electronic circuitry. The Center for Nanomaterials Research at Michigan Technological University in Houghton partners with the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on the development on these miniaturized technologies.
   * $2 million to develop software tools to assist in the design of future Army tactical vehicles. ThermoAnalytics, Inc. of Calumet, Michigan, has been working with TARDEC on developing these new engineering design tools.
   * Over $1.4 billion for fundamental research to support the military at our nation's universities and government laboratories. Many Michigan universities, including the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State, Oakland University, Eastern Michigan University, Kettering University, Lawrence Technological University and Michigan Technological University, perform high quality fundamental research for the Department of Defense in all fields of science and technology.
   Michigan National Guard Projects:
   This bill included funding of projects that will enable the Michigan National Guard to procure materiel that it needs to fulfill its mission. Included among those projects are the following items:
   * $7.5 million for Air Force joint threat emitter systems for the Air National Guard. These systems simulate electronic combat signals produced by surface-to-air missiles and provide realistic electronic warfare training for pilots and aircrew members. Alpena, Michigan is home to a key Air National Guard Combat Readiness Training that employs these types of training technologies.
   Manufacturing Extension Program: The bill included an amendment that would make available additional funds for the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP). The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) helps small and mid-sized American manufacturers modernize and stay competitive in a global marketplace by boosting. The administration's 2004 budget reduced funding for this program by 88 percent.
   This amendment clarified that the Department of Commerce has the ability to transfer and reprogram $21.8 million to the MEP Program in fiscal year 2004. The Department of Commerce had argued that it was only able to reprogram up to $3.9 million for this program. This language will enable additional funds to be provided to our nation's 60 MEP centers. These centers are public-private partnerships that prove technical assistance and business support services to small manufacturers so that they can compete in the global market place.
   The House of Representatives passed the defense appropriations bill on June 22. The differences between the two bills will now be worked out in a conference committee.
