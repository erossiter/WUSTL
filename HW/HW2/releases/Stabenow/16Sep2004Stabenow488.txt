SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN COMMENT ON EPA ANNOUNCEMENT RECLASSIFYING THREE MICHIGAN AREAS AS MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE CLEAN AIR
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) offered the following comments today in response to an announcement by EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt that the air quality classifications of three Michigan regions have been reduced.  
   Reducing the classification means the areas are expected to achieve clean air sooner, and it also means the areas are subject to fewer mandatory emission control requirements. The affected areas are Cass County, Muskegon County, and the Detroit area.
   "We are very pleased the EPA has responded to our repeated requests to adjust the air quality classification of these three areas of Michigan," Stabenow said. "It remains my goal that Michigan be treated fairly under these national ozone standards." 
   "This long overdue decision is a sensible compromise and conclusion that will contribute to cleaner air without imposing unnecessary burdens on our communities," Levin said.
