SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $301,818 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR SEVEN FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN MICHIGAN
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that seven fire departments in the state of Michigan have received $301,818 in grants from the Department of Homeland Security.  
 Lincoln Park, Duncan Township, Centreville, Hillsdale, Muskegon Heights and Frederick Township Fire Departments will receive funding for fire operations and firefighter safety programs. Buena Vista Township Fire Department will receive funding for the firefighting vehicle acquisition program. 
   "Our firefighters deserve our full commitment as they risk their lives to protect our communities," Levin said. "These grants will provide our firefighters with additional training and needed equipment so that they can do their jobs more safely and effectively."
   "Assistance to Firefighters Grants play an important role in making sure that our nation's emergency responders have the equipment and training they need to respond to all hazards, " Stabenow said. "This round of funding will help another seven Michigan fire departments do their jobs, improve safety and save lives. "
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Fire Administration. The fire operations and firefighter safety programs provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. The vehicle acquisition program allows departments to purchase vehicles, such as tankers, rescue vehicles, foam units and ambulances.
