CONGRESS APPROVES SEN. STABENOW MEASURE TO FIGHT TRADE VIOLATIONS
  The U.S. Congress has passed a provision authored by Sen.  
 Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to combat trade violations by countries like China and Japan - including currency manipulation or product counterfeiting - by allocating an additional $1 million to the Treasury Department to stop these illegal trade practices.
   Stabenow's legislation was included as an amendment to the annual appropriations bill funding the U.S. Department of Treasury. Approved by both the House and Senate on Friday, the bill awaits the signature of the president, as he returns from a trip to Asia.
   "Illegal Chinese and Japanese trade policies are destroying American industries, costing us jobs, and hurting the middle class in this country," Stabenow said. "Unless our government stands up for American businesses and workers, our Michigan manufacturing base and middle class way of life are in jeopardy." 
   "When the rules are fair and enforced, Michigan manufacturers can keep producing automobiles that can compete fairly in the international market," Stabenow said. "My amendment provides the president with another enforcement tool to ensure that Michigan manufacturers have a level playing field in the global marketplace."
