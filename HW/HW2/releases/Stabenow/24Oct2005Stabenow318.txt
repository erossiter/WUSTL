SEN. STABENOW SEEKS TO HEAD OFF DOUBLE-DIGIT MEDICARE PREMIUM HIKE
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) has introduced legislation to prevent a 13 percent increase in Medicare Part B premiums, a hike that threatens to eat up one-fourth of the planned $39 average monthly increase in Social Security payments. 
   "The increase in Social Security payments should be welcome news to older Americans, but the scheduled Medicare premium increase steals 25 percent of their additional income," Stabenow said. "Seniors can't afford this increase as they struggle to keep up with high prices for prescription drugs, record prices at the pump and a winter of high home heating costs. That's why I will fight to cap next year's Medicare premiums at a more reasonable level."
   By tying the premium increase to a rise in the cost of living, Stabenow's legislation, the Keep the Promise of Medicare Act of 2006, would cap the Medicare Part B premium increase at $3.20.
   In other efforts to combat rising health care costs, Stabenow has:
   * Sponsored legislation that would allow reimportation of U.S. prescription drugs from Canada.
   * Introduced a bill to allow Medicare to negotiate a bulk-purchase price for prescription drugs. Giving Medicare this authority could trim drug costs as much as 200-500 percent, based on the success of the Veterans Administration in negotiating for veterans' prescription drugs.
