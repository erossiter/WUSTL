SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW URGE MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO APPLY FOR FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security will be accepting applications for the Fiscal Year 2004 Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program (FPSGP) through September 30, 2004.  
   "Prevention is key to overall fire safety, and if fire departments can help stop fires before they start, it will help keep our communities safer," said Levin. "I encourage fire departments throughout the state to apply for these grants so that they may have more resources for their life saving efforts." 
   "I have been fighting for expanded funding for first responders, because public safety officials have told me how much help they need to meet their new community responsibilities for homeland security," Stabenow said. "I urge agencies large and small across Michigan to make use of this program and apply for these grants."
   The FPSGP is administered through the Department of Homeland Security and is designed to help fire departments address fire safety and prevention issues at the national, regional, state and local levels. These grants are geared specifically to help fire departments aid high-risk groups such as children and seniors and also to assist firefighters in their rescue efforts. This program also places great emphasis on preventing fire related injuries to children.
   For application and program guidance please visit www.firegrantsupport.com. Any prospective applicants may address their questions regarding the FPSGP to the fire grant help desk at 1-866-274-0960 or firegrants@dhs.gov.
