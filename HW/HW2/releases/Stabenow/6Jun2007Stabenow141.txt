SENS. STABENOW, REID, LEVIN DISCUSS FUTURE OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, along with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), and other members of the Senate Democratic Caucus, met today with top manufacturing executives, labor leaders, and other experts from around the nation to discuss the problems facing domestic manufacturers. 
   "The choice in a global economy is either to race to the bottom or race to the top," said Stabenow. "We want to partner with manufacturers to make this a race to the top by leveling the playing field on trade, addressing the cost of health care, and investing in education and innovation so we can keep and create good-paying jobs here in America." 
   The Summit was highlighted by a lunch meeting with General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner, Ford CEO Alan Mulally, Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda, and UAW President Ron Gettelfinger. The meeting, entitled "The Future of the Domestic Auto Industry," featured a frank discussion between Senate democrats, the Big 3 and the UAW President, moderated by Stabenow.
