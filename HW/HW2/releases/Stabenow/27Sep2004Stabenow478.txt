SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $60,000 GRANT FOR ASSOCIATION FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a $60,000 grant to the Association for Children's Mental Health (ACMH) in Lansing.  
 The ACMH is an organization that focuses on supporting children and families whose lives have been affected by mental illness. 
   "Families of children with mental health issues must have the needed support to face these unique challenges," said Levin. "This grant will help fund initiatives to improve education, offer more support and help these families in their efforts to deal with their special situations." 
   "Families struggling to cope with serious emotional disturbances in their children need information and support," Stabenow said. "This funding will have a positive impact on Michigan families who must deal with this health issue." 
   The ACMH will use the funds from this grant to focus on Michigan children and their families who have been affected by mental illness. The association will work to encourage these persons to act for change in the current mental health system, and improve their family skills and knowledge by providing provisional training, education and increased information access through improved partnerships with regional mental health agencies.
