SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $1.5 MILLION TO FIGHT VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC SEPTICEMIA
  U.S. Senators Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will make $1.5 million in contingency funds available to control viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in the Great Lakes and surrounding states. The funding will focus on education, testing, and surveillance and compliance efforts to prevent the spread of VHS, a deadly fish disease.  
   "We don't have a minute to spare in fighting the spread of VHS," said Levin. "This funding will help prevent its introduction into Lake Superior or more of our inland lakes, fish hatcheries and aquaculture facilities. With more resources dedicated to keeping tabs on VHS, I am hopeful that we can better track this deadly disease and, hopefully, bring an end to its terrible impact on the Great Lakes."
   "Viral hemorrhagic septicemia poses a serious danger to our native fish species and our state's food supply," said Stabenow. "I am hopeful this funding will help better identify and prevent this virus from infecting more of Michigan's fish population."
   VHS, an invasive species that causes internal hemorrhaging and death in many different species of fish, has been reported in Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario and St. Clair and has recently spread to inland lakes in Michigan, New York and Wisconsin.
   The contingency funding provided by APHIS will support laboratory upgrades at the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories to improve confirmatory testing, surveillance and compliance support efforts in coordination with state and tribal agencies in the Great Lakes watershed, and an educational campaign to promote biosecurity efforts and prevent the spread of VHS.
