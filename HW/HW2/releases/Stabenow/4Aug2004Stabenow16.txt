SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $1.06 MILLION IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR 17 MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that 17 fire departments in the state of Michigan have received $1,058,137 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These communities will use the funds for fire prevention, fire operations and firefighter safety programs. 
   "This grant program provides funding directly to local fire departments across Michigan to improve their ability to respond to fires and fire-related emergencies," Stabenow said. "These 16 federal grants will help local firefighters protect the communities they serve, while protecting themselves with better equipment, training and conditioning."
   "Our firefighters deserve the most advanced equipment and training to fight fires and protect their communities," said Levin. "This funding will assist these Michigan fire departments with the essential resources they need to do their job, including educating the public about fire prevention."
   These grants are provided through the Fiscal Year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Fire Administration. Grants for Fire Operations and Firefighter Safety provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. The Fire Prevention Program includes fire code enforcement and the purchase and installation of smoke alarms and fire suppression systems.
