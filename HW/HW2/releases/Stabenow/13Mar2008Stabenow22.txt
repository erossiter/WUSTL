SEN. STABENOW: SENATE BUDGET INVESTS IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS, GOOD-PAYING JOBS FOR MIDDLE CLASS WORKERS
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today announced that the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution paves the way for Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) funding. MEP centers assist manufacturers with cutting-edge technologies and product innovation to stay competitive in the global economy. 
   "The MEP is a vital program that helps our manufacturers stay competitive," said Stabenow. "At a time when we are losing manufacturing jobs overseas, we must do everything we can to create, protect and keep manufacturing jobs here in Michigan and America."
   As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Stabenow played a key role in ensuring the budget included $122 million for MEP, laying the groundwork to fully fund the program. In sharp contrast, the President's Budget included only $4 million for MEP funding. Restoring this investment, will help our manufacturers stay competitive and create quality jobs here at home.
   Last month, over 52,000 manufacturing jobs were lost nationwide- the most since July 2003.
   The Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution is expected to pass the Senate late this evening.
