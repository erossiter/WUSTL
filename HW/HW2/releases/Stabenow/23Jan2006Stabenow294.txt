SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING JOB CUTS AT FORD
 Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding Ford Motor Co.'s announcement that it will be cutting nearly 30,000 jobs nationwide and closing 14 assembly pants, including its plant in Wixom, Michigan:  
   "Today's announcement by Ford is another serious blow to Michigan workers and to our economy. I am deeply concerned for those who are impacted by the closing of the Wixom plant and I will help the affected workers and families in any way that I can."
   "These plant closings are yet another wake-up call to the Administration that we need to change our policies to save our manufacturing jobs. I agree with Bill Ford when he says that we cannot cut our way to success. We have to enforce our trade laws, change the way we fund health care and protect pensions in a way that does not hurt our manufacturers."
