SEN. STABENOW PLANS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO NAME DETROIT BUILDING 'ROSA PARKS FEDERAL BUILDING'
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) plans to introduce legislation in the U.S. Senate later this week that would name the building currently housing the Federal Homeland Security Office at 333 Mt.  
 Elliott Street in Detroit the "Rosa Parks Federal Building." Rep. Kilpatrick (D-MI) has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives earlier today. 
   "We are profoundly fortunate to have the mother of the civil rights movement as our neighbor in Michigan," said Stabenow. "I am looking forward to the day when this historic building stands as a permanent reminder of our nation's deep gratitude to Mrs. Parks for her courage, strength and history-making sacrifice." 
   This year marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks' historic act of civil disobedience and her arrest that brought the issue of civil rights before the American people. The bus boycott spurred by Mrs. Parks' heroic act lasted 381 days and directly led to the desegregation of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus system the following year. Mrs. Parks has been a resident of Detroit since 1957.
