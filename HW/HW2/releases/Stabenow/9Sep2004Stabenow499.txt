SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $850,000 USDA GRANT FOR VILLAGE OF FREEPORT
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded the Village of Freeport a grant for $850,000 to replace and improve its water supply, distribution and storage facilities.  
   "Water supply, distribution and storage are critical to the success of any municipality," said Levin. "The funds from this grant will give Freeport an opportunity to provide its residents with their water needs safely, efficiently and economically."
   "Rural Utilities Service grants like this grant for the Village of Freeport are important sources of funding to help small communities maintain and improve their basic infrastructure," Stabenow said. "This work will ensure that the people of Freeport have access clean water - the basic staple of modern life and community growth."
   Freeport owns and operates a municipal water system consisting of two wells serving 189 customers. The current system has insufficient power to supply Freeport with its water demands and the pipes for the water are in need of serious repair and replacement. Chlorine and phosphate use as well as iron treatment take place at the well site. The well field is located in the surrounding flood plain, and the Coldwater River has tested positive for fecal coliform in the past because of inadequate equipment for treatment and proximity to the flood plain. Freeport's 100,000 gallon elevated water storage tank is also in need of interior and exterior repair and maintenance.
   The funding for this grant comes through the USDA's Rural Utilities Service and will alleviate Freeport's water problems through:
   * Drilling of two or three new wells and installation of pumps, motors and controls, as well as standby equipment and miscellaneous accessories to efficiently power the wells.
   * Replacement of existing water main with approximately 13,000 feet of new six, eight and 10 inch water main.
   * Purchase of new valves, hydrants and service connections as needed.
   * Removal of existing exterior coating of water storage tank, replacement with interior coating.
