SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE THREE $100,000 SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION GRANTS FOR MICHIGAN COMMUNITY COALITIONS
  Three community anti-drug coalitions have received grants of $100,000 each from the Drug-Free Communities Program to aid in their efforts to reduce substance abuse among youth, Sens.  
 Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today. 
   The three coalitions are the Berkley, Huntington Woods and Oak Park Tri-Community Coalition; the Project WEAVE Coalition in Marquette; and the Family Youth Coalition, serving Saginaw County.
   "An important aspect of these grants is that they allow each coalition to use the funding for programs unique to its own community," Stabenow said. "The goal of each program, however, is the same - to reach out to young people and head off substance abuse before it becomes a destructive force in their lives."
   "These three communities are taking different but equally important steps towards substance abuse reduction and prevention," said Levin. "Targeting troubled youths, educating a diverse group of middle school students and providing a seven point system to build a drug free community are different approaches to achieving the same goal- a drug free community."
   Created under the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997, the Drug-Free Communities Program has earned strong bipartisan support from Congress. The act was extended for five years in December 2001, authorizing $399 million in funds through fiscal year 2007.
   The grants support coalitions that are comprised of a diverse cross-section of the community, including parents, youth, teachers, religious and fraternal organizations, health care and business professionals, law enforcement, the media, and community leaders. The goal is to prevent and reduce drug, alcohol and tobacco use among youth.
