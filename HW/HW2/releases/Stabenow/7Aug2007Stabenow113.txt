SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $340,000 COMING TO WESTERN MICHIGAN FOR ANTI-GANG PROGRAMS
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that Grand Valley State University will receive $345,657 to provide Western Michigan with funding to support new and expanded anti-gang programs. This will include educational, community awareness and anti-crime programs. The funds were awarded under the Department of Justice FY 2007 Anti-Gang Initiative program.  
   "Our children need the support of parents, law enforcement, and community leaders to resist gangs and the temptation to choose the wrong path early on in life," said Stabenow. "This funding will help communities throughout Western Michigan combat gangs by providing law enforcement and community organizations with the much-needed resources."
   "This federal funding is critical because it targets gangs and the problems they pose for communities in west Michigan," said Levin. "I am hopeful that these programs will help to educate the public and protect neighborhoods and families."
   Grand Valley State University will distribute these funds to community organizations and law enforcement to combat gang-related violence throughout the Western District of Michigan. The Anti-Gang Initiative program provides funds to support new or expanded anti-gang enforcement and prevention efforts under the existing Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) Initiative.
