SEN. STABENOW, COLLEAGUES PASS EXPANSION OF HEALTH COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), this evening announced Senate passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007. The program provides health insurance to children of working families who are not eligible for Medicaid, but still unable to afford private health insurance. The legislation will provide Michigan with the resources needed to cover the 90,000 children currently eligible, but not enrolled in the program.  
   "This is a victory for working families across the country," said Stabenow. "This bill is a critical step in providing coverage for the over 3 million uninsured children. Health care should be a right, not a privilege, in America, and parents in the greatest country on earth shouldn't have to go to bed worried about what they will do if their children get sick." 
   The $35 billion bipartisan agreement renews and improves the successful program. The agreement will maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children currently enrolled in the program. In addition, it will provide quality health coverage to an additional 3.2 million low-income, uninsured American children. Under the agreement, Michigan will receive approximately $210 million a year in funds to cover more children without insurance 
   Also included in the bill is a section authored by Senator Stabenow to provide grants to demonstrate the effectiveness of electronic medical records for children. These technologies reduce medical costs by improving efficiency, quality of care and patient safety. A study by the RAND Corporation suggested savings as high as $81 billion a year through effective use of electronic records.
