SEN. STABENOW WELCOMES UKRAINIAN SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO INVALIDATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow issued the following statement today in the wake of a ruling by the Supreme Court of Ukraine invalidating the results of the nation's Nov. 1 election for president and ordering a new runoff election in December:  
   "I welcome the Ukraine Supreme Court's decision to overturn the disputed November 21 presidential election. Numerous independent observers, including the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, concluded that a concerted effort of electoral fraud and abuse had marred the election. The Ukraine Supreme court found 'systemic and massive violations' by election authorities, and accepted the arguments presented to the court that the abuses prevented a free and fair election. 
   "A fair and legitimate election for Ukraine's highest office is critical to ensure confidence in the Presidency of the Ukraine and Ukraine's democratic system.
   "I encourage all parties to accept the Ukraine Supreme Court's findings and work together to ensure a fair election that represents the will of the Ukrainian people."
