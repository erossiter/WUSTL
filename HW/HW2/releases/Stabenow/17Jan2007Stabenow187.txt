  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced on Wednesday, January, 17 that five Michigan Fire Departments will receive $402,035 to pay for fire operations and fire safety programs, including training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The funds are being awarded through the fiscal year 2006 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "It's important that we continue to strengthen our firefighting agencies through training, new equipment, and fire prevention programs," Stabenow said. "This funding will help these five agencies provide their communities with better fire protection."
   "Michigan's first responders play a vital role in ensuring our safety and security," said Levin. "These federal dollars are an important step in providing them with the resources they need to prepare for a wide variety of potential dangers."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism.
