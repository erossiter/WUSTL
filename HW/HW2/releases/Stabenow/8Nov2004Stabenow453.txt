SEN. STABENOW ON TRACK FOR LEADERSHIP POSITION
  After only four years in the Senate, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) has the support from her colleagues for election to the third highest ranking leadership position in the Senate Democratic Caucus.  
   As Caucus Secretary, Stabenow will join the Senate's soon to be elected new leadership team with Democratic Leader, Senator Harry Reid and Democratic Whip, Senator Dick Durbin. Caucus Secretary is one of only three elected leadership positions in the Democratic Caucus. The Senate is expected to meet on November 16 to elect its new leaders. 
   The position is being vacated by Senator Barbara Mikulski who said in a letter to her colleagues last week, "I want to open the door for someone else...just as the door was opened for me 10 years ago."
   Stabenow said, "Senator Mikulski did an outstanding job in this position. I sincerely value her service to the Democratic caucus and look forward to continuing my work with her over the coming years."
   "Senator Stabenow has earned the respect of her colleagues because they have seen first hand her effective leadership, hard work, and the ability to get the job done," said Senator Harry Reid. 
   "I look forward to taking on this leadership position which will allow me to more effectively fight for the things that matter most to the people of Michigan and get the job done," said Stabenow. "We have important work ahead of us on critical issues like stopping Canadian trash, making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, protecting our manufacturing economy and creating good paying jobs. I look forward to continuing to lead the fight on these important issues."
