SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON SENATE REJECTION OF ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO CUT OVERTIME PAY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) commented today on the Senate's approval of an amendment by Sen.  
 Tom Harkin (D-IA) that would protect the overtime benefits of American workers:
   "This is a great victory for working families in Michigan, and it will keep millions of Americans from losing part of their paycheck. 
   "The administration's proposed overtime rule was a fundamental attack on the wages and benefits of hard-working Americans. Today's vote in the U.S. Senate sends a clear message to the administration that this rule should not be implemented."
