SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE NEARLY $375,000 TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE IN SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN
  U.S. Senators Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance is awarding $374,859 to the Detroit Community Justice Partnership to reduce gun crime in southeast Michigan through Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN).  
   "Gun violence rips apart families and communities, and the Project Safe Neighborhoods program will help bring local police together to protect against that," said Levin. "These federal dollars will provide a boost to local law enforcement and make our streets safer."
   "Sadly, gun violence continues to place our families and communities in danger," said Stabenow. "The Project Safe Neighborhoods program provides law enforcement with much needed resources to combat crimes and help keep our cities safe."
   The Detroit Community Justice Partnership will act as the fiscal agent, in coordination with the PSN Task Force, to allocate funds to the Jackson, Flint and Saginaw Police Departments and the Jackson, Genesee and Saginaw County District Attorneys. The program will focus on reducing gun violence and gun-related crime through a comprehensive approach that emphasizes enforcement and prosecution.
