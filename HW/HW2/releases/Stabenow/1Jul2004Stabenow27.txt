SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION, ASSISTANCE WILL HELP MICHIGAN COUNTIES RECOVER FROM MAY STORM DAMAGE
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) said today the federal disaster declaration and federal assistance for 23 Michigan counties will help individuals and communities recover from the severe storms that hit Michigan in May.  
   "The violent storms that struck the state between May 20 and 24 brought heavy winds and flooding rains that caused an estimated $32 million in damages," Stabenow said. "In response to a request from Gov. Granholm and the Michigan congressional delegation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has now declared the affected areas a disaster, making federal aid available. This financial assistance is vitally needed to help families in these areas repair and rebuild."
   "The torrential rains, tornadoes, hail and severe winds that hit our state in late May damaged thousands of homes and businesses," Levin.
