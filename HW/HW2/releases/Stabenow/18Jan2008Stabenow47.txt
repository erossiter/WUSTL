SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS REGARDING ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the President's comments today regarding an emergency fiscal stimulus package: 
   "Middle-class families all over Michigan and across our country are struggling - the time to act is now. I appreciate that the President has finally recognized the economic problems facing our nation, but it's critical that any economic stimulus package must be focused on supporting the middle-class families and small businesses that are truly feeling the effects of the economic downturn. 
   "We shouldn't be giving rebate checks to the wealthy, and we shouldn't be giving tax breaks to companies that are sending jobs overseas. The people of Michigan have been struggling for too long. We need a package that invests in those who need it most, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this legislation gives a jump start to the middle class and invests in businesses that are creating jobs at home." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
