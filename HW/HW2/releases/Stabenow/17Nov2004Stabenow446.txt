SEN. STABENOW: CHANGE OF ADDRESS FORM CAN REUNITE MORE THAN 1,500 MICHIGAN RESIDENTS WITH THEIR MISSING TAX REFUNDS
  More than 1,500 Michigan residents can claim their personal share of more $1.1 million in income tax refunds by correcting or updating their addresses with the Internal Revenue Service, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) said today. 
   "When people move or change their address and fail to notify the IRS or the U.S. Postal Service of this change, their refund check is returned to the IRS," Stabenow said. "With a quick visit to the IRS Web site 'Where's my refund?' people can verify that they are due a refund and, in some cases, get instructions online to resolve potential account issues."
   Browsers can link to "Where's my refund?" from the IRS home page at http://www.irs.gov/ They should be ready to enter several identifying pieces of information, including Social Security number, filing status - such as single, married filing joint return, or head of household -
  and the exact amount of the refund as shown on their tax form.
   Individuals without access to the Internet should have tax return information at hand and call the IRS toll-free assistance line at 1-800-829-1040.
   According to information release by the IRS, the number of undeliverable checks in Michigan has gone down in 2004 by 363, but the average refund has gone up since 2003 from $674 to $767. Refunds can be as small as $1, but one Michigan resident is missing a refund of $75,000.
   Stabenow said taxpayers may want to consider direct deposit of tax refunds in a personal checking or savings account to guard against theft or loss of refund checks. The IRS states that more than 49 million taxpayers chose direct deposit of almost $120 billion in refunds this year, a jump of almost 11 percent from last year.
   For residents who will continue to watch the mail for their refund check and are considering a move, an IRS change-of-address form, Form 8822, is available for download at the IRS Web site or by calling 1-800-829-3676.
