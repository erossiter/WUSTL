SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $20,000 COMING TO MICHIGAN FOR FIRE SAFETY
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that the Ironwood Public Safety Department will receive $14,250 and the City of Wixom Fire Department will receive $5,767 for fire prevention and safety programs. The funds are awarded under the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP).  
   "Community safety and fire prevention begins with education and outreach," said Stabenow. "I'm thankful this funding will provide Ironwood and Wixom the resources needed to prevent fires and other hazard-related accidents." 
   "Fire prevention education classes are essential to keeping our communities safe," said Levin. "This federal funding will improve public awareness of fire-related dangers and help keep the communities of Wixom and Ironwood safe."
   The primary goal of the AFGP Fire Prevention and Safety Program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, is to mitigate or prevent the danger to the public and first responders posed by fire and other hazards. Projects supported by the program include fire prevention and public safety education campaigns, media outreach, and arson prevention and awareness programs.
