SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR OVER $450,000 FOR LAPEER
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the National Parks Service has awarded the City of Lapeer a grant for $450,686 for the Optimist Community Soccer Field Expansion.  
 The grant will provide funds for development of five soccer fields, a playground, pavilion, bleachers, goals, restrooms and concessions building, accessible pathways and other amenities.
   "Development of these soccer fields will provide valuable places of recreation for Lapeer," said Levin. "All of these additions will make this a wonderful facility for soccer and other athletic activities." 
  "Soccer is a sport with a vibrant future in the U.S., and the fact that the U.S. Women's National Team is advancing to the gold medal game in the Olympics can only spur more interest in the game," Stabenow said. "This National Park Service grant will ensure that as this sport grows in the Lapeer area, these facilities will be available."
   The soccer fields are located in Lapeer, just south of Lapeer East High School. The grant amount will provide for half the cost of development. Funding for the grant comes through the National Park Service's Land and Water Conservation Fund. The goals of these grants are to promote the ideals of preservation and aid already existing public parks. For more information regarding LWCF grants, please visit: www.nps.gov.
