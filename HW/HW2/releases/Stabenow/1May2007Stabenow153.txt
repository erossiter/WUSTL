SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT IN REACTION TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO OF EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today released the following statement in reaction to President Bush's veto of the Emergency Supplemental bill:  
   "I am very disappointed the President vetoed this bill to fund our troops in Iraq, support our veterans when they return, and provide assistance to those who need it here at home, particularly those affected by Hurricane Katrina. Instead of accepting our strategy to responsibly end the war and bring our troops home safely, President Bush's veto will keep our military engaged in an open-ended civil war. If the President has a different plan for holding the Iraqis accountable for their future and bringing our troops home safely and responsibly, the Congress, the Iraqis and the American people need to hear it immediately." -U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
