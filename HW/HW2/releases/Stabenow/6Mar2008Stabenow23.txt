REP. STABENOW ANNOUNCES 'NATIONAL SUPPORT THE TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES DAY' RESOLUTION PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced that the Senate has unanimously supported her resolution, once again designating March 26 as "National Support the Troops and Their Families Day." Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) is a co-sponsor of this resolution. 
   "Our active-duty troops and their families make enormous sacrifices in service to this nation, and we owe them our eternal gratitude," Stabenow said. "I am pleased that the Senate has once again set aside a day to honor our brave men and women and their families, the same way we do our veterans."
   First passed two years ago, "National Support the Troops and Their Families Day" was the idea of then sixteen-year-old Alexandra McGregor of Waterford, Michigan. This resolution states that "all Americans should participate in a moment of silence to support our troops."
   "Without the troops, our country would not be what it is," said McGregor. "Everyday men and women put their lives on the line, and I believe that we should recognize them for everything they do. This is why I spearheaded Support Our Troops and Their Families Day."
