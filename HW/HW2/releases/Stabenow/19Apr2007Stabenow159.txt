SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS AWARDED TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, WAYNE COUNTY AIRPORT
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) on Thursday, April 19, announced that Children's Hospital of Michigan will receive $43,847 and the Wayne County Airport Authority will receive $13,000 for fire prevention and safety programs. The funds are awarded under the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Community safety and fire prevention begins with education and outreach," said Stabenow. "I'm pleased this funding will provide Children's Hospital and Wayne County Airport the resources needed to prevent fire related emergencies." 
   "These federal dollars will help to keep Detroiters safe from the devastating consequences of fire and other dangers," said Levin. "Educating the public about potential hazards is an important step in protecting our homes and communities."
   The primary goal of the AFGP Fire Prevention and Safety Program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, is to mitigate or prevent the danger to the public and first responders posed by fire and other hazards. Projects supported by the program include fire prevention and public safety education campaigns, media outreach, and arson prevention and awareness programs.
