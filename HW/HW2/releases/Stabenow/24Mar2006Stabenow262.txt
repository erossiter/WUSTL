SEN. STABENOW APPLAUDS $1 BILLION IN HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has agreed to release $1 billion in additional funds for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP), with Michigan slated to receive over $40 million. Earlier this month, the Senate passed legislation supported by Stabenow to release these funds. 
   "Any funding to help keep America's neediest families out of the cold is a step in the right direction," said Stabenow. "I applaud HHS for recognizing the urgency of this issue, and I hope we can work together to secure future funding so that families and seniors can make ends meet each and every winter."
   This additional $1 billion will bring total LIHEAP funding to $3.16 billion for this year - nearly $2 billion below the amount needed to fully fund the program. In his FY2007 budget proposal, President Bush allocates only $1.78 billion for heating assistance next winter.
   According to the Energy Information Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Energy, even though it has been a decidedly mild winter nationwide, Americans have faced the highest heating costs in a generation.
