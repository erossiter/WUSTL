SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $1.845 MILLION FOR SAGINAW COUNTY FLOOD PROTECTION
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded $1,845,000 to the Flint River Dike and Erosion Control Board in Saginaw County to help fund improvements to dikes and reservoirs along the Flint River damaged during severe storms and flooding in 2000. The funding comes as part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.  
   "This federal funding will bring much-needed improvements to the Flint River and will create jobs along the way," said Levin. "The increased protection against erosion and flooding will protect the people of Saginaw County from repeated storm and flood damages and the financial hardships that follow."
   "The severe storms and flooding Saginaw Country residents faced in 2000 caused significant personal hardship and financial loss," said Stabenow. "Improving flood control measures for the Flint River is critical in preserving and improving the quality of life for the community. I am very pleased these funds will allow this much-needed project to be completed."
   The project includes the reconstruction of existing earthen dikes and the construction of a storage reservoir and two wetland areas to control flooding and erosion. The improvements will help prevent floodwaters from overtaking the dikes and mitigate the financial loss to the community from repeated flood damage.
