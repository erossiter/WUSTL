SENS. STABENOW, DURBIN TO REPRESENT DEMOCRATS IN SOCIAL SECURITY DEBATE
 Sens. Durbin and Stabenow (D-MI) will be the two Democratic participants in a formal debate tonight on privatization of Social Security with Senate Republicans. Sens. Santorum (R-PA) and DeMint (R-SC) will represent the Republicans.  
   Tonight's Social Security debate is hosted jointly by the Democratic Policy Committee and the Republican Policy Committee on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This debate is part of a continuing series of Senate floor debates organized by the DPC and RPC on major issues facing the nation. This type of debate is unique in the Senate, as it requires suspension of Senate rules that prohibit Senators from directly addressing each other during floor debate.
   "President Bush and the Republicans have been desperately trying to sell their ideas for privatizing Social Security to the American people," Durbin said. "But the more people learn about privatizing Social Security, the less people like the idea. Tonight will be a real opportunity for both sides to make their best and clearest arguments on privatization. I believe that, after hearing both sides, most Americans will reject once and for all the President's proposals to privatize Social Security."
   "We know Social Security faces long-term challenges, but privatization is not the answer, because the numbers just don't add up. Not only does the administration's plan fail to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security, but it also cuts the average retiree's benefits $152,000 over 20 years and adds $4.9 trillion to the national debt," Stabenow said. "I know that most Americans agree - and this debate will reaffirm - that we need to work together to ensure the continued viability of this great American success story. Let's keep the security in Social Security."
   The debate will take place at 6:00 EDT and televised nationally on CSPAN-2.
