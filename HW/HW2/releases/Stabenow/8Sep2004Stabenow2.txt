SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $17.4 MILLION IN DOT GRANTS FOR SEVERAL MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $17,491,922 in grants to several Michigan communities. The DOT grants will be used for bus allocation, repair and service expansion as well as construction of bus station amenities, storage facilities, office buildings and a transfer center.  
   "Affordable and functional transportation is a critical need for Michigan's economy and its residents," said Levin. "The funds from these grants will revitalize public transportation in several communities, provide new public transportation for others and generally help to make Michigan residents' commutes easier."
   "Public transportation is a sensible choice for many people, but for others it's an essential means of obtaining and maintaining quality jobs to support their families," Stabenow said. "Just as we support job growth, we must support the infrastructure that allows people to get and keep good jobs"
