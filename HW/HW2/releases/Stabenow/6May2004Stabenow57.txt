SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON REPORTS THAT VETERANS' ACUTE CARE FACILITY IN SAGINAW WILL BE CLOSED
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) responded today to reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs will formally announce its intention to close the acute care facility at the Aleda E. Lutz Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Saginaw: 
   "I strongly disagree with the VA's apparent decision to close the acute care facility at Saginaw's Aleda E. Lutz Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
   "While fighting the Administration will be a tough battle, I will do everything I can to keep this facility open. In fact, I recently introduced legislation to block closing of the facility. 
   "Ultimately, this is a move in the wrong direction, and it undermines veterans' health care in Michigan.
   "In the end, we need to do more for our veterans, not less. It is especially distressing that in a time of war we are eliminating services for our veterans here at home."
