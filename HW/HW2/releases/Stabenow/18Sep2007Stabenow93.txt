SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $55 MILLION TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is awarding approximately $55 million over five years to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to help reduce health disparities, offer training opportunities for students, and enable clinical researchers to turn laboratory research into treatments that benefit patients more quickly and efficiently. The funding comes as part of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program. This program is being led by the National Center for Research Resources, a component of NIH.  
   "The University of Michigan continues to be a national leader in the development of new medical research," said Stabenow. "I am grateful this funding will help our great institution remain a leader in the life sciences, create research jobs, and transform medical research into quality patient care."
   "With this federal funding, the University of Michigan will continue to play a leading role in cutting-edge medical research," said Levin. "Their work will help translate science into real-world results and has the potential to alleviate pain and suffering and save lives in Michigan and throughout the world."
   This grant will help the University of Michigan develop a state-of-the-art clinical and translational research center, which will aid in the overall CTSA goal of improving medical care for patients, community organizations, and health care providers. 
   NIH initiated the CTSA program last year to promote and improve clinical research by providing medical institutions with the resources and tools they need to develop treatments for diseases. The University of Michigan was one of twelve institutions in this latest round of funding, expanding the CTSA program to include a total of twenty four funded institutions.
