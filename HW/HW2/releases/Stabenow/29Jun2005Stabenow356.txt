SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN REACT TO HOUSE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF LEGISLATION TO REGULATE CANADIAN SOLID WASTE
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) issued the following comments today in response to the action of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which on a voice vote approved legislation to help block the flow of Canadian municipal into Michigan.  
 Stabenow and Levin are authors of the companion bill in the Senate.
   "This bipartisan legislation will empower Michigan to pass its own laws to limit trash imports and push the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce our existing treaty with Canada, and we will work the Senate to match the quick action of the House," the senators said. "We will be sending a letter in the near future to Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords, the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, urging them to expedite the legislation."
