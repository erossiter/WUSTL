SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $600,000 FOR DETROIT ANTI-GANG INITIATIVE
  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance is awarding $600,937 to the Detroit Community Justice Partnership to identify, disrupt and dismantle covert gang organizations operating in Detroit's northwest district. The funding is part of the Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative.  
   "Gang violence tears our communities apart and this funding will help Detroit police work with residents to stop these illegal activities," said Levin. "This will be a significant step towards getting criminals off the streets and making sure they are brought to justice for the havoc they wreak in our neighborhoods."
   "Our battle against gangs is a battle for safe neighborhoods, for families, and for the futures of the young people who are being recruited for a life of crime," Stabenow said. "This grant is an important tool in this fight, because it helps bring community residents and law enforcement together in the struggle to break up gangs."
   Detroit's anti-gang initiative will focus on both prevention and enforcement. Prevention efforts include community outreach presentations to encourage and strengthen cooperation between police officers and residents as well as education and training programs to help residents combat and cope with gang-related violence. There will be a wide range of enforcement activities, including: intelligence operations aimed at identifying and arresting offenders; physical surveillance of gang members; conducting sweeps, raids and searches of suspected venues; and targeting priority gangs for prosecution under applicable statutes.
