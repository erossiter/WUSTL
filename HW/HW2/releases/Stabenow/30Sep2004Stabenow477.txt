SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $649,800 IN GRANTS FOR DETROIT, KENT COUNTY
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded $649,800 to the City of Detroit and Kent County to improve their response capabilities to a potential terrorist attack.  
   "Our communities need to be prepared to respond to and minimize the damage from a terrorist attack," said Levin. "These grants will provide Detroit and Kent County with needed resources to help prepare their first responders and medical personnel in the event of a catastrophic attack."
   "Even as we work to close our borders to possible terrorist attacks, we must at the same time prepare our communities to deal with such an attack," Stabenow said. "These grants will help ensure that emergency medical technicians and other public health officials can react promptly and in a coordinated way with police and firefighters, should the unthinkable occur."
   The grants have been awarded through the DHS's Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS). These grants are designed to supplement and improve existing local capabilities for response to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and high casualty attacks. 
   Two types of MMRS grants were awarded: Capability Focus Areas (CFA) grants and sustainment grants. CFA grants are designed to help localities respond to new threats from WMD, such as the detonation of a dirty bomb. Sustainment grants fund training and equipment needed to deal with the medical complications of a high casualty attack. 
   The City of Detroit MMRS Office of Homeland Security/Emergency Management received a CFA grant for $250,000. Kent County Emergency Medical Services Inc. in Grand Rapids received a CFA grant for $249,800 and a sustainment grant for $150,000.
