SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON DELPHI MOTION TO CANCEL LABOR CONTRACTS, CLOSE FOUR MICHIGAN PLANTS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement in response to Delphi Corp.'s request that a bankruptcy court cancel the company's union contracts, close four Michigan plants, and eliminate retiree health and life insurance benefits:  
   "Delphi's decision to abandon its workers during this process is dead wrong. The company's petition to cancel its union contracts and close four Michigan plants will hurt Michigan families and the American auto industry. 
   "When Delphi filed for bankruptcy last fall, I urged Steve Miller to abandon this failed strategy of massive cuts to wages and benefits. I asked him to stand with me and fight for policies that will stop unfair trade practices, lower the cost of health care and protect workers' pensions. 
   "It's unfortunate and deeply troubling that Mr. Miller continues to try to balance Delphi's books on the backs of Michigan workers and retirees. I hope the court will reject this misguided proposal so we can work toward a real solution.".
