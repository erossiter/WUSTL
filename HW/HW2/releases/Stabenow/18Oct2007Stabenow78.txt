SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE ATTEMPT TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today issued the following statement regarding today's House vote, which fell short of receiving the two-thirds needed to override the President's veto of Children's Health Insurance.  
   "This is about our values and priorities. The President has already spent almost half a trillion dollars in Iraq and continues to spend over $10 billion each month - money that goes right on to the national debt. But when Congress sent him a bipartisan bill that would provide 10 million children with health care and it's fully paid for, the President said 'no'.
   "I am deeply disappointed by the outcome of today's House vote, but this is not the end of this important fight, this is only the beginning. I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get the necessary votes to pass this critical health care program for 10 million American children."
