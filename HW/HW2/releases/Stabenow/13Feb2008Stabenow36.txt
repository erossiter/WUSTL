SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement after joining President George W. Bush at the White House, as the President signed H.R. 5410 the Economic Stimulus Act.  
   Stabenow helped lead the charge in the Senate to provide tax rebates for over 20 million seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans that were left out by the original proposal. 
   "This stimulus package is an important victory for seniors, veterans and middle-class families across Michigan and across our nation. However, this can only be the first step in addressing the economic crisis facing our state and our country. A bipartisan group of economists and financial experts agree that extending unemployment insurance is one of the fastest, most effective ways to stimulate our economy. 
   "That's why I will continue this critical fight to ensure that millions of unemployed, middle-class Americans are not forgotten.
   "In the long run, we can't forget that the best way to boost the economy is by creating quality, good-paying jobs. That's why I will continue the fight to make the investments needed to create jobs here at home, develop a vibrant economy and ensure a strong middle-class." --U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
