SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN SET STAKES FOR PISTONS-LAKERS PLAYOFF
 Wagering some of Michigan's best in support of Michigan's best, Sens.  
 Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) are pitting cherry pies, Vernors Ginger Ale, Motown CDs and two bottles of Michigan wine against the movie DVDs, two Disneyland tickets, a crate of avocados and two bottles of California wine proffered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA). The friendly wager centers on the Detroit Pistons-Los Angeles Lakers matchup in the NBA finals that begins Sunday. 
   "I look forward to enjoying the California vintage, but I suspect that won't be the only whine coming from the West Coast when this series is done," Stabenow said. "I will enjoy my visit to Disneyland, but I feel like I'm already in Fantasyland, when I hear folks taking the Pistons out of this championship before this series even tips off."
   "The Pistons swept the series with the Lakers the last time they met in the finals," said Levin. "It may take a little longer this time, but I'm confident the Pistons will once again bring home the championship. And when they do, I'll be shouting, 'I'm going to Disneyland.'" 
   California's senators replied with a little trash talking of their own.
   "The Pistons have about as much chance of winning as the Edsel does of coming back," Senator Feinstein said. "Senators Levin and Stabenow should pay up now."
   "Motown is going to be singing the blues after the Lakers get through with the Pistons," Senator Boxer said.
