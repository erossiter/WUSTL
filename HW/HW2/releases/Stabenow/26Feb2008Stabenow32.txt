SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $8.1 MILLION FOR EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PROGRAMS IN MICHIGAN
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that 78 counties and municipalities will receive $8,070,109 to supplement rent, mortgage and utility assistance programs and help feed and shelter homeless individuals. In addition, the state of Michigan will receive $51,062 to distribute to counties and municipalities in need of further funding. 
   "This program provides critical funding to organizations and agencies across our state, as they seek to assist families hit hardest by our struggling economy," said Stabenow. "Helping to ensure that these grants reach our local soup kitchens, food banks, and shelters will provide much needed support to Michigan families and communities." 
   "These federal funds will help numerous organizations in Michigan provide assistance to families who are struggling to make ends meet," said Levin. "I am hopeful that this program will bring relief to those in need in Michigan."
   The Emergency Food and Shelter Program is overseen by a national board, chaired by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency and composed of representatives from the American Red Cross, Catholic Charities USA, United Jewish Communities, National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., The Salvation Army, and United Way of America. The program provides supplemental funding to shelters, soup kitchens, food banks, and rent, mortgage, and utility assistance programs. The funds are used to help individuals and families with non-disaster, temporary financial emergency needs.
   In each jurisdiction funded, a local board advertises the availability of the funds, establishes local priorities, selects local non-profit and government agencies to receive supplemental funding, and monitors program compliance.
