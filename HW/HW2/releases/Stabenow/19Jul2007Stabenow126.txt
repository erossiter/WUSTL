SEN. STABENOW HELPS LEAD EFFORT TO EXPAND HEALTH COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), along with the other members of the Senate Committee on Finance, today approved the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007 on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 17 to 4. The program provides health insurance to children of working families who are not eligible for Medicaid, but still unable to afford private health insurance. The full Senate is expected to take up the bill in the coming weeks.  
   "We have a moral obligation to provide coverage for the millions of children in our nation without health care," said Stabenow. "Something is wrong in this country when hard working families don't have access to affordable health care for their children. This bill is a major step forward in our effort to make sure every child in America gets the health care they need." 
   The $35 billion bipartisan agreement renews and expands the successful program. The agreement will maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children currently enrolled in the program. In addition, it will provide quality health coverage to an additional 3.2 million low-income, uninsured American children. Under the agreement, Michigan will receive approximately $210 million a year in increased funds to cover more children without insurance 
   Also included in the bill is a section authored by Senator Stabenow to provide grants to demonstrate the effectiveness of electronic medical records for children. These technologies reduce medical costs by improving efficiency, quality of care and patient safety. A study by the RAND Corporation suggested savings as high as $81 billion a year through effective use of electronic records.
