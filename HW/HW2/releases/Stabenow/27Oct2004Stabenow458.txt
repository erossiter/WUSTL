SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $1 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR EIGHT MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded $1,077,180 in grants for eight Michigan communities. The communities will receive three types of grants: comprehensive, predatory lending and S8.  
  "Michigan residents need to know the financial aspects of leasing or purchasing safe and affordable housing," said Levin. "These grants will fund improvements for housing authorities, as well as provide counseling to help residents avoid housing finance problems and also to understand the ownership aspects of the Section 8 program." 
   "Home ownership not only provides safety and stability to families and communities but also provides an important savings vehicle," Stabenow said. "These counseling grants, especially those for programs that enable people to avoid the snares of predatory lenders, will help families realize the dream of home ownership."
   HUD awarded comprehensive, predatory lending and S8 grants. Predatory lending grants fund counseling and education to prevent numerous housing finance problems that could eventually lead to foreclosure for borrowers. Comprehensive grants fund housing authorities' needed repairs, improvements and management changes to keep their units safe and desirable places to live. S8 grants fund financial counseling for persons possibly making the transition from leasing to purchasing a home through HUD's Section 8 voucher program.
