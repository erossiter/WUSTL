SEN. STABENOW STATEMENT ON BUSH'S MEETING WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF BIG THREE AUTOMAKERS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement following the President's meeting with the chief executive officers of General Motors, Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler:  
   "While I wish the President had found the time to meet with the Big Three sooner, I hope that today's meeting will be an important first step toward a comprehensive American manufacturing strategy that will keep us competitive in the 21st century. Today's meeting must be the start of an ongoing dialogue between our automakers, the President and Congress that creates a level playing field and keeps our jobs in America. 
   "With a new Democratic majority in Congress, I look forward to passing legislation to fight unfair trade practices by China and Japan, to lower the cost of health care for manufacturers and to support the auto industry as it continues to develop cutting-edge alternative fuel vehicles. The future of the American middle class depends on a strong American auto industry, and I call on the President to show real leadership in tackling the issues raised by the Big Three CEOs today.".
