SEN. STABENOW REACTS TO NOMINATION OF NEW EPA ADMINISTRATOR
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) issued the following statement in reaction to President Bush's nomination of Steve Johnson as the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   "I want to congratulate Mr. Johnson on his nomination to be our next EPA Administrator. The EPA Administrator bears a significant responsibility to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink and the environment around us. I look forward to working with Mr. Johnson and the Administration during the confirmation process to ensure that Michigan's concerns - protecting the Great Lakes and stopping the flow of trash from Canada - are at the top of Mr. Johnson's list of priorities, as they should be. As the author of the legislation that banned drilling in the Great lakes, I was pleased to hear the President mention the great work we've done in ensuring the quality of the water in the Great Lakes. But we know that there is more to do, and I will continue to fight to protect the Great Lakes. 
   However, as every Michiganian knows, the problem of Canadian Trash is only getting worse as time goes on. In fact, in the last year alone, we saw an almost 100% increase in the amount of trash coming across the border. As the more than 165,000 people who signed my petition to stop the flow of Canadian trash attested, we have got to get the EPA to start taking this issue more seriously and using the authority they already have to stop the hundreds of trucks coming across our border on a daily basis. This situation is so serious because of the impact on the environment and the health of Michigan's citizens. It not only degrades our air quality and decreases our available landfill space, but it poses a significant threat to homeland security by the very nature of how difficult it is to inspect these trash trucks."
