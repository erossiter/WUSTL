SEN. STABENOW, LEVIN NAME NEW VA CLINIC FOR WORLD WAR II HERO AND ALPENA NATIVE
 U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced passage of legislation that will name the upcoming U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Alpena after Michigan's most highly decorated veteran of World War II, Lieutenant Colonel Clement C. Van Wagoner.  
   "Lieutenant Colonel Clement C. Van Wagoner served Alpena, Michigan and this nation valiantly and proudly," said Stabenow. "Naming this clinic, which will benefit veterans across northern Michigan, after him is a fitting tribute to a man that devoted his life to protect our country." 
   "I am pleased to honor the memory of a highly decorated Michigan soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Clement C. Van Wagoner," said Levin. "Lieutenant Colonel Van Wagoner served his country and state with distinction in World War II and as a leader of the Michigan National Guard." 
   Lt. Col. Van Wagoner was in combat for 600 days, being wounded on five different occasions. He was also one of only 32 survivors of the 1,800 soldiers who landed with the 1st Infantry Division at Omaha Beach on D-Day. After World War II, Lt. Col. Van Wagoner continued to serve Michigan and his country by commanding a battalion of the Michigan National Guard, until retiring in 1967. Van Wagoner was the recipient of the combat infantry badge, seven bronze stars, four silver stars and five purple hearts, among other honors.
   The new clinic will ease the burden for veterans in Alpena and the surrounding area who regularly make long and often difficult trips to VA hospitals in other parts of the state to receive basic medical services.
