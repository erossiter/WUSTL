SEN. STABENOW STATEMENT ON TREASURY SECRETARY'S ANNOUNCED TRIP TO CHINA
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's planned trip to China next week to discuss economic policy:  
   "Secretary Paulson must get tough and demand that China stop manipulating its currency, stop dumping counterfeit auto parts in the U.S. and stop stealing American patents. Otherwise, this trip will just be one more missed opportunity.
   "Michigan is losing jobs every day because of China's illegal trade practices. Yet, President Bush and his Administration continue to stand by and let China break the rules.
   "Michigan's jobs, future and way of life are all at stake if the Administration won't stand up to China and fight for American manufacturers."
