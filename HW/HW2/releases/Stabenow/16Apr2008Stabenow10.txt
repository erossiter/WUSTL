SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $67,000 FOR HOLLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the Holland Fire Department has been awarded $67,500 for fire prevention and safety programs. The funds are awarded under the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). 
   "These funds will enable the Holland Fire Department to continue their invaluable service to their city," Stabenow said. "Providing our first responders with the necessary equipment to save lives will help them protect our communities and reduce the risks posed by fire and other dangers."
   "This is good news for families in and around Holland," said Levin. "Better training and public education programs will help our brave firefighters and first responders do their jobs safely and effectively."
   The primary goal of the AFGP Fire Prevention and Safety program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, is to mitigate or prevent the danger to the public and first responders posed by fire and other hazards. Projects supported by the program include fire prevention and public safety education campaigns, media outreach, and arson prevention and awareness programs.
