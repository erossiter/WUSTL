SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN: OVER $116,000 COMING TO MARQUETTE COUNTY TO HELP STEER YOUTH AWAY FROM GANGS
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today announced that Marquette County will receive $116,537 to provide students with the skills they need to avoid gang pressure and youth violence. The funds were awarded under the Department of Justice FY 2007 Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program.  
  "Our children need the support of parents, law enforcement, and their community to resist gangs and the temptation to choose the wrong path early on in life," said Stabenow. "This program brings together a diverse coalition of community leaders and the proper resources necessary to administer an effective curriculum for students in high-crime neighborhoods."
   "Keeping Michigan's children away from the scourge of gangs is a very important goal," said Levin. "I am hopeful that this program will help law enforcement officials teach students how to stay away from such a destructive path."
   The Marquette County Sheriff's Department will work in partnership with the Salvation Army's Project WEAVE program to provide G.R.E.A.T. training for approximately 386 seventh and eighth grade students, 393 fourth and fifth grade students, 30 families, and 1,200 youth during the summer component in the fourth through eighth grades.
   The primary goal of the G.R.E.A.T. program is to provide a life-skills competency program in which students will be able to develop values and practice behaviors that will help them to avoid destructive activities. G.R.E.A.T. trains law enforcement officers at the state and local level to administer instructive classes to school-aged children. The G.R.E.A.T. program also coordinates with community and civic groups to help with the program.
