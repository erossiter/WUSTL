SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN URGE HOUSE-SENATE CONFEREES TO ADOPT PROVISIONS OF SENATE VERSION OF TRANSPORTATION BILL THAT WILL HELP MICHIGAN
  The Senate version of a multi-year transportation bill will generate more than $635 billion in economic activity, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, support busy border crossings, and help sustain and foster public transit, Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) told the leaders of a House-Senate conference on the bill today.  
   The senators' letter is an appeal for conference adoption of the Senate bill, which won bipartisan support in setting a funding level of $318 billion over six years for transportation projects. The Senate bill would provide Michigan with $1.23 billion more than the House bill over six years.
   * On the $318 billion funding level of the Senate bill, the senators wrote:
   "The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that every $1 billion of highway spending creates 47,500 new jobs and generates more than $2 billion in economic activity. The highway finding levels in the Senate bill would create 100,000 jobs in Michigan alone." 
   * On the rate of return for every transportation dollar sent to Washington, they wrote:
   "Under the Senate bill, all states including Michigan would have a 95 percent rate of return, bringing donor states closer to receiving their fair share of federal highway funding. However, the House bill does not make any progress on highway funding equity and would, at best, maintain the 90.5 percent rate of return under current law."
   * On funding for border crossings:
   "Under the Senate bill, the borders program would distribute funding to border states based on key criteria such as border traffic, trade flow and cargo weight. This formula would ensure that our busiest border crossings would receive some of the funding that they need to improve and expand their infrastructure. The House borders program, however, distributes funding based on the number of border crossings in a state and does not consider the amount of traffic or the value of trade crossing the border."
   * On support for mass transit programs:
   "Michigan communities depend on public transit to ease congestion, stimulate economic growth, and provide an affordable and convenient transportation options ... There are bus systems operating in every one of Michigan's 83 counties, but service in many areas is minimal, creating a real hardship for many working families." 
   No date has yet been set for a conference to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the bill. In the absence of a new bill, Congress has passed three short-term extensions of the 1998 transportation bill, which expired in September 2003.
