SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $46 MILLION FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN MICHIGAN
  Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that the military construction appropriations conference report, which passed the Senate unanimously on Monday, includes over $46 million for projects in Michigan. 
   "The military construction bill funds much of the infrastructure for our military facilities in this country and across the world," said Levin. "Michigan's National Guard and Reserve play critical roles in both our homeland security and national security. The new construction and safety improvements included in this legislation will contribute significantly to the training and readiness of the men and women in the National Guard and Reserve in Michigan." 
   "Almost 40 percent of the U.S. forces in Iraq are Guard and Reserve units, and the training facilities for these units need to be first-rate. This bill will provide much-needed infrastructure upgrades at Michigan facilities," Stabenow said. "Whether deployed or at home, Michigan's Guard and Reserve will continue to play an important role, and I will continue to work for needed expansions and improvements at their facilities all across the state."
   The military construction appropriations bill includes funding for the following Michigan projects: 
   * $27.6 million for an Army Aviation Support Facility in Grand Ledge. This funding will be used to construct a new Army Aviation Support Facility to accommodate the new mission of 22 UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that the Michigan Army National Guard is authorized to receive as part of the Army National Guard Aviation Transformation Program. 
   * $5.1 million for a new Fire Crash Rescue Center at Kellogg Air Field, the home of the 110th Fighter Wing. The facility currently fails to meet the needs of Air National Guard unit stationed at W.K. Kellogg Field in Battle Creek. The current conditions lead to overcrowding and reduce the ability of the unit to train and execute its fire protection plan for the fighter wing.
   * $4.0 million for a Visitors Center and Identification Complex at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base. The current facilities are collocated in a small undersized facility located near the installation's main gate entrance and do not meet the needs units stationed at Selfridge. This new facility will allow the base to consolidate several functions into one joint facility, as well as upgrade the base's entrance to current force protection standards.
   * $9.7 million for a new Joint Security Forces Operation Center at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. This project will enable both Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard security forces to consolidate their missions. Currently, both security forces lack the space needed to fulfill their duties. This facility will promote "jointness" while unifying operations that are currently conducted in several aging facilities at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
