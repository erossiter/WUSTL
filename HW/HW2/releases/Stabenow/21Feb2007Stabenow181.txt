  Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced on Wednesday, Feb. 21, that seven Michigan organizations have been awarded $1,420,222 through the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety.  
   "Investing in our first responders pays immediate dividends to the community," said Levin. "Each of these communities will benefit from the improved equipment and the fire prevention, safety and training programs that these grants will help to fund."
   "Michigan's first responders deserve nothing less than the very best training and equipment," said Stabenow. "I'm pleased that this funding will assist our local fire departments in continuing to keep their communities safe."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. Grants are awarded competitively through an application process.
