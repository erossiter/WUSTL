SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $730,000 FOR FIRE SAFETY
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that six Michigan organizations have been awarded $730,339 through the Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety and to purchase vehicles. 
   "Communities throughout Michigan rely on local firefighters to protect them when emergencies arise," said Stabenow. "Our state's first responders deserve nothing less than the best possible equipment and training, and these grants will help these fire departments reach that goal."
   "Investing in our first responders pays immediate dividends to the community," said Levin. "Each of these communities will benefit from the improved equipment and the fire prevention, safety and training programs that these grants will help to fund."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. Grants are awarded competitively through an application process. More information can be found at http://www.firegrantsupport.com/.
