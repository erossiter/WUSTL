SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $300,000 FOR FIRE SAFETY
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that two Michigan fire departments have been awarded $312,694 through the Department of Homeland Security Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). The funding will be used to support operations and firefighter safety.  
   "First responders put themselves in serious danger when emergencies arise," said Stabenow. "Our communities depend on these brave men and women, and every department deserves the best possible training and equipment available as they fight to keep our communities safe."
   "Our firefighters deserve the best equipment and training to fight fires and protect their communities," said Levin. "This funding will help provide these Michigan fire departments with the resources they need to do their jobs and educate the public about fire prevention."
   The AFGP awards grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to improve the effectiveness of operations and health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. Grants are awarded competitively through an application process. More information can be found at http://www.firegrantsupport.com/.
