SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE GRANT OF $50,715 FOR NORTH OAKLAND TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $50,715 to the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation.  
 The grant will be used to purchase a bus and replace a van for the North Oakland Transportation Authority. 
   "Providing bus and van services to our communities is essential to senior citizens, the disabled, and people using public transportation to commute to work," said Levin. "This funding will add to North Oakland Transportations Authority's fleet, enhancing its service. 
   "Public transportation is a sensible choice for some people, but for others it's an essential means of getting to work, school, or a doctor's appointment," Stabenow said. "This grant will help enhance public transportation service for people served by the North Oakland Transportation Authority."
