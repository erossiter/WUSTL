SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH CANCELING HIS MEETING WITH BIG THREE
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today released the following statement on President Bush's decision to cancel his meeting with the Big Three automakers for the third time.  
   "In the last two months President Bush has canceled three separate meetings with the Big Three while finding time in his busy schedule to meet with sports teams, hold a picnic for members of Congress and personally swear in members of his Council on Physical Fitness. This is another clear indicator of where this administration's priorities are when it comes to manufacturers."
