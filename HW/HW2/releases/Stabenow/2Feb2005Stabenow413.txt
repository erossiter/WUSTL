SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) offered the following comments tonight in response to President Bush's State of the Union speech. 
   "Tonight we heard the president talk about values and about the responsibility we have to current and future generations. Unfortunately he didn't talk about the details and he didn't address the needs and priorities of Michigan families. He didn't talk about the loss of manufacturing jobs or protecting American workers by enforcing trade agreements. Most importantly he didn't talk about the exploding cost of health care.
   "Instead he talked about a risky scheme to privatize Social Security and add $2 trillion to the national debt.
   "The choices we make reflect our values and priories. Privatizing Social Security doesn't make sense, and it's out of step with the fundamental value of ensuring that after a life spent working hard and contributing to the greatness of our nation, every American should have a secure retirement. I know we need to make changes. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and work with the president to keep the "security" in Social Security. But I will not support privatization schemes that cut benefits and add trillions to the national debt. To do so would be fiscally irresponsible and would violate our responsibility to future generations.
   "We want every American to have a real opportunity to provide for themselves and their families, to dream the big dreams and to enjoy the promise of what America offers. Protecting this opportunity is what we owe our children and grandchildren, it's what we stand for and what we will continue to fight for."
