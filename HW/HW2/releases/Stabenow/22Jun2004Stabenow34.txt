SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN RECEIVE ?VICTORY SPOILS' OF WAGER WITH SENS. BOXER, FEINSTEIN OVER NBA PLAYOFFS
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) had faith that the Detroit Pistons would defeat the L.A. Lakers in the NBA playoffs, and that faith was rewarded when Michigan's team took the NBA crown. Today that faith was rewarded again, when California's two U.S. senators paid off their wager on the series. 
   In a ceremony in front the cameras in the Senate Radio & TV Gallery in the U.S. Capitol, Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) made good on their wager with Stabenow and Levin of Oscar-winning movie DVD's, two Disneyland tickets, a crate of avocados and two bottles of California wine.
   "In this face-off between Tinseltown and Motown, it was clear from the start that hard work, great coaching and teamwork would triumph, and I'm proud of what our team and Coach Larry Brown have accomplished," Stabenow said. "I will greatly enjoy these California products, while my California colleagues will have to make do with a serving of humble pie."
   "We look forward to enjoying the fine food, wines, and entertainment from our California colleagues for which their state is celebrated," said Levin. "For our part, we will be celebrating the fact that our world champion Pistons have made the City of Detroit Hoopstown as well as Hockeytown, USA."
   Terming their payoff "a very unlikely event," Stabenow and Levin nevertheless offered as their side of the wager a quality package of Michigan products, including cherry pies, Vernors Ginger Ale, Motown CDs and two bottles of Michigan wine.
   Stabenow and Levin will donate their Disneyland tickets to the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Michigan.
