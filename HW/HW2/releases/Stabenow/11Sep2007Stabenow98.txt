SEN. STABENOW REACTS TO TESTIMONY OF GEN. PETRAEUS
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the testimony of General David Petraeus:  
   "Four and a half years after the ill advised, poorly planned and mishandled invasion of Iraq, this administration still doesn't understand that victory on the ground cannot be achieved without political progress. Our military is getting the job done, but the Iraqi government has failed to make the kind of tough political decisions required to bring stability and safety to their nation. Only the Iraqis can secure Iraq, and American troops cannot serve as a substitute for Iraqi resolve. Our brave men and women in uniform deserve a strategy that brings them home safely and responsibly."--U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
