SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) issued the following statement today regarding the nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr. to the United States Supreme Court.  
   "The President has begun the process of appointing the next justice of the Supreme Court. We must now allow the Senate Judiciary Committee to do its important work of fairly and thoroughly examining Judge Roberts' record, qualifications and judicial philosophy. 
   "The person appointed to the Supreme Court will have an impact on our daily lives and on the lives of our children and grandchildren. That is why we in the Senate must ensure that any nominee to the court demonstrates that he or she is independent, fair-minded, and willing to reach impartial decisions based on the law without political bias."
