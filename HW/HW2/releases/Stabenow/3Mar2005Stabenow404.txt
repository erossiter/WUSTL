SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $756,616 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR MICHIGAN
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that eight fire departments in Michigan have received $756,616 in grants under the terms of the fiscal year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program enables firefighters to enhance their ability to do their jobs, improve safety and preserve lives," Stabenow said. "This round of grants will enable eight Michigan fire departments to provide better firefighting protection for themselves and the communities they serve."
   "Firefighters are essential to the safety and security of our local communities," said Levin. "We owe it to these men and women to provide them with better training and equipment so they can do their jobs more effectively and safely."
   These grants have been provided through the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a joint effort of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Fire Administration. The Operations and Firefighter Safety programs provide firefighters with equipment, training and modifications to facilities. The firefighting vehicles acquisition program allows departments to purchase vehicles such as ambulances, rescue vehicles, fireboats and brush trucks.
