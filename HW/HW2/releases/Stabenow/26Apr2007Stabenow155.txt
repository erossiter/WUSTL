SEN. STABENOW INTRODUCES NATIONAL MARINA DAY RESOLUTION ON APRIL 26
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today introduced a resolution designating August 11, 2007, as the sixth annual "National Marina Day." The day serves to highlight the role marinas across the nation play in recreational enjoyment, strengthening local economies, and in safeguarding the environment. The resolution is being introduced in the House by Representative Hal Roger (R-KY).  
   "Recreational boating is an important part of Michigan's history and identity," said Stabenow. "Over 750 marinas across our state serve not only to preserve this identity, but as a critical component of local economies, creating jobs while providing family-friendly recreation."
   With over 900,000 registered boats in Michigan, third most in the nation, boating represents a $3.9 billion industry in the state. National Marina Day recognizes the important recreational, environmental, and social contributions marinas make to thousands of waterfront communities all across America, while celebrating one of America's great natural resources - its waterways.
