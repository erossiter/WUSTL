SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $2.9 MILLION FOR DETROIT METROPOLITAN WAYNE COUNTY AIRPORT
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded $2,950,000 to Wayne County for the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.  
   "Our airports in Michigan face many challenges, especially during the winter months," said Levin. "This grant will help fund the necessary improvements to keep Detroit Metro running efficiently and in an environmentally sound manner as it continues to serve as the major business and travel hub for the greater Detroit area." 
   "Snow and ice are problems enough for drivers, but they pose a special hazard for air travel in much of the nation," Stabenow said. "Aircraft need to be deiced, but it is important that we prevent the deicing compounds from causing environmental damage. Containment and cleanup, supported by this grant, is an essential part of the deicing process."
   This grant will be used to construct a deicing containment facility, helping to minimize deicing fluid from contaminating local waterways.
