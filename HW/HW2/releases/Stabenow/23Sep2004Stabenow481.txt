SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE OVER $900,000 IN DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS FOR SEVERAL MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded $963,231 in grants to 13 Michigan community fire departments and a public safety department for firefighter safety programs and the purchase of new vehicles.  
   "Firefighters routinely put their lives on the line and deserve the best tools and training available," said Levin. "These grants will also provide funds for needed vehicle repairs and purchases, aiding firefighters in their jobs." 
   "These valuable grants will allow these 13 Michigan communities to better serve their communities in the job of protecting lives and property," Stabenow said. "I encourage those Michigan fire departments who have not taken advantage of this program to beat the Sept. 30 deadline and apply for the next round of Department of Homeland Security grants."
   The Operations and Firefighter Safety Program provides fire departments across the nation with grants for training and fitness programs as well as needed repairs to fire departments.
