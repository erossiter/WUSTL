SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $810,900 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR FOUR MICHIGAN FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded $810,900 in grants to four Michigan fire departments under the terms of the fiscal year 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
   "Our state's first responders deserve nothing less than the best possible equipment and training we can provide," Stabenow said. "This latest round of fire grants will help these four communities obtain the equipment they need to better protect the communities they serve."
   "Everyday our firefighters go to work willing to risk their lives to protect us," said Levin. "We owe it to them to provide the necessary vehicles and equipment. This funding will strengthen each department's ability to respond to emergencies while minimizing the risks to the men and women who work so hard to protect our lives." 
   The grants were awarded under the terms of the Firefighting Vehicle Acquisition Program, which helps communities buy such vehicles as pumpers, brush trucks, tankers, rescue vehicles, ambulances, aerials, fireboats, and multiple feature vehicles known as quints.
