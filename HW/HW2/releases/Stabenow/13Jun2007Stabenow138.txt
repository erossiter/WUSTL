SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ISSUE STATEMENTS REGARDING CURRENCY BILL
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) made the following statements regarding the bill introduced earlier today by Sens. Max Baucus (D-MT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), to address undervalued currencies that harm U.S. trade and economic interests.  
   "This bill provides more evidence of the growing urgency surrounding the issue of currency manipulation. American businesses are being unfairly punished for other countries' cheating, and we need to consider every option in our efforts to level the playing field for our manufacturers. Currency manipulation is not a single nation issue. China, Japan, or any other country that gains an unfair trade advantage by manipulating their currency needs to be held accountable. Like the bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Bunning earlier this Congress, this measure recognizes that when the playing field is level American companies can compete with anyone in the world and win." -U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
   "Once again, the Treasury Department has taken a hands-off approach and failed to identify any of our trading partners as manipulating their currencies. The Bush administration has repeatedly neglected to hold countries like Japan and China accountable for their unfair trade practices, and continuing that approach today will hurt our domestic manufacturers and cost American jobs. Senate action is long overdue in the face of inaction by this administration and, while the Finance members' bill may not be as strong as I would like it, I am pleased that they are at least beginning the ball rolling in an effort to provide a more level playing field for U.S. manufacturers."- U.S. Senator Carl Levin.
