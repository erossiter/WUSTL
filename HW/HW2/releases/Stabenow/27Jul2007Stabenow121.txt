SEN. STABENOW, COLLEAGUES PROVIDE VITAL EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced the Senate passage of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill which provides funding for America's first responders. Notably, the legislation includes $124 million for Interoperable Communications and Technical Assistance Services, far surpassing the amount in the President's budget request.  
   "For too long our police, fire, emergency medical services and transportation officials have not been able to communicate with each other, and our local departments are not able to link their communications with state and federal emergency response agencies," said Stabenow. "In an emergency, the ability to communicate with other first responders can be the difference between life and death. I am pleased this funding will help get the necessary equipment into the hands of our first responders before the next natural disaster, attack or emergency."
   "Senator Stabenow has been a leader in the Senate on interoperability for years," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "No one has worked harder on this issue." 
   The bill also directs the Department of Homeland Security to report by February 5, 2008, on how it intends to develop and implement a strategic plan to improve communication interoperability. 
   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill will provide over $37 billion for all homeland security programs including billions for emergency preparedness and response activities, over $6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and over $3 billion for state and local emergency training and assistance grants. This amount represents more than $2.2 billion over the President's budget request.
