SEN. STABENOW COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE ACT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Thursday, Feb. 1, issued the following statement praising the passage of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007:  
   "Today's vote is a victory for hard working Americans. I am pleased that Congress has finally taken action on this critical issue with a balanced, bipartisan approach that helps both working families and small businesses.
   "I am also proud the Minimum Wage Act includes the expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which will increase employment opportunities for disabled veterans. The brave men and women who serve in our military devote their lives to protecting our country and we owe them our support both during and after their service. There are over 800,000 veterans in Michigan and these tax credits will ensure they have the resources they need to assist the transition from solider to veteran." -U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
