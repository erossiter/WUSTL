SEN. STABENOW INTRODUCES SHORT SEA SHIPPING ACT
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today introduced the Short Sea Shipping Act, which would scale back the Harbor Maintenance Tax and make viable a new option for transporting goods in the Great Lakes region. The tax is currently assessed on cargo if it moves by ship, serving as an obstacle to move trucks and their freight by water.  
   "The majority of our state's foreign trade is directed into Canada," said Stabenow. "This act will provide another, much needed trade route between Michigan and Canada, providing jobs and encouraging economic growth here at home."
   The Short Sea Shipping Act would repeal the Harbor Maintenance Tax on non-bulk cargo traveling between the U.S. and Canada. The tax unfairly penalizes freight ferries that provide transportation for commercial trucks. The repeal of this tax would make the water route a more viable transportation option for commercial traffic, subsequently combating current highway congestion, creating maritime jobs, improving the flow of commerce, and reducing air pollution. Michigan exports more goods to Canada than any other country in the world, transporting over $23 billion per year.
