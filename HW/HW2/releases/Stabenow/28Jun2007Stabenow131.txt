SEN. STABENOW ANNOUNCES BILL TO PROVIDE $12 BILLION TO AUTOMAKERS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today announced legislation to provide $12 billion in financing to American automobile manufacturers to retool older facilities in order to produce advanced technology vehicles, such as flex fuels and hybrids. 
   "We need a 21st century strategy that works with American manufacturers to decrease greenhouse gas emissions while curbing our dependence on foreign oil," said Stabenow . "This is a great investment in an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of American workers and is racing to produce cleaner, more fuel efficient products." 
   The proposed legislation would provide $12 billion in private activity bonds to finance the reconstruction of a facility, or a portion of a facility for the development of advanced technology vehicles, such as flex fuel, E85 and hybrids. The private activity bond offers a higher leverage ratio than tax credit bonds. For every dollar spent, the bond leverages 10 times that amount in the marketplace.
   Since 2001, the United States has lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs and Michigan has lost more than 250,000. The proposal would provide valuable investment into a domestic industry that directly employees hundreds of thousands of Americans, and indirectly supports millions more.
