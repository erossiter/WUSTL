SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $1 MILLION GRANT FOR LANSING SCHOOL DISTRICT
  Sens. Carl Levin, D- Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D- Mich., announced today that the Department of Education has awarded the Lansing School District a $1,099,995 grant to improve educational effectiveness in three high schools over a three-year period.  
   "The steps Lansing School District is taking to improve its effectiveness are paramount to the overall goal of providing the best education possible for these students," said Levin. "The 'Freshman Academy' will be particularly helpful for ninth graders as they enter high school." 
   "It remains a basic tenet of education that reducing class size improves teacher efficiency and student learning," Stabenow said. "This program in the Lansing School District is a wonderful step toward achieving better teacher-pupil ratios and improving the educational opportunities for all these students."
   The funds from this grant will be used to implement a program called Smaller Students, Parents, Administrators, Community, and Educators to Improve Student Achievement (Smaller SPACES), whose goal is to develop smaller and more effective learning communities within Eastern, Everett and Sexton high schools. The program will emphasize core academic subjects, coordinate instruction with curriculum and provide adult advocates for at-risk students and is expected to reach over 4,400 students. Smaller SPACES will also include Freshman Academy, a transitional program to help ninth graders.
