SENS. LEVIN, STABENOW ANNOUNCE $1.3 MILLION FOR SAWYER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded $1,320,000 to Sawyer International Airport.  
 The funding, provided through the Military Airport Program (MAP), will be used for the rehabilitation of airport hangars 664, 665 and 667.
   "The Military Airport Program has played an important role in the conversion of Sawyer International Airport from military to commercial use and I am pleased that it continues to receive money under this program," said Levin. "This latest grant will help reduce Sawyer's heating costs, allowing the airport to operate more efficiently and serve the community better."
   "This DOT grant will allow important infrastructure improvements to be made at Sawyer International Airport, " Stabenow said. "This funding is a new round of assistance from the federal government to complete the conversion of the former KI Sawyer Air Force Base to civilian use. Through such changes, the grant ultimately is intended to help improve the economy and quality of life in the region."
   The funding will be used to replace the heating system for hangar 664, the door for hangar 665 and the exterior panel/insulation of hangar 667. These projects are expected to significantly reduce the heating costs once completed.
   The Military Airport Program (MAP) provides financial assistance for military airfields being converted to, or that have been converted to, civilian or joint-use airfields. Sawyer International Airport qualified for three more years of MAP funding.
