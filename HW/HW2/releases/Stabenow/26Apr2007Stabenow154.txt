SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL ON APRIL 26
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today issued the following statement following passage of the Emergency Supplemental bill: 
   "Today, the U.S. Senate passed a supplemental appropriations bill that provides our troops with the funding and resources they need on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, and sets a timetable to bring them home safely and responsibly. The bill also provides emergency funding for critical needs here at home, including veterans health care and rebuilding communities destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. I am hopeful the President will do the right thing and sign this bill into law."-U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
