SEN. STABENOW HONORED BY AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, NATIONAL FARMERS UNION
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow has been honored by two national farm organizations for her work in the Senate in support of the nation's and Michigan's farmers.  
 The American Farm Bureau Federation has honored Stabenow with its congressional 'Friend of the Farm Bureau' award, and the National Farmers Union has given her its "Golden Triangle"award. 
   "Michigan has an extremely diverse agricultural community, and I have worked hard to support the efforts of Michigan's farmers and growers," Stabenow said today. "I greatly value and appreciate this recognition from these two important and respected national farm organizations."
   The Farm Bureau award is given to those individuals who have voted in support of Farm Bureau issues in Congress. Nominees for the award must be nominated by their respective state farm bureaus and approved by the bureau's national board of directors.
   The "Golden Triangle" award is given to lawmakers, "who have demonstrated outstanding leadership on issues affecting family farmers and ranchers."
   Stabenow has served on agriculture committees in the Michigan House of Representatives, the Michigan Senate, the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.
