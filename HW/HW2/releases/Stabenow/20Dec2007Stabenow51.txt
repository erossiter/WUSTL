SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE OVER $1.6 MILLION FOR HOMELAND SECURITY ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that 96 Michigan organizations have been awarded $1,698,927 through the Department of Homeland Security Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP). The funding will be used to help Michigan first responders and law enforcement agencies in smaller communities and qualified metropolitan areas enhance their ability to respond to major crises and disasters here at home.
   "This funding will help ensure that our first responders and law enforcement agencies in communities throughout our state receive the necessary equipment and training so vital to keeping Michigan safe," said Stabenow. "Making homeland security a priority means providing our brave men and women with the resources they need to continue protecting Michigan families and homes from danger."
   "First responders and law enforcement personnel play a crucial role in safeguarding homes and communities throughout Michigan," said Levin. "These federal dollars will help these provide local organizations with the equipment and the resources they need to do their jobs safely and effectively." 
   The Department of Homeland Security's Commercial Equipment Assistance Program (CEDAP) provides specialized commercial equipment and related training directly to smaller jurisdictions and eligible metropolitan areas. CEDAP complements other major DHS grant programs to augment regional response capabilities, mutual aid, and interoperable communications by providing technology, equipment, and the appropriate training to law enforcement and first responders across the nation.
   Individual grant awards can be found in the table below.
