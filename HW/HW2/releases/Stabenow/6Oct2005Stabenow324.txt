SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN ANNOUNCE $510,185 IN FIREFIGHTER GRANTS FOR MICHIGAN
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) announced today that seven fire departments in Michigan have received a total of $510,185 in grants under the terms of the fiscal year 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Programs. 
  "Communities throughout Michigan rely on local firefighters to protect them when emergencies arise," Stabenow said. "These seven FEMA grants will help local fire departments respond to the emergencies and hazards that threaten the safety of our local communities."
   "Each day Michigan's firefighters go to work prepared to risk their lives to protect us," said Levin. "We owe it to them to provide first-class equipment and training. This funding will strengthen each department's ability to respond to emergencies while minimizing the risks to the men and women who work so hard to keep us out of harm's way."
   The Operations and Firefighter Safety Program provides funding for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to facilities. The Vehicles Acquisition Program allows departments to purchase vehicles such as pumpers, brush trucks, rescue vehicles, ambulances and fireboats. 
   The following communities were awarded grants under terms of the fiscal year 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program:
