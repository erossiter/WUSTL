SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON 2006 NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE DATA
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the analysis of 2006 National Health Expenditure data, released today by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Office of the Actuary. The analysis was released today in the journal Health Affair.  
   "I'm pleased that my continued efforts to increase accessibility to safe, affordable generic alternatives are paying off. Beyond what these numbers tell us, we are seeing the political will we need to effect real change. Last year, I led the successful fight to change FDA rules to allow more generics into the marketplace. This new law is increasing competition, which means lower prices for consumers and employers. Reducing the costs of prescription drugs is a critical component in staying competitive in a global economy and protecting American jobs. 
   "However, this report also shows that overall health care costs are still rising much faster than inflation. It is simply unacceptable that in the greatest country in the world, so many middle-class families struggle to keep up with the skyrocketing costs of health care. As we enter the new legislative year, I will continue my fight to ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care." --U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
