SEN. STABENOW CONTINUES FIGHT TO MAKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MORE AFFORDABLE
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Wednesday, Jan. 10, announced the reintroduction of legislation to allow reimportation of safe, lower-priced prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act would allow U.S. licensed pharmacies and drug wholesalers to import FDA approved medications from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and European Union nations, passing along much needed cost savings to American consumers. Sen. Debbie Stabenow was a lead co-sponsor of this bill in the 109th Congress, and continues that role with this reintroduction in the 110th. 
   "Pharmacists in Michigan and across the country would like to be able to do business with their counterparts in Canada and other industrialized nations to offer customers their medications at affordable prices," said Stabenow. "This legislation would provide a safe and secure framework to help seniors, families, and businesses lower their often crippling health care costs."
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save the federal government $6.1 billion over 10 years - money that could be used to protect health care for veterans and retirees.
   Last year, Stabenow was successful in passing a provision permitting individuals to import FDA-approved prescription drugs from Canada. The measure was signed into law last October. 
   "Prescription drugs aren't like other products - they are a necessity families cannot do without when finances are tight," said Stabenow. "Our families, our pharmacists, and our businesses deserve better, and this bill is step in the right direction."
