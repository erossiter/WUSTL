SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. WEBB'S AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement regarding the cloture vote on the Webb Amendment to H.R. 1585, the Defense Authorization Act.  
   "Our fighting men and women are the greatest single resource our military has and this government is abusing that resource. They put their lives on the line for us every day, and the least we can do is make sure they have the time they need at home between combat deployments to see their families and prepare for redeployment. A majority of the Senate, and a majority of the American people, support our troops and the Webb Amendment. We need a new strategy for Iraq, one that respects our military and their families, and all that the Republicans have offered are political tactics to block this much needed reprieve for our combat troops."-U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
