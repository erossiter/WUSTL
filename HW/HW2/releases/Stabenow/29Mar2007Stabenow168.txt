SEN. STABENOW'S ISSUES STATEMENT ON KOREAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND PENDING FAST TRACK DEADLINE
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Thursday, March 29, 2007, released the following statement on the pending fast track deadline for the Korean Free Trade Agreement.  
   "There is no need for the Bush administration to hastily push through the Korean Free Trade Agreement and succumb to Saturday's fast track deadline. In the past, fast track authority has been used to push bad agreements through Congress that have increased our trade deficit, cost us jobs, and hurt our automobile industry and other manufacturers. American workers deserve an agreement that is fair for America. Any agreement should raise the standard of living, ensure market access to both countries, and uphold fair competition, and Congress and the administration should take the time to shape such an agreement." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
