SEN. STABENOW REACTS TO REPUBLICAN STONEWALLING ON IRAQ RESOLUTION
  "Every day in Iraq and around the world our men and women in uniform step up for America and do their duty. On Saturday, Feb. 17, on the floor of the Senate the Republican minority failed to do their's. 
   "Sending more Americans into combat without a strategy for success will not improve the situation on the ground in Iraq and it will not bring our armed forces home any sooner. Only the Iraqis can secure Iraq, and American troops cannot serve as a substitute for Iraqi resolve. 
   "Simply put, our troops deserve better."
