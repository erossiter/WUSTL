SENS. STABENOW, LEVIN SECURE $2.75 MILLION FOR MICHIGAN LABOR, HEALTH CARE, AND EDUCATION PROJECTS
  Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Carl Levin (D-MI) have secured $2,750,000 for Michigan hospitals, schools, and other organizations in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Fiscal Year 2007 Appropriations Bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee today. The Senate will vote on the final bill this fall. 
   "These funds will help create good jobs in Michigan, improve access to high-quality health care and enhance education and innovation at our colleges and universities," said Stabenow. "They are an important investment in the future of our state, our families and our communities." 
   "This funding will provide important resources for Michigan's schools and hospitals," said Levin. "It is critical that our medical facilities are well-maintained and that our students have the programs and the guidance they need to succeed, and I'm hopeful these federal dollars will be a significant step towards achieving that."
   The following projects will receive funding:
   * $500,000, Eastern Michigan University (Ypsilanti): Eastern Michigan University's Strategic Enrollment Outreach Office in the Division of Enrollment Services, in collaboration with the Division of Academic Affairs, will use this funding to develop educational support programs for displaced workers in Michigan. The program will also provide financial assistance to help workers attain their associate and/or baccalaureate degrees from Eastern Michigan University or participating community college partners.
   * $175,000 for the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (Detroit): Michigan is poised to be a leader in the developing fields of life sciences, chemical engineering, nanotechnology, homeland security and alternative energy. This funding will boost the state's ability to attract new companies and expand its highly skilled workforce. Funds will be used to track the effects of exposing urban youth to technology, and its impact on future education and career decisions. By analyzing student performance and evaluating program content, DAPCEP can determine student success in science, technology, engineering, and math, and develop strategies that will encourage students to pursue careers in those fields.
   * $125,000 for Northeast Guidance Center, Family Life Center (Detroit): The Family Life Center provides resources for chronically unemployed and single-parent families, including a multi-generational literacy program, substance abuse treatment, skills training, childcare, health assessments, and family therapy. This funding will be used to increase reading, life skills, and workforce preparedness for parents, school success for youth, and improve the overall health, education, and safety of Detroit families.
   * $1 Million, Kids Kicking Cancer, Heroes' Circle Program (Detroit): This program uses martial arts to empower children facing serious physical and psychological challenges. Kids Kicking Cancer operates programs for children with cancer, sickle cell disease, obesity, asthma and anger management issues in Detroit hospitals and schools. This funding will be used to open additional programs at hospitals and schools in Michigan, and substantially increase the number of children served.
   * $500,000, Michigan Health and Hospital Association, Keystone Center for Patient Safety & Quality (Lansing): This funding will aid the Keystone Center in working with national patient safety experts to improve care and set new national benchmarks for best practices for care. The Keystone Center has already successfully reduced infections from central IV catheters, reduced pneumonias for patients on respirators, and improved communication and a culture of safety in the ICU setting.
   * $250,000, St. Francis Hospital (Escanaba): This project will renovate the existing St. Francis Hospital Emergency Department and consolidate the Urgent Care Clinic into an expanded setting, fostering safe, efficient, patient-centered hospital services. Project details include a single point of entry for urgent and emergency care; updating and expanding the emergency patient treatment area; and providing isolation rooms and decontamination facilities in the case of a toxic chemical exposure or terrorist incident.
   * $200,000, Alpena Community College, Rural Homeland Security Preparedness Initiative (Alpena): This funding will provide emergency management and first responder training in communities through the northern Michigan colleges and universities. Highly qualified instructors will go into communities and assist counties in conducting safety exercises and identifying areas for improvement.
