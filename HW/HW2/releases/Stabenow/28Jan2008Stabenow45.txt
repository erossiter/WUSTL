SEN. STABENOW REACTS TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today issued the following statement in reaction to President Bush's State of the Union address: 
   "For the past seven years our manufacturing industry has been left out of the President's agenda. I appreciate that the President has finally recognized what families in Michigan and across the country have been feeling for some time, but we need to know he shares our sense of urgency.
   "Unfortunately, the President is pushing a stimulus package that leaves out one of the quickest, most effective ways to stimulate our economy - extending unemployment insurance. Economists and experts from both sides of the aisle agree that extending unemployment insurance will immediately boost consumer spending, while allowing individuals more time to search for a job in a difficult market. I will continue to lead this effort in the Senate Finance Committee.
   "In the long term, we cannot forget that the best way to stimulate the economy and remain competitive in the global marketplace is by creating good paying jobs. That is why I have put forward my Green Collar Jobs initiative that will invest in the newest alternative energy technologies, making sure the next generation of vehicles is made in America and most importantly, create quality, good-paying jobs here at home.
   "Tonight, the President called on Congress to implement more trade agreements. With approximately 77,500 Michigan workers losing their jobs last year alone, what we really need in this country is a comprehensive trade policy that puts American workers and businesses first. We need to be enforcing our trade laws, improving product safety, keeping our promises to working Americans and ensuring a level playing field." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
