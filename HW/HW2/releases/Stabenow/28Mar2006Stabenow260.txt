SEN. STABENOW MEASURE TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS GAINS TRACTION
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today joined a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Trade Enhancement Act of 2006, which includes her legislation establishing a special trade prosecutor to police our trading partners and protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair trade practices, particularly with China and Japan. 
   "Michigan has lost more than 50,000 jobs due to dishonest trade practices," said Stabenow. "These job losses are hurting manufacturers across the state, from apple juice to auto parts. We need to enforce our trade agreements now -American workers depend on it."
   This year's U.S. trade deficit is the largest in history. China alone exports five products to the U.S. for every one American product shipped to them. These unfair trade policies have already cost the U.S. economy 1.5 million jobs.
   The trade prosecutor will fight unfair trade practices that hurt Michigan manufacturers including undervaluing currency, allowing these countries to sell more goods in the U.S. while raising the costs of American products abroad; providing illegal government subsidies and interest-free loans to their industries; and selling counterfeit goods. 
   "Michigan's manufacturers and farmers can compete with any country in the world," Stabenow said. "But when other nations are cheating and violating our trade laws, we need someone to stand up and fight for American manufacturers. A special trade prosecutor will ensure that other nations play by the rules or pay the price.".
