SEN. STABENOW NAMED TO DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP, FINANCE COMMITTEE POSTS
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today was appointed by incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) to a seat on the powerful Senate Finance Committee and as the Chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee for the 110th Congress. 
   "I look forward to serving in these key committee and leadership positions," Stabenow said. "Both the Senate Finance Committee and the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee will allow me to focus on a broad range of issues critical to Michigan families - jobs, health care, pensions and tax policies to support our manufacturers. We have important work ahead of us, and I will continue to fight every day for policies that strengthen middle class families."
   The Senate Finance Committee is one of the most influential committees in the U.S. Senate and has jurisdiction over a wide range of issues important to Michigan. All legislation regarding Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, trade policy, pensions and tax policy is referred to the Finance Committee. 
   As the Chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, Stabenow will serve as the liaison between the Democratic caucus and grassroots community organizations nationwide. In advancing to this new role, Stabenow will continue her work in Senate Democratic leadership, shaping and advancing the Senate's agenda.
   Stabenow will continue to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee in the 110th Congress, where she will have a major role drafting a new farm bill critical to Michigan farmers. She will also retain her seat on the Senate Budget Committee.
