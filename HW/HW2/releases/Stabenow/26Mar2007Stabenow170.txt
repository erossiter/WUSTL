SEN. STABENOW ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S MEETING WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF BIG THREE AUTOMAKERS ON MARCH 26
  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) on Monday, March 26, 2007, issued the following statement regarding President Bush's meeting with the heads of the big three automakers: 
   "I'm encouraged by the President's willingness to sit down with the Big Three, but the real proof of his commitment must come in the form of action. Michigan is building the cars, and it's time that the Administration put their full weight behind ensuring that all Americans have access to alternative fuels at their local gas station." - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
