MILLIONS FOR MINE SAFETY SHOULD HELP SAVE LIVES
  Tens of millions of new dollars budgeted for mine safety should help to save coal miners' lives, Sen. Byrd said Friday.
   "We have seen the tragic consequences that occur when the political leadership at the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) forgets that its number one job is protecting coal miners," Byrd said. "Miners die when MSHA cuts its staff. Miners die when MSHA does not insist that 21st century rescue and communications equipment are part of coal mining. Enough is enough."
   The Senate late Thursday approved a Byrd budget proposal to infuse an additional $184 million into MSHA during the next five years. That legislation, cosponsored by Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, was approved unanimously by the Senate as part of the five-year federal budget plan. 
   Byrd has met with MSHA officials, both in meetings in the Capitol and at the White House, as well as questioned the agency's top officials at key Senate hearings this winter, always asking when the agency would step up its coal safety enforcement.
   Since 2001, MSHA resources have been shifted to other areas. Coal enforcement, one of the cornerstone responsibilities at the agency, has been lowered in priority, evidenced by the fact that there are 217 fewer coal enforcement personnel on the MSHA payroll today than five yeas ago. 
   "Fewer inspectors mean greater risk of tragedy. Violations are not caught in time, and mines are able to place a higher priority on production than on safety," Byrd said.
   The $184 million package that Byrd and Rockefeller pushed through the Senate late Thursday would allow MSHA to hire additional mine safety inspectors and implement better mine rescue technologies. It begins the work of funding the safety priorities outlined in the more comprehensive legislation that Senator Byrd and the West Virginia Congressional Delegation introduced after the fatal accidents in Upshur and Logan counties.
   "The funding is one piece of the safety solution. But we also need to mandate changes to the culture of safety at MSHA. The agency has allowed safety to drag for five years, and West Virginia has paid for that attitude with the lives of our coal miners. Our Delegation legislation needs to move through this Congress and be signed into law," Byrd stated.
   The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee is expected to consider the West Virginia bill in the coming weeks.
   The Delegation bill focuses on several areas, including:
   * Rapid Notification and Response - require MSHA to establish a rapid notification and response system, and require coal operators to expeditiously notify MSHA of emergencies, or subject themselves to a $100,000 fine. It took 11 hours before the rescue operation at Sago entered the mine; 
   * Emergency Communications and Breathing Equipment - require coal operators to store additional emergency breathing caches underground, and require emergency communications equipment for surface rescue efforts to locate and communicate with miners underground. The Sago miners had only one hour of oxygen to last through a forty-hour rescue operation, and that no communication was possible with the trapped miners at both Sago and Alma; 
   * Penalties - create a new mandatory minimum penalty of $10,000 for coal operators that show "negligence or reckless disregard" for the safety standards of the Mine Act. Sago had 276 safety violations, and paid fines as low as $99 for "significant and substantial" violations; 
   * Belt Entries - nullify an MSHA rule issued in 2004 that authorizes the use of belt entries for ventilation, which may have caused the Alma fire; 
   * Technology - create a science and technology transfer office in MSHA to pull research and development ideas from other federal agencies for use in the mines; and 
   * Miner Ombudsman - create an ombudsman in the Labor Department's Inspector General office for miners to report safety violations.
