SEN. BYRD: WHITE HOUSE SECURITY RHETORIC A HOLLOW LEGACY TO 9-11 VICTIMS
  On the eve of the third anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and as President Bush campaigned in Huntington, W.Va., claiming that he was making the country safer from a repeat attack, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., Friday charged the Bush White House with creating a hollow legacy to the victims of 9-11. 
   "The President crisscrosses the country claiming that he has made America safer. Don't believe it," Byrd said Friday." He has signed legislation intended to protect our airplanes from hijackers.The President has signed legislation designed to close the porous borders in our north and south. The President has signed legislation to stop terrorists from slipping through our seaports.But what he hasn't signed is the check."
   "The President campaigns on an image of being tough on terrorists, but he has rejected effort after effort to invest critical dollars in police officers and firefighters.It is as if the President wants our emergency responders to pay for homeland security with bake sales and bingo nights," Byrd stated."To continue this homeland security hoax pays little tribute to the victims of September 11, 2001.To tell the American people that they are safe, when, in fact, they are not, honors few memories of those victims. This White House has made an absolute sham of homeland security."
   Byrd has been highly critical of the Bush White House that talks a great deal about making America safer from attack while rejecting funds aimed at closing the gaps in our homeland security protections. For instance: 
   * On November 25, 2002, the President signed into law the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), a law designed to close the security gaps at America's seaports. Yet, the President has not sought funding in 2003, 2004, or 2005 to make those improvements a reality;
   * On November 19, 2001, the President signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. The Act created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and mandated the deployment of explosive detection systems or explosive trace detectors at every airport in the country by the end of 2002 while also significantly expanding the number of Federal Air Marshals. Yet, the President has rejected funds that would have helped to install these explosive detection machines at the nation's airports. Worse, because of funding shortfalls, the number of air marshals continues to dwindle, and the number of critical flights they are able to cover remains on a steady, downward spiral.
   * The President's latest budget cuts funds for local police departments, fire departments, and emergency medical teams by $729 million. Specifically, the President cuts first responder training by 43 percent; provides no new funding to help communities hire firefighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, rescue workers, ambulance personnel and hazardous materials workers; cuts funds to local fire departments by 33 percent; and eliminates altogether the $60 million grant program for Urban Search and Rescue and the $60 million for competitive training grant programs. 
   "Much of the legislation that Congress has passed since 9/11 was envisioned as a legacy to those 3,000 men and women who lost their lives on that day three years ago. Yet, I fear it is becoming a hollow legacy. Surely this is not the legacy we want to leave to the victims of 9/11," Byrd stated.
   "Congress has been thwarted at every turn by a White House that spends lavishly on rhetoric yet demonstrates a pinch-purse mentality when it comes to delivering on its promises," Byrd said." The Department of Homeland Security has been hamstrung from the outset by inadequate funding from the White House. Our port security and border security initiatives, so essential to fighting terrorism, are languishing for lack of money. The people hear that their safety, their security, are the paramount priority of this White House, but then see the very same Administration play shell games with security funds."
