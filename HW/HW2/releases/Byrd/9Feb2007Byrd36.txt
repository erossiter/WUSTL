SEN. BYRD, WEST VIRGINIA GUARD COLLECT VALENTINES FOR TROOPS
  Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and the West Virginia National Guard have joined together to send Valentine's Day greetings to Guard members deployed around the world. 
   "The men and women of our National Guard are stationed in places far from home. Being separated from family and friends is a hard trial for our troops," Byrd said. "That's why, for this Valentine's Day, I urge all West Virginians to send our Guard members a message of support, admiration, and love by stopping at my 'Hearts for Heroes' website."
   Byrd and the West Virginia National Guard have created a website and email addresses to send messages to troops stationed around the world. Both email addresses are linked at Byrd's website. Messages can be simple emails and photos. Byrd's website also will accept small videos (no more than 20 seconds in length). The website and email addresses will remain open throughout the year.
   "The members of our military can derive great comfort from knowing that they are in our daily thoughts and prayers back home. I strongly encourage all West Virginians, old and young alike, to reach out to our troops and show them the respect and appreciation they deserve. Anyone with access to the Internet can perform this simple, patriotic act of gratitude," Byrd said.
   Byrd's "Hearts for Heroes" website will post some of the messages and photos for people to see. 
   "The simple gesture of sending an email to West Virginians serving overseas can have such a positive impact on troop morale. I hope my fellow West Virginians will take a moment to reach out to these brave man and women to let them know how they appreciate the sacrifices our troops are making," Byrd said.
