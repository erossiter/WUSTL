SENATE HONORS FENTON ART GLASS
  The United States Senate has given unanimous approval to a resolution congratulating Fenton Art Glass in Williamstown, W.Va., for its first century of work. 
   Senators Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., wrote the resolution and guided it through the Senate.
   "For 100 years, Fenton has made glass the old-fashioned way. Artisans there create fine, hand-blown glass the same way they did when the Fenton glass factory first opened its doors in 1905," Byrd said.
   "Fenton is an institution in West Virginia and around the world," said Rockefeller. "Wherever you're from, people know Fenton Glass in the United States or overseas. I'm always surprised by how many people know Fenton glass - they know the name and, more importantly, they know the craftsmanship that is part and parcel of any Fenton product."
   The Byrd-Rockefeller resolution, approved by the Senate late on Wednesday night, noted Fenton's proud history and contributions to Williamstown and all of West Virginia. The Senators remarked on that history, and noted that the future for Fenton is just as bright as its works of art.
   "Introducing this resolution is a special point of pride," Rockefeller said. "I enjoy sharing Fenton's history and the quality of their products with other people. I enjoy telling them what a model Fenton is for West Virginia companies and what an ambassador Fenton is to people everywhere about our great state."
   "We in West Virginia have so much in which to take pride. We have our beautiful Appalachian mountains, our swift-moving rapids, and our bountiful forests. We have our determination, our strong work ethic, and our reverence for the Lord. And we have the pride in the beauty of Fenton Art Glass, a shining example of the unique and creative skills abundant in West Virginia," Byrd said. "I look forward to many more years of enjoyment of Fenton glass."
