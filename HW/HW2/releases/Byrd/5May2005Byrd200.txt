WAR HEROES' FAMILIES TO GET DEATH BENEFIT BOOST
  Families of American military men and women who gave their lives in battle soon will be eligible for an increased benefit, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Thursday. 
   Legislation which Byrd has helped to steer through Congress would increase the death payment and also the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) benefit for all combat-related deaths (which includes training accidents and hazardous duty positions as well as deaths in combat). Under the new legislation, the death benefit is increased from $12,000 to $100,000, and SGLI is increased from $250,000 to $400,000. These payments are retroactive to October 7, 2001. 
   "This substantial increase is a recognition of the supreme sacrifice that nearly 1,800 Americans have given in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan," Byrd said. "Too often, families struggle with significant financial burdens after losing a loved one in combat. This increased benefit is one small way that the United States can help and say, 'Thank you,' to these grieving families."
   Byrd, the top Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, worked to shepherd the increased benefit provision through key Congressional negotiations that wrapped up this week. The legislation is set to win final Congressional approval and go to the White House to be signed into law.
   "These men and women have put their civilian lives on hold in order to serve this country. They are often the primary breadwinner in their families. When they give their lives in battle, their families, too often, face immense emotion and financial pressures," Byrd said. 
   "No government benefit or program can help to make a family whole. But this increased payment can help families to stay out of financial trouble and out of bankruptcy," Byrd explained.
