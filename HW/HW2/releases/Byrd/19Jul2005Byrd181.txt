SEN. BYRD REACTS TO SUPREME COURT NOMINATION
  Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., issued the following comments after President George W. Bush nominated Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., to serve on the United States Supreme Court.  
   "I thank President Bush for reaching out to Senators on both sides of the aisle as he worked to select a nominee for the Court. I hope that this bipartisan cooperation will continue as the confirmation process begins.
   "The confirmation of a new Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is a significant responsibility and requires each Senator to have a good understanding of the nominee and his judicial philosophy. I look forward to learning more about Judge Roberts, talking with him, reviewing his record, and listening to the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee."
