SEN. BYRD HAILS FORMER PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., issued the following statement on Wednesday morning after learning of the death of former President Gerald Ford. [1] 
   President Ford worked to heal the nation after one of the most turbulent periods in our history. His actions were defined by his patriotism and his belief that America had to move forward instead of looking back. 
   Gerald and Betty Ford committed their lives to building this country. They understood that the strength in each of us is built on the lessons we learn from all of our experiences - our families, our friendships, our successes, and our failures. President Ford was one of the kindest, most sincere elected officials whom I have known and with whom I have worked. He approached problems with commonsense and the simple goal of shaping a brighter future for the nation. Although he and I were from different political parties, we often were able to find common ground and work together for our country.
   My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Betty, their family, and their friends. The days ahead will not be easy for them, but they go forward with the love and support of this country. Tonight, America has lost a true patriot.
