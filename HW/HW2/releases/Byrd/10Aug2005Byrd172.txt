HIGHWAY FUNDING BECOMES LAW
  More than $2 billion in road, highway, and bridge construction funding is heading to West Virginia, as federal legislation is signed into law, Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., announced Wednesday. 
   "This is a great day for all of West Virginia," Byrd said. "This new law will mean more than $2 billion for West Virginia highways for the next five years, from the Northern Panhandle to the Southern Coalfields, from the banks of the Ohio River to the banks of the Potomac. These new roads will bring jobs. They will bring greater safety. They will bring new opportunities for West Virginians."
   "Senator Byrd and I recognize that having a modern transportation network is vital to the future of West Virginia," Rockefeller stated. "With more than $400 million coming to West Virginia in each of the next five years, we will be able to repair some of the roads that we already have and build new roads and bridges. These roads will dramatically improve the daily lives of West Virginians, and they will enable us to attract new industries and new jobs. Today's bill signing represents an important step in strengthening the future economic prosperity of our state."
   Today, President Bush signed the highway funding bill into law. In this legislation, Byrd and Rockefeller worked to ensure that, overall, West Virginia would receive more than $2 billion during the next five years for road, highway, bridge projects. For the Appalachian Corridor highway system, Byrd secured more than $432 million in construction dollars for the next five years.
   As part of this legislation, Byrd and Rockefeller fought to win funding for a number of specific projects across the state, including: 
   * $52 million for U.S. 35 in Putnam County;
   * $38 million for the King Coal Highway;
   * $13 million for the Route Nine Martinsburg Bypass;
   * $10 million for the Raleigh Street Extension in Martinsburg;
   * $18 million for a new bridge over the Ohio River near Wellsburg;
   * $7 million for Route Ten in Logan County;
   * $1 million for the Shawnee Parkway; and
   * up to $1 million each year for the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system at West Virginia University.
   "When you see new, divided, four-lane highways, you see new businesses. You see new jobs. You see fewer accidents and fewer traffic deaths. All of these are important to our state, which is why I've worked hard to build new highways throughout West Virginia," Byrd said.
   "These highways have been a long time in coming. It takes a significant amount of money to build new roads and safer highways through our mountains. But we're going to keep on working," Byrd said.
