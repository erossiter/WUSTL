SEN. BYRD WORKS FOR MASON COUNTY JOBS
  Sen. Byrd met recently with executives of Utron, Inc., in his U.S. Capitol office to discuss the company's defense weapons development program and the potential for continued job growth in Mason County. 
   "West Virginia brain power is helping to provide America's troops with new weapons and new technologies. With each innovative step forward, the Mountain State helps to strengthen our military," Byrd explained.
   The Utron Corporation, with offices in Ashton and Montgomery, is working to develop a new high-velocity gun that will provide cover to American forces going ashore in hostile territory while keeping Navy ships out of range from land-launched missiles. The company's goal is to extend the Navy's current gun range from 20 nautical miles to more than 100 nautical miles.
   Byrd included $4.25 million in the Department of Defense appropriations legislation, recently signed into law, for this initiative. 
   "Utron employees are hard at work today, developing the technologies and military applications of tomorrow. West Virginia will continue to play a leading role in the company's efforts to increase America's military power," Byrd explained. "Utron is developing advanced weapons that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S. Navy, would have loved to have."
   Byrd met with the following Utron representatives: Dennis Massey, CEO; Dave Kurczynski, vice president of defense systems; and Jack McInnis, business development.
   Utron currently has 35 people working at the former General Dynamics facility at Ashton, near Point Pleasant, and the company also has opened an office in Montgomery, to facilitate a research relationship with the West Virginia University Institute of Technology.
