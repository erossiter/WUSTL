SEN. BYRD MOURNS PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  Sen. Byrd offered his praise for Mrs. Coretta Scott King, who died late last night.  
   People of all colors and creeds, from big cities and small towns alike, have lost a teacher in Coretta Scott King. She and the entire King family have shown that one family, committed to faith and to principle, can move a nation. Mrs. King not only shared her husband's dream, but she also worked by his side and continued after his death to try to make that dream come true. As a nation, as a people, we must remain committed to building that dream.
   I've met with Coretta Scott King on many occasions and always found her to be a woman of quiet courage and dignity. She will always be a great American.
   Erma and I offer our condolences to the King family.
