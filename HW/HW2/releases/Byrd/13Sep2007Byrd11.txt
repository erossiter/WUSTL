  BYRD STATEMENT ON MEGAN WILLIAMS
   "Make no mistake about it. What happened in Logan County to Megan Williams is a despicable outrage. There is simply no place in our society for this kind of inhuman violence and hatred against any man, woman, or child. Those responsible for causing such terrible pain and suffering, both physical and emotional, should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and be severely punished. No human being should ever be treated with such cruelty and disrespect. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to Megan Williams."
