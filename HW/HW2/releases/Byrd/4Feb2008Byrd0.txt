SEN. BYRD DENOUNCES PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO CUT FUNDING FOR BYRD HONORS SCHOLARSHIPS
  U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today commented on President Bush's Fiscal Year 2009 budget which cancels funding for the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship program: 
   "The President has slammed the door to a college education in the faces of young Americans. This is the President who calls for leaving no child behind, but has no problem eliminating a program that helps make the dream of attending college a reality for some of our nation's most outstanding students.
   "Byrd Scholarship winners are selected for their hard work and education. The potential of these young men and women should not be short changed. This President pays lip service to the importance of education and its impact on the future of our state and nation, but he will not invest the resources to back up his rhetoric."
   History of the Byrd Honors Scholarships:
   The Byrd Scholarships, awarded to students in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, were established by Congress in 1986 through legislation authored by Byrd. The program was later named in his honor.
   Originally, the program awarded one-year, $1,500 scholarships to students who demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and who have been accepted for enrollment at an institution of higher learning. In 1993, the program was expanded to provide 4-year scholarships. Under the revised program, students who receive the first-year scholarships are eligible to continue to apply for stipends for the following three years.
