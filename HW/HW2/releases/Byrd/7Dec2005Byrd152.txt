SEN. BYRD RENEWS CALL FOR WHITE HOUSE TO FOCUS ON NEEDS AT HOME
  Sen. Byrd issued the following statement after President Bush delivered a speech on Iraq at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C. 
   "President Bush seems to be willing to pay any price for his plan in Iraq. The numbers tell the story of the President's adventure in Iraq, and it's a tragic story indeed. More than 2,130 of our men and women have lost their lives in Iraq, while more than 15,000 have been wounded in action. The United States has devoted $256 billion to Iraq. How much more is needed? What more will be demanded of the American people? The President either can't say, because he doesn't have any real plan, or he won't say, because he refuses to level with the American people. But one truth is clear: It is time for the Iraqi people to take the lead in their own country, and it is time for America to turn its attention to the incredible needs here at home.
   "Just yesterday, victims of Hurricane Katrina testified before Congress that they are living in desolation. They have not seen any meaningful federal assistance from FEMA. It is December, the hurricane struck in August, and yet the victims seem forgotten by the White House. One must ask why the United States continues to commit billions in Iraq when our own people are so much in need, not only now, in New Orleans, but all across America.
   "The President started the conflict in Iraq, and our troops have gamely continued. They toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein. They carried out the search for weapons of mass destruction. But now, in increasing numbers, our troops are sitting ducks for attacks. The Iraqi people are going to the polls next week to elect a permanent government. We ought to use that moment to start to establish a plan to begin to bring our troops home. The Iraqi people need to find their future and the American people need to demand a government which cares about the huge problems here at home."
