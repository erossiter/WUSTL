SENS. BYRD, ROCKEFELLER CALL FOR 'ZERO TOLERANCE' ON MINE DEATHS
  The United States should not accept deaths in the mining industry, Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., said Thursday at the first Senate oversight mine safety hearing since 2001. Families of some of the deceased miners from the Sago and Alma mine tragedies (in Upshur and Logan counties) attended the hearing. 
   "I will not go along with the false premise that mining is inherently dangerous, and therefore we've got to just accept the fact that coal miners will die. As a nation, we must adopt a zero tolerance policy for coal mine deaths," Byrd stated. 
   "We need to address the tragic loss of life we have endured this year in the Appalachian coalfields," Rockefeller said. "The fatalities at mines in three of our coal counties are very much on the minds of West Virginians and all Americans."
   The West Virginia lawmakers participated in a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Thursday. The leaders of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) testified before the panel, as did other federal, industry, labor, and research specialists who could help to improve coal mine safety.
   Already this year, 16 coal mining deaths have occurred in West Virginia. 
   "I hope that the miners' families who are with us here today find ways to get through their days with the unspeakable grief they must still feel. Our job at this point is make sure that these families get answers about what has happened and to pass comprehensive mine safety legislation to do everything we can to protect our miners," said Rockefeller.
   The West Virginia Congressional Delegation has banded together to author legislation aimed at fixing many of the safety and regulatory problems that contributed to the explosion and fire at the Sago and Alma mines. Since the group introduced the legislation in early February, MSHA has announced plans to begin to implement some of the Delegation's initiatives. However, the agency has been slow in putting specifics in place. 
   Rockefeller and Byrd also have been successful in having the Senate pass the Mine Safety Tax Relief Act of 2006 to secure tax credits that will promote greater mine safety by encouraging coal companies to invest in improved equipment and technology. 
   "MSHA had the legal authority to require better communications and breathing equipment. It didn't use it. It had the legal authority to assess tougher penalties to enforce safety standards. It didn't use it. Even today, MSHA still has not implemented these critical safety improvements," Byrd stated. "MSHA has had the opportunity to do something, and nothing has happened. It has been 25 years since mine rescue rules were updated. It has been 15 years since communications requirements have been updated. How much longer do we have to wait?"
   "We need an administration committed to carrying out a serious safety regime for our miners," said Rockefeller. "They have the authority to implement a much more rigorous fine structure. Yet they have $60 as the base penalty and the one that is most frequently assessed. $60 is simply not a form of behavior modification because companies are too willing to pay the fine and not address the underlying danger. For too many companies, these fines are merely the cost of doing business." 
   The Senate HELP Committee is expected to consider the Delegation bill during the next few weeks. That legislation focuses on several key areas, including:
  * Rapid Notification and Response - require MSHA to establish a rapid notification and response system, and require coal operators to expeditiously notify MSHA of emergencies, or subject themselves to a $100,000 fine. It took 11 hours before the rescue operation at Sago entered the mine; 
   * Emergency Communications and Breathing Equipment - require coal operators to store additional emergency breathing caches underground, and require emergency communications equipment for surface rescue efforts to locate and communicate with miners underground. The Sago miners had only one hour of oxygen to last through a forty hour rescue operation, and that no communication was possible with the trapped miners at both Sago and Alma; 
   * Penalties - create a new mandatory minimum penalty of $10,000 for coal operators that show "negligence or reckless disregard" for mandatory health and safety standards. Sago had 276 safety violations, and paid fines as low as $99 for "significant and substantial" violations; 
   * Belt Entries - nullify an MSHA rule issued in 2004 that authorizes the use of belt entries for ventilation, which may have caused the Alma fire; 
   * Technology - create a science and technology transfer office in MSHA to pull research and development ideas from other federal agencies for use in the mines; and 
   * Miner Ombudsman - create an ombudsman in the Department of Labor's Inspector General office for miners to report safety violations.
