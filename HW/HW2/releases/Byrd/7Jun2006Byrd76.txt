MINE SAFETY BILL HEADS TO WHITE HOUSE
  Following today's passage of the MINER Act they co-authored, Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) today said the bill would usher in a new era of mine safety. The bill passed the House of Representatives tonight 381-37 after passing the Senate unanimously two weeks ago.  
   "This is truly a historic moment for our miners, their families, and the mining industry as a whole," said Rockefeller. "In the wake of the horrible tragedies that have been visited upon us in recent weeks and months, we came together to think about what we need to do to make mining safer. The families of the victims at Sago were so instrumental in this effort. Their willingness to share their pain and suffering and that experience enabled us to forge legislation that we know will dramatically improve the everyday lives of our miners."
   "At long last, this Congress is taking steps to protect the lives of our coal miners," Byrd said. "In West Virginia this year, 19 miners have been killed on the job. We cannot allow these men to die in vain. We must take steps now to save lives, to prevent other coal mining families from having to endure the heartache from the loss of their loved ones. This legislation takes significant steps forward in emergency communications, pre-positioned oxygen supplies, and better trained, more rapidly deployed rescue teams. Clearly, there is more to accomplish, but the MINER Act is a major step forward." 
   "Our work on mine safety is not over. Congress must be aggressive in making sure this new law is properly implemented and strongly enforced. We simply must do everything in our power to make sure that no more Sagos, Aracomas, and Darbys become household words," Rockefeller said.
   "There are plenty of people in this Capitol standing up for the best interests of the coal operators. Senator Rockefeller and I are focused on doing all that we can for our coal mining families, for the people who take the risks and go underground to mine the coal and power our economy," Byrd added.
   The MINER Act will:
   * Double the amount of breathable air that each miner carries on them; 
   * Establish additional breathable apparatus' for shelters in place and at 30 minute intervals along escape routes; 
   * Create better communication - more telephone lines, new wireless technology, and electronic tracking of every miner; 
   * Develop more and better-trained rescue teams - requiring a response within one hour; and 
   * Create higher minimum fines for serious health and safety violations
