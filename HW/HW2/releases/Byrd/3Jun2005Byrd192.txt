BRAC CHAIRMAN TO KEEP PLEDGE TO SEN. BYRD
  Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., announced that the Chairman of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission will visit the West Virginia National Guard's 130th Airlift Wing. 
   Byrd spoke Friday with BRAC Chairman Anthony Principi, who assured Byrd that he will keep his pledge to the Senator to visit the 130th Airlift Wing before the BRAC Commission makes a decision on the base's future.
   "The Secretary of Defense, when he included the 130th Airlift Wing on his realignment and closure list last month, had his facts wrong, plain and simple. West Virginians deserve the chance to make their case to the commission before it makes any decision, and having the Chairman come to Charleston is a step in the right direction," Byrd said.
   "No doubt, we still have a major challenge on our hands. Getting the 130th off of this realignment and closure list will not be easy. But the men and women of the West Virginia National Guard have always stood by us. Now it is our turn to stand by them," Byrd said.
   Yesterday, Byrd announced that BRAC Commission analysts would visit the Charleston base on June 14, followed by testimony to be offered by the State of West Virginia at a June 28 BRAC hearing in North Carolina.
   "I am heartened by this turn of events. A big part of our fight is getting people to listen. They are ready to listen; our job is to give them a convincing case to keep the 130th open," Byrd said.
   Last month, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld included the 130th Airlift Wing on its base realignment and closure recommendations. The Defense Department wants to remove the eight C-130H planes housed at the 130th Airlift Wing and relocate them to Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina. The BRAC Commission has the authority to change the Secretary's plan.
