SENATORS MARK 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF FENTON ART GLASS
  Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., have introduced a resolution congratulating Fenton Art Glass of Williamstown, W.Va., on its centennial anniversary. 
   "Fenton Glass is a trademark of West Virginia. Across the country and around the world, people know Fenton's quality and character, and, through the remarkable works of art, people learn of West Virginia's quality and character as well," Byrd said.
   "Fenton deserves this honor. People all over the world know of the craftsmanship and beauty of Fenton glass. They appreciate the remarkable attention West Virginia craftsmen pay to the details of their products, and they appreciate the artistic vision underlying their work," said Rockefeller.
   The resolution, which was introduced to the Senate on Friday, notes the great history of Fenton Art Glass, which was founded in 1905 by brothers Frank and John Fenton.
   "The first 100 years of Fenton Art Glass have been a grand journey, but those years are just the beginning chapters," Byrd said. "There is a great future ahead for Fenton, for Wood County, and for all of West Virginia, a future as beautiful as the works created by the artisans at Fenton."
   "I feel sure that one hundred years from now, some future Congress will pass a resolution honoring the bicentennial of this great West Virginia company," said Rockefeller.
