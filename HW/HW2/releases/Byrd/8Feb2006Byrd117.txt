SENATE RESOLUTION HONORS LOST MINERS
  Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., introduced a resolution in the Senate Wednesday to honor the 16 coal miners who have perished this year in West Virginia. 
   "I pay tribute to all of those who have fallen in our nation's mines, and to their families who must bear their loss. A grateful nation owes its eternal thanks," Byrd said in remarks on the Senate floor.
   Senator Byrd read the names of all the miners who passed away in the Sago Mine in Upshur County, the Aracoma Alma Mine in Logan County, and the Long Branch Energy's #18 Tunnel and the Black Castle Surface mines in Boone County.
   "While the names of these coal miners have become known to many of us, we must not forget that there are many more coal miners whose tragic deaths are not chronicled in the national media. They die quietly in their homes of black lung disease, and they die anonymously in mine accidents across the nation. Their families mourn and grieve their loss without national attention," Byrd stated.
   "The recent tragic deaths of 16 West Virginia miners, along with miners in Utah and Kentucky, have brought serious attention to the overwhelming need to improve mine safety," Rockefeller said. "We are taking important steps in Congress to require stronger enforcement of existing regulations and to encourage companies to make a greater investment in technology that can save miners' lives."
   "Coal mining is a dangerous, but necessary occupation. Miners deserve to know that they have the best equipment and the best possible resources available. We owe it to the legacy of these fallen miners that today's miners and future miners have the best technology and hope of rescue that we can provide," Rockefeller stated.
   The West Virginia Delegation in the House of Representatives introduced an identical resolution in that chamber Wednesday.
