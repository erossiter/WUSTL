SEN. BYRD DEFENDS SEN. DAYTON'S TERRORISM CONCERNS
 Sen. Byrd issued the following statement in light of the mean-spirited attacks on Sen. Mark Dayton of Minnesota for his decision to shift his staff from his Capitol Hill office to other locations because of heightened terrorism concerns. 
   "I am disappointed that Senator Dayton has come under fire for his decision to temporarily close his Washington office. Senator Dayton took this precautionary step based on his conscience and his responsibility to his staff. I commend him. All members of Congress worry about the safety of the men and women who work in our offices. Today, Americans throughout the country, not just those who live and work on Capitol Hill, must live with the fear of terrorism. The choices they make to deal with this reality are personal and should not be fodder for public ridicule."
   "For the past several weeks, law enforcement and intelligence experts have warned Senators about increased threats to the Capitol. They have urged Senators to be prepared to have their staffs work from alternate locations. Senators ought not take these warnings lightly. And those Senators who put in place prudent security measures should not be mocked."
   "In March, we saw how terrorists purposely timed an attack in Madrid just three days before the Spanish election. Considering the recent warnings provided to Senators by the CIA, the FBI, and the Senate's Sergeant-at-Arms, I think that it is incumbent on all Americans to be alert, watchful, and smart. Instead of criticizing Senator Dayton for his decision, I think Americans can take a page from his book and be on guard during this period of heightened alert. After all, even the Bush White House has warned us that the question of another attack is not if it will occur, but when."
