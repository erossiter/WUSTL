SEN. BYRD MOBILE OFFICE HEADING TO STATE FAIR!
  As West Virginians take time to enjoy the start of the State Fair in Lewisburg this Friday, Sen.  
 Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., hopes that they will stop by his booth and say hello. Members of his staff will be on-hand to answer questions and help solve problems that people may have with the federal government.
   "The Fair is a wonderful celebration of our state. It is West Virginia, through and through. I hope that West Virginians will stop at my booth at the Fair. My staff will be ready to answer questions and provide assistance for those people who may be having trouble cutting through government red tape," Byrd said.
   Byrd's Mobile Office recently has visited every county in West Virginia.
   "Constituent service has always been a hallmark of my work as a United States Senator. Responding to the needs of West Virginians is, and always has been, my top priority. I make every effort to help my constituents with the problems they may encounter in dealing with federal government agencies," Byrd said.
   "By having my staff meet and visit with West Virginians in their local communities, I want to demonstrate my continuing commitment to serve the people of our state. My constituents have come to expect, and rightly deserve, this human touch and I am pleased to provide it for them," Byrd explained.
   At the State Fair's opening day on August 12, Byrd's Mobile Office will be set up at the Community Service Tent from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
