SEN. BYRD, GUARD CONTINUE TO COLLECT 'HEARTS FOR HEROES'
  With Easter approaching, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and the West Virginia National Guard are asking West Virginians to take a moment and send messages of support to Guard members deployed around the world. 
   "Easter is always a time for faith and family. For members of the West Virginia National Guard, stationed around the world, their families are far away," Byrd said. "'Hearts for Heroes' gives us the chance to bridge that gap, and to send a message of support and friendship to our fellow West Virginians serving our country around the world."
   Byrd and the West Virginia National Guard launched the "Hearts for Heroes" effort in February, encouraging Valentine's Day messages. The initiative was warmly received across West Virginia, and even included messages from as far away as Colorado.
   "We stand four-square with the men and women of our military, and every American wants to see them return home safely with the honor that they have earned. But until that day, 'Hearts for Heroes' gives us a chance to send a little bit of home to our troops overseas," Byrd said.
   "The messages can be from individuals, from families, from schools or classes, or from civic groups. Each of us can take a few minutes to share what's happening in our hometowns with our heroes serving around the world," Byrd explained.
   Byrd and the West Virginia National Guard have created a website and email addresses to send messages to troops stationed around the world. Both email addresses are linked at Byrd's website at: http://byrd.senate.gov/heroes.html. 
   Byrd's website also accepts and post small videos (no more than 20 seconds in length) and pictures. The website and email addresses will remain open throughout the year.
