SENATE GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO SEN. BYRD BORDER SECURITY PLAN
  The Senate on Tuesday approved a proposal authored by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., that would help to strengthen security along America's northern and southern borders.
   "Border security in this country must be more than a political slogan; it must be one of this nation's top priorities. The United States is on track to hire thousands of new Border Patrol agents and immigration enforcement officers. But, we have not provided the resources to equip these new agents with radios and weapons, with jeeps, and with aerial support. My proposal would give America's Border Patrol the resources to outfit our agents with the tools that they need to get the job done," Byrd explained. 
   The Byrd proposal would provide $350 million for border security infrastructure enhancements. With Senate approval on Tuesday, the provisions are now part of the legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security for the coming year. 
   "If we are truly serious about securing our borders - and not just engaging in hollow rhetoric - then we will put real dollars on the border," Byrd stated.
   Senator Byrd has worked with Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire - the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee - to craft the border plan.
   "I wish to commend the Senator from West Virginia for this amendment. Everything that he is proposing to fund in this amendment is needed and is critical," Senator Gregg stated during debate Tuesday. "There is no question but that the agencies which he is giving these additional dollars to for the purposes of refurbishing their both air and vehicle fleets are in dire need of these dollars. The aircraft owned by Customs are 30 years beyond their useful life. The helicopters are averaging 20 years beyond their useful life. The vehicles that these folks go out to protect our borders in often break down. Many times they can't fulfill their missions because the vehicles are not up to the capacity that is needed. This is a good amendment. It's needed."
   Specifically, the Byrd amendment would provide:
   * $90 million for additional fencing, tactical border infrastructure, and facilities; 
   * $105 million for air and marine items, such as new helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, the equipping and manning of all planned Northern border air wings, and the facilities to house and maintain these aircraft; 
   * $55 million for replacement vehicles for border and immigration personnel; 
   * $15 million for the information technology modernization program at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has a direct impact on the ability of agents and officers to track information and conduct investigations; 
   * $47 million for the Business Transformation Program at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) - a multi-year effort to modernize immigration benefit services in a more timely, consistent, and accurate manner, reducing fraud in the program and better ensuring the security of the immigration system; and 
   * $38 million for Fraud Detection and National Security activities at USCIS. Currently USCIS resources only allow its personnel to check the name and date of birth that applicants provide on their applications for benefits. This additional funding will allow USCIS to verify individuals' identity claims with various public data sources. 
   This latest border initiative by Senator Byrd builds on another bipartisan package that he authored last year. For that law, Byrd and Republican Senator Larry Craig of Idaho combined efforts to win approval of more than $273 million for border security initiatives, including the hiring of 500 border patrol agents and more than 200 immigration enforcement agents and criminal investigators. In fact, in the past two years, Senator Byrd's work has resulted in the hiring and training of 3,000 new Border Patrol agents and 2,275 new immigration enforcement officers, as well as expanded detention facilities for illegal immigrants arrested in the United States.
