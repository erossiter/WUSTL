MINE DEATHS TRAGEDY FOR ALL WEST VIRGINIA
  Sen. Byrd on Wednesday called the deaths of 12 coal miners in Upshur County, W.Va., a terrible tragedy.  
   All of us are united in sadness today. The miners in Upshur County were part of the West Virginia family. We grieve for those who died, and we pray for their families. But, we also thank God and pray for the sole survivor, Randal McCloy, Jr. He is in great hands at the WVU trauma center.
   Each miner faces physical dangers with a knowledge that every other miner with him is his brother. Together, they do their jobs with extraordinary bravery and professionalism. The men at the Sago mine were brothers. They worked together; they struggled together; and together today, they are with the Lord.
   As the families grieve, they also want answers. They deserve to know what happened in that mine. One of the finest tributes we could pay to these families and their lost loved ones would be to take steps to help prevent other families from ever experiencing such pain.
   Erma and I pray for the souls of these men, for the consolation of their families and friends, and for the improving health of Randal McCloy. Millions across the country mourn with West Virginia today.
