SEN. BYRD WISHES 'MERRY CHRISTMAS' TO WEST VIRGINIA
  As families prepared to celebrate Christmas this weekend, Sen.  
 Byrd hoped that West Virginians would keep the true spirit of Christmas in their hearts all year round.
   "Christmas comes once a year, but the spirit of Christmas should guide us always," Byrd said. "I hope that all West Virginians will enjoy Christmas as it was meant to be, as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ."
   Senator and Mrs. Byrd planned to celebrate Christmas with their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
   "Family is very important at all times, but especially at Christmas time. We should enjoy the times with the children and grandchildren, and gather around the Christmas tree to share stories and remember what is truly important," Byrd said. "At its core, Christmas will always be about a couple who found no shelter but a manger, and also about a newborn child who would become the Savior of the world. My Christmas wish is that all of us will remember the words and, more importantly, the true meaning of this sacred season."
   Growing up in Southern West Virginia in hard times, Senator Byrd's family always found ways to celebrate the holiday.
   "We enjoyed the old-time Christmas. There was none of this 'season's greetings' nonsense. It was 'Merry Christmas!' There were many times that we didn't have much, but we always had each other. That's the way it was," Byrd said.
