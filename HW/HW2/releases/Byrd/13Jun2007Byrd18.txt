SENS. BYRD, ROCKEFELLER LEAD CHARGE FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS
  Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., today joined a bipartisan group in the Senate in introducing legislation to make immediate improvements in the treatment of service members with combat-related injuries or illness as they transition civilian life. The "Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act" addresses many problems that plague this far-too burdensome and difficult process, while enhancing health care for wounded servicemen and women, including treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
   "Our brave men and women who have been wounded in combat deserve much better than they have received to date," said Byrd. "We must ensure that those who need care after returning home from the battlefield receive the quality care and assistance they need. They are our nation's heroes. They have earned top-notch medical care."  
   "Our soldiers are coming home with deep and debilitating wounds - both physical and mental. This can make their transition back into civilian life a truly difficult challenge. That's why it's so important that we are there to help them every step of the way," said Rockefeller. "But the process our veterans have faced when returning home has often been cumbersome, outdated and not worthy of their service. We're determined to fix it, and this legislation will go a long way toward giving our wounded soldiers the support they've earned and deserve." 
   Summary of the "Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act": 
   The bill requires the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a comprehensive policy by the end of this year on the care, management and transition from the military to VA or civilian life for service members with combat-related injuries or illnesses, including: care and management of members in medical hold/holdover status, medical and physical disability evaluations, standards for return to duty, patient-focused policy for transition from DOD to VA.

   * Require the military departments to take into account all medical conditions that render the member unfit for duty.
