SEN. BYRD: POPE WAS 'VOICE FOR FREEDOM AND A CHAMPION OF THE POOR'
  Sen. Byrd issued the following statement after the death of Pope John Paul II in Vatican City.  
   "The world has lost an inspiring figure today. I am not of the Catholic faith, but I have watched Pope John Paul II these past 26 years travel the globe. He not only spread the Good News of the Lord, but the Pope also served as a voice for freedom and a champion of the poor. 
   "Matthew in his Gospel writes, 'If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.' Pope John Paul II helped to move mountains of poverty, of injustice, and of ignorance in all corners of the world. May his soul rest in peace. My heart and my prayers are with the people of the Catholic Church on this sad day."
