SEN. BYRD WORKS FOR SUPPORT FOR IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN VETERANS
  Sen. Byrd pressed the Defense Department's top civilian and military leaders about the growing mental health problems facing combat veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   "As many as one in five soldiers and Marines returning from Iraq have reported mental health problems," Byrd said. "This is a real problem for the returning veterans, as well as for their families and friends. The stress of combat and the wounds of war particularly affect the children of our returning veterans. Yet, the Administration, while asking for more than $72 billion to fight these wars, did not ask for a single additional dime for mental health services for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)."
   At a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on Thursday, Byrd asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, why the mental wellness of returning troops did not merit attention in the Administration's special funding request of the Congress.
   Byrd has been contacted by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - as well as by their families - reporting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Often, PTSD and other problems do not manifest themselves until well after the soldier has returned home.
   "How can the Defense Department and the VA effectively coordinate efforts to meet the long-term needs of these veterans with such a sparse and uneven funding effort?" Byrd asked at the hearing.
   General Pace responded that the VA does an enormous amount of work for returning troops but that more is certainly needed.
