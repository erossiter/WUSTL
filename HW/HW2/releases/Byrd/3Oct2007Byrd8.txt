SEN. BYRD CONDEMNS PRESIDENTIAL VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE BILL
  U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., issued the following statement today after President Bush vetoed the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Byrd has been a strong supporter of this health care program that has a proven track record of making health care accessible for the neediest children in West Virginia and across the nation. 
   Byrd statement:
   "Once again, President Bush has put funding the war in Iraq over funding critical priorities here at home. He claims he is vetoing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) because America cannot afford health care for our children. This President's priorities are completely out of whack. The President vetoes a bill to fund children's health needs in the same week he intends to ask Congress for $190 billion to fund his endless war in Iraq.
   "I find it ironic that the President made a point to designate the first of October "Children's Health Day," yet two days later vetoed a bill that would provide health care for children who need it most. When designating children's health day, the president noted the role CHIP has "played in helping poor children stay healthy," and called for a reauthorization of the program. Clearly, this was more empty rhetoric from a President desperate to draw attention away from his neglect of the most important priorities facing the nation. I applaud Senator Jay Rockefeller for his tireless efforts to advance this vital program that has helped thousands of children in West Virginia, and pledge to work with my colleagues to override this veto."
