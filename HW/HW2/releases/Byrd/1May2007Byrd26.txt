SENS. BYRD, ROCKEFELLER REQUEST FOR FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION APPROVED
  A request for a federal disaster declaration in the seven West Virginia counties hardest hit by recent severe storms, mudslides and flooding was approved today by President Bush. Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W.Va., had submitted a formal request to the White House, asking the President to grant Gov. Joe Manchin's request for federal assistance.  
   The federal declaration makes the Public Assistance (PA) program available for Boone, Cabell, Lincoln, Logan, Mingo, Wayne , and Wyoming counties. Hazard Mitigation eligibility has also been granted statewide.
   "This will help state and local governments, and some of the private nonprofit groups that have been working so hard to repair damage from this disaster," Byrd said. "The PA program can now help these counties with debris removal, emergency response, road and bridge repair, and public utilities like water and electricity. Sadly, West Virginians are no strangers to natural disasters of this kind. Even so, you never get used to it. It is more than an inconvenience - it is a disruption of people's lives. This extra help is most welcome."
   FEMA has also granted West Virginia eligibility status for assistance through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
   "All 55 counties are eligible to apply now for Hazard Mitigation grants," Rockefeller said. "These grants will help us do the work necessary to try and prevent some of these areas from flooding again. The PA designation will help some homeowners, and the Hazard Mitigation grants can help at the community level. I encourage our counties that experience these recurring flood problems to apply for these FEMA grants now that we have made them available."
