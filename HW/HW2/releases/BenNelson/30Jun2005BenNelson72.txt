                                                                                                 WASHINGTON  D C     Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson today voted for the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   Senator Nelson released the following statement after the vote         When it comes to trade agreements  unfortunately you have to vote for or against the entire agreement  I voted for CAFTA because I believe that with all things considered  this agreement is good for Nebraska  Our farmers  ranchers and producers will operate in a fair trade zone with the elimination of trade taxes for exports to Central American countries  we  ll have increased access to a multi billion dollar market in the region  and expanded markets for Nebraska goods like agriculture products  textiles  pharmaceuticals and medicines     said Senator Nelson       Senator Nelson has been pushing the Administration to address the concerns domestic sugar producers have with the sugar provisions in the agreement  U S  Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns recently sent a letter to a number of Senators indicating that he would personally act to block the entry of imported sugar if the domestic sugar program was threatened       Over the past several weeks Nelson has had numerous conversations regarding the sugar provisions in CAFTA   Last week  he met with President Bush and expressed his concerns  For weeks he has been in discussions with Commerce Secretary Gutierrez  U S  Trade Representative Ambassador Rob Portman  Secretary Johanns and sugar producers and sugar industry leaders trying to forge a compromise on the sugar provisions         I have tried to balance the benefits the United States can derive from CAFTA while protecting our domestic sugar producers   I have received assurances from Secretary Gutierrez  Secretary Johanns and Ambassador Portman that they will ensure that our domestic sugar interests are protected and I have their pledge that should problems arise in the future  we will be able to work together to keep those promises     said Nelson       Nelson said that Congress can correct any inadequacies that might arise for sugar from CAFTA when it addresses the farm bill in 2007   The Central American Free Trade Agreement was passed by the Senate today on a bipartisan vote of 54 45       CAFTA FACTS      CAFTA Will Level the Playing Field for Nebraska Workers and Farmers  In 2004  Nebraska exported  19 6 million in goods to the CAFTA region  Currently  80 percent of goods and services and 99 percent of agricultural goods from CAFTA nations already enters the U S  duty free  However  U S  made products exported to CAFTA nations   15 billion total  are still subject to hefty tariffs  CAFTA would immediately eliminate the vast majority of those tariffs  saving nearly  1 billion per year in foreign taxes on U S  manufactured goods and farm products  This reduction would give our workers and farmers a level playing field   United States Department of Commerce  March 2005  Op ed  United States Trade Representative Rob Portman  Wall Street Journal  5 10 2005       CAFTA Will Expand Markets for Manufacturers and Farmers  CAFTA will expand markets for many American producers  According to the United States Trade Representative Rob Portman  America s leading farm and manufacturing groups estimate sales gains to Central America of  1 5 billion in farm products and  1 billion in manufactured goods  This is good for American workers   Op ed  United States Trade Representative Rob Portman  Wall Street Journal  5 10 2005       CAFTA Will Help Nebraska Textile Manufacturers Compete More Effectively  CAFTA helps the United States compete more effectively  For example  in the clothing business  CAFTA will provide incentives to use U S  yarn  fabric  thread and elastics in making clothes  In 2004  Nebraska exported just over  2 million in fabric mill products to CAFTA regions  According to Portman  after CAFTA  more than 90  of all apparel made in Central America or the Dominican Republic will be sewn from fabric and yarn produced by American workers  If the United States does not solidify its trade relationship with this region  these factories are likely to move to Asia  where U S  inputs account for less than 1  of the clothes made there   Op ed  United States Trade Representative Rob Portman  Wall Street Journal  5 10 2005       CAFTA Will Reduce Tariffs on Nebraska Produced Pharmaceuticals and Medicines  Nebraska  s top exports to the CAFTA DR region are pharmaceuticals and medicines  in 2004  Nebraska  s exports from this category were valued at  4 2 million  accounting for 21 percent of the state  s total shipments to the region  Under CAFTA DR  tariffs on high value chemical products  such as residual pharmaceuticals and medicines  will  in most cases  be phased out immediately or in five years   US Department of Commerce  March 2005
