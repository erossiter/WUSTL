                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        May 23  2007   Nebraska s Senator Ben Nelson and South Dakota Senator John Thune today announced that they are introducing legislation to promote the development and production of celluosic ethanol        Celluosic ethanol has always faced a chicken or the egg problem   it s difficult to start commercial production without a guaranteed supply of biomass  but it s hard to encourage farmers to grow the biomass unless they know they ll have a market   said Nelson    This legislation will help resolve that problem by encouraging the construction of biofuel facilities while simultaneously pushing the production of biomass         Cellulosic ethanol has incredible potential to supplement corn based ethanol  But if cellulosic ethanol is to achieve its potential  it is critical that Congress help this industry overcome initial market barriers  This legislation would spur the construction of biorefineries across the country and provide incentives to farmers in surrounding areas to grow energy dedicated crops that can eventually supply these biorefineries in a cost effective  environment friendly way   Thune said   If we are going to be serious in this country about reducing our dependence on foreign oil  we have to be serious about giving the necessary jumpstart to America s budding alternative fuels industry and the farmers who supply it  so they can transform this infant industry into the future answer to America s energy needs        The legislation  the Biofuels Innovation Program Act of 2007  seeks to help advance our biofuels production and move us closer to capturing the potential of cellulosic ethanol production   The bill provides business planning and assistance matching grants of up to  30 000 for entities and communities interested in developing a project area for producers to begin producing dedicated energy and biomass crops  as well as for attracting or creating a cellulosic biofuels facility   The grant applicants would be required to submit a proposal that identifies eligible cropland and indicates that the area has a strong likelihood for producing biomass for energy   The proposals would have to include a letter of commitment from an existing or proposed biofuels production facility to use the feedstock for producing biofuels or other energy       Once the grant is approved  the areas around the plant  within a 75 mile radius  would be classified as Biofuels Innovations Program  BIP  Project Areas  making them eligible for transitional assistance for the production of biomass feedstock   The assistance would be provided in the form of a percentage of the establishment cost incurred by a producer to plant and grow a biomass crop  as well as yearly rental payments on the land that is growing the biomass crop for the first five years of the BIP contract   This will help producers get energy and biomass crops established and growing at the same time that the cellulosic biofuel plant is being built so that the feedstock will be ready when the biofuel plant needs it   Finally  the bill provides optional transitional assistance in the form of a matching payment to producers for the purchase of the biomass by the biofuel facility   This provision will help create a market for the biomass        While the grants help get biofuel plants up and running  assistance will be given to area producers to transition to biomass development   said Nelson    We ll be pushing both areas of development along the same track  providing a boost for the new fuel site and encouraging further development of domestic energy supplies   Celluosic ethanol has shown great potential  but faced significant hurdles   Our bill will help clear the hurdles and encourage widespread development of biofuel plants         On behalf of the American Coalition for Ethanol  ACE   I applaud Senators Thune and Nelson for developing a forward thinking initiative that takes a balanced and sustainable approach to provide land owners with the financial and technical means to plant  harvest  store  and transport biomass feedstocks for ethanol production   I encourage Members of Congress to include an innovative program such as this in the 2007 Farm Bill   said Brian Jennings  Executive Vice President    While important gains are being made in the cellulosic ethanol production process  it is critically important to place an equal amount of focus on the feedstock side of the equation   The Biofuels Innovation Program attends to the fundamentals of establishing  growing  harvesting  and transporting the cellulosic feedstocks necessary for this new generation of ethanol
