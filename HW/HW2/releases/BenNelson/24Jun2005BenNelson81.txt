Ben Nelson which directs NASA to develop a health care program designed to better track and understand the long term effects of space travel   The program  whose feasibility was initially studied at the University of Nebraska Medical Center  UNMC   would lead to increased understanding of how humans can travel longer periods in space and live longer lives on earth        This proposal provides a common sense approach to tracking the long term effects from space travel   If we are to meet the challenge of long term space travel  we need to start now in determining how humans can make the journey safely   I am pleased that my colleagues saw the importance of this proposal and Nebraska s role in developing it   said Nelson  a member of the Senate s Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee          We are flattered to have been given the opportunity to prepare the lifetime health insurance proposal for the astronauts and their families  Due to Sen  Nelson s leadership  this important work will continue  This endeavor signifies that UNMC s expertise is being recognized on a national level  This type of cooperation only strengthens UNMC s reputation as a world class medical center     said Cory Shaw  chief administrative officer for University Medical Associates  the physician group practice for UNMC       The Astronaut Health Care for Life program is a comprehensive health care system for astronauts and their families that allows the capture and study of all relevant medical data necessary to ameliorate the risks of space flight   This health care program shall enhance understanding of how humans can travel safely and live longer in space and  as an additional benefit  how humans can live longer on Earth  Many of the medical findings developed through this program will likely be applicable to many of today  s standard medical treatments        A study to design the project was first conducted at UNMC  in cooperation with NASA  and looked at providing lifetime health care to astronauts and their dependents   In exchange  the agency would get stronger data to track long term health issues  such as the effects of weightlessness  isolation and radiation         Nelson  s amendment to establish the health care program for NASA  s astronauts was included as part of the NASA Reauthorization Act  which was considered by the Senate Commerce Committee earlier today   The bill authorizes the U S  space program and related agencies  The Commerce Committee completed its   mark up    of the legislation today and the bill will go to the full committee for approval       Attached is a one page summary of the Astronaut Health Care for Life program is attached       ASTRONAUT HEALTH CARE FOR LIFE  The Astronaut Health Care for Life responds to a critical need identified by NASA  with concurrence by the Institute of Medicine  to create a comprehensive health care system for astronauts and their families which enables the capture and study of all relevant data necessary to ameliorate the risks of space flight   This program will enhance the understanding of how humans can travel safely and live longer in space and  as an additional benefit  how humans can live longer on Earth       Currently  NASA provides comprehensive health care only for active duty astronauts  with all former astronauts limited to an annual executive physical examination for data collection to support the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health   Dependents of active duty astronauts are currently limited to space available health care through the Johnson Space Center flight medicine clinic       The program would finance and coordinate the delivery of everything necessary to provide for the health care needs of this population  including medical  dental  prescription drug and vision care   No cost to beneficiaries is a feature that would enhance participation in this program by eligible beneficiaries who may have other options for receiving health care   The proposed beneficiary population consists of all active and former U S  astronauts  U S  payload specialists  U S  space flight participants  their spouses  and their dependents up to age 23     This program will serve three main purposes   1      Provide comprehensive health care to the astronauts and their dependents  a population at unique risk from the poorly understood health effects of space flight  and the stresses associated with training for space flight and recovering from space flight missions       2      Establish occupational health surveillance of the health of current and former astronauts  and their dependents  by capturing all health events and any pathology  altered physiology or altered behavioral health that has a relationship to space flight  training for space flight or recovering from space flight missions  and      3      Facilitate research into the long term health risks associated with human space flight  making these activities safer for future astronauts       This program is a data gathering effort in the form of a health care delivery plan   The main function is to provide comprehensive health care to the astronauts and their dependents  so that all health events are captured and any pathology  altered physiology or altered behavioral health that has a relationship to space flight is identified to the benefit of future astronauts and their families         The data gathered will be the result of individual provider patient encounters for health care  i e  medical information protected by the Privacy Act  and will not be the product of any research protocol or project   The data will be entered into the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health  LSAH  database  will be available to NASA flight surgeons for use in clinical practice  and will be periodically analyzed from an epidemiological perspective to identify any emerging health trends   The data  with individual identities protected to the maximum level possible  will also be available  upon review and approval  to researchers who request specific information pursuant to an approved research protocol or project       This program will increase our understanding of the health effects of space flight  assist in guiding NASA  s biomedical research efforts  help assure adequate protection for future space travelers  and ensure health care for current astronauts who will experience the largely unknown long term effects of space flight   If travelers are to go to Mars and beyond one day  they should appreciate that in 2005 we laid the groundwork on human health to facilitate this goal
