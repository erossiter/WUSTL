                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON  D C     The United States Senate completed action on a second piece of major reform legislation this session when it completed action on the Bankruptcy Reform bill today  This bill comes on the heels of a Class Action reform bill completed last month           No gridlock here     said Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson  the lead Democratic sponsor of S  256  the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005  also known as the Bankruptcy Reform bill    With gridlock like this we  ll complete the session early  I hope we can tackle the Energy bill  the Renewable Fuels Standard  the Highway Construction bill and the appropriations bills with such speed and cooperation          Nelson comments refer to an often repeated criticism that the Senate is locked in partisan gridlock and unable to complete action on major legislation          Under the Bankruptcy Reform bill no American will be denied access to the bankruptcy system  However  those trying to shield their assets while abandoning their financial responsibilities will find it much more difficult to abuse the system and leave their debts for other Americans to cover through higher interest rates and fees     said Nelson    This bill finds the appropriate balance between protecting consumers from predatory lending practices and protecting creditors  retailers  and small businesses that provide credit in good faith from fraud and abuse          The goal of the bill is to prevent certain abuses of the bankruptcy system  It includes more than five hundred pages of new and reformed law  but key provisions include the following       Curbing Bankruptcy Abuses  The bill will curb abuse of the bankruptcy system by implementing a means test to ensure that those who can afford to repay some portion of their unsecured debts are required to do so  Bankruptcy petitioners with relatively high incomes could be required to file under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7  and repay some of their debt out of future income  The means test takes into account the petitioner s income  debt burden  and allowable living expenses  which can vary significantly according to the debtor s place of residence and particular circumstances  Filers who cannot afford to repay at least  6 000 will be given unfettered access to Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings        The bill has a safeguard that will allow judges to consider extenuating circumstances in each bankruptcy case  After determining this means test calculation  the judge can then take any   special circumstances    into consideration before making a decision to shift the debtor into Chapter 13  This will allow judges to consider cases where catastrophic illnesses or other unexpected financial calamities that have impacted a family or individual to the point where their debts are too heavy a load to carry  This provision made many of the amendments considered on this bill redundant       Chapter 12 Bankruptcy Protection for Farmers  The bill implements an important safeguard for family farmers by making permanent the extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy rules  Chapter 12 has expired every year  necessitating the need for an extension  Last year  Senator Grassley and I worked in a bipartisan fashion to secure the Chapter 12 extension   The bill also bumps the exemption level for family farmers from  1 5 million to nearly  3 24 million  which will be adjusted periodically for inflation        Child Support Safeguards  The bill includes an important provision to safeguard our children  It contains provisions that strengthen the ability of women and children to collect child support and marital dissolution obligations  This provision will enable some families to continue to provide for the needs of their children       Consumer Protections  Consumer also benefit from protection measures in this bill  By requiring new minimum payment and introductory rate disclosures for credit cards  consumers will be protected from surprise fees and unexpected rate fluctuation  It also contains a  debtor  s bill of rights  requiring that bankruptcy attorneys and petition preparers disclose their services and fees for those services to consumers       The bill passed the Senate on a bipartisan 74 25 vote and will be referred to the House of Representatives for consideration                                                             30
