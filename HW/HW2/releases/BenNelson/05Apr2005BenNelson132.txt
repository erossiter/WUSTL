                                                                                                        WASHINGTON  D C     In an effort to permanently resolve the acrimony over judicial nominations that has permeated the U S  Senate in recent years  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson today offered a proposal to change the standing rules of the Senate to guarantee confirmation votes for judicial nominations     Nelson offered his proposal as an alternative to the so called   nuclear option     a parliamentary procedure that would employ a partisan vote within the Senate to temporarily prohibit the use of the filibuster by the minority party        The   nuclear option   was deficient in two areas     said Senator Nelson    It doesn  t address the issue permanently and it fails to address the instances of the Judiciary Committee blocking nominations before they get to the floor  If some members believe this issue is grave enough to merit a nuclear option to resolve it  we should consider it grave enough to merit a change in the rules of the Senate        Nelson is proposing a permanent change in the Senate Rules that would set a calendar timeframe for action on nominees at the committee level and by the full Senate  It would prohibit the use of the filibuster on judicial nominations and it would require the Judiciary Committee to report out each nominee regardless of how the committee votes on the nomination      Nelson proposal to remove the partisanship from the judicial nomination process      The Committee Process         Once a nomination is received by the Senate Judiciary Committee the Committee would have 20 legislative days to hold a hearing on a nomination          After a hearing  the Committee would have another 20 legislative days to consider the nomination and make a recommendation to the Senate      o If the Committee fails to act  the nomination would be automatically reported out of committee unfavorably and placed on the Executive Calendar      o All nominations passed or rejected by the Judiciary Committee would also be reported to the Senate and placed on the Executive Calendar     o Only with the mutual consent of the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee could the time frame for consideration be extended another 20 legislative days        The Senate Floor Process         Once a nomination is placed on the executive calendar  the full Senate would have an additional 20 legislative days to debate and act on the nomination      o If that time period expires without Senate action  a pending nomination can be brought up by a point of order from any individual Senator      o The Senate would then have ten hours to debate the nomination and ultimately an up or down vote would occur         My goal with this proposal is to remove completely the role of partisanship in addressing judicial nominations     said Nelson    Under my plan  no matter which party controlled Congress or occupied the White House the president would get votes on his judicial nominations  By removing the partisanship  the Senate can focus on the nominations and eventually vote  which is what should happen        Nelson  s proposal to guarantee votes on judicial nominations also provides ample opportunity for the minority Party or the opposition to the nomination to make its case and debate the nominee      Nelson has opposed the use of the filibuster to block nominations  In fact  in every case but one he has voted against the filibuster and in favor of moving the President  s nominations to a vote  In the one case he did support the filibuster he did so because he was denied access to information regarding the nominee that he thought would be important to decide if that nominee was qualified  Even though he opposes the use of the filibuster on judicial nominations he has reserved the right to utilize the filibuster in the event of a particularly objectionable nomination  Nelson has voted against only one of the 205 judicial nominations confirmed by the Senate     In the last four years  the Senate has confirmed 205 of a possible 215 judicial nominations  That  s a 95  confirmation rate  During the previous Administration  the Senate confirmed 248 out of 311 judicial nominations  or just an 80  confirmation rate     Nelson has been working for months with Majority Leader Bill Frist  TN   Minority Leader Harry Reid  NV  and Rules Committee Chairman Trent Lott  MS  to develop an alternative to the nuclear option        Facts About Judicial Nominations in the U S  Senate    205 Judicial Nominees Confirmed     The Senate has confirmed 205 judicial nominees of President George W  Bush   This is more than in President Reagan  s first term  President George H W  Bush  s only term  or President Clinton   s second term    95  Confirmation Rate for Bush Nominees    215 nominees were brought to the full Senate for a vote  meaning 95 percent of the judges brought for a vote were confirmed   One hundred of the 205 confirmations took place in the 17 months that Democrats were in the Senate majority and the other 105 during the 34 months that Republicans have controlled the Senate  During the previous Administration  the Senate confirmed 248 out of 311 judicial nominations  or just 80      35 Circuit Court Nominees Confirmed    The Senate has confirmed 35 circuit court nominees  more than in Reagan  s or Clinton  s first term      The Federal Judiciary is Now 95 percent Full    There are now only 46 vacant seats in all of the Federal courts  the lowest level of vacancies since the Reagan era  There are more federal judges today than in any previous Presidential term   In 2001  there were 110 vacancies and by the end of the 108th Congress the number had plummeted to 27     Of the 10 Nominees Filibusters  3 Have Withdrawn  4 Are Opposed by Both Home State Senators and 3 Were Seen as Unsuitable  Extreme  And Likely to Impose Their Personal Views    Miguel Estrada  Carolyn Kuhl and Chalres Pickering have all asked that their nominations be withdrawn and are no longer pending   Three Michigan nominees and Janice Rogers Brown of California are opposed by both their home state Senators  William Myers of Idaho  William Pryor of Alabama and Priscilla Owen of Texas are the 3 nominees already debated by the Senate on whose nominations cloture was denied      President Bush Has Not Sent Names for 28 of the 46 Vacancies    President Bush has not yet made nominations for more than half of the current vacancies on the federal bench         President Bush Has Sent the Senate Only 1 New Judicial Nomination This Year    Brian Sandoval of Nevada is the only new judicial nomination sent to the Senate in the first 4 months of this year   He has bipartisan support from his home state Senators and appears to be a consensus nominee whose confirmation can be expedited as soon as his paper work is received
