                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON  D C     With gas prices soaring and little relief in sight  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson has again joined the fight to boost domestic production of ethanol and other renewable fuels in order to decrease the United States   reliance on foreign oil  Nelson is part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators who today will introduce the Fuels Security Act of 2005   ambitious Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  legislation that would more than double the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the nation  s fuel supply to at least eight billion gallons annually by 2012         The biggest threat to our economic security is our over reliance on fossil fuels and foreign oil     said Senator Nelson    The Fuels Security Act will boost domestic production of renewable fuels  drive down gas prices  create agriculture sector jobs  and protect our economic security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil        Senators Richard Lugar of Indiana and Tom Harkin of Iowa authored the Fuels Security Act of 2005  Senator Nelson is an original cosponsor  This important renewable fuels legislation is one of the pillars for economic development for rural America    one segment of the population that lagged behind in the economic surge of the 1990  s and is suffering from current economic conditions and the continuing effects of a devastating drought    Drought David       The use of ethanol  as part of a Renewable Fuels Standard  is a win win win situation  a win for farmers  a win for consumers  and a win for the environment     said Nelson    We should promote energy policies that fit into a comprehensive rural development plan that will spur investment in agri business and promote economic activity in the agriculture sector        If passed  the Fuels Security Act will establish a 4 billion gallon renewable fuels standard in 2006  growing every year until it reaches 8 billion gallons by 2012   This is a responsible approach to meeting the demands of an ever increasing demand for fuel sources       There are many benefits to this legislation  The minimum renewable fuels usage in this version of the RFS is three billion gallons a year higher by 2012 than in similar legislation approved in the 108th Congress  and two billion gallons a year higher by 2012 than in legislation approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on March 16       Nelson pointed out that many of the ethanol and biofuels plants to be built will be farmer owned  bringing jobs and economic growth to rural communities  For example  according to a recent study  each typical ethanol plant built in the United States creates 700 jobs  expands the local economic base by over  140 million  and increases the local corn price by five to ten cents a bushel   Nebraska plants produce 532 million gallons of ethanol annually  or 12  of the nation  s total        Like the earlier RFS legislation  The Fuels Security Act of 2005 requires that petroleum companies market a minimum volume of renewable fuels in the United States each year   These minimum annual volumes of renewable fuels would increase over seven years  beginning with four billion gallons a year in 2006 and rising to eight billion gallons a year in 2012   Mechanisms in the legislation provide for further increases in later years depending on the total volume of U S  motor fuel consumption and other factors   Each gallon of ethanol produced from cellulose biomass will count as 2 5 gallons toward meeting the RFS     The legislation also eliminates the two percent oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline under the Clean Air Act and provides the Environmental Protection Agency authority to ensure that emissions standards from the Clean Air Act are still met   In addition  federal vehicle fleets would be required to purchase a minimum quantity of renewable fuels  and EPA would be required to sponsor a study to investigate how the United States could obtain 25 percent of its transportation fuel from renewable sources by 2025       Soon after being elected Nebraska  s 37th Governor  Nelson formed and was the first Chair of the Governor  s Ethanol Coalition to promote increased ethanol use nationwide  The Coalition began with nine Midwest states and grew to 22 states  Puerto Rico and 2 foreign countries under his stewardship   More than 6000 Nebraskans are now employed directly or indirectly in Nebraska ethanol production   One of the first bills Nelson cosponsored as Senator was a bill to boost production of ethanol and other renewable fuels  which was the basis for the agreement in last years Senate energy bill   Senator Nelson received the Renewable Energy Leadership Award in 2002 for his work on that bill     Joining Harkin  Lugar and Nelson in sponsoring the legislation are Senators Durbin  Obama  Johnson  Bayh  Conrad  Dayton  Dorgan  Salazar  Stabenow  Hagel  Frist  Bond  Grassley  Coleman  Talent  Thune  Bunning  and DeWine                                                           30
