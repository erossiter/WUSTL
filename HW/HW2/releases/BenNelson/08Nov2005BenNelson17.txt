                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON  D C     With health insurance cited as the fastest growing and most cumbersome cost for America  s small businesses  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson is backing a plan to control those costs and expand health insurance coverage for small businesses and their employees that is winning accolades from business and insurance groups       Nelson is the lead cosponsor of    the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005     a bill designed to lower health insurance costs by stimulating market reforms and promoting competition while allowing trade associations the ability to offer group insurance plans for employees       The bill  S  1955  would allow business and trade association to band their members together and offer group health coverage on a national or statewide basis  The group plans would be in direct response to runaway costs that are driving many employers and families from comprehensive health insurance  Since 2000  group premiums for family coverage have grown nearly 60 percent         If we don  t do something to help small businesses cope with the costs of health care  soon we will have an entire workforce without health insurance coverage     said Senator Nelson    Health care premiums are experiencing double digit growth annually  small businesses can  t keep up with the costs  As a result  fewer employers are offering health coverage and fewer employees are covered  The continuing problem of skyrocketing heath care costs is a grave threat to our working families          The bill would enhance the market leverage of small groups as well as individuals by giving associations a meaningful role on a level playing field with other group health plans  streamlining the current confusing  overlapping and varying state regulations  preserving the primary role of the states in health insurance oversight and consumer protection  making lower cost health plan options available  and achieving meaningful reform without a huge federal price tag         According to U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee and the author of the bill  the legislation will benefit families struggling to keep their current insurance as well as those already priced out of their plans  The bill is the result of more than a year of negotiations and responds to pleas from the small business community to be allowed to pool their members and provide group health insurance  called Small Business Health Plans  SBHPs   The bill will also include safeguards to protect against adverse effects that could result if new group plans were given a blanket exemption from state based oversight and enforcement        The Senate  s HELP Committee held a hearing in April to gather information that would help small businesses combat growth in health insurance costs and dwindling access to health coverage  Many of the ideas and solutions brought forward during the hearing were incorporated into this bill  The bill is also cosponsored by Montana Senator Conrad Burns       Highlights    Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization   Affordability Act         Small Business Health Plans established under the bill       o Will resemble the fully insured component of the AHP bill S  406    The Small Business Fairness Act          o Will permit business and trade associations to pool their members independently but will not allow them to establish self insured plans       o Will require SBHPs to include any benefits already required by at least 45 states as part of their plans  but also will allow those SBHPs to opt out of other mandated benefits that are not required by at least 45 states        Rules that will govern SBHPs established under the bill       o Must obtain federal certification       o Must be governed by a board of trustees with complete fiscal control       o Must be established for more than three years for purposes other than pooling health care coverage       o Must not condition association membership or coverage on health status        Modernization  Promoting uniform state insurance regulations under the bill       o Sets up a process to promote greater uniformity in the current costly and competition inhibiting hodgepodge of varying state health insurance regulations       o Sets up a harmonization commission under the Department of Health and Human Services with the participation of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  NAIC  to develop uniform standards for insurance regulation such as rating and underwriting  consumer protections  market conduct and plan oversight standards
