                                                                                                  WASHINGTON  D C     At the Third Annual United States Missile Defense Conference today  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson  a member of the U S  Senate Armed Services Committee and the first Democratic member of Congress to speak at the conference  said that vigorous testing of the missile defense program will instill the confidence of the American people in the system   Since coming to the United States Senate  Nelson has been a consistent advocate for missile defense  supporting  31 6 billion over the last four years           I  ve promoted vigorous testing of missile defense because any system we deploy should have the confidence of the Commander in Chief  Congress and the American people     said Nelson     There  s no argument that we need missile defense  the argument as far as I  m concerned  is about how we develop this system  test it  certify it and deploy it on land  at sea and in the air      Nelson believes wherever American forces are deployed  the U S  needs to ensure soldiers   safety from conventional and unconventional threats and he believes a tiered missile defense system can achieve this           Some argue that the cost of missile defense forces us to spend resources that should go toward improving homeland security     said Nelson     But this is wrong  we need to do both   The threat of a rogue state with nuclear capabilities is truly a threat to our homeland          CIA Director George Tenet stated publicly at a United States Senate Armed Services Committee hearing two years ago that North Korea has the capacity to reach the West Coast of the United States with a missile   Today  Nelson said    The U S  knows that North Korea is pursuing a nuclear program  we know that even if they don  t equip a missile with a nuclear warhead that they use  they could proliferate that technology to the highest bidder   And  it seems certain that if al Qaeda or another terrorist organization had nuclear capability  they would use it against Western interests   In the Middle East  Iran has nuclear ambitions that have not been deterred by the invasion of Iraq           Nelson also argued that missile defense can protect the United States from future political instability     For the moment  Pakistan  s nuclear stockpile is watched over by President Musharraf  but is there any doubt in the event of a coup we could face a very perilous situation from Pakistan     asked Nelson     Shouldn  t we have an insurance policy in the event of any of these worst case scenarios            Nelson  s primary concern as the U S  develops a missile defense system has always been about how often we test and the kind of testing we conduct     I  ve said it before and I  ll say it today     said Nelson     A scarecrow isn  t a scarecrow unless it actually scares crows   And a system that doesn  t work is not a deterrent             MORE     U S  Strategic Command in my home state of Nebraska is executive agent for missile defense     said Nelson   Combatant Commander  General Cartwright is the person who can recommend to the Secretary of Defense that the current land based system be certified operational     I  like all of you  want this to happen   In order for that to happen  Congress will want to know that our nation  s missile defense system has been sufficiently tested by Pentagon testers  not simply the people who developed the missile defense system   I think we need combat realistic testing and I will continue to push for that from my position on the Armed Services Committee     said Nelson         At a hearing last week at the Senate Armed Services Committee  General Cartwright said he wanted operationally realistic testing of the system   Nelson believes that the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation  DOT  at the Pentagon is the right person to determine that the system has been put through combat realistic paces     Developmental testing is vital  but it  s not sufficient by itself   Operational testing is needed to have confidence that the system will work effectively     Nelson told the audience       Nelson also emphasized diplomacy  s role as our first line of defense     Diplomacy first can deter an attack and in many respects is the greatest defense   The U S  also has the option of using pre emptive force and as we have shown in the past  we have the capability to respond if we detect an imminent threat     Missile defense isn  t just rockets  fuel and satellites  its diplomacy negotiation and partnership to prevent proliferation and to strengthen our position in the world     he said           30
