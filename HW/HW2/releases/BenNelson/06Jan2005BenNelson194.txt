                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  D C     Americans who contribute to the Asia tsunami disaster relief efforts this month will be able to deduct those contributions on their 2004 tax returns under a plan cosponsored by Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson and approved by the United States Senate today     Nelson cosponsored a proposal offered by Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa and Max Baucus of Montana that will  extend the period of time in which Americans can claim tax deductions for charitable donations to assist victims of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Southeast Asia on December 26        Americans are reaching out to help the victims of the tsunami in record proportions and hopefully this temporary tax deduction extension will encourage more Americans to contribute even more to relief efforts     said Senator Nelson    Every American will have until January 31 to contribute to the tsunami disaster relief efforts and claim the charitable deduction this spring on their tax returns         Under this proposal  taxpayers would be permitted to claim a tax deduction in tax year 2004 for donations made for tsunami disaster relief until Jan  31  2005  Under current law  taxpayers would have to wait until the spring of 2006 to claim a tax deduction for tsunami related gifts made after Dec  31  2004  The proposal would be limited to cash gifts made specifically for disaster relief      The House of Representatives must now adopt the measure and then it will be sent to the president to be signed into law       Note  Fact sheet attached      30       ASIAN TSUNAMI RELIEF CHARITABLE TAX INCENTIVE FACTS    Current Law on Charitable Contributions          Under current law  individuals that do not take the standard deduction may deduct up to 50  of their adjusted gross income  AGI  for contributions to charity          Corporations may deduct up to 10  of their AGI for contributions to charity          Both individuals and corporations are eligible to take the charitable deduction in the year that the contributions are made  In addition  individuals and charities may carry forward deductions for charitable giving up to five years  as long as the taxpayer exceeds the 50 or 10 percent limitation           The majority of taxpayers file their tax returns between February and April 15th every year      Need for Cash Aid to Tsunami Relief Efforts          In response to the continuing need for aid in the region President Bush has asked former Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush and William Jefferson Clinton to assist in raising funds from the private sector          Relief organizations on the ground have specifically asked for immediate cash assistance which saves money by eliminating shipping costs to transport goods from the U S  and allows cash to flow into local economies stimulating growth       Joint Resolution Proposal          The Senate Finance Committee has outlined a proposal that would allow taxpayers to claim a 2004 charitable tax deduction for cash gifts made to aid tsunami relief efforts during the month of January  2005           This proposal is similar to current law with respect to the rules governing Individual Retirement Accounts  IRA   which allow taxpayers to count certain contributions made in the new tax year for the prior tax year          The proposal represents a simple and cost effective way to encourage immediate cash contributions for life saving relief  while allowing taxpayers to claim a deduction today rather than next year          Under the proposal  taxpayers making charitable contributions in January 2005 for tsunami relief efforts would be able to choose whether to claim the deduction for the 2004 tax year or the 2005 tax year       30
