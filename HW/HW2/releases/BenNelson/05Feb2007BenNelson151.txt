                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             February 5  2007    With the U S  Senate debate on the resolution expressing opposition to the President  s plan to surge the level of troops in Iraq bogged down by procedural action  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson called for the Senate to overcome the procedural hurdles and begin the debate on the resolution       Senator Nelson is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee   He helped craft the pending resolution along with Senator John Warner of Virginia  Senator Susan Collins of Maine  Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and others  The Senate is scheduled to vote on whether or not to proceed to debate the Iraq Resolution today  Senator Nelson  s statement as delivered is below         Mr  President  let me begin by stating for the record and for my colleagues that this debate is not about support for the troops or support for their extraordinary work on the ground in Iraq         Our troops  the best fighting force in the history of the world  have performed admirably  honorably and successfully under extreme  unusual and dangerous conditions in Iraq  We are not here today to besmirch their efforts  their work or their sacrifice  To indicate otherwise is disingenuous and out of line         This is not the time or the place for political attacks   The President even made an offer to Congress  before a nationally televised audience on January 10th  that   if members have improvements that can be made  we will make them            This is a debate about a serious topic    what is the way forward in Iraq  How can we achieve a political solution without the additional loss of American lives         One of my colleagues has said over and over    this comes down to if you support an escalation or not    and   the American people deserve this debate            For me the question is  Will the Senate lead  Will the Senate express its opposition to the surge  I know that many don  t think passing a non binding resolution is leading  I know others say the resolution goes too far         I say that on an issue of this magnitude  an issue this important  it is critical for the Senate to speak with the strongest voice possible  Generating a revised resolution with broader appeal is putting our best foot forward in securing the strongest bipartisan vote possible         I am proud to have worked with Senator Warner  the most recent past chairman of the Armed Services Committee  and our colleague Senator Collins of Maine in this cause   They have both shown tremendous leadership on this issue as has Senator Levin  Biden and Hagel         But it seems that even when it comes to the lives of our troops    partisanship prevails  Here we are  after weeks of negotiations  after weeks of public proclamations  after weeks of consideration    we are about to witness the minority choose politics over progress   And this is after we revised our original resolution to address some of the concerns that were raised by both Democrats and Republicans         It s important that we point out that this is not simply about being opposed to a surge  It s about opposition to a surge to do what  To go into Baghdad    to go into the midst of sectarian violence  civil war  criminality  There is no opposition to continuing to support troops in al Anbar and even an increase in the troops to fight the bad guys in that location  But that is altogether different from going into Baghdad where our troops will be expected to be on the point and in harm s way in the midst of sectarian violence that is unheralded  unparalleled across our great world today  but in strong support of Iraq we must in fact do what we can to support Iraq but without putting our troops in the midst of that caldron         Now  the Baker Hamilton report made things very clear  and we ve established benchmarks as well that we should empower the Iraqi government to be able to do what it can to quell its own violence  We cannot win their civil war  We cannot stop the violence in Baghdad  Only a political solution achieved by the Iraqis will be able to do that         Mr  President  if we are to do our duty  if we are to exhibit leadership  let us begin by allowing a full debate on the resolutions we have pending    lets talk about the President  s plan to deploy American troops to the crossroads of civil war in Iraq   Let  s talk about holding the Iraqi government accountable for its responsibilities         I  m prepared to defend the resolution I offered with Senators Warner  Collins and Levin  I am prepared to vote on the McCain resolution  I am prepared for this debate because its time has come         So I ask my colleagues  if not now  When  If not now  do we wait for more troops to die before we oppose the president  s plan  If not now  do we wait for more violence  more unrest  and more danger for our troops before we act         Some have said the president deserves   one last chance    to succeed  How do we ask our troops to do again what has failed in the past    we  ve had other surges that have not succeeded for a variety of reasons not the least of which the Iraqis did not show up  What  s different this time  I hope we don  t look back on this as our last hurrah
