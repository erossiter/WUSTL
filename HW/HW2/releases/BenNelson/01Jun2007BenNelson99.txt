via email if they think those projects should be funded by the Senate Appropriations Committee        We hear a lot about opposition to the use of Congressional earmarks so I thought it would be good to invite Nebraskans to comment on these water projects before we actually fund them  to express concern or support   said Nelson  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   They can send me an email  and I will take their comments into consideration as we work the bill through the Appropriations Committee         Nebraskans interested in commenting can review the list of Nebraska water
