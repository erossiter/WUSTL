

Ben Nelson sent Secretary of Defense Robert Gates a letter asking him to fully fund the replacement of equipment lost by the National Guard while fighting the war against terrorism  The Administration will submit its defense budget to Congress on Monday       Our Guard members are voluntarily risking their lives for ours     said Nelson    And it  s unthinkable to send them into danger without the best appropriate protection        The Nebraska National Guard is short approximately 7 500 pieces   80 million worth  of equipment ranging from night vision goggles to tractor trailer trucks that have been destroyed  damaged  or left in Iraq       Our troops   lives are our primary responsibility     said Nelson    The president  s budget must address this dangerous equipment shortage  especially as the Pentagon continues to rely on Guard and Reserve troops to execute the war on terror        Earlier this week  Nelson joined Sens  Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Kit Bond  R MO  in re introducing the National Guard Empowerment Act  The bill would give the Guard more muscle within the Pentagon by elevating the Chief of the National Guard to a four star position among the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and it would give the National Guard Bureau budgetary power to research  validate and procure essential equipment for the Guard     Nelson is Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee and has pushed to replenish Guard equipment  defended the Guard against efforts to reduce end strength  pushed for better benefits for Guard personnel and prodded the Pentagon to clarify expected deployment schedules for the Guard  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Nelson will have an oversight role over the military budget     The text of Nelson  s letter to Sec  Gates follows        January 31  2007       The Honorable Robert Gates  Secretary    U S  Department of Defense    1000 Defense Pentagon    Washington  DC 20301     Dear Mr  Secretary     As the United States enters its fifth year of military support in Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF   our brave servicemembers continue to selflessly serve our nation   Fighting courageously alongside active duty servicemembers  the National Guard has played a vital role during this crucial time in our nation  s history   There is certainly no question whether members of the Guard are   weekend warriors      Rather  they serve full time when needed  and in return  I wholeheartedly expect the U S  Department of Defense  DoD  to support the National Guard missions at home and around the world   I request  therefore  that DoD fully fund equipment needs in the Fiscal Year 2008  FY08  DoD budget     Our increased dependence on these citizen soldiers for their service in OIF and OEF has  unfortunately  caused a severe equipment shortage  which will weaken the Guard  s ability to fulfill its missions safely and successfully   In my home state  for example  the Nebraska National Guard currently has a total equipment shortage valued at more than  80 million   This amount includes 7 500 pieces of equipment it needs and does not currently have   Last year  that shortage was 1 500 pieces of equipment totaling  35 million   Excessive shortages such as these endanger not only the success of the United States   missions  but also the lives of the brave men and women in the National Guard who rely upon DoD to send them to war with the equipment necessary to completing their duty safely     The National Guard  s equipment shortage has been exacerbated by units leaving equipment in Iraq after activation   As more and more units are called up for active duty  more equipment is being left behind in Iraq   In addition  at the request of DoD  state Guard units are completing additional pre mobilization training  which results in weapons shortages as equipment is shuffled among armories nationwide   Last year  the Senate unanimously approved legislation which Senator Lindsey Graham and I introduced calling upon DoD to fully fund the National Guard in order to make up for equipment shortages   Yet despite the overwhelming support of that bill  our National Guardsmen are still facing shortages     Furthermore  as you know  the National Guard  s role is not isolated to serving in OIF and OEF  it is also critical to domestic disaster relief and homeland defense operations   However  due to the equipment shortages caused by units   deployments abroad  the Guard units remaining in the United States have inadequate equipment with which to respond to domestic disasters   This month the Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that although the Army has pledged  21 billion through 2011 to ensure that all Guard units are modernized and deployable  the Army still has not indicated how much of that equipment will remain stateside   Last year  according to an article in National Journal  Lt  Gen  Steven Blum testified to Congress that two thirds of the Guard units in the United States are not combat ready   The National Guard cannot protect American citizens if DoD does not provide it with the equipment to do so   And our nation  s governors need to know that the Guard will be ready and able when called to respond to emergencies at home  as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan   Mr  Secretary  the National Guard must have the equipment it needs to respond to domestic disasters     In closing  I urge you to include  and fight for  full National Guard equipment funding in the FY08 defense budget   Should you or your staff need additional information  please contact me or my Defense policy advisor  Eric Pierce  at  202  224 6551     Thank you for your prompt consideration of this matter   I look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure the National Guard is fully funded so it may fulfill the missions it is called upon to do      Sincerely        E  Benjamin Nelson United States Senator
