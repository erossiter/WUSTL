deadly tsunami that flooded countries and killed hundreds of thousands of people in and around the Indian Ocean basin on December 26 should be aware they are eligible for immediate tax benefits as a result of their generosity  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson said today       Nelson joined a bipartisan group of Senators earlier this month to pass legislation  also adopted by the House of Representatives and signed into law by the president  which would allow taxpayers to claim a 2004 charitable tax deduction for cash gifts made in January 2005 to aid tsunami relief efforts         Today  Nelson sent a letter to more than 2100 churches in Nebraska asking local pastors to remind their congregations about the tax benefit for contributions  This is the first time in Nelson  s four years in the Senate that he has taken advantage of a mail privilege  known as the   franking privilege    that allows Members of Congress to send large  unsolicited mailings to constituents         Because of the enormous response from religious organizations to assist in the tsunami relief effort  I want to ensure that those making contributions understand that the charitable work they are doing right now can be deducted on their 2004 tax filings     said Nelson   The greatest source of America s generosity is not our government   It is the good heart of the American people and they should be aware that the tax benefits are extended until the end of January          Nelson says that the  350 million in aid pledged and the military resources provided by the United States government is only part of what Americans will contribute to the tsunami relief efforts          Individual charitable contributions will likely surpass the government contributions and this tax deduction extension is designed to encourage contributions now  to provide as much aid as possible as soon as possible     said Nelson        The Text of Senator Nelson  s letter is attached

been affected by the terrible loss of life and suffering caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in the region of the Bay of Bengal   Images of the destruction continue to stream into our homes from Sri Lanka  the Maldives  Thailand  Indonesia  as well as other impacted countries   Stories of orphaned children and shattered lives have touched all our hearts   Our prayers go out to the people who have lost so much to this series of disasters  Our hearts are also with the Americans who have lost loved ones in this tragedy       Our nation has committed military assets and made an initial commitment of  350 million for disaster relief   We are working with the United Nations and with governments around the world to coordinate the comprehensive international response   We are showing the compassion of our nation in the swift response   But the greatest source of America s generosity is not our government   It is the good heart of the American people   In the weeks since the tsunami struck  private citizens have contributed millions of dollars for disaster relief and reconstruction         Because of the enormous response from religious organizations to assist in this effort  I wanted to take a moment to share some information   Last week  Congress passed  and the President signed  a law to help encourage donations toward this effort   I thought it might be helpful for you and your congregation to know about this new law as this tragedy is discussed and decisions are made about donations toward this cause       The new law allows taxpayers to treat tsunami relief donations made during January 2005 as if the donation was made in the year 2004   This way  those taxpayers that itemize their deductions may claim this deduction on their 2004 tax returns  which most of us will file in the next few months  as opposed to waiting an entire year to claim the deduction on their 2005 tax returns    The contributions must be made specifically for the relief of victims in areas affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami   Taxpayers do not need to fill out any additional forms  rather  it should just be indicated in the check notation that the donation is meant to be used in the tsunami relief effort       I am hopeful this information is helpful to you as you discuss tsunami efforts with your congregation   If I can answer any questions or be of service to you  please do not hesitate to contact me         Thank you for the opportunity to spread this information   Please share it with all who may be interested       Sincerely       Ben Nelson
