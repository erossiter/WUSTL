Disjointed  Disconnected and Disassociated    October 30  2007   The United States must refocus on examining the progress of the Iraqi government on established benchmarks to determine the future of U S  involvement there  Nebraskas Senator Ben Nelson said today   In a speech delivered on the Senate Floor this morning  Nelson called on Congress and the Administration to bring the focus of the debate about Iraq back to Iraq  Nelson pushed for and played a critical role in establishing the eighteen benchmarks for progress the Administration is using to measure Iraqi political  economic and military progress  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Nelson negotiated the inclusion of the benchmarks in the most recent supplemental funding bill for the war     Nelson is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and has traveled to Iraq four times to meet with U S  troops and Iraqi political leaders  including twice this year  Nelson said during his visits to Iraq he delivered strong messages to Iraqs leaders that the cycle of dependence cannot continue indefinitely  Nelson does not support establishing a date certain for withdrawing U S  troops from Iraq and has instead offered a plan to transition the mission of our troops from battling sectarian violence to pursuing terrorists  protecting American assets and maintaining Iraqs border integrity   At this critical juncture of U S  policy toward Iraq  the Iraq policy toward the U S  seems disjointed  disconnected and disassociated  Nelson said in his remarks  The level of progress on the benchmarks is debatablewhat is undeniable is the fact that progress is needed on some of the most urgent issues to bring peace and stability in Iraq   Nelson continued  The Iraqi government has failed to enact a de Baathification law  the Parliament has failed to enact a law on equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources and revenues  and theyve failed to provide the three trained and ready brigades to support Baghdad operations  and the disarmament of the militias has not occurred  These are fundamental failures by a government that continues to expect the United States to invest in Iraq with our soldiers and our dollars and these failures are unacceptable  We cant continue on this path and cycle of Iraqi dependence on the United States   Nelsons entire floor speech as delivered is included below    30   Mr  President  I rise today to try to bring the focus of the debate about Iraq back to Iraq  specifically the Iraqi governments continuing failures to meet benchmarks for progress on political  military and security matters   For the past several weeks  the news out of Iraq has been consumed by coverage of the Blackwater security transgressions  To be sure  the allegations against Blackwater are serious and need to be addressed  Oversight needs to be tightened  Action should be taken to ensure that security needs are being met and force is used only when necessary    By no means do I believe we should do anything but hold Blackwater and its government overseers responsible for their actions  But what is happening here is the Iraqi government has successfully shifted the focus of the debate from their failures in meeting benchmarks for progress to the Blackwater security matter  We need to refocus   Everyone here remembers  and the American people remember this past spring during debate of the supplemental  the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans Care  Katrina Recovery  and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act  2007  Congress codified into law 18 benchmarks that were identified by the Iraqi government and the Bush Administration    As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I pushed to include benchmarks in this bill  Since returning from Iraq having spent Thanksgiving Day there with the troops in 2004  my second visit to our troops in Iraq  I began to call for the Iraqi government and U S  military leaders to establish a method of measuring progress on the stated goals of standing up the military and security forces and establishing a functioning government    During my third visit to our troops in Iraq in April of this year  I delivered a strong message to Iraqi leaders that they needed to show progress on an oil agreement  quelling sectarian violence and building a functioning government very quickly or the U S  would continue lose patience with the war    This supplemental presented an opportunity to send that message and codify it into law   It was the hope of the Senate to provide measurable benchmarks that could provide an outline on progress in Iraq  As part of the benchmarks requirement  Congress asked the White House to provide an assessment in July and September Congress also directed the GAO to provide its own assessment on the Iraqi benchmarks    In July  Congress received an assessment from the White House on the status of the 18 benchmarks At that time  the White House indicated that satisfactory progress on 8 of the benchmarks had been made  On the remaining ten benchmarks  the White House indicated that the Iraqi government had failed to make satisfactory progress   In September  the GAO review indicated that three benchmarks had been met  four had been partially met and eleven had not been met at all   In September  the White House provided its final assessment of the 18 benchmarks On the benchmarks  satisfactory progress had been made on 10  two more than in July  and that eight benchmarks still received an unsatisfactory rating  two less than July     Everyone here remembers that this is an important issue because of the importance of making positive gains by the Iraqi government   I visited Iraq for a fourth time in September  just after General David Patraeus testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee but before the benchmark reports were issued  Little had changed  Iraqs political leaders were still entrenched  there was very little hope for progress on the benchmarks and I delivered the message that time was running out on the blank check policy the Administration seems to have implemented in Iraq    At this critical juncture of U S  policy toward Iraq  the Iraq policy toward the U S  seems disjointed  disconnected and disassociated   The level of progress on the benchmarks is debatablewhat is undeniable is the fact that progress is needed on some of the most urgent issues to bring peace and stability in Iraq   The Iraqi government has failed to enact a de Baathification law  the Parliament has failed to enact a law on equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources and revenues  and theyve failed to provide the three trained and ready brigades to support Baghdad operations  and the disarmament of the militias has not occurred    These are fundamental failures by a government that continues to expect the United States to invest in Iraq with our soldiers and our dollars and these failures are unacceptable  We cant continue on this path and cycle of Iraqi dependence on the United States    As we prepare to deal with another supplemental  bringing the total off budget additional war spending this year to just under 200 billion dollars  making total off budget spending on the war in Iraq nearly  500 billion  off budget spending in Iraq to nearly half a trillion dollars   we need to refocus on what is happening in Iraq  We need to reexamine these benchmarks  Those who called for another six months to allow more progress got what they wanted  The question is when will we get what we want  When will Iraq step up and take over  When will we be able to bring most of our troops home  When will the cycle of dependence end   The answers to these questions lie in the benchmarks we established  Progress on the benchmarks can give us a timeframe for the future  Lack of progress on the benchmarks could extend our commitment indefinitely if we allow it to continue    Mr  President  We need to refocus on the Iraqi governments progress on the benchmarks  and there lack of it  If they had made more rapid progress we wouldnt need private security outfits protecting American assets and personnel  If they continue to fail to make progress and meet the benchmarks  we will need to fundamentally reassess what our future role might be in Iraq  We cant sustain this pace forever  Our soldiers deserve better  Our taxpayers deserve better  And the Iraqi people deserve better from their own government than the failed leadership they have shown to date   Thank you Mr  President  I yield the floor
