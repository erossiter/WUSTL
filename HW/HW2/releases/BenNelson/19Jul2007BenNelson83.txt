                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Press Release    July 19  2007         NELSON STATEMENT ON HIS AMENDMENT TO PRESERVE OPTIONS FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILTY FOR AMERICA S FAMILIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              July 19  2007   Today  Nebraska s Senator Ben Nelson offered an amendment to higher education legislation to preserve a highly successful and affordable college loan program that helps America s families send their children to college       Nelson made the following floor statement  as prepared  upon introduction of his amendment        Mr  President  I rise today alongside Senator Burr on an issue of great importance for America s middle class  the affordability of higher education   Even at the University of Nebraska  which offers a quality and cost effective education  the average graduate holds  16 872 in debt as they enter the working world   For many students across the nation  the picture is even bleaker as students graduate with the equivalent of a home mortgage   Over the last 10 years the problem has grown worse and average tuition and fees at four year public and private institutions increased by 38           The Class of 2008 will be the largest high school class in U S  history  with nearly 3 2 million high school graduates facing the decision of whether or not they can afford to go to college   A key part of that calculation will be the financing options at their disposal  including grants  federal loans  and private financing   I applaud Senator Kennedy for leading the charge in investing additional federal dollars in Pell Grants  which provide need based aid to 5 3 million Americans each year   An estimated 90  of Pell Grant recipients considered to be dependent upon their parents had family income below  40 000   This provides essential support for many underprivileged families but only starts to address student need  as loans are often required to supplement this aid and many middle class families who are ineligible for Pell grants are left searching for financing solutions        In a time of mounting challenges for America s middle class  I am urging caution and moderation in cutting funding for the Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  Program which 8 out of 10 schools relies on to serve their students  financial needs   The federal government partners with loan providers to ensure that the student loan marketplace is fully capitalized  and students have access to affordable higher education financing options    This market based approach has solidified access for student loans  preserved attentiveness to the needs of borrowers and schools  while providing valuable discounts to middle class families        That said  our amendment does preserve significant cuts to the student loan industry   However  it does so in a tempered and moderate manner which bridges the desires of members  on the one hand  to increase need based aid for low income families and  on the other hand  to avoid increasing loan costs for millions of families and doing irreparable  significant harm to the public private FFEL program   In addition  our amendment preserves the maximum Pell grant levels established in the Higher Education Access Act and does not reduce financial aid for students          Many will come and speak about past grievances about a select few in the student loan industry who have abused the program   I am as troubled as anyone else by these past actions  and applaud the HELP Committee for taking action in the Higher Education reauthorization bill to make sure that these problems do not occur again   That said  the federal family education loan program has afforded young Americans the opportunity to attend college for over 40 years  and is a critical part of making college a reality for many in the middle class   Over the life of a loan  the FFEL program delivers  on average   2 800 in discounts and savings to middle class Americans   Amazingly often  we speak about the magnitude of student loan cuts as if they will cost nothing   Americans rely on the FFEL program and I encourage members to ask their FFEL schools how valuable the program is for students in their state        Our amendment tempers the FFEL cut  preserving  15 65 billion in reductions to lenders   Reports are circulating that the Nelson Burr Amendment would set aside less money for Pell Grants  what has not been relayed accurately is that the Nelson Burr Amendment increases grant aid to the exact same funding levels as the Higher Education Access Act   The amendment does not degrade the amount dedicated to Pell grants  rather it uses a different baseline from which the CBO cost calculations are made   We assume a  4 600 Pell grant appropriation which was accommodated in the budget resolution  the same budget resolution which created these reconciliation instructions   This assumption is less than the House of Representatives  Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations bill which funds a  4 700 Pell grant maximum         Our focus is on the end result for students   A vote for Nelson Burr not only assures that the neediest families see the same increase in Pell Grants but also helps mitigate the damage to competitive student loans that deliver savings to middle class families and students  many of whom are ineligible for Pell grants and other aid            Let me make my point clear                    8 out of 10 schools rely on the FFEL program                    We must proceed with caution and moderation in making these cuts                     These cuts directly impact students and middle income Americans  pocket books                    Our amendment does not reduce student aid or the maximum Pell grants set out in this bill          I urge colleagues to join me in supporting the Nelson Burr amendment
