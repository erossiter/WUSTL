Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson to President Bush Tuesday in advance of the President  s State of the Union Address next week       As the President prepares to outline his priorities in his State of the Union Address  I wanted to share with him three issues the people of Nebraska have told me they consider to be of primary importance to them in hopes he will include these items in his remarks     said Nelson     The three priorities highlighted in Nelson  s letter are  Taking care of our National Guard  Expanding access to health insurance  Strengthening our border security     The letter asks the President to consult with Congress before making any of the rumored changes that might reduce troop levels within the National Guard  It also asks the President to address the need to replenish shortages of National Guard equipment  Nearly  35 million of National Guard equipment needs to be replaced in Nebraska alone       The Guard plays a critical role in defending our nation in war and at home during natural disasters or other emergencies     said Nelson    And they deserve to be as prepared and protected as possible         The letter also requests that the President outline a plan for making health care more affordable and more accessible  More than 40 million Americans live without health care coverage and Nelson believes those who want health care should have access to it     Nelson joined with Senator Mike Enzi  R WY  to offer a plan that will give small businesses more options and more economic leverage to offer health insurance to their employees    It  s unacceptable that of the 30 000 small businesses in Nebraska  20 000 are still unable to keep up with runaway costs of health insurance and offer their employees health benefits     said Nelson     The final priority in Nelson  s letter asks the President to address the problem of illegal immigration in his speech    The problem of illegal immigration is only worsening with each day that passes and our borders are not secured     said Nelson     Nelson has offered bipartisan legislation that solves one challenge at a time and begins where the challenge begins  at the border    Until we stop the flood of illegal immigration across our borders  it will be increasingly difficult to address other issues associated with illegal immigration  including amnesty programs     said Nelson     President Bush  s State of the Union Address is scheduled for January 31  2006  The text of Senator Nelson  s letter to the president is attached     January 23  2006    The Honorable George W  Bush President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W  Washington  DC 20500    Dear Mr  President     I write in advance of your State of the Union address to encourage you to address several key issues which are legislative priorities for me this year and are critical to the continued success  security  and economic growth of our country     First  I am very concerned about proposed cuts to National Guard troop levels and the ongoing problem of equipment shortages for our current Guard members here and those serving in Iraq   The National Guard  s duty is to protect our citizens at home and our interests abroad  and it is critical for the Guard to have the requisite personnel and equipment to meet its operational needs   I urge you and the U S  Department of Defense to engage in full consultation with Congress and our nation  s governors to ensure we are meeting our commitment to the National Guard     Second  it is critical that we take immediate action to make health care more affordable for small businesses and their employees   Health insurance premiums for small businesses are rising at double digit rates of inflation  and small businesses and working families cannot keep up with the runaway costs   I have introduced bipartisan legislation to address this crisis by allowing America  s small businesses to band together to offer group health insurance to reduce costs   It is essential that we act on implementing solutions to the problem of skyrocketing health insurance costs     Finally  I hope you will address immigration reform   I have introduced legislation  also bipartisan  to rigorously strengthen our border security to stop the flood of illegal immigration across our borders   By focusing on border security first  and doing so in a way which will significantly bolster our ability to stop illegal immigration  we can then move toward addressing comprehensive immigration reform and promoting legal immigration     Mr  President  I look forward to listening to your State of the Union address  and I do hope to hear that you plan to focus on these and other areas vital to the future of the United States of America     Sincerely      E  Benjamin Nelson United States Senator EBN act
