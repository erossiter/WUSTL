                                                         Press Release    June 15  2007         NELSON CO SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO PROMOTE NURSING  PHYSICAL THERAPY EDUCATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       June 15  2007  Nebraskas Senator Ben Nelson yesterday joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to expand educational opportunities in the areas of nursing and physical therapy    We currently face critical shortages in both the civilian and military health care systems for qualified nurses and physical therapists  said Nelson  Congress has taken steps to encourage students to enter these careers  but we now need the faculty and resources to train all these prospective health care providers    The U S  Department of Labor has designated nursing and physical therapy as occupations for which there is a national shortage  set only to increase as our aging population requires increasingly complex care  The American Association of Colleges and Nursing  AACN  reported that 42 886 qualified applicants were denied admission to nursing baccalaureate and graduate programs in 2006  with faculty shortages cited as a main hurdle     Nebraska  in particular  is experiencing a serious nursing shortage that will become acute in the years ahead  According to the University of Nebraska Medical Center  College of Nursing  the Nebraska shortage of registered nurses is predicted to grow from the current shortage of 6  to 30  by the year 2020  Yet the UNMC College of Nursing turns away 30  of qualified applicants each year because of lack of faculty  With an average age of 53  the UNMC College of Nursing faculty will be retiring in record numbers in the next 10 years  This problem is aggravated because Nebraska only has 16 nursing schools  a low number compared to other states    Shortages of physical therapists are just as severe  According the Rural Health Advisory Commission in the Nebraska Office of Rural Health  in 2007  29 of Nebraskas rural counties  almost one third of the 93 total counties  were identified as state designated shortage areas relative to the availability of physical therapy services    Nelson joined Senators Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico  Norm Coleman of Minnesota  Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas  and John Kerry of Massachusetts in introducing legislation to help alleviate these shortages  The Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act of 2007 would    Establish grants for nursing schools to provide them with the ability to enhance recruitment and retention of faculty  with the overall goal of increasing enrollment and graduation rates   Expand learning opportunities by creating nursing and physical therapy distance education pilot projects   Create geriatric career awards for nursing faculty to specialize in clinical geriatrics    As Dean of a college of nursing  I am looking at the elements of a perfect storm  an aging faculty  a wave of retirements in the next decade  increasing competition in recruiting new faculty  a small pipeline of masters and doctoral students who are willing to consider a teaching career given poor teaching salaries  and a mandate to accept ever more applicants into undergraduate nursing programs that are chronically under funded by state legislatures  said Virginia Tilden  Dean of the UNMC College of Nursing  I am very grateful to Senator Nelson for his foresight in introducing this important legislation that will help divert this storm    The demand for physical therapists will continue to rise due to the aging of the population  the expanding size of the elderly population  the increased number of individuals living with chronic diseases  and the emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention  said Kyle P  Meyer  Associate Dean  School of Allied Health Professions  UNMC  By promoting the development of distance education pilot projects  this legislation offers a resourceful approach for increasing accessibility to physical therapy education for students from rural communities  along with the promise of increasing physical therapist practitioners for underserved rural areas   Our population is getting older and there are greater and greater strains on our health care resources  Unfortunately  the practitioner supply is not meeting the demands  said Nelson  This legislation will provide an important boost to our efforts to ensure that we have the nurses and physical therapists we need to care for patients
