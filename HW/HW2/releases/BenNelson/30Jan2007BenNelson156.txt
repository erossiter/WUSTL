bipartisan legislation to empower the National Guard within the Pentagon and to strengthen the Guard  s ability to respond to emergencies both at home and abroad     Introduction of the National Guard Empowerment Act of 2007 comes the day before a hearing focusing on the bill  by the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve   Leahy and Bond  who co chair the Senate  s National Guard Caucus  first offered the legislation last year  Nelson is the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee with oversight on military personnel matters     Multiple and extended deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and deployments in response to domestic emergencies like Hurricane Katrina and western wildfires have depleted National Guard equipment stocks and stretched its personnel   The Leahy Bond Nelson legislation would give the National Guard a seat at the table in the Pentagon where deployment  strategic  economic and personnel decisions are made  It would enhance coordination among military leaders and Governors and local elected officials during emergencies  The Act would specifically give the Guard more muscle within the Pentagon by elevating the Chief of the National Guard to a four star position among the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and it would give the National Guard Bureau budgetary power to research  validate and procure essential equipment for the Guard       The National Guard has undergone a tremendous transformation since September 11  The Pentagon has relied on Guard personnel and resources to execute military operations in Iraq  Afghanistan and around the world     Said Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson    The Guard is no longer a strategic reserve force  it  s now an operational force  Elevating the Guard leader to the Joint Chief level is long overdue           This drive to empower the Guard is gaining momentum in Congress     said Leahy     Since 9 11 we have been asking the Guard to do more and more  and they have superbly handled their dual role at home and abroad   But strains are showing in the system   The Guard is a 21st Century military organization that has to operate under a 20th Century bureaucracy   The Guard  s ability to help the nation is limited only by the resources  authorities  and responsibility we give it   Let us put the trust in the men and women of the Guard that they have deserved and earned  by giving them the seat at the table that they need         As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Nelson has pushed to replenish Guard equipment  defended the Guard against efforts to reduce end strength  pushed for better benefits for Guard personnel and prodded the Pentagon to clarify expected deployment schedules for the Guard      In Nebraska  the Guard is short more than 7500 pieces of equipment that would cost nearly  80 million to replace      The Guard empowerment bill has been endorsed by The National Guard Association  the Adjutants General Association and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard     U S  House of Representatives Government Reform Committee Chairman Tom Davis  R Va   and Representative Gene Taylor  D Miss      who co chair the House Guard and Reserve Components
