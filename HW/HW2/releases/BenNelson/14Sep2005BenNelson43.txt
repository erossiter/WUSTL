and other grant programs used to fight meth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON  D C     The U S  Senate today passed unanimously an amendment that restores funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  JAG  program  The amendment is cosponsored by Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson and was offered by Senators Mark Dayton of Minnesota and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia        The amendment  adopted as part of the FY 2006 State  Justice  and Commerce spending bill  would restore the grant funding to the Fiscal Year 2003 level          Our state and local law enforcement officials are in a constant struggle against the scourge of meth and other illegal drugs and listening to them over the years is why I have consistently supported funding the fight against meth     said Senator Nelson    Recent federal budgets have offered cuts in funding to fight meth even as the problem grows nationally  We shouldn  t be reducing funds to local law enforcement while we continue to ask them to do more in the areas of homeland security and protecting our neighborhoods            The Byrne Grant program targets the demand and supply of illegal drugs  including meth   It allows Nebraska law enforcement agencies to acquire new personnel  equipment  training  technical assistance  and information systems  and to provide services for the victims   It also provides critical funding to Nebraska  s 9 regional drug task forces tasked with combating the epidemic of meth trafficking and production in local communities         Mark Overman  member of the WING Task Force in Scottsbluff said    This is good news for every task force in Nebraska   With a very serious methamphetamine problem  the cuts to these task forces in recent years meant fewer officers dealing with this very significant problem   This restoration of Byrne money will be very important to add resources where they are needed   We are very appreciative of Senator Nelson  s work on this in addition to the entire Nebraska congressional delegation           Chief Thomas Warren of the Omaha Police Department said    The funds provided by the Byrne   Justice Assistance Grants enable State and Local agencies to implement comprehensive strategies that include crime prevention  intervention and enforcement components   This financial assistance enhances our ability to reduce crime and violence  drug distribution and gang activity             The Byrne program is critical in assisted funding to the State of Nebraska s nine local multi jurisdictional drug task forces which covers approximately 70  of the Nebraska s 93 counties and one statewide task force  As a result of the task force operations  an average of 5 000 individuals are arrested per year in Nebraska for illegal drug activities   The majority of these cases involve methamphetamine  Methamphetamine is found in the cities and rural areas Nebraska  and causes health and environmental problems   In addition  the Byrne program provides critical funding to keep Nebraska law enforcement officers trained in investigating methamphetamine cases     said Michael E  Behm  Executive Director of the Nebraska Crime Commission        Nebraska has used the Byrne funds to develop and operate 9 multi jurisdictional drug task forces  training for law enforcement officers  implement and upgrade the State s Automated Fingerprint Identification System  AFIS   support for the operation of rural Drug Courts  develop and implement a comprehensive treatment program for drug offenders within the State Dept  of Corrections  train law enforcement officers  develop and operate a Drug Prosecution Unit in the Attorney General s office  and to develop and operate the computerized Nebraska Criminal Justice Information System        According to the Nebraska Crime Commission  NCC   in 2004 Nebraska received  3 6 million in Byrne funds to subgrant to state and local entities for fighting meth and other purposes   The NCC award for 2005 was 2 1 million  As a result of the task force operations  an average of 5 000 individuals are arrested per year for illegal drug activities   The majority of the arrests involve methamphetamine        Additionally  on Friday  also as part of the CJS Appropriations bill  the Combat Meth Act was approved by the Senate   Many states  including Nebraska  have passed laws trying to address the meth problem   Because meth can be made with the use of over the counter drugs that contain the ingredient pseudoephedrine  eg  cold  sinus medicines   many of these laws have tried to limit and or make it more difficult to purchase pseudoephedrine products   The Combat Meth Act will set a federal minimum for the treatment of pseudoephedrine products by placing them behind the counter  requiring a signature and identification for purchases  and setting a monthly limit of 7 5 grams per person          As a cosponsor of this legislation  Senator Nelson sought to make changes that would create protections for rural consumers   The result is a provision that would allow the DEA and States to develop alternative procedures to continue to allow cold medicine to be sold at retail stores without pharmacies and in rural areas which meet appropriate security criteria    Additionally  the Combat Meth Act authorizes more funding for to help fight meth  including enforcement  training and research dollars        Once the Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations bill passes the full Senate it will go to a conference committee between the House and the Senate
