                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON  D C     Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson has made preserving our rural way of life a priority in the Senate and this week he has introduced two bills designed to help rural communities comply with the federal unfunded mandate on arsenic in drinking water and expand economic opportunity through alternative crop production     The bills are part of a larger series of bills he will propose to improve the economy  increase access to health care  reduce the impact of unfunded mandates  and combat methamphetamine in rural areas       So much can be done do preserve and improve our rural way of life     said Senator Nelson    My proposals are designed to take incremental steps and offer straightforward solutions to some of the economic  health and crime challenges facing small rural communities        Yesterday  Nelson introduced S  41  the Rural Community Arsenic Relief Act  RCARA  of 2005  to help rural communities that are facing burdensome and in some cases crippling costs to comply with an Environmental Protection Agency requirement to reduce levels of arsenic in drinking water from the current 50 parts per billion  ppb  to a new standard of 10 ppb     In Nebraska  the estimated statewide cost to meet the new 10 ppb rule is  120 million to  176 million  No community in Nebraska exceeds the current standard for arsenic in drinking water  50ppb   but 52 communities do not meet the new lower standard     The EPA has offered no financial assistance to communities to meet this unfunded federal mandate  The new EPA arsenic rule requires all communities to meet the 10 ppb standard by January 1  2006     Nelson joined with Senators Pete Domenici  NM  and Larry Craig  ID  to offer this bill that will allow small rural communities with populations of up to ten thousand more time to meet the EPA arsenic requirement  It extends the deadline for compliance from 2006 to 2016  giving rural communities more options in meeting the EPA  s rule  It also institutes a graduating scale for compliance  setting more attainable goals over the time of the extension  Specifically  the legislation outlines to following deadlines for compliance     January 1  2007  not more than 50 parts per billion     January 1  2010  not more than 35 parts per billion     January 1  2012  not more than 30 parts per billion     January 1  2014  not more than 20 parts per billion     January 1  2016  not more than 10 parts per billion        Giving rural communities more time to meet this unfunded mandate and setting incremental goals for reducing arsenic in drinking water will give the communities more options for meeting the EPA  s requirement     said Nelson    Nelson also will introduce this week a simple solution to a federal obstacle preventing producers from exploring alternative crops  He will introduce a bill that will amend the 2002 Farm Bill to remove chicory from the fruit and vegetable  FAV  planting prohibition on Direct and Counter Cyclical Program  DCP  base acres   With removal of the FAV prohibition  there would be a potentially dramatic increase in planted acres of chicory       Nebraska and Wyoming farmers are open to pursuing alternative crops  like chicory   These crops can create new revenue streams and help diversify agriculture production  We simply have to give farmers more options for diversifying agriculture if we expect them to survive     said Nelson    This is a very simple and straightforward way to expand opportunity for farmers and ranchers to explore alternative crops and their potential         Currently  the only chicory production facility in the Western Hemisphere  U S  Chicory  is located in Nebraska   Nelson has pushed alternative crops before by promoting sugar beet and hard white winter wheat production in Nebraska   Nelson has worked with Nebraska agriculture producers in crafting this legislation   This legislation does not yet have a bill number     Nelson introduced both RCARA and the chicory bill last Congress      30
