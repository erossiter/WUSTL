                                                                                                    WASHINGTON  D C    Senators Norm Coleman  R MN  and Ben Nelson  D NE  today announced legislation to create a bipartisan independent commission to recommend reforms to strengthen the ethics  disclosure and transparency requirements governing the relationship between members of Congress and lobbyists and restore public confidence in the legislative process  The Commission to Strengthen Confidence in Congress  CSCC   modeled after the 9 11 Commission  will be comprised of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats and will be chosen by both the House and Senate leadership of both parties  The Commission will issue its first report containing findings  conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures on July 1  2006  with annual reports thereafter  The Commission will also be given the ability to hold hearings in order to carry out its duties        In light of the recent scandals involving members of Congress and the lobbying community  we have witnessed an erosion of public trust and confidence in our government     said Coleman    In its wake  many in Congress have rushed forward with a range of proposals   While I support the adoption of immediate measures to improve transparency  such as the McCain Lieberman bill  I believe we also need long term reforms that can only be achieved from the outside looking in  Through this commission  we will develop a comprehensive reform agenda using a group of respected individuals outside the institution to conduct a thorough and bipartisan review and offer constructive recommendations to the House and Senate            There is a crisis of confidence in how Americans feel about Congress that has been exacerbated by developments in recent years regarding abuses of Congressional ethics rules     said Senator Nelson     In order to adequately address this crisis in confidence we need an independent review of the rules and laws regulating the conduct of Members of Congress and lobbyists  The Commission we are proposing will achieve that goal        The independent Commission will consist of five Republicans and five Democrats  none of whom may be sitting members of Congress  The chairman and vice chairman will be appointed by the Majority and Minority Leader of the Senate in consultation with the Majority and Minority Leader of the House  To fill the remaining eight positions  Senate Republican leadership  Senate Democratic leadership  House Republican leadership and House Democratic leadership will each select two commissioners respectively  The Commissioners will be a combination of former members of Congress and other independent voices  including  academics  historians  public relations executives  and other experts       The Commission  s responsibilities will be to review ideas and to provide a series of recommendations to Congress on how to reform itself to best address the concerns of the American people     Coleman    This Commission has the historic opportunity to provide a roadmap for Congress that will help renew and reinvigorate the world  s leading governmental institution  This will encourage public discussions and debate on reforms and help restore the public  s confidence in their elected leaders          Independent commissions have the ability to do the kind of careful intense scrutiny and make the tough assessments that this growing crisis in confidence requires  The Commission will have the opportunity to offer real reforms based on careful analysis and provide Congress with a course to begin rebuilding the American people  s trust in their government     said Senator Nelson     Specifically  this bill will charge the Commission with following responsibilities           Evaluate and report the effectiveness of current Ethics requirements  if penalties are enforced and sufficient and make recommendations for new penalties         Weigh the need for improved ethical conduct with the need for lawmakers to have access to expertise on public policy issues          Determine and report minimum standards relating to official travel for Members of Congress and staff          Evaluate the range of gifts given to Members of Congress and staff  and determine and report the effects on public policy and make recommendations for limits on gifts         Evaluate and report the effectiveness and transparency of disclosure laws and recommendations for improvements          Assess and report the effectiveness of the ban on Member of Congress and staff from lobbying their former office for one year and make recommendations for altering the time frame          Make recommendations to improve the process whereby Members of Congress can earmark priorities in Appropriations Acts  while still preserving Congressional power of the purse         Evaluate the use of public and privately funded travel by Members of Congress and staff  violations of Congressional rules governing travel and make recommendations on limiting travel          Investigate and report to Congress on its findings  conclusions  and any recommendations for reform
