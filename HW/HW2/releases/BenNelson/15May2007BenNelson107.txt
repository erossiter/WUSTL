introduced the Full Service Community Schools Act of 2007  S  1391 and HR  2323   a bill to expand the number of full service community schools that coordinate educational and social service programs for students and families in collaboration with community based organizations and public private partnerships         The Full Service Community Schools Act of 2007 will help schools become a one stop shop for the needs of students and families   said Senator Nelson   Community leaders  educators and parents will work together  using the additional resources provided by this legislation  to support enterprising instruction  public health  job training and overall community and parental engagement         Education is often referred to as the  great equalizer in a democratic society   but classroom education is only a piece of the puzzle when it comes to ensuring that all children succeed   stated Rep  Hoyer   Full service community schools take an innovative  big picture  approach to educating America s children by utilizing community based public private partnerships that provide for the seamless integration of academic  development  family  and health services to children and their families  I am proud to introduce the Full Service Community Schools Act of 2007 along with Senator Ben Nelson to encourage these crucial partnerships and ensure the best use of resources to help children learn and families and communities thrive        The Full Service Community Schools Act would make grants available to local partnerships between school districts  community based organizations and state collaboratives for purposes of coordinating educational and social service programs at a full service school site  These services may include  early childhood programs  literacy reading programs for youth and families  parenting education activities  community service  job training career counseling services  nutrition services  primary health and dental care  and mental health preventive and treatment services       The concept grew from a pilot program that began in 1999 in Lincoln   By 2001  14 schools in the Lincoln Public School system had started Community Learning Centers with funding from the Lincoln Public Schools Foundation  21st Century Community Learning Center  and matching resources from community based organizations   Today there are 23 Community Learning Centers in the Lincoln Public Schools system        Lincoln Public Schools has seen a direct and powerful impact on the educational development of our students who have had the opportunity to participate in our Community Learning Centers   said Susan Gourley  Superintendent  Lincoln Public Schools    I am very pleased that Senator Nelson is assisting schools throughout the country by supporting legislation that would provide additional opportunities for students to participate in full service community schools before and after the regular school day  Lincoln Public Schools would like to thank Senator Nelson for his continued commitment to public education and his support of cutting edge programs        Nelson and Hoyer s legislation would authorize  200 million for Fiscal Year 2008  with 75 percent of the funds allocated for local grants  20 percent to state grants  and the remaining funds used for technical assistance and evaluation       The Act also specifies that grants may be allocated to state educational agencies that collaborate with at least two other state government agencies to plan  coordinate and expand the development of full service community schools  Grants can also be used to provide technical assistance and training at full service community schools as well as collect and evaluate data about their progress        The legislation also creates an Advisory Committee  composed of representatives from the Departments of Justice  Agriculture  Health and Human Services  and Labor  to consult with the Secretary of Education on the development and implementation of full service community schools   The committee will identify strategies to improve the coordination of federal programs that are part of full service community schools  consult with local and state grantees  and issue an annual report to Congress        For more information see the one page summary of the Full Service Community Schools Act of 2007
