                                                                                                     WASHINGTON  D C     Federal subsides that encourage air carriers to service rural communities are once again being threatened by cuts proposed in the Administration  s 2006 budget and Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson is working to preserve that air service       Senator Nelson and several colleagues from rural states sent a letter today to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee requesting that the Fiscal Year 2006 budget resolution protect commercial air service to rural communities          The Essential Air Service provides needed support to rural communities to keep them connected to the Nation  s air transportation system     said Senator Nelson    This air service support provides a vital economic lifeline to these smaller communities and is important to preserving rural communities and the rural way of life          The President  s Fiscal Year  FY  2006 budget would eliminate commercial air service to 27 communities and require others to pay up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain their commercial air service  Under the President  s budget  the communities of Alliance  Chadron  Grand Island  Kearney  McCook  North Platte and Scottsbluff in Nebraska all would be required to come up with matching funds to maintain commercial air service to their cities         Specifically  the budget would require communities less than 210 miles to a large or medium hub to provide 25  in matching funds to keep their commercial air service  According data from the U S  Department of Transportation  the communities of Kearney and Grand Island would fall within this provision  The budget would require communities more than 210 miles from a large or medium hub to provide a 10  match  The communities of North Platte  McCook  Scottsbluff  Chadron and Alliance would fall within this provision        According to data provided by the U S  Department of Transportation  under this budget Kearney would be required to pay approximately  300 000 per year to maintain its commercial air service  Grand Island    300 000  Chadron  54 000  North Platte  87 000  McCook  150 000  Alliance  54 000  and Scottsbluff  49 000       The President  s budget only provides  50 million in funding for the EAS program for FY 2006  This is less than half of the level of funding that Congress provided for EAS in FY 2005  The letter to the Budget Committee requests  102 million in EAS funding for FY 2006  which is the level the program was funded at in FY2005          Maintaining the level of funding for the Essential Air Service will allow these rural airports more time to recover passenger levels to pre September 11 levels     said Nelson     Passenger levels across the airline industry suffered after September 11  including the airlines that serve rural communities          In addition to the letter to the Budget Committee  Senator Nelson is an original cosponsor of S  217  which would repeal a mandatory cost sharing program for communities that are part of the EAS program  The mandatory cost sharing had been enacted in the 2003 FAA reauthorization bill  Language was included in both the FY 2004 and FY 2005 appropriations bills barring implementation of any cost sharing for EAS communities        Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air service before airline deregulation continue to receive scheduled service    Without EAS  many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all       The letter was signed by Senators Jeff Bingaman  NM   Jay Rockefeller  WV   Orin Hatch  UT   Hillary Clinton  NY   Olympia Snowe  ME   Byron Dorgan  ND   Susan Collins  ME   Pat Leahy  VT   Dick Durbin  IL   Debbie Stabenow  MI   Mark Dayton  MN   Barak Obama  IL   Tim Johnson  SD   Jim Jeffords  VT   Charles Schumer  NY   and Tom Harkin  IA    A copy of the text of the letter to the Senate Budget Committee is attached                                      February 18  2005      The Honorable Judd Gregg  Chairman  Committee on the Budget  624 Dirksen Building  Washington  DC  20510        The Honorable Kent Conrad  Ranking Member  Committee on the Budget   624 Dirksen Building    Washington  DC 20510          Gentlemen                  We are writing respectfully to request that the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution not include any provision that would eliminate commercial air service to communities that participate in the Department of Transportation  s Essential Air Service Program  We also request that funding for the EAS program be maintained at least at the same  102 million level as for the current fiscal year                  Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air service before deregulation continue to receive scheduled service    Without EAS  many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all      The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial air service to around 100 communities in thirty six states   EAS supports an additional 37 communities in Alaska   Because of increasing costs and the continuing financial turndown in the aviation industry  particularly among commuter airlines  about 37 additional communities have been forced into the EAS program since 9 11 2001        The proposed changes to EAS in the FY06 budget would eliminate commercial air service to 27 communities and require others to pay up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain their commercial air service   A list of the affected communities is attached       We urge you to preserve the Essential Air Service Program in the FY06 budget resolution                                                                   Sincerely          30
