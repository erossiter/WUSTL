                                                         Press Release    September 13  2006         NELSON FLOOR STATEMENT ON  6 5B IN DROUGHT ASSISTANCE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              MR  NELSON  WELL THANK YOU  MR  PRESIDENT  FIRST OF ALL  I D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE COSPONSORS  SENATORS TALENT  LEAHY  OBAMA  DURBIN  DAYTON  SCHUMER  AND CLINTON ARE ALL    ALL ASKED TO BE ORIGINAL COSPONSORS OF MY AMENDMENT  MR  PRESIDENT  I RISE TODAY TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO H R  4954 THAT LL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED EMERGENCY RELIEF TO FAREWELLS  RANCHERS  AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN RURAL AMERICA THAT TODAY AND FOR SOMETIME HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THE DEAF STATISTICKING IMPACTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS THE LONG RUNNING DROUGHT IN MY HOME STATE OF NEBRASKA       A FEW YEARS AGO I NAMED THE DROUGHT  DROUGHT DAVID  TO MAKE THE POINT THAT A DROUGHT IS A NATURAL DISASTER IN MANY WAYS JUST LIKE HURRICANES OR FLOODS AND TORNADOES  THAT SHOULD BE TREATED BY CONGRESS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE DISASTERS  CONGRESS PROVIDES EMERGENCY RELIEF TO THOSE THAT HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH DEVASTATING HURRICANES AND THERE S NO EXCUSE FOR NOT HELPING FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND BUSINESSES SUFFERING FROM THIS NATURAL DISASTER       UNFORTUNATELY  IN PARTS OF NEBRASKA  DROUGHT DAVID IS CELEBRATING ITS SEVENTH BIRTHDAY AND YET CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE RELIEF  I BELIEVE THIS MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE CONGRESS HEADS HOME FOR THE ELECTIONS  AND THAT IS WHY I M OFFERING MY AMENDMENT  ORDINARILY I WOULDN T OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO THE HOMELAND SECURITY    THE PORT SECURITY BILL BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WANT TO SUPPORT THAT  BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND THE INCREASING NEED FOR RELIEF  I M FACED    AND MY COSPONSORS AND OTHERS WHO WILL JOIN ON THIS RECOGNIZE THAT WE RE    THERE AREN T MANY OPPORTUNITIES  AND WAITING UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION JUST DOESN T SEEM  I THINK  APPROPRIATE       SO I WANT TO THANK SENATOR CONRAD FOR HIS TIRELESS EFFORTS TO GET DISASTER ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE AND FOR HIS WORK TO DRAFT AND INTRODUCE THE EMERGENCY FARM RELIEF ACT OF 2006  THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS AMENDMENT OF EVERY TIME I CHECK THE U S  DROUGHT MONITOR    AND WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT DROUGHT DAVID HERE ON THIS CHART  IT SHOWS WHERE AND HOW SEVERE THIS DROUGHT IS AFFECTING THE RURAL PARTS OF AMERICA  I SEE THAT THE ENTIRE CENTRAL UNITED STATES  AS YOU CAN NOTE FROM THIS DEMONSTRATION HERE  IS SUFFERING FROM DROUGHT CONDITIONS THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS SEVEN  SEVERE  EXTREME  OR EXCEPTIONAL  INCLUDING THE WESTERN TWO THIRDS OF NEBRASKA WHICH IS CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM SEVERE TO EXTREME DROUGHT       NEBRASKA BEING LOCATED RIGHT HERE  YOU GO UP TO THE DAKOTAS  THE SAME THING IS TRUE  OR YOU DROP DOWN  YOU SEE IN TEXAS  MOVE OVER YOU FIND THAT THE ENTIRE CENTRAL PART OF OUR COUNTRY IS UNDER THESE EXTREME TO SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS  SO THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR THIS RELIEF       IN MY STATE OF NEBRASKA  FOR EXAMPLE  RECENTLY PROFESSOR BRAD LUBBIN  HE CONCLUDED THAT AS OF AUGUST 2006  THIS YEAR  THE DROUGHT HAS COST NEBRASKA AGRICULTURE A TOTAL OF NEARLY  342 MILLION  NOT MUCH MONEY BY SOME MEASUREMENTS IN WASHINGTON  D C   BUT EXTRAORDINARY IN THE STATE OF NEBRASKA  HE FOUND THAT THE DROUGHT HAS THUS FAR CAUSED  98 MILLION IN CROP LOSSES  MOSTLYWHEAT   1 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL IRRIGATION COSTS  AND ABOUT  193 MILLION IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION LOSSES HAVE BEEN INCURREDAS WELL DUE TO PASTURE AND RANGE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW AVERAGE  RAISING LOSSES IN WESTERN NEBRASKA ARE ESTIMATED TO BE FROM 50  TO 70        PRETTY SIMPLE  NO GRASS  NO GRAZING  CATTLE LOSSES  THE 2006 PRODUCTION YEAR IS NOT YET COMPLETE  SO WE DON T KNOW THE FINAL IMPACT THAT THIS WILL HAVE ON CORN  SOYBEANS AND SORGHUM BUT I SEE MANY FIELDS WHO ARE DEVASTATED BY THIS DROUGHT AND MANY FARMERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE GO AHEAD TO CUT THEIR CROPS FOR SILAGE RATHER THAN FOR GRAIN PRODUCTION  CONGRESS AND THE REST OF WASHINGTON MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROBLEM IS CRITICAL AND RECOGNIZE AS WELL THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS HAVE SUFFERED       THIS COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE PROVIDES EMERGENCY FUNDING TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS WHO HAVE SUFFERED WEATHER RELATED CROP PRODUCTION  SHORTFALLS  QUALITY LOSSES AND DAMAGE TO LIVESTOCK AND FEED SUPPLIES  THE BILL ALSO HELPS FARMERS OVERCOME LOSSES AS A RESULT OF ENERGY PRICES THAT SPIKED DURING LAST YEAR S HURRICANES  CERTAINLY AN INCIDENT THAT OUR PRESIDING OFFICER KNOWS VERY WELL  THE BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND FUNDING FOR THE IN THIS CONSERVATION PROGRAM  SOME OF WHICH COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR REHABILITATING GRASS AND RANCH LANDS IN PLACES LIKE WESTERN NEBRASKA  AND I WOULD IMAGINE IN THE DAKOTAS AS WELL THAT WERE DAMAGED FROM RECENT WILDFIRES       I RECENTLY TOURED SOME OF THE DROUGHT STRICKEN REGIONS OF WESTERN NEBRASKA  INCLUDING LAKE MACONAHAY WHICH FOR SO LONG HAS BEEN CALLED  BIG MAC  NOW IS UNFORTUNATELY LESS  LESS AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO AS  LITTLE MAC  AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE WILDFIRES LAST MONTH  WHEN I VISITED FIRE FIGHTING OFFICIALS  EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATORS AND COMMUNE LEADERS  I    COMMUNITY LEADERS  I ASKED HOW WE COULD HELP        THIS AMENDMENT WILL PROVIDE MEANINGFUL AND IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO NEBRASKANS WHO LOST SO MUCH IN THESE FIRES  RECOGNIZING THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS THAT THE DISASTERS HAVE HAD ON MAIN STREETS ALL OVER RURAL AMERICA  THE AMENDMENT ALSO PROVIDES ASSISTANCE FOR THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES SIMPLY FIGHTING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN  WHEN FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE  HAVE INADEQUATE INCOME  OBVIOUSLY IT IMPACTS THE MAIN STREET OF THAT COMMUNITY  LOWER PURCHASING POWER  LOWER SALES  AND FIGHTING TO KEEP DOORS OPEN IS AN OBVIOUS RESULT  DROUGHT AFFECTS ELATED BUSINESSES  FOOD LOTS  DEALERS AND EVEN LOCAL STOREFRONTS THAT SERVICE RURAL COMMUNITIES       DROUGHT DOESN T JUST DESTROY FARMS  IT ECONOMICALLY DAMAGES OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES  NOW I KNOW THAT WE RE DISCUSSING PORT SECURITY HERE  AS I SAID BEFORE  SO ORDINARILY I WOULDN T OFFER THIS AS A PART OF THAT BILL  BUT I M OFFERING THIS AMENDMENT AT THIS TIME BECAUSE IT S NEEDED  CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BEFORE IT LEAVES AT THE END OF THE MONTH       MY QUESTION IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE  IF NOT NOW  WHEN  IF NOT NOW  WHEN  OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS CANNOT WAIT  THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF DROUGHT DAVID THREATEN TO DRIVE MANY OF OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES OUT OF OPERATION  AND WITHOUT THEM  YOU CANNOT EXPECT TO SECURE OUR FOOD SUPPLY  AND WE CANNOT EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVE FUEL SUPPLIES WHICH IS SUCH A CRITICAL PART OF OUR OWN FUEL SECURITY IN AMERICA TODAY       WHEN AGRICULTURE SUFFERS  THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS SUCH AS BIOFUELS WILL SUFFER AS WELL  THAT S WHY WE NEED TO DO THIS  IF WE FAIL TO ACT  AND BY OUR INACTION WE ALLOW FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND RURAL BUSINESSES TO DRY UP UNDER THE IMPACTS OF THIS DROUGHT  THEN WE HAVE FAILED TO ASSURE BOTH OUR FOOD AND FUEL SECURITY
