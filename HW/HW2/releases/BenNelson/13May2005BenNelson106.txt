authorization bill that authorizes more than  83 million in funding for research and development  military construction projects  technology innovation and education programs in Nebraska  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and directly supported many of the Nebraska related projects         A bill of this scope is critically important to our national defense initiatives and I  m pleased the committee was able to complete its work quickly and without disruption or distraction     said Senator Nelson   Many worthy projects in Nebraska will receive defense dollars through this bill   The work being done in Nebraska will better prepare our military personnel and ensure they have only the highest quality of equipment and training  The investments in infrastructure for Offutt Air Force Base will enhance the base  s ability to complete its various missions          The Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization Bill provides more than  63 million in funding for infrastructure improvements at Offutt AFB   The projects authorized for funding             19 870 000  million for runway construction          30 410 000  million for the new Air Force Weather Agency         12 800 000 million for a new child development center       The new child development center at Offutt would provide families with 6 week    6 month infant care for up to 302 children which is currently not available at Offutt  The demand for childcare on the base far exceeds the available capacity  Over 200 children are on a waiting list for child care and the wait is 9 12 months  A typical family pays about  600 for on base child care versus  870 1300 off base    up to 40  of their gross income  The new facility could meet up to 98  of the existing child care need       The Child Development Center  the runway and the weather agency will be funded through the Military Construction Appropriations Bill        The Defense Authorization bill also authorizes several research related projects in Nebraska  Those are        2 5 million for the University of Nebraska at Omaha  Secure and Assured Information Sharing  These funds would be used for the continued development of information security solutions  i e  policy  hardware  and software  that address critical cyber infrastructure protection issues   The initiative addresses pressing national information security issues that confront businesses  the government  especially those of defense  and critical infrastructure   This research will build on the success of Nebraska University Consortium for Information Assurance  NUCIA  as a National Security Agency  NSA  Center of Academic Excellence            3 million for the University of Nebraska at Lincoln  Advanced Mine Detection and Blast Mitigation  These funds will support research on advanced materials for mine detection and blast mitigation that will help protect U S  soldiers in all environments   This research focuses on the development of advanced materials for composite armor  lightweight body armor and hardened structures  and remote detection and destruction of mines and biological pathogens   This is the second year this project has been authorized        3 million for the University of Nebraska at Lincoln  Fibrogen Bandages for Battlefield Wounds  These funds would be used to complete biomedical tissue engineering research to develop inexpensive  safe and effective source of fibrogen and thrombin for use in bandages  foam and other medical devices for regenerative medicine   This source of fibrogen  and thrombin  developed from recombinant proteins instead of human plasma  will remove the major obstacle to the development of an affordable fibrogen bandage  a project in which the Department of Defense already has invested  20 million  This is the second year this project has been authorized        2 million for Royal Plastics in Minden  NE for Low cost  Rapid Prototype Production   Technology for Polymeric Aircraft Components  These funds will support the Navy  s efforts to develop Selective Laser Sintering Technology to produce polymeric aircraft components to meet the Navy  s needs for lower cost  lightweight aircraft   This funding is solely to develop rapid prototype production polymeric aircraft components  This is the third year this project has been authorized        6 million for Satellite Communications for Learning  SCOLA  Language Training   SCOLA originated at Creighton University  These funds will be used to enhance the satellite language learning opportunities and expand delivery of educational  cultural and other material via satellite and Internet video streaming  SCOLA provides in depth news coverage  cultural programming and language training relating to countries impacted by U S  National Security policies  SCOLA services the U S  Department of Defense  military branches and other federal agencies  This is the fourth year this project has been authorized        2 million for SituSpace Single Integrated Space Picture at 21st Century Systems of Omaha  These funds would be used for continued development  production and field demonstration for the SituSpace  SISP  system   SituSpace is designed to provide knowledge superiority to U S  forces through the use of advanced  intelligent agent based interactive software for use by space operators in support of joint operations  It will provide a consolidated picture to improve space situational awareness  This is the second year this project has been authorized        2 million for the Navy Logistics Common Operating Picture  LOGCOP  initiative at 21st Century Systems in Omaha  LOGCOP is a logistics decision support and management tool for use in linking deployed ships and shore based support units with existing  but disparate  logistics databases and management tools on a common system   LOGCOP uses intelligent agent based software to process large caches of information on parts availability and repair needs for ships  aircraft  weapon systems and other equipment employed in the fleet  LOGCOP predicts and prepares fleets for expected maintenance         50 million for Impact Aid nationwide  Impact Aid provides assistance to local educational agencies that benefit dependents of members of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense civilian employees  Impact Aid is split into three parts    30 million as an impact aid supplemental to funds provided though the U S  Department of Education   5 million for children with special needs and  15 million over three years to support the increase of students in impact aid districts from overseas bases as they are moved from Europe and Asia back to the US and for bases that are affected by base realignment         This legislation must still be adopted by the full Senate   The legislation authorizes funding for these projects  Funds for these projects will be appropriated through the Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Bills later this year                                                              30
