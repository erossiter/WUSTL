                                                                                                WASHINGTON  D C     The Iraq market for dry edible beans  once the largest market in the world for Nebraska producers  could soon reopen if the White House succeeds in removing some of the trade barriers that currently exist  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson said today       The Bush Administration has committed to me to do what it can to remove cumbersome barriers that prevent Nebraska producers from selling their beans in Iraq     said Senator Nelson    Specifically  they will address transportation challenges  cumbersome packaging rules  and financing obstacles that keep our beans from the Iraqi market          Senator Nelson has done a tremendous job in working with the Administration to reopen this critical market for Nebraska  s dry bean producers     said Craig Henkel  President of the Nebraska Dry Bean Growers Association    Reopening the Iraq market would be a tremendous win for dry bean producers in Nebraska and across the country        In April of 2003  the United States Agency for International Development  USAID  sent a shipment of 31 900 metric tons of dry edible beans in food aid shipments  These shipments had a positive secondary impact on the dry bean market by utilizing surplus supplies   This raised the price per hundred weight  cwt  from  14 to  22   The market recovery was short lived  and the price of Great Northern Beans dropped in the following weeks to  12 15 cwt  Nelson has been pushing the Administration to reopen this market to Nebraska producers     Since then  Nelson has been pressing the Bush Administration to reopen the dry bean market in Iraq  Today  he released a letter he received restating the Bush Administration  s commitment to removing barriers to this market  The Administration  s letter committed to address the following barriers     Inland Transportation  In the past Iraq has required producers to provide inland transportation of product to Iraqi warehouses  The Administration has agreed to support the Nebraska dry bean growers   suggestion that Iraq consider accepting deliveries to port or alternative ports like Mersin  Turkey and leave inland transportation responsibilities to the buyers  The U S  Department of Agriculture Foreign Agriculture Service and the U S  Department of State will work toward this goal     Performance Bonds  Currently performance bonds are only released upon final inspection along with the final percentage   The Iraq Ministry of Trade  s Food Stuffs Company will pay percentage to be determined at the point of unloading and initial testing   Nebraska dry bean growers and processors would prefer a policy of cash against documents or payment upon presentation of a dock receipt or container stuffing reports  USDA FAS and the USTR have both agreed to work on this issue in the past  and will renew efforts in that regard in the hopes of making ease of payment and inspection for this and other commodities a reality      Packaging  Iraq requests that great northern and other dry edible beans be delivered in 500 gram packaging for ease in handling and distribution   The Nebraska dry bean growers and processors believe it is imperative that the smaller packaging requirements would need to be met at the port  allowing the commodity to be shipped in bulk  USDA FAS and the USTR will work toward developing a packaging facility in country  alleviating the packaging requirement and a market for the commodity in country    Since the initial shipment of dry edible beans as part of the food aid program  Nelson has been exploring other means by which to reopen this market   Nelson has brought the case to the president and even pressed the case with U S  agriculture officials during a Thanksgiving Day visit to Baghdad last November      Nelson has also pushed to open markets for Nebraska  s dry edible beans and other products with other countries  As governor  he led twelve trade missions and helped boost Nebraska  s exports from  868 million in 1990 to  2 2 billion in 1997   Last week  Nelson met with trade officials in Cuba to discuss Nebraska  s dry edible beans and other products  This week  Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman announced that a trade delegation would visit to Cuba later this summer     Key dates in Nelson  s discussions with the Bush Administration about the Iraq dry edible bean market    April 30  2004  Senator Nelson wrote the President to encourage him to urge the CPA Ministry of Trade to once again purchase beans from American growers   He later sent letter to White House Chief of Staff Andy Card to renew that effort       Late October 2004  Senator Nelson received a response from the State Department that directed his staff to work with the Foreign Agriculture Service  FAS  at USDA  In working with FAS  Nelson suggested that the growers and processors develop a   prospectus    of what they could offer and submit that to the State Department USDA Agriculture Attach     for delivery to the Iraq Ministry of Trade      November 2004  During a Thanksgiving Day visit to Baghdad  Senator Nelson met with James Smith  Agricultural Attache   with the US Embassy to deliver a message to the Iraqi Ministry of Trade about Nebraska growers and processors willingness and desire to renew a trading relationship with Iraq on dry beans       December 17  2004  Nelson met with the dry bean processors of western Nebraska and enlisted them to develop a prospectus for the Iraqi MOT  The prospectus was forwarded to the MOT in the following weeks       February 15  2005  Senator Nelson  s staff hosted a conference call with all Nebraska bean dealers  Nizar Mohammed  Directorate General of the Iraqi Foodstuffs Company  Iraqi MOT   and USDA officials to work out the issues that seem to be obstacles to renewing a trading relationship for dry beans   Those issues specifically are packaging requirements  payment arrangements by the Iraqis and transportation of the product in country   An agreement was reached to work together to overcome the existing barriers    March 29  2005  Senator Nelson  s staff met with Ambassador Allen Johnson during his trip to western Nebraska to visit about the Iraqi bean market      April 28  2005  Nelson writes to Ambassador Johnson to follow up on the discussions of March 29     June 24  2005  Ambassador Johnson responded to Nelson with assurances to continue to work with the MOT and USDA FAS  and to work toward the meeting the packaging requirements  and to assist the Nebraska growers and processors in working with Mr  Mohammad on these issues     June 30  2005  Nelson finalizes an agreement with White House staff to renew the push to address the packaging requirements  payment arrangements by the Iraqis and transportation of the product in country
