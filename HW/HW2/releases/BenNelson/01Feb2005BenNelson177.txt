live in rural communities continue to have access to health care and laboratory services         As a native of McCook  I understand how important health care is to the survival of rural communities     said Nelson     Without basic services such as health care  rural areas cannot hope to attract new residents or retain existing residents          The bill Nelson has introduced would repeal a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services    CMS  regulation that would prohibit critical access hospitals from being reimbursed at cost for laboratory services  unless patients are   physically present in a critical access hospital    when laboratory specimens are collected   Many critical access hospitals provide laboratory services in rural health clinics and nursing homes in smaller  neighboring communities as well as in home health settings  however  the elimination of cost based reimbursement may make it prohibitive for them to continue offering off site laboratory testing   In short  under the new regulation  lab services would not be adequately reimbursed by CMS unless the patient is at the facility where testing will occur       Nelson says that about sixty rural hospitals would be affected   See attached list          This change jeopardizes rural Americans   access to care by imposing an additional burden on the frail elderly by requiring them to visit the hospital to get simple lab tests done     said Nelson     The additional time and inconvenience incurred by the patient is unnecessary if the critical access hospital is willing and able to conduct tests at the point of patient care and transport it back to the hospital for analysis          Congress created the critical access program in 1997 to ensure that those in isolated  rural communities have access to health care   To protect the viability of these hospitals  often a community  s only source of vital health care services  Congress established cost based reimbursement for Medicare inpatient and outpatient services    regardless of where the services are provided   The new regulation would fundamentally alter this well established practice        30            62 Hospitals in
