                                                         Press Release    February 17  2007         SENATE BLOCKS IRAQ RESOLUTION  AGAIN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Nebraska s Senator Ben Nelson Votes to allow up or down vote on Resolution that Supports Troops  Opposes Surge Plan   February 17  2007   The United States Senate today again failed to allow debate and an up or down vote on a Resolution that expresses support for our troops fighting in Iraq and also expresses opposition to the Administration s plan to surge troop levels to quell the civil war in Iraq  Nebraska s Senator Ben Nelson  a cosponsor  voted in favor of moving forward with an up or down vote on the Resolution        This is a dark moment in the history of the United States Senate   By failing to consider this measure  the institution has failed the American people  Blocking an up or down vote on this Resolution prevents the Senate from expressing its opinion on the most pressing issue facing the nation  the proposed deployment of troops to the crossroads of civil war in Iraq   said Senator Nelson   The Majority has offered the Minority several proposals to allow votes on different resolutions  All offers have been rejected  And now  again  the Minority has obstructed an up or down vote on the Resolution passed by the House of Representatives yesterday        While a majority of the Senate  56 34  voted to allow an up or down vote on the Iraq resolution  the Senate was unable to overcome filibuster tactics used by the minority that required 60 votes to proceed to the Resolution        Nelson is the only cosponsor of the Resolution considered today  S 574  and also is the lead Majority cosponsor of the Warner Nelson Collins Resolution which supports the troops  opposes the troop surge and calls for clear benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet in order for U S troops to continue their presence in Iraq  The Minority blocked consideration of the Warner Nelson Collins Resolution with a procedural vote on February 5  Nelson spoke in favor of moving to consideration of S  574 today on the floor of the Senate  An unofficial transcript of his remarks is included below         Nebraska s Senator Ben Nelson  Floor Statement   Iraq Surge Resolution  February 17  2007     Madam President  this has been called a very unusual occasion for us to come to the floor on a Saturday to vote on a resolution   or to vote on any matter   But this is a special occasion today because we need to vote up or down on this Resolution        I want to make it clear that while it s unusual  I believe it is  in fact  necessary but I want to make it clear also that I support and prefer the Warner Nelson Collins Resolution which sets forth benchmarks and conditions for staying and requirements for the Iraqi government and the Iraqi Prime Minister to meet in connection which that        But this Resolution  while maybe more simplistic  still expresses support for the troops  a very strong statement of support for the troops and what they do  funding for the troops and continuing to support their needs   It also states an opposition to the surge plan        The Warner Nelson Collins Resolution  which I prefer  makes it very clear that the opposition to the surge plan is sending our troops into Baghdad to put them in harm s way between the Sunnis and the Shias and sectarian violence that s been described as being far worse than a civil war   We do not believe that that is the appropriate plan and we ve asked in that Resolution that the president consider all alternatives and other plans that might not put out troops into harm s way in the middle of civil disobedience and a civil conflagration as we ve seen it   I want to thank Senators Warner and Collins for their support and the co sponsors of this other Resolution that I ve referred to        But you know  today I think it s pretty clear there s been much debate about the debate   My friend from Kentucky indicated that he is frustrated   I think we are all frustrated   We re frustrated because it s time to end this charade and move forward to the consideration of the Resolution so that the Senate can be on record with senators voting for or against the surge plan        The American people can see what s happening here   They know that some want to prevent a vote at all costs   There have been those on the floor complaining about the vote that was cast a vote a little over a week ago against moving forward   Then they stood on the floor and said it s time to have a vote  after having voted against having a vote      Let us debate and vote on this Resolution   We owe it to the American people   We owe it to the American people because of the importance of this Resolution to making clear that we do not support or that we do support putting our troops in harm s way in the middle of a civil war or a war that is simply between Shias and Sunnis  Shias and Shias  and other civil groups within the community          We don t have to understand 1400 years of this battle to know that this is an inappropriate to put our troops into the middle where it s impossible to identify the enemy   We put our troops into a situation where they are going door to door  hopefully with some support from the Iraqi troops  hopefully with some support from Prime Minister Al Maliki  hopefully with some support from the Iraqi government   But  in any event  the surge  which the president has said is going forward  will put our troops in that situation      I  for one  do not believe that that is an appropriate use of our troops  and I believe today that this is the opportunity for the Senate to be able to say  no  by saying  yes  to moving forward on this Resolution
