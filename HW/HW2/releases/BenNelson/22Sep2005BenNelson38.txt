COURT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON  D C     Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson today issued the following statement regarding the nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court  Nelson  s statement has been entered into the Congressional Record  The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on the Roberts nomination today and the Senate will vote on the nomination next week     With the Judiciary Committee  s confirmation hearings all but complete  I rise today to announce my vote on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as the 17th Chief Justice and the 116th Justice of the United States Supreme Court     I have come to my decision not in haste  but with great care and consideration  Over the history of our nation  relatively few Senators have had the opportunity to consider the nomination of a Chief Justice and I recognize the honor that accompanies this great responsibility       Judge Roberts is an extremely well qualified nominee  Some have said he may be the best nominee ever to the Supreme Court  I  m not one that regularly calls on such hyperbole on most issues  but I can say today that from what I  ve seen  I expect Judge Roberts to serve with distinction and honor as Chief Justice  I think the Court will be enhanced despite the obvious and measurable impact of the loss to the Court of Chief Justice William Rehnquist     My record on judicial nominations speaks for itself   I have supported 213 of the 214 district and circuit court judges confirmed by the Senate   I voted against filibustering judicial nominees twenty four times  I understand the executive branch  s power to appoint judges    as Nebraska  s Governor I appointed the entire State Supreme Court and Court of Appeals and more than half the state  s sitting judges     As a Senator who pledged to put aside the partisan games to get things done in Washington  I was very concerned last year about how a potential Senate shutdown due to a stalemate over judicial nominations would impact legislation important to the nation  and especially my home State of Nebraska      We needed a national energy policy    including the Renewable Fuels Standard that would boost ethanol production  a very strong Nebraska industry  We needed to complete the Highway bill    with  1 3 billion in road construction funds that will create jobs and boost the economy in Nebraska  We needed to avoid the now annual   omnibus    spending bill that made it nearly impossible to monitor and control Washington spending  Social Security and Medicare need to be addressed  At the time I was concerned about the ongoing drought      Drought David    as I called it to bring attention to it    that is ravaging our agriculture sector in Nebraska and across the nation  We had no idea the wrath and destruction that Hurricane season would bring to bear on the nation  but after Katrina we can see how important it is to have a functioning Congress      Senator Alexander  during a floor speech regarding the judicial stalemate offered a suggestion  a call really  that many of us heard and decided to heed  Surely  a bipartisan group of Senators could develop an agreement that would resolve the stalled judicial nominations and diffuse the Nuclear Option    and ultimately  ease some of the partisan tension that had crippled the Senate and threatened to shut it down completely     I am very proud of my role in the so called   Gang of Fourteen     the bipartisan group that navigated the path to confirmation for many of the president  s judicial nominees and preserved the precedents and traditions of the Senate   I am also very proud that the Gang  s   memorandum of understanding    paved the way to complete many of the legislative priorities I mentioned earlier    including the energy bill and the highway bill      The   Memorandum of Understanding    included an important section asking the president to improve communications with the Senate on judicial nominees  We asked that he spend more time on the advice part of the   advice and consent    clause in the Constitution      When Associate Justice Sandra Day O  Connor announced her planned retirement in June  the White House heeded our recommendation and consulted with a vast majority of Senators before nominating Judge Roberts to the Court  That consultation with the Senate certainly diffused some of the more extreme partisanship when the Roberts nomination was announced  Not all of it  of course  but some of it       Before the Judiciary Committee began its process  I met personally with Judge Roberts  In that meeting he impressed me   We talked at length about judicial activism and the threat it poses to the nation  We talked about settled law  His knowledge of the history of law was impressive  His belief in and dedication to the rule of law was apparent and admirable      At the outset of the Roberts confirmation process  I said that I hoped the Gang of Fourteen had no role in the process because that would mean the process was working  And it did work      The Roberts Confirmation hearings were dignified  the questions were tough but appropriate  and the answers Judge Roberts provided were as most expected  The hearings were no place to overturn law or discuss case specifics  The hearings did not produce any disqualifying revelations  nor did I expect that to happen       Only time will tell where Judge Roberts will come down on the prevailing legal matters that come before the Roberts Court  I can only take him at his word that he will approach his role on the Court without a predetermined agenda  without activism  and with only the intention to balance the scales of justice for all Americans      What came though to me as I watched his confirmation hearings was a man with great poise  a deep and thorough knowledge of the law  a love for this country and unmatched integrity  John Roberts is a man deserving of the nomination and deserving of confirmation      I will vote to confirm Judge John Roberts as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court     Thank you
