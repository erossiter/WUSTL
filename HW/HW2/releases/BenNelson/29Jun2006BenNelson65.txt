imports of American beef and a bill that I have introduced that would ban imports of Japanese beef until such time as fair trade is resumed and Japan is once again importing U S  beef   I am raising this issue because of its importance in my state of Nebraska and to the entire American beef industry     Today  Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi visits with President Bush    in fact  they are together right now   I hope they are talking about the beef ban  but if they are not  I am   It is important that this devastating and unfair ban on U S  beef does not get ignored       Japan has now banned imports of U S  beef for over 5 months   This ban has had significant affects on the U S  beef industry and it has hit home in Nebraska       First  Japan used to represent a  1 4 billion market every year for U S  beef  which equals about  115 million every month    and Nebraska was the leading beef exporting state to Japan   That means Japan  s most recent ban has directly cost the U S  beef industry at least  575 million      But this is only part of the problem   In December of 2003  Japan closed its borders to U S  beef over purported concerns about Mad Cow  s Disease   Their borders remained closed for over two years  until December 2005 and were opened barely a month before closed again in January 2006   This in spite of the low prevalence of BSE in the U S  herd  especially compared to its prevalence in the Japanese herd     Second  my home state of Nebraska has been hit especially hard   The beef industry is a big part of Nebraska  s economy    we were one of the top states in cattle fed and cattle slaughtered in 1995   We  ve estimated that both Japanese bans on U S  beef imports have caused great damage in the state    up to  875 million and more than 1300 jobs  including two plants in West Point and Norfolk that were closed due in part because of this ban     Mr  President  because of this I write to Japanese Ambassador Kato every week to urge Japan to end the ban as quickly as possible   Each time  I emphasize two main points    1  that American beef is the best and safest in the world and  2  that Japan needs to end its ban on U S  beef immediately   Unfortunately  I have now written 18 letters with more on the way     Because the beef industry cannot tolerate this unfair ban much longer  I  ve introduced a bill that will ban all U S  imports of Japanese beef until such time as the U S  Trade Representative reports to Congress that Japan has actually resumed imports of U S  beef       My bill is about fairness and I urge my colleagues to become co sponsors of this bill       I want to emphasize that my bill is about fairness in our trade relations   Japan  s ban on U S  beef simply cannot be considered fair trade practices     Last December Japan finally agreed to lift its initial ban on U S  beef after a long series of negotiations and overwhelming evidence of the safety of American beef     In January  the very first shipment of U S  beef to Japan was found by Japanese inspectors to contain a few boxes of beef that did not comply with the Export protocol that Japan and the U S  had agreed to  the very first shipment     It is extremely important to note that this shipment posed absolutely no risk to human health  it was merely in violation of the strict export agreement between the U S  and Japan     And how did Japan react   They immediately banned all imports of U S  beef   They didn  t send the shipment back or even de list the company that sent the non compliant shipment to them     No  they punished the entire U S  beef industry for a single instance of non compliance    a situation that came about because of human error in the implementation of the export procedures    and their actions have caused great harm to a  1 4 billion industry     I agree that mistakes were made by U S  officials and facilities   But fair trade requires a reasonable and fair response to mistakes     Japan  s total embargo is not  in my opinion  a fair and reasonable response     Because of that  Mr  President  I am bringing this matter to the attention of my colleagues on the day that Prime Minister Koizumi meets with President Bush  as a reminder of this unfair trade practice     I have met with Ambassador Kato multiple times and I greatly appreciate all of his efforts to resolve this situation and end Japan  s ban   Unfortunately  the Japanese bureaucracy has dragged this process out entirely too long     Let me set out a timetable of events and discuss what this slow process has cost the U S  beef industry in real dollars          January 20  2006  Japan instituted the current ban on U S  beef imports          Within the first month of this second ban  two beef processing plants in Nebraska were closed  costing these communities over 1300 jobs and an untold amount of money          I wrote my first letter on February 22nd and by that time USDA had already conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and delivered a report to Japan with its findings and the steps it would take to correct the mistakes          By the time of that letter  the U S  beef industry had lost an estimated  116 million in exports          By the end of March  when Japanese finally met with a technical team from the USDA to answer lingering concerns Japan had about beef safety  even though the non compliant shipment posed no danger to human health   the ban had cost the beef industry an estimated  264 million          In April  Japan held a series of public meetings to communicate to Japanese consumers that there were no risks to health from American beef   These meetings were held over the course of 14 days at a cost to the U S  beef industry of an estimated  56 million and the ban now causing about  348 million          On the 4 month anniversary of the Japanese ban  Japan announced that it had reached a basic understanding with the U S  on the resumption of beef imports  but had not reached any formal agreement to resume imports   The damage to the beef industry topped  460 million when Japan had reached this basic understanding          Lately  we  ve been told that all that is left for Japan to resume importing U S  beef is for its own inspectors to audit each of the 35 U S  facilities permitted to export to Japan    and previously re audited by USDA officials in April   This round of audits just began and will continue through July 21st    or just past the 6 month anniversary of the ban when the cost to the beef industry will reach  700 million          In the time that it takes Japan to re audit the U S  facilities  the loss in exports to the beef industry will be  116 million          And Japan has recently said that they will not resume imports until after they submit a report on their audits    so each day that Japan takes to complete this report  the beef industry loses about  4 million     Those numbers are only part of the real cost to an important U S  and Nebraska industry of this slow  drawn out process  most of the costs we are unable to estimate at this point in time   But the above timeline should serve as a real reminder of what unfair trade practices cost American industries     I was given another real reminder of the damage caused by this ban at the end of last month   On May 31st  I flew around Nebraska to meet with producers  packers and other members of the Nebraska beef industry   They all told me that the Japanese ban has been hard on them and they encouraged me to continue pushing Japan     I talked to folks at a beef processing plant in Grand Island  where foreign beef sales once made up 16  of the company  s sales    half of which once went to Japan   They have been hit hard by Japan  s ban     I talked to farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods have been threatened by this ban   Some of these feedlots were set to ship beef to Japan when it re opened in December   These producers couldn  t emphasize enough the problems this ban has caused them and how it has affected their planning and businesses     These Nebraskans were clear   our trade arrangements must be fair   They must be based on sound science and not on politics or emotion     And they all supported my bill   Their message to me was clear   if Japan won  t take our beef  there  s no reason why we should continue to accept their beef   I couldn  t agree more     Recently the National Cattlemen  s Beef Association unanimously voted to support my bill   They too emphasized that fair trade was the driving force behind their support for my bill   The Cattlemen  s message to Japan was simple  enough is enough     The Nebraska Cattlemen have also recently stated that they welcomed my bill   They support this effort because they are frustrated that we have not obtained fair trade with Japan   Japan imported  350 million of Nebraska beef products in 2003 and that market has now been unfairly closed for far too long     Japan  s ban on U S  beef has unfairly damaged the beef industries in Nebraska and the United States   This ban is not based on scientific evidence   It is not the result of health concerns   It is based on politics and emotion   It is not a fair manner to conduct trade     And that is why I am doing all that I can to push this process along and that is why I will continue to push until trade is actually resumed and U S  beef is once again on the shelves in Japan and available to Japanese consumers     And that is why I am speaking on the Senate floor this morning while the Japanese Prime Minister is at the White House    as a reminder that our trade relationship with Japan must be conducted fairly     There has been progress made and I do not wish to discount that   It has come too slowly and at a high price to the beef industry   But progress has been and continues to be made     And I do want to mention that I applaud Japan  s agreement to refrain from closing down all trade over any future instances of non compliance   The shared understanding reached last week between the U S  and Japan includes a provision whereby Japan  upon finding a non compliant shipment  will only take actions that are commensurate with the nature of the violation     I believe that fair trade between our countries requires that action only be taken against non compliant shipments or  at most  against the facilities responsible for the non compliant shipment   I do not believe that it is fair to hold the entire industry at fault   I welcome Japan  s agreement to conduct trade in this fair manner     I  ll wrap up by again asking my colleagues to support my bill and to help send a message to Japan that trade between our nations must be fair     It is my hope that together our efforts will continue to speed along the process for resuming the beef trade with Japan and will help ensure that when trade resumes between our nations it is conducted fairly     I close today by reiterating what I keep telling Ambassador Kato   that U S  beef is the best and safest in the world and that Japan  s ban on it should end immediately     I am cautiously optimistic that Japanese consumers will again be able to enjoy U S  beef before the end of July  but this ban has gone on too long and I am worried about the lingering damage it has caused    to the U S  beef industry in particular     Thank you  Mr  President
