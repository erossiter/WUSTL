                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON  D C     Today Nebraska  s Senator Nelson met with senior business leaders from real estate development and holding companies  insurance companies  including Mutual of Omaha  and other representatives to discuss the critical need for the extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act  TRIA  which has helped protect American jobs and keep large scale construction projects going in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11       Senator Nelson along with Senators Harry Reid  Chris Dodd  Barak Obama  Kent Conrad  Jon Corzine  Tom Carper  and Jack Reed hosted a discussion to focus on the TRIA extension legislation and the need to provide for our economic security in the event of another terrorist attack on US soil  Business leaders from across the country participated in the meeting         TRIA serves as a backstop for our economic vitality  job creation and economic development by providing insurance protection for new construction and other building projects     said Senator Nelson     It also serves as a backstop for the catastrophic loss for group insurers in the wake of another large scale terrorist attack  TRIA has kept the country moving forward since September 11 and we need to extend the program          One critical provision that is now included in the extension is related to group life insurance     The ability of insurers to provide comprehensive group life insurance coverage for large numbers of subscribers hinges on the extension of TRIA with protection for group life products   said Ivan Gilreath  Senior Vice President of Group Insurance Products for Mutual of Omaha     Extending TRIA to provide a backstop for group life insurance will give insurers like Mutual of Omaha the flexibility to provide a high level of coverage in high density population areas and still cover catastrophic events like terrorist attacks     Mr  Gilreath attended the TRIA meeting with Senator Nelson      Following the attacks of September 11  2001  Congress passed TRIA to address the instability in property and casualty insurance markets present after those attacks  particularly in the area of terrorism insurance coverage       The program is scheduled to sunset on December 31  2005 and Senator Nelson is very concerned that not extending TRIA will have a highly negative impact on economic stability in the United States    TRIA is designed to ensure that our nation can prepare for  and recover from  financial devastation caused by a catastrophic terrorist attack     said Nelson     TRIA helps to prevent terrorists from accomplishing one of their key objectives  which is to undermine the economic security of our country   This is why I believe it is imperative for our national economic security that the public private partnership established under TRIA continues beyond the end of this year          Senator Nelson today also sent a letter in support of extending TRIA to U S  Treasury Secretary John Snow   In part Nelson stated         Unfortunately  the recent bombings in London underscore the need to adequately prepare on all fronts for another terrorist attack on U S  soil  I believe TRIA provides some measure of economic protection our country needs to address the uncertainty that another terrorist attack poses for our economic security  The economic implications of not extending TRIA as it exists today may be far more burdensome on American taxpayers than the public private partnership created by the law itself  We must ensure stability continues while we develop and finalize a long term solution          In February of 2005  Nelson joined with Senators Bob Bennett  UT  and Chris Dodd  CT  in offering the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005  legislation to extend for two years the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act  TRIA   Senator Nelson supported establishing TRIA in 2002       Summary of Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005      The legislation preserves the operative provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002  extending those provisions for an additional two years  The legislation also           Extends through the last year of the program the provision requiring insurers to  make available  TRIA terrorism coverage           Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to include group life insurance  by regulation  as a covered line of insurance under TRIA under conditions similar to those covering commercial property casualty insurers           Maintains individual insurer deductibles at the Year 3 level of 15 percent of prior year direct earned premiums for TRIA covered lines through the balance of the program           Gradually adjusts the aggregate industry loss level used to determine mandatory recoupment from  15 billion in Year 3 to  17 5 billion in Year 4 to  20 billion in Year 5           Includes a soft  run off  so that insurance policies written prior to December 31  2007 will not lose their coverage for  acts of terrorism  before the policy period expires  Only policies written by December 31  2007 will receive the benefit of TRIA  and only to the extent that those policies expire on or before December 31  2008           Mandates a study to be completed addressing long term solutions to managing terrorism exposure
