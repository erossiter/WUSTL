bipartisan resolution today supporting the National Guard and requesting that the Department of Defense seek input from Congress and governors when deciding future changes to the National Guard personnel and calling on the Pentagon to resolve equipment shortages        The members of our National Guard aren  t   weekend warriors       said Senator Nelson    They  re indispensable citizen soldiers  airmen and airwomen who serve their country full time when needed  and in return  I expect the Department of Defense to fully support the National Guard missions here and around the world          At this crucial time in our nation  s history  we are more dependent on the National Guard than ever     said U S  Senator Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina      Now is not the time to diminish the role the reserves play in the American military   I look forward to working with Senator Nelson  who has been a good friend to the National Guard and Reserves  to ensure our reserve forces are properly structured          The National Guard has a unique role in defending the nation  Guard troops have a dual responsibility  to the nation and to their home states  The Department of Defense is proposing cuts in personnel levels for the Guard and the Guard is hindered by significant shortages on critical equipment        This resolution will explicitly define support for Guard missions here and abroad to reiterate the need to replenish equipment that has been destroyed on missions in Iraq     said Senator Nelson     The resolution calls for the Department of Defense to     Fully fund the equipment needs of the National Guard     Consult with Congress and the nation  s governors as soon as possible on any proposed changes to the National Guard force structure   Consider the National Guard  s role in homeland defense when considering the National Guard  s force structure     Create budget projections that detail cost savings from any National Guard force structure changes  as well as projected costs in the event large personnel increases are necessary to respond to a homeland defense emergency     Ensure Congress and our nation  s governors that potential personnel cuts will not impact the safety and security of the American people      The resolution arrives as the future of the National Guard is currently being determined by the Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR       Despite and as a result of their significant work  the National Guard continues to experience equipment shortages  Last November  Senators Nelson  Graham and 40 other senators from both political parties sent President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a letter urging them to fully fund the National Guard  And earlier this month  Nebraska National Guard Adjutant General Roger L  Lempke briefed Senator Nelson on the impact of shortages on the missions and responsibilities of the Nebraska Guard       As Nebraska  s Governor  I relied on the National Guard to assist in states of emergency such as the blizzard of October 1997 that left 125 000 Nebraskans without electricity   It is important that the Guard has adequate equipment and personnel to respond     said Nelson      The guard is experiencing equipment deficiencies all over the country including shortages of humvees  rough terrain trucks  over the road tractors  wreckers  semi trailers  communication equipment  and weapon mounts for trucks     Over breakfast Thursday morning  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld committed to Senator Nelson that the Pentagon would ensure that the National Guard have the personnel and resources it needs to fulfill its roles in defending our nation and responding to emergencies     The resolution is supported by the National Guard Association of the United States  Also  current co sponsors of the bipartisan resolution include Senators  Ben Nelson  NE   Lindsey Graham  SC   George Allen  VA   Jim Talent  MO   Elizabeth Dole  NC   Olympia Snowe  ME   Lisa Murkowski  AK   John
