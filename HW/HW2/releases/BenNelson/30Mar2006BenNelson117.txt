constituents  health insurance costs are out of control and a vast majority support lower health costs for small businesses  Our bill will lower health insurance costs for small businesses  which includes Nebraska  s family farmers and ranchers     said Senator Nelson  a former state insurance director and insurance executive    By giving these small businesses purchasing power  this bill will expand access to health insurance for nearly one million American workers          The results of the survey go to the heart of why the Senate should pass S 1955 now   the people who make up the bedrock of our economy    small  family owned businesses    have overwhelmingly issued a mandate for change     Enzi said    Allowing small businesses to pool together  combined with relieving regulatory burdens  will improve the business climate and provide more health insurance choices for working families          S 1955  which was introduced by Enzi and cosponsored by Senator Ben Nelson  D NE  and Senator Conrad Burns  R MT   will allow business and trade associations to band their members together and offer group health coverage on a national or regional basis in direct response to runaway costs that are driving far too many employers and families from comprehensive health insurance     The HELP Committee ended a decade long stalemate on health insurance reform by voting in favor of S  1955 on March 15  The bill awaits consideration by the full Senate     Some key findings of the NAR survey include     Thirty five percent of voters nationally report that the current health care system is not meeting their own needs or the needs of their families       The 25 percent of voters who work in America  s smallest companies  companies with less than 10 employees  are having the most difficulty   Forty eight percent of these voters say the health care system is not meeting their own needs or the needs of their families      Almost one quarter of voters  23 percent  have gone without health insurance coverage at some point over the last three years      Access to healthcare plans is a bigger problem for individuals in the lowest income brackets and those working in America  s small businesses     Among the 24 percent of respondents who work for companies with 100 employees or fewer  37 percent are dissatisfied with their access to a wide variety of healthcare plans   That number drops to 27 percent dissatisfied among those working in companies with more than 100 employees      Thirty five percent of those with incomes less than  60 000 are dissatisfied with their access to healthcare plans  compared to 29 percent dissatisfied among those with incomes of  60 000 or more
