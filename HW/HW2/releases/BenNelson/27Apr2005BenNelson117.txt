                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON  D C     Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson today announced that he is co sponsoring bi partisan legislation with Senator Sam Brownback  R KS  to assure that people who live in rural communities will have access to affordable hospital care      The Rural Community Hospital Assistance Act makes certain that senior citizens will be able to receive the same quality of health care throughout the country whether they live in rural or urban areas     said Nelson     What  s happening is just another example of when it comes to rural living Washington just doesn  t get it   They understand big hospitals and they understand small hospitals  to some extent  but they don  t understand mid sized hospitals at all and as a result mid sized hospitals are being unfairly reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid   This bill will change that       Nelson made the announcement in a telephone conference call with administrators from five hospitals that are participating in a demonstration project   They are Beatrice Community Hospital  Columbus Community Hospital  McCook Community Hospital  Phelps Memorial Health Center in Holdrege  and Tri County Area Hospital District in Lexington    The five hospitals are among 14 nationally in 8 sparsely populated states that are participating in the demonstration program that was mandated in the Medicare Modernization Act passed by Congress in response to financial concerns of rural hospitals      Nelson plans to introduce bi partisan legislation with Senator Sam Brownback  R Kansas  to allow all rural hospitals to receive adequate reimbursement from Medicare based on the success of the demonstration project   That would include 560 hospitals nationwide including the five in Nebraska      In a rural state like Kansas  community hospitals form the backbone of the health care infrastructure     said Senator Sam Brownback     This legislation will preserve access to the high quality health care delivered at these hospitals     Kansans and other Americans in rural communities deserve nothing less          Many rural hospitals are too large to qualify for critical access hospital status  yet they are too small to benefit from the economies that larger hospitals enjoy     said Nelson     Their rural population base also lends to a greater reliance on Medicare as a source of revenue than urban hospitals       The legislation would allow rural hospitals with 26 50 acute care beds the option of receiving Medicare payments based on 101  of costs using the same formula used for smaller rural hospitals   These hospitals are currently paid by a formula that does not pay them their true cost of providing care  The economic impact on the five hospitals in the demonstration project amounts to 34 to 35 million dollars in Nebraska over the next five years    This is the latest in a series of bills Nelson has introduced that champions the cause of rural health care   Summary of other rural health care legislation follows     Senator Nelson worked with Senator Brownback  R KS  to introduce legislation to create the new designation of   rural community hospital    for hospitals with between 25 and 50 beds   Under this proposal  which was included as a pilot program in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003  15 rural community hospitals    including five in Nebraska    will receive cost based Medicare reimbursements  allowing them to recoup their costs of providing care as well as to maintain their facilities by making necessary improvements    The Brownback Nelson legislation also included enhanced cost based reimbursement for even smaller  rural hospitals   This provision was also included in the Medicare bill and provides the 60 critical access hospitals in Nebraska with the financial means to make critical infrastructure and technology upgrades     Senator Nelson has a strong commitment to protecting these critical access hospitals   When the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  changed a regulation to lower the reimbursement rate for off site laboratory services  Senator Nelson introduced legislation to reinstate the original formula   Many CAHs provide laboratory services in rural health clinics  RHCs  and nursing homes in smaller  neighboring communities  as well as in home health settings  however  the elimination of cost based reimbursement may make it prohibitive for them to continue offering off site laboratory testing   As a result  Medicare beneficiaries will have to travel to a CAH to have laboratory specimens drawn  The additional time and expense these patients will have to incur is entirely unnecessary if the CAH is willing and able to draw a specimen at the point of patient care and transport it back to the CAH for analysis   This change imposes a considerable burden on patients  particularly the sick and the elderly  and jeopardizes their access to care    Senator Nelson voted for legislation to end Medicare  s historic discrimination against states that do more with less  Medicare  s complex funding formula penalized rural states such as Nebraska for practicing cost effective medicine by reimbursing them at a lower rate   Health care providers and hospitals in Nebraska received a lower reimbursement for the same procedure performed in New York   This practice created a disincentive for doctors and nurses to stay in rural areas and hurt hospitals that were already struggling financially   The legislation Senator Nelson supported helped equalize the reimbursement rate between urban and rural America      Senator Nelson understands the difficulty rural areas face when trying to recruit physicians   Senator Nelson cosponsored legislation that provides a special visa to foreign doctors who agree to spend three years serving in the state   The program has been successful in retaining these physicians with 83 percent of those who have served in Nebraska remaining past their assigned period of time      The National Rural Health Association recognized Senator Nelson as one of the top legislators for 2004 for his work on rural health care issues                                                                   30
