                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Nebraska s Senator Introduces Legislation to Spur Biogas Development   April 18  2007   Billions of gallons of fossil fuels could be reduced through renewable energy sources produced from animal waste with a little ingenuity and modest government support   Nebraska s Senator Ben Nelson is proposing groundbreaking legislation that promotes the development of biogas   a natural gas substitute created by the anaerobic digestion of animal wastes   through tax incentives and guaranteed loans for small businesses        The technology to break down animal wastes to create biogas already exists but it needs encouragement from the federal government to become a commercially viable alternative to natural gas   This new energy source would benefit rural communities and the environment while lessening our dependence on fossil fuels   said Nelson    We shouldn t waste the waste  we should promote biogas development         Creating another market for a commodity is helpful  but  as we have seen with corn based ethanol  it can have negative consequences   However  creating a product out of waste is a groundbreaking opportunity to assist our livestock farmers   You create a new market  help control waste  keep our environment clean  and create a new revenue stream for farmers   That is why this is so exciting and worthwhile   said Craig       Biogas is produced through the anaerobic digestion  AD  of animal wastes and other agricultural or organic wastes and is composed of at least 60  methane  the principal ingredient of natural gas    Biogas can be used as is on the farm or co located with another facility such as an ethanol plant  or it can be cleaned up to be used as a renewable substitute for natural gas  propane or other fossil fuels         Nelson s legislation  the Biogas Production Incentives Act of 2007 would encourage greater production of biogas for energy purposes by       Providing biogas producers with a tax credit of  4 27 for every million British thermal units  mmBtu  of biogas produced        Providing loans  loan guarantees and or grants for the multi farm collection and transportation of qualified energy feedstock from smaller livestock operations to a qualified facility  or for the purchase or construction of equipment or facilities for collection and transportation        Creating a counter cyclical safety net for biogas producers by providing payment from Commodity Credit Corporation funds to qualified biogas producers only when the annual average daily prices of natural gas falls below a certain level        The Environmental Power Corporation has estimated national biogas production potential from AD systems on dairy  swine and beef farms could exceed 340 million mmbtu of gas per year   This would be the energy equivalent of approximately 2 5 billion gallons of heating oil per year         Biogas production also offers environmental benefits such as a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions of both carbon dioxide and methane and improved water quality through better manure management        We ve made great strides in developing an ethanol industry in Nebraska and we should do more to diversify and expand our production of biofuels and renewable energy   said Nelson    My legislation will put into place tax incentives and financial support for large scale and small scale producers to get involved in biogas production         One of the major obstacles for biogas development in agriculture is the significant costs associated with it   Nebraska Farm Bureau President Keith Olsen said   Incentives for biogas production and other incentives to encourage the development of the infrastructure to support it would certainly help livestock producers who are interested in the opportunities associated with the production of biogas         There is opportunity for livestock raisers to become food and energy producers   Senator Nelson recognizes that opportunity  We appreciate his understanding that nothing produced at a livestock operation is  waste    said Michael Kelsey of the Nebraska Cattlemen        The Nebraska Pork Producers Association embraces Senator Nelson s Biogas Production Incentives Act for its recognition  incentives and use of animal and agricultural bi products to produce biogas  The Act s efforts will utilize our naturally occurring bi products to help reduce the nation s dependence on fossil fuels while providing financial incentives to Nebraska livestock producers to produce this biofuel  We encourage its passage and implementation   said Larry Sitzman of the Nebraska Pork Producers       The Nelson legislation is co sponsored by Senators Larry Craig of Idaho
