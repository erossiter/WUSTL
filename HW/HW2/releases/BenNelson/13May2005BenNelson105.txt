                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON  D C     Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson today reacted cautiously to Defense Department recommendations to close 33 major military bases and realign 29 more including Offutt Air Force Base near Bellevue     If approved  Offutt  s realignment would result in a gain of 54 military positions and a loss of 158 civilian positions for a net loss of 104 jobs   The 54 new military positions come by relocating flying related expeditionary combat support  ECS  and headquarters manpower from Pittsburgh to Offutt   The civilian positions being removed are as a result of closing the Defense Finance and Accounting Service office and will not affect military operations of the 55th Wing        The good news is Offutt will continue to play a vital role in our national defense which is changing to meet challenges of the 21st Century     said Nelson     While there is a net loss of civilian personnel at Offutt  the recommendations include bringing in 54 new military and 69 new civilian positions to support the vital missions underway at Offutt   The Defense Department obviously realizes the sizeable investment at Offutt and STRATCOM and while the mission may be changing slightly the overall importance is not diminished        In four and a half years on the Senate Armed Services Committee Nelson has been successful in directing millions of dollars to improve infrastructure at Offutt Air Force Base   Projects include  11 million for the fire rescue station   10 million for the new air traffic control tower   10 5 million for a new STRATCOM command center   19 million for the new runway   30 million for the new Air Force Weather Agency and nearly  13 million for a new child development center    In addition  Offutt has become the oversight base for the developing National Missile Defense program  the headquarters for an emerging and innovative public private partnership to monitor suspicious or terrorist activities and home for a newly created Nebraska Air National Guard Unit  the first ever to be stationed at the base      Nelson reacted with cautious optimism about recommendations to close Army Reserve Centers in Columbus  Grand Island  Kearney  Wymore  McCook  and Hastings   New information obtained by Nelson is that the recommendation is to close the existing centers in those cities but to relocate the units to new Armed Forces Reserve Centers in those cities if the Army is able to acquire land suitable for the construction of the facilities   The new centers will be capable to accommodate Nebraska National Guard Units and the Army Reservists in a joint use facility   In the case of the Reserve Center in Wymore  it would be relocated to a new center in or near Beatrice and would accommodate Army National Guard Units from Fairbury  Falls City and Beatrice  In the case of Hastings  the BRAC report recommends closing the U S  Army Reserve Center in Hastings and relocating units to a new Armed Forces Reserve Center at the Greenlief Training Site   The new center will have the capability to accommodate Nebraska National Guard units from the Guard Readiness Centers in Grand Island  Crete  and Hastings     Nelson said he has concerns about closing the Naval Recruiting District Headquarters in Omaha affecting 26 military and civilian positions and the Navy Reserve Center in Lincoln affecting 7 military positions     My hope is that if these are ultimately closed that the military positions will simply shift to other locations     said Nelson       Nelson said while he would have preferred to see no losses he pointed out that the Department of Defense provided him with an economic impact statement that states the loss of employment in the Omaha Council Bluffs Metropolitan Area amounts to less than 0 1 percent        While I  m not surprised that Offutt is not on the closing list it  s something we can never take for granted because it will be reviewed periodically and we need to take steps to assure that it won  t be closed in the future     said Nelson     I  m proud of the role STRATCOM and Offutt play in our national defense and will continue to work for improvements so that role will become even more important in the future                30
