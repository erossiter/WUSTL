by Ag Disaster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 With drought stricken portions of the country still struggling to deal with the effects of the natural disaster  Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson and North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad today introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at helping producers recover from losses to natural disasters in the 2005 and 2006 production seasons         The livelihoods of thousands of families are at stake   We need nothing less than a comprehensive disaster bill to cover 2005 and 2006 losses     Senator Conrad said       Agriculture producers in Nebraska and other states are struggling with the ongoing drought and Congress has failed to respond adequately  The problem is getting worse and Washington just doesn  t seem to get it     said Senator Nelson who toured drought stricken regions of Nebraska including Lake McConaughy and Northwest Nebraska communities fighting wildfires last month      The new ag disaster package combines legislation Senators Conrad  Nelson and others previously introduced to support ranchers and farmers impacted by drought  frost  flood and disease during the 2005 growing season with emergency legislation to aid producers suffering from the 2006 drought devastating the Great Plains     The comprehensive ag disaster package now provides emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather related crop production shortfalls  quality losses and damage to livestock and feed supplies  The bill also helps farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked following last year  s hurricanes     The bill would also expand funding for the Emergency Conservation Program  ECP   some of which could be made available for rehabilitating grass and ranch lands in western Nebraska that were damaged from the recent wildfires         When I visited fire fighting officials  emergency response coordinators and community leaders in Chadron after the wildfires were contained  I asked them how we could help  This bill will provide some meaningful and immediate assistance to Nebraskans who lost so much in those fires     said Nelson     Recognizing the devastating impact the disasters have had on the Main Streets of rural America  the bill would provide assistance for thousands of small businesses fighting to keep their doors open         The devastating impact of the drought is not reserved for farm and ranch land     said Senator Nelson    Drought affects related businesses  feed lots  grain dealers  implement dealers  and even local store fronts that service rural communities  Drought doesn  t just destroy farms  it economically damages our rural communities and threatens our rural way of life        The economic assistance package authored by Senator Conrad provides  300 million for a Small Business Economic Loss Grant Program   The provision is designed to help small  agriculturally dependent businesses that have suffered significant losses because of the natural disasters that have decimated rural economies    With many parts of Nebraska receiving only half of their normal precipitation and suffering temperatures more than 90 degrees on at least 14 days in July  many producers face dramatic losses  while ranchers experiencing feed and water shortages are selling off their herds  The Secretary of Agriculture has currently declared a total of 49 Nebraska counties agricultural disaster areas and 34 additional counties could soon receive the same designation  Adding up the crop losses  supplemental irrigation costs  and lost grazing capacity  the total direct impact of drought conditions on Nebraska crop and livestock producers has been estimated to exceed  340 million in 2006     The bipartisan ag disaster legislation was authored by Senator Kent Conrad  ND  and cosponsored by Nebraska  s Senator Ben Nelson and Senators Norm Coleman  R Minn    Byron Dorgan  D ND   Jim Talent  R Mo    Tim Johnson  D SD   Ken Salazar  D Colo    Max Baucus  D Mont    Maria Cantwell  D Wash    Dick Durbin  D Ill   Barack Obama  D Ill   and Mark Dayton  D  Minn      Senator Nelson has named the drought   David    to demonstrate that drought is a natural disaster and should be treated by Congress the same as other natural disasters like hurricanes  Nelson has pushed for comprehensive drought assistance each year and has opposed the Bush Administration  s efforts to block drought assistance in the past      A summary of the legislation is below
