introduced the  Full Service Community Schools Act of 2005   a bill to expand the number of Full Service Community Schools  which are public schools that coordinate multiple educational and social service programs with community based organizations and public private partnerships         Full service community schools provide more than just after school programs     said Senator Nelson     Their objective is to close the achievement gap between minority and non minority students and to foster community involvement in school improvement efforts          Lincoln Public Schools in Nebraska has developed an effective community learning center program that is already showing results  Many of the elements of the Lincoln program are incorporated in the Full Service Community Schools Act of 2005          I learned about the potential of Full Service Community Schools from my late wife Judy who was dedicated to improving the quality of early education programs   Full Service Community Schools improve the coordination  delivery  effectiveness  and efficiency of services to children and families   They ensure the best use of resources and they help strengthen communities   Full Service Community Schools are a 21st Century way of educating America  s children     Representative Hoyer said        The Full Service Community Schools Act authorizes funding for full service community schools  which are public elementary or secondary schools that coordinate multiple federal  state and or local educational and social service programs with community based organizations and public private partnerships  The purpose of these schools is to improve the coordination  delivery  effectiveness  and efficiency of services provided to children and families       The legislation will provide grant funding to local organizations and state collaboratives  The local groups must be comprised of community based organizations  non profit organizations or other public private entities with a plan to coordinate multiple services including education and health related services   The state collaboratives must be comprised of a combination of the state education agency and two other related government or non profit agencies          I  m very pleased that Ben has taken this initial step to help move community learning centers down the road     said Bill Johnston  Chair of the Lincoln Community Learning Centers Leadership Council     I personally think this is an outstanding concept for families to help their children achieve better reading and math scores          Nelson and Hoyer  s bill authorizes  200 million for fiscal year 2006 and similar amounts through 2010   Local grants receive 75  of funds  state programs receive 20  with 5  used for technical

in Nebraska  Nebraska community learning centers were established through a pilot program in operation in Lincoln since 1999  By 2001  14 schools in the Lincoln Public School system had started Community Learning Centers with funding from the Lincoln Public Schools Foundation  21st Century Community Learning Center  and matching resources from community based organizations   Today there are 19 Community Learning Centers in the Lincoln Public Schools system       Some of the services provided in Lincoln  s Community Learning Centers  include literacy and math programs  after school  summer and weekend programs  integrated education  health  social service  recreation and cultural programs  technology education for all ages  and parenting skills education programs         After school extended learning opportunities strengthen our students   chance of success     said Lincoln Public Schools Superintendent Dr  Susan Gourley     We know that increased parental involvement is a key variable in raising student achievement          More Information about Community Learning Centers in Lincoln  There are 19 Community Learning Centers in Lincoln    15 elementary schools and 4 middle schools     Arnold Elementary  Clinton Elementary  Elliott Elementary  Everett Elementary  Hartley Elementary  Hawthorne Elementary  Holmes Elementary  Huntington Elementary  Lakeview Elementary  McPhee Elementary  Norwood Park Elementary  Pershing Elementary  Riley Elementary  Saratoga Elementary  West Lincoln Elementary  Dawes Middle School  Goodrich Middle School  Lefler Middle School  and Mickle Middle School   Each of the 19 CLC  s in the Lincoln Public School system look different  based upon the needs of the community it serves  children  families  schools  neighborhood businesses  and patrons of the district living in that neighborhood    Together with families  community residents  and numerous community based organizations CLC  s develop partnerships that provide opportunities and supportive services that lead to improved student learning and development  stronger families  and healthier neighborhoods   Over the past few years  these programs have helped hundreds of students improve academically and provided enriching experiences that they would not have had otherwise  Community Learning Center initiatives have also brought families together and mobilized the Lincoln community into action    History of Community Learning Centers in Lincoln       In 1999  the notion of   community learning centers    peaked the interest of the Foundation for the Lincoln Public Schools   The Lincoln Community Foundation put up money to test the fit of CLCs for the Lincoln community   When they received positive feedback  the Nebraska Investment Financial Authority  NIFA  joined in  giving an additional  250 000 for the CLC endeavor   The combination of this and support of community partners gave the foundation enough funding to establish four pilot elementary school level CLCs   These centers were designed to engage community based organizations as partners in their development  The original partners were Family Service  Cedars Youth Services  YMCA  and Northeast Family Center         In 2001  after trying for 3 years  LPS received  2 3 million in federal funds for three years from the 21st Century Community Learning Centers fund    enough for nine more schools   The decision was made to interweave the CLC pilot schools funding under the 21st Centruy Grant  boosting the total number of CLCs to 13   In 2003  a state level 21st century grant allowed for the addition of two more elementary level CLCs bringing the total number to 15   As additional funding has become available  there are now 19 CLCs         Additional dollars from local funders such as the J C  Seacrest Trust  Woods Charitable Trust  NIFA  as well as national groups like the Public Education Network  PEN  help keep the blended CLC funding stream strong  but more is needed   PEN believes that school based CLCs are an appropriate mechanism to address the growing health and social service needs of children and youth  to close the achievement gap between minority and non minority students and to foster community involvement in school improvement efforts   In addition to supporting site supervisors and their interns  PEN dollars are helping to implement a major communication media campaign to build a common understanding of the concept of CLCs as more than just after school programs                                                   30
