SEN. CHAFEE SECURES $148,000 FOR DORCAS PLACE
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that he has secured $148,000 to support the Dorcas Place Career Academy Program. Awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor, the funding will enable the program to provide 60 low-income adults with customer service skills and non-technical health care customer service training. The funding was included in the FY 2005 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill,  
   "For 25 years, Dorcas Place has provided low-income Rhode Islanders with the skills they need to realize their full potential. This experience will be an invaluable asset to the success of the Career Academy Program. This award will help Dorcas Place to continue its great work in communities across the state without additional burdens on Rhode Island's taxpayers," Senator Chafee said. 
   Dorcas Place Adult and Family Learning Center assists low-income adults with literacy, employment, and advocacy services. The Career Academy Program was piloted in 2005 with 27 students enrolled in two customer service academies. This year, the new funding will allow 42 adult students to complete at least one internship at selected work sites. Within six weeks of completing the program, thirty-nine of these students will be placed in a job of at least 30 hours per week.
