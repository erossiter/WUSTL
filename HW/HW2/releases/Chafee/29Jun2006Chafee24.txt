SEN. CHAFEE LEADS BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS URGING PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION TO REVERSE THREAT OF GLOBAL WARMING
  In a bipartisan letter, 40 Senators today urged President Bush to support congressional efforts to reverse the threats posed by global warming, adding that "Leading U.S. scientists now warn that we must begin reducing global warming pollution from today's levels within 10 years in order to avoid the worst effects of global warming."  
   In the letter to the president, spearheaded by U.S. Senators Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), the senators wrote: "Last year, the resolution passed by the Senate called on Congress to enact a national program of mandatory limits on global warming pollution that slows, stops, and reverses emissions. We believe we should begin acting now to reduce emissions from current levels within 10 years. U.S. action on global warming is long overdue. As we consider legislation to address global warming, we urge you to provide leadership on this critical issue by supporting our effort." 
   "The time for Congress to get serious about climate change is now. We must take steps to reduce current harmful emissions levels to protect our planet for future generations, or risk the consequences that may result. If this crisis is not addressed soon, the devastation caused by last year's hurricane season may just be the beginning of more frequent and severe events," said Senator Chafee. 
   Senator Susan Collins said, "Scientists are finding clearer and clearer evidence that the climate is changing and that we are contributing to that change. Last year a majority of senators supported mandatory emission controls; I believe that the White House should do the same." 
   In addition to Durbin, Collins, Nelson and Chafee, other senators signing the letter are Harry Reid (D-NV); John McCain (R-AZ); Richard Lugar (R-IN); Bob Menendez (D-NJ); John Kerry (D-MA); Jim Jeffords (I-VT); Tom Carper (D-DE); Joe Lieberman (D-CT); Maria Cantwell (D-WA); Dianne Feinstein (D-CA); Evan Bayh (D-IN); Barack Obama (D-IL); Russ Feingold (D-WI); Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ); Ken Salazar (D-CO); Paul Sarbanes (D-MD); Tom Harkin (D-IA); Joe Biden (D-DE); Barbara Boxer (D-CA); Patrick Leahy (D-VT); Barbara Mikulski (D-MD); Ted Kennedy (D-MA); Chuck Schumer (D-NY); Hillary Clinton (D-NY); Christopher Dodd (D-CT); Patty Murray (D-WA); and Ron Wyden (D-OR); James M. Inouye (D-HI); Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI); Herb Kohl (D-WI); Blanche L. Lincoln (D-AR); Jack Reed (D-RI); Tim Johnson (D-SD); Mark Dayton (D-MN); and Olympia Snowe (R-ME).
