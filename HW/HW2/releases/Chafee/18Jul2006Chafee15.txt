SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $45,000 IN USDA GRANTS FOR KENT COUNTY
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has made two awards totaling $45,000 in Rural Business Enterprise Grants to the RI Resource Conservation and Development Area Council, Inc.  
   "I am pleased to hear that the USDA continues to expand access to capital, ensuring that projects such as these in Kent County can move forward to benefit residents of Rhode Island," noted Senator Chafee. 
   One $25,000 grant will be used to provide technical assistance and to finance a feasibility study to develop a plan of work that will include forest conservation practices and the regeneration of native plant species (such as Black Ash, American Chestnut, Butternut, and Walnut) which are valuable to the Narragansett Indian Tribe and tribal culture. 
   Another $20,000 in Rural Development funds will be used to provide technical assistance for the collection of (raw commercial grade) wool from approximately 45-60 Rhode Island sheep farmers, processing, spinning, weaving, and marketing of wool blankets from locally raised sheep. Funds will also be used to define a business plan for continuation of this project. 
   For more information contact Christopher Modisette, chairman of the RI Resource Conservation and Development Area Council, Inc. at 401 822-8877.
