SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $500,000 FOR RHODE ISLAND FAMILY COURT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has given a $493,322 grant to the Rhode Island Family Court as part of their fiscal year 2005 Demonstration Programs Division allocations.  
 The funding will specifically benefit the Rhode Island Family Treatment Drug Court (FTDC), which provides treatment services to parents as determined necessary by the Department of Children, Youth, and Families.
   The Court's goal is to provide parents with the necessary treatment and services to become effective parents, provide a safe and stable home environment, and become drugfree.
   "The Family Treatment Drug Court has been essential in protecting young children from parents who may pose a threat to their health due to problems with substance abuse. The programs developed by the court serve to identify and assess problems within the home, while implementing treatment programs to address the situation. This includes helping parents overcome addiction problems and teaching them the important aspects of good parenting, helping them recover and regain custody of their children. This funding will support these programs, and I am pleased the U.S. Department of Justice has decided to allocate this funding," Senator Chafee said.
   The FTDC plans to serve a minimum of 100 families over the next two years, targeting all substance-involved families with children age 18 and under who have come to the attention of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families due to abuse and/or neglect charges. The grant includes an evaluation of the FTDC by the National Perinatal Information Center, and the FTDC is required to report on its performance as it relates to the goals and services of the program.
