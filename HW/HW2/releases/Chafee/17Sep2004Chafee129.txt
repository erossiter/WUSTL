SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $155,124 HOMELAND SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANT TO CUMBERLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $155,124 grant to the Cumberland Fire Department.  
 This 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant is one of 135 grants announced this week to ensure that America's firefighters have the resources they need to protect our communities.
   The funding will be used for Fire Operations and Firefighter Safety. This program includes training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "I am pleased that the Bush Administration continues its commitment to making first-responder funding a priority," said Senator Chafee. "These funds will help in a big way to help public safety personnel do their jobs and to keep us safe."
   The Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. The funds are used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, new fire apparatus, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety Programs.
