SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES EPA SETTLEMENT REGARDING CENTERDALE MANOR RESTORATION PROJECT IN NORTH PROVIDENCE
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reached a settlement with the owners of Brook Village and Centerdale Manner in North Providence.  
 This will allow the two parties to resolve their financial liability for contamination at the Centerdale Manor Restoration Project.
   "I am pleased to announce that the EPA has reached an important settlement on the Centerdale Manor Superfund site in North Providence. Under the terms of the agreement, the owners of the Brook Village and Centerdale Manor apartments will pay a total of $3.5 million toward cleanup costs. With the assistance of Rhode Island Housing, the deal is structured to maintain the affordability of the apartments, and none of the tenants in the 225 affordable elderly housing will be displaced," Senator Chafee explained.
   Under the agreement, Centerdale Manor and Brook Village will pay $3.2 million to the United States and $277,000 to the State of Rhode Island. The parties will also fund an escrow account at $150,000 for any outstanding obligations under the previous order at the site.
   These funds will be generated through refinancing mortgage transactions that both parties will enter into with Rhode Island Housing. As part of the refinancing, both properties will remain as affordable housing for the next forty years. The settlement payments represent the maximum equity that can be realized from the refinancing transactions. As part of this settlement and refinancing, both parties will receive a covenant from the EPA not to sue for future costs.
   Once the EPA announces the settlement officially, there will be a 30-day public comment period on the settlements.
