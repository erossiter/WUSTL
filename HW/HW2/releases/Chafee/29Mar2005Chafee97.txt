SEN. CHAFEE DELIVERS $100,000 TO CODAC IN CRANSTON
  Sen. Chafee today visited Edgewood Highland School in Cranston to announce that he has secured $100,000 in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill for CODAC's "ABC Choices" program, as well as to meet students participating in the initiative. 
   "When I first learned about this program, I immediately knew what an important resource this would be for our youngsters," said Senator Chafee.
   "I was glad to secure an initial $65,000 in 2001 to improve the program and expand it into a number of other school systems across the state. Seeing the success that this program has had over the past couple of years, I was pleased to be able to secure an additional $100,000 this past year to continue and enhance the many advances the program has made," Chafee concluded.
   CODAC Behavioral Healthcare started this initiative in the Cranston school system in the late 1990s as the Adolescent Behavior Control program. The intent was to provide school-based counseling to at-risk middle school students, with a particular focus on helping them manage their anger and build healthy relationships. In 2001, CODAC asked for federal funding to improve the program and expand into a number of other school systems. Subsequent funding was secured last year to continue the program. It is offered in the following communities: Cranston, East Greenwich, Johnston, Little Compton, Middletown, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and Tiverton.
   CODAC Behavioral Healthcare is a nonprofit organization in Rhode Island that provides outpatient counseling in a number of areas, ranging from substance abuse to gambling to domestic violence. It was originally known as a "Community Organization for Drug Abuse Counseling" but has since adopted the acronym as its official name.
