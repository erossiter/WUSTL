SEN. CHAFEE SECURES $250,000 FOR PROVIDENCE NEIGHBORHOOD INVESTMENT PROGRAM
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has secured a grant totaling $248,000 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the city of Providence, he announced today.  
 The funding will be used by the Providence Neighborhood Investment Program (PNIP), which provides assistance to economic revitalization projects in distressed communities around Providence. The grant was requested by Chafee and was included in the 2005 HUD appropriations bill.
   "The Providence Neighborhood Investment Program has been part of a bold plan by the city of Providence for revitalizing neighborhoods across the city, strengthening the economic base in these areas as well as restoring quality of life," Senator Chafee said. "This money will be very useful in implementing grassroots projects aimed at revitalizing neighborhoods, creating jobs and providing opportunities for members of the community to succeed," he explained.
   With this award, PNIP will complete projects in distressed neighborhoods that will have a positive impact on the physical character of the area while creating jobs and other opportunities for residents. Importantly, funds will be used for catalyst-type projects - those that begin the process of turning the neighborhood around by creating jobs and eliminating poverty.
