SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES MAJOR GRANTS FOR RHODE ISLAND BROWNFIELDS SITES
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has selected three projects in Rhode Island to receive funds from the Brownfields Program. The program was created by legislation authored by Senator Chafee and signed into law by President Bush in 2002. Sen. Chafee's legislation provided increased funding for brownfields and included important liability relief for those parties involved in economic redevelopment of brownfield sites. 
   "As Chairman of the Superfund Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Brownfields, I am very aware of the impact that these dollars will have on the Rhode Island communities that receive them," Chafee said when he was informed of the grants. "As a leader in industrial production for most of the last two centuries, Rhode Island is full of sites that are ripe for redevelopment and these important Brownfields dollars will provide the basis for sound economic development," Chafee continued.
   The grants have been made for the following projects:
   * $600,000 for Revolving Loan Fund - The Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation will receive a total of $600,000 for a revolving loan fund grant. With this money, the EDC, in partnership with the City of East Providence, will make low interest loans and subgrants for Brownfields cleanups across the state.
   * $200,000 Cleanup Grant - The Meeting Street National Center of Excellence site in Providence, RI will be restored. Grant funds will be used to clean up five properties along Eddy and Haswell Streets that comprise the seven-acre Meeting Street site. The properties are a mix of former residential and commercial sites where the soil appears to be contaminated with lead, arsenic and other hazardous substances.
   * $200,000 Assessment Grant - The City of Cranston will receive assessment grant funds that will be used to conduct a citywide Brownfields inventory, prioritize sites, perform several Phase I and II environmental site assessments, and create a public involvement program.
   * $400,000 Assessment Grant - The Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation will receive funds, $200,00 for hazardous substances and $200,000 for petroleum, to perform Phase I, II and III assessments throughout the states 39 municipalities. Grant funds will also be used for community outreach programs.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program is designed to empower states, communities and other stakeholders in economic development to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields. A brownfields site is real property, the expansion, the redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.
