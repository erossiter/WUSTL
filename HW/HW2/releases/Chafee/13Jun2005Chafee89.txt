RHODE ISLAND COUNCIL FOR HUMANITIES RECEIVES FUNDING TO CONTINUE PROGRAMMING ON AMERICAN HISTORY, CULTURE
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities (RICH) will be the recipient of grant awards potentially totaling $51,560. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has awarded RICH an outright grant totaling $36,560 as well as a $15,000 grant to be awarded on the condition that the Council matches the amount with non-governmental funds. Executive Director Sara Archambault recently said that RICH has every intention of finding the means to match the funding. The award has come as part of NEH's "We the People" grants, distributed to state humanities councils for programming on themes in American history and culture through radio, television, and public lectures. Entitled "Access and Audience Development: Responding to Community and Increasing Service at RICH," the program will focus on increasing and deepening audience involvement with the humanities. Sen. Chafee is the Honorary Chairman of the Board of Trustees for RICH. 
   "I have always expressed strong support for increasing awareness and education in the humanities, and I am very pleased that these funds have been allocated to support the great work the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities has already started," Senator Chafee said. "Using resources such as radio, television, and public lectures, the Rhode Island Council will be able to expand its programs to a broader audience in Rhode Island." Chafee further explained.
   Four programs will be funded through NEH's "We the People" initiative:
   * First, a portion of the funding will be devoted to support for RICH's collaboration with RI PBS. This project entails outreach via year-round television programming designed to target audiences in their homes. Throughout 2005, RICH and RI PBS have and will continue to broadcast one film per month that explores the "American Dream." The series reflects on this cultural ideal from several perspectives, including the immigrant experience, the legacies of slavery, rising from poverty, and others.
   * Additionally, funds will continue to support screenings of winning selections from RICH's Short Film Initiative (SFI). Through this program, local filmmakers create short documentaries featuring a RI connection. By using this method, the Council hopes to create a more interesting method for engagement with RI scholars than the traditional panel discussion. The short videos are either researched in consultation with or involve interviews with scholars. Due to the positive public response, RI PBS and RICH are continuing their collaboration in 2006, recently selecting the theme "Common Thread: What Unites Us? What Divides Us?"
   * Third, the "Action Speaks: Urban Dialogue for a Healthy Democracy" program is a series of panel discussions, recorded and broadcast for a radio audience. "Action Speaks" is committed to enhancing cultural life in RI by providing high-quality, intellectual discourse and encouraging dialogue on issues of public interest and concern. Panels are comprised of humanities scholars and practitioners in relevant fields representing varied knowledge and experience.
   * Finally, a portion of funding will be devoted to Enrichment Opportunities (EO), RICH's Speakers Bureau. Used by community organizations, religious institutions, senior centers, libraries, historical societies, and schools, EO includes lectures, performances, and workshops on an array of humanities topics: civic life, education, philosophy, books, as well as people and places of both local and national significance.
   "In each of these programming endeavors, the purpose is the same: to make humanities scholarship meaningful for all Rhode Islanders. With these projects, RICH hopes to fulfill the goals of the 'We the People' initiative by providing Rhode Islanders with many opportunities throughout the year to thoughtfully engage with our state's and our nation's culture and history. RICH is honored to receive this grant support from the NEH," said Sara Archambault, Executive Director of RICH. For more information, please visit www.rihumanities.org.
