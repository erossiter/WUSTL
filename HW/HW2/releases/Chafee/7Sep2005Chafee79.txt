MEETING STREET RECEIVES OVER $600,000 FOR NEW RECREATIONAL FACILITY
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has announced that a total of $644,800 will be given to the Meeting Street National Center of Excellence from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the construction of a new facility and recreation space.  
 The award was secured by Sens. Chafee and Reed, both requesting funding in the 2005 HUD appropriations bill. Located in East Providence, Meeting Street offers children with disabilities and their families a fully accessible, stateof- the-art environment where they can receive a high quality education and have access to clinical expertise, special equipment, and community-based inclusive academic resources in the same setting as their peers without disabilities.
   "Meeting Street is a national leader in providing education, treatment, and developmental services to children with disabilities. The recreational space created with this award will be a valuable addition to a neighborhood that currently has few open areas or green space," Senator Chafee said. "The expansion will also allow the school to provide additional services and new programs to children with and without developmental disabilities and their families, as well as creating a significant number of jobs, revitalizing the area both environmentally and economically."
   Meeting Street's redevelopment plans include the establishment of an elementary, middle, and high school, with a planned gymnasium, a therapeutic pool, a Family Resource Center, library, outdoor play areas, community meeting space, and outdoor athletic fields, most of which would be available for community use. The project is expected to create approximately 369 new jobs, and will be located on a federally designated Brownfields area. Senator Chafee visited Meeting Street in February, 2005.
