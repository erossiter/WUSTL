SEN. CHAFEE SECURES $246,807 FOR AMERICAN SAIL TRAINING ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that he has helped secure a grant totaling $246,807 for the American Sail Trailing Association (ASTA). ASTA offers programs to urban and disadvantaged youth to build character, foster teamwork, and develop leadership qualities, by connecting students' academic lessons to real-life experiences while learning how to sail. By utilizing member tall ships and sail training vessels, the ASTA program provides positive life-changing experiences for these youth in underserved communities.  
   "This program is an excellent to way build self-confidence among at-risk youths. These young people will gain invaluable skills through the hands-on experience of sailing on beautiful Narragansett Bay," Senator Chafee said. "This award will help ASTA to reach more children and continue its great work in Rhode Island." 
   ASTA's mission is to encourage character-building through sail training, promote sail training to the North American public, and support education. ASTA is a nonprofit organization that represents nearly 300 tall ships, sail training organizations, and schools in more than 25 states. 
   "This funding will help us get young Americans, including some from Newport and other areas of Rhode Island, out on the water for education and character-building experiences," stated Peter A. Mello, ASTA executive director. 
   The grant was funded through DOJ's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), which was established in 1974 to support state and local efforts to prevent delinquency and improve the juvenile justice system. OJJDP provides national leadership, coordination, and resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization.
