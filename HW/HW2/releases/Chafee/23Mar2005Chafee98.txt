SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES OPENING OF 2005 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is now accepting applications for two separate programs falling under their jurisdiction - the 2005 Competitive Training Grant Program (CTGP) and the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP).  
 Rhode Island has received funding under both programs in 2004.
   "Equipping public safety officials with the resources and training necessary to protect the communities they serve is important to ensure the safety of the people of Rhode Island," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased the Department of Homeland Security has made these funding opportunities available, and I encourage all public safety organizations in Rhode Island to submit a proposal," he continued.
   The 2005 CTGP provides finding for training initiatives to prepare state agencies to prevent, deter, respond, and recover from incidents of terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). State and local public safety organizations interested in applying for the program are required to submit a concept paper that demonstrates the applicant's ability to develop and deliver a WMD response training program.
   The deadline to submit a concept paper is April 8th. For further information, contact (800) 368-6498, or visit www.ojp.usdoj.gov/odp
   Additionally, the AFGP will be accepting electronic applications to assist local fire departments and non-affiliated emergency medical services providers with the acquisition of equipment, vehicles, and training. Program guidance is available at www.firegrantsupport.com. Interested applicants may call the Fire Grant Help Line at (866) 274-0960 for additional information. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis. The deadline to submit an electronic application is also April 8, 2005.
