SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES LABOR DEPARTMENT DECISION: ASSISTANCE NOW AVAILABLE FOR FORMER EMPLOYEES OF UNION WADDING COMPANY OF PAWTUCKET
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor has determined that all workers of Union Wadding Company of Pawtucket are now eligible to apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance. 
   An investigation was initiated on November 15, 2004 in response to a petition filed by a company official on behalf of workers at the firm that produced non-woven roll goods and trim-a-tree merchandise. The Department of Labor surveyed the firm's major customers regarding their purchases in 2002, 2003, and January through November of 2004 and found increases in customer imports of these products. In addition, the study also revealed that sales, production and employment had decreased absolutely in November of 2004 due to closure of the production facility.
   In conclusion, Linda G. Poole, certifying officer in the Labor Department's Division of Trade Adjustment Assistance, determined "that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with those produced at the subject firm contributed importantly to the decline in sales or production and to the total or partial separation of workers of that firm."
   As a result, "all workers of Union Wadding Company, Pawtucket, Rhode Island who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after November 9, 2003 through two years from the date of certification are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974."
   Since the Department also determined that the workers' skills are easily transferable, they are not eligible to apply for alternative trade adjustment assistance (ATAA) for older workers under Section 246 of the Trade Act of 1974.
