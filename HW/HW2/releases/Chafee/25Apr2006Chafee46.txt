SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $1.8 MILLION TO ASSIST VICTIMS OF CRIME
  Today, Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) announced the allocation of $1,838,000 to the Rhode Island Justice Commission (RIJC) to assist victims of serious crimes. The award, granted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the fiscal year 2006 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Assistance program, will be distributed to organizations that provide direct services to crime victims.  
   "For twenty years, VOCA has been the primary means by which the Federal government has supported critical services to aid victims of crimes. Deriving its funding from fines and other penalties paid by federal criminal offenders, the program has effectively financed critical assistance programs without placing the financial burden on taxpayers. This substantial award will extend services that are important in assimilating victims back into society at no cost to the American taxpayer," Senator Chafee said. "I support continued strong funding for the VOCA program," he said. 
   The RIJC will use this award to enhance crime victims' services in Rhode Island. Critical services are made available to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, drunk driving, elder abuse, and all other types of criminal activity. Services include crisis intervention, emergency shelter, mental health counseling, justice advocacy, and many others. 
   Senator Chafee has been a strong supporter of the VOCA program, previously joining in authoring a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science in opposition to Administration proposals to rescind all amounts remaining in the Crime Victims Fund. Resources for the Fund come from the collection of Federal criminal fines, not taxpayer revenues.
