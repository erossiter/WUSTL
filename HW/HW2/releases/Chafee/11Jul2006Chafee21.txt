SEN. CHAFEE SECURES $198,000 FOR TOWN OF WEST WARWICK
  Today, Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced that the town of West Warwick has been granted $198,000 for the West Warwick River Walk Project, a 1.5 mile economic development initiative at the center of town. Chafee secured the funding as part of the fiscal year 2006 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) appropriations legislation. The award will help fund the construction of the proposed River Walk, located in the Arctic section, at the center of the Pawtuxet River Valley. Arctic was a major cultural and economic hub in the state before shopping malls were built in a neighboring town.  
   "Like the Blackstone River Valley, this region was an important area of early industrial activity significant to the growth of the United States," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased to have helped secure funding for investment in the River Walk, which will promote a rediscovery of this important heritage, create jobs, and boost commerce in West Warwick." 
   The grant was funded through a HUD Economic Development Initiative, and marks a significant step toward completing the development of the River Walk. 
   In addition to Chafee's efforts, voters have supported a state bond to finance a portion of the project, and the Rhode Island General Assembly has established a Municipal Economic Development Zone in the Arctic that will reduce sales taxes for ten years at businesses that invest in the community.
