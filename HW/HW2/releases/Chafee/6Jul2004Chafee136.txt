SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES GRANT TO ASSIST SENIORS IN UNDERSTANDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID BENEFITS
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has notified him that the Administration on Aging has awarded Aging 2000, Inc. a $175,000 grant for the Senior Medicare Patrol Project.  
 The award will be used to educate seniors on how to be better health care consumers.
   "Providing Rhode Island's seniors with the information on how to properly understand the benefits of both Medicare and Medicaid, as well as how to detect and report fraudulent activity is an important step in the effective operation of our health care system," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased that this money is being made available to ensure this education is made accessible to all of our seniors, should they desire," he continued.
   Aging 2000 has worked in conjunction with the Department of Elderly Affairs, The Alliance for Better Long Term Care, RSVP, West Bay Community Action and the Urban League of Rhode Island in the advancement of the Senior Medicare Patrol Project. The project educates retired senior volunteers to help Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries better understand the system. 
   Additionally, older Rhode Islanders and their families are educated along with health care providers to better identify, understand, and report Medicare and Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse. Aging 2000 first received this award in 1997, and since that time Medicare fraud overpayments have been reduced from $23 billion in 1997 to $12 billion currently.
