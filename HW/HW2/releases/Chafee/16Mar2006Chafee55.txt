SEN. CHAFEE REITERATES HIS OPPOSITION TO CENSURE RESOLUTION
  "As I stated on Tuesday, I do not support Senator Russell Feingold's resolution to censure the President. In a news article, the Providence Journal reporter chose to interpret the notion that I will not rule out the censure of any president in any number of hypothetical circumstances as an endorsement of the drastic censure resolution currently being offered in the Senate. This is misleading considering my recent comments on this issue. From the first mention of this resolution, I have never expressed support for it. I have joined colleagues on both sides of the aisle in calling for a vigorous dialogue about the balance between civil liberties and national security. I believe that as the only bodies authorized to be briefed on the full range of the wiretapping program, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees must conduct the necessary oversight, reach a final conclusion and make recommendations. I stand by that position."
