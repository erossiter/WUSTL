SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $1.65 MILLION EMERGENCY FUNDS TO REPAIR DAMAGED ROADS IN RHODE ISLAND
  Today, Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced that Rhode Island will receive $1.65 million in federal funding to pay for roads and bridges damaged by the flooding that affected Rhode Island in October, 2005. Allocated by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration, the money will be used to reimburse states for expenses associated with the emergency situation.  
   "With the allocation of these federal dollars, Rhode Island can recoup many of the expensed incurred in the wake of last October's flooding," Senator Chafee said. "Now, those costs associated with repairing damaged roads and bridges will not be paid for by the local taxpayer," he continued. 
   "These funds are crucial to restoring communities and getting local economies back on track," said Acting U.S. Transportation Secretary Maria Cino. 
   The projects paid for by the funds include reconstructing or replacing damaged highways and bridges, establishing detours, removing debris, and replacing signs, lighting and guardrails. Heavy rainfall and flooding caused much of the road and bridge damage. 
   "Our priority after a natural disaster or emergency is repairing the transportation network so local communities can rebuild, businesses can reopen and people can resume their lives," said Federal Highway Administrator Richard Capka. 
   Today's announcement is part of an emergency supplemental appropriations package approved in June by Congress and signed by President Bush that supplements FHWA's emergency relief program. The program is available to reimburse states for certain costs resulting from natural disasters or other emergencies.
