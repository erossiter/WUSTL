SEN. CHAFEE, SECRETARY OF STATE RICE DISCUSS PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS
  Today, Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) questioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, of which Chafee is a senior member. Their discussion centered on the recent Palestinian parliamentary elections, and the Hamas victory. Following the hearing, Sen. Chafee made the following comments: 
   "There is no doubt that the victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections has created a disastrous situation. I believe that while not directly responsible for the outcome of the elections, the United States should have done more on key issues to ensure that both sides met their commitments under the Road Map following the election of Mahmud Abbas, and before the recent Palestinian parliamentary elections.
   "I continue to be a strong supporter of the goal of a peaceful, viable and contiguous Palestinian state. Not only is this two state solution in the interest of keeping Israel safe and secure, it is also in the interest of the Palestinian people, and, importantly, in the interest of United States' national security. If our standing in the Arab world remains unfavorable, our objectives regarding the spread of democracy and the eradication of terrorism are compromised. Neglecting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only exacerbate this problem in the future."
