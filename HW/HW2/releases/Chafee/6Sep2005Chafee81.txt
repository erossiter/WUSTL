SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO REDUCE DRUG-RELATED CRIMES IN PAWTUCKET
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has announced today that the City of Pawtucket will receive $225,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice's Community Capacity Development Office for the continuation of its Weed and Seed Program.  
 The program's objectives are to help law enforcement officials reduce drug related crime in the Pleasant View community, therefore reducing the overall crime rate.
   "Across the State and the Nation, the Weed and Seed Program has proven to be effective in crime reduction and increasing community policing efforts, giving local residents a sense of ownership of their community," Senator Chafee said. "With assistance from the Weed & Seed program, the City of Pawtucket has been able to implement strategies designed to 'weed out' criminals who participate in violent crime and drug abuse, and also to 'seed' the area with human services aimed at prevention, intervention, treatment, and neighborhood revitalization," he continued.
   Located in the Northeast Section of Pawtucket, the Pleasant View Weed and Seed program received official recognition in February 2001. This award represents the site's fifth and final award to implement its strategy. Community policing will play a primary role in building positive community relations and reducing criminal activity. Prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies will provide opportunities for residents of all ages to participate in human service programs. In addition, neighborhood restoration goals will include implementing a multi-faceted, holistic approach that is grounded in the direct participation of residents as leaders and through the development of a comprehensive community strategies plan.
