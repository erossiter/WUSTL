SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE FOR DISPLACED EMPLOYEES OF PINNACLE MEDICAL SERVICES OF RHODE ISLAND
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation (RIEDC) has agreed to provide assistance to employees of Pinnacle Medical Services of Rhode Island (Pinnacle) whose jobs are slated to be terminated when their office closes on June 30, 2006.  
   Pinnacle, a subsidiary of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arkansas, which administers Medicare claims for Rhode Island beneficiaries, has decided to transfer services provided by its Providence facility to its Arkansas office, in what the company asserts will be a cost cutting move. 
   In response to calls for help from Pinnacle Employees, Senator Chafee contacted Michael McMahon, Executive Director of RIEDC, to find a way to assist them. As a result, arrangements have been made for a majority of these displaced workers to be considered to fill positions at the new Bank of America call center in East Providence. 
   "This is encouraging news and I appreciate EDC's quick response to this matter," said Senator Chafee. "If you are an employee of Pinnacle Medical Services of Rhode Island and are about to lose your job as a result of its closure, please call Paul Harden of the RIEDC at 401-222-2601, extension 149."
   Contact: Stephen Hourahan, 202/224-6167.
