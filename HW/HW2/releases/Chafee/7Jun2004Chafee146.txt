SEN. CHAFEE COMMENTS ON DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN
  COMMENTS OF SENATOR CHAFEE ON THE DEATH OF RONALD REAGAN
   "A strong, principled leader, President Reagan used his optimism and humor to help the nation feel better in a post-Vietnam, post-Watergate country coping with an energy crisis and high inflation. He brought strong leadership and could relate to people from all walks of life very, very easily. With tremendous vision and dignity, President Reagan will ultimately be remembered for ending the Cold War and promoting freedom and democracy throughout the world in a peaceful way. The Chafee family offers our sincere condolences to Nancy, and the Reagan family."
