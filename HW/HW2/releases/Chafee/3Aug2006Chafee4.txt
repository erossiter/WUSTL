CRANSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES EDWARD BYRNE MEMORIAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the Cranston Police Department (CPD) will receive a grant for $29, 218. The grant was awarded by the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Program, which helps to support local law enforcement needs.  
   The CPD will use these funds to create and implement a departmental operations manual, purchase computer equipment, and attend a training conference. The manual represents the first effort to compile a single comprehensive guide for the department. The CPD will then be eligible to receive accreditation through the Commission Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). 
   "Every little bit helps the departments which are always looking for more funding," said Senator Chafee. "I am pleased that the Cranston Police Department applied for and received grant money for this important project."
