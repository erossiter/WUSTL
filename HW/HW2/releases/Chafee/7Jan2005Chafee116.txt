SEN. CHAFEE SECURES $150,000 FOR CITY OF NEWPORT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today visited the Newport Police Station to announce that he has secured $150,000 in federal funds for the City of Newport.  
 The funding, which was included in the FY05 Commerce-State-Justice Appropriations bill, will allow the Newport Police Department to begin implementing its Newport Area Interoperable Surveillance Network. This integrated video monitoring system will enable local public safety agencies to detect and deter any problems and risks to safety.
   "Newport is one of the world's most beautiful destinations, and at the height of the busy tourist season, there can be substantial challenges for public safety first responders," noted Senator Chafee. "Risks to the security of the harbor and the bridge would have a significant ripple effect throughout our state, as well as on the Naval operations that take place here."
   The Newport Police Department, as the city's Emergency Operations Center will have primary monitoring responsibility for the Newport Area Interoperable Surveillance Network. A police mobile command vehicle will be a secondary monitoring site, along with other area public safety agencies. Local law enforcement and security agencies, including Coast Guard, police, fire, and Naval personnel will have early indications of threats and risks through this new communications system.
   "In this new era of increased homeland security regulations, it is important that we give local communities the necessary tools and funding to implement these new projects," said Senator Chafee. "With my new assignment on the Senate's Homeland Security Committee, I will be working to support the development of proper preparedness and response programs throughout our state."
