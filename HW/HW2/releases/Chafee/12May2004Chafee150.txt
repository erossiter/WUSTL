  CHAFEE STATEMENT ON NICK BERG MURDER
   I want to offer my heartfelt sympathy to the family of Nick Berg for their loss.  
 All Americans are appalled at the gruesome way that this talented young man lost his life. I will work to see that the perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice.
   On a recent visit to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial with my children, I was struck by a quote of his that really brings this situation home "I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed. I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war."
