NASA AWARDS BROWN UNIVERSITY OVER $1 MILLION IN GRANTS
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee was recently notified that NASA has awarded Brown University a total of $1,081,572 in funding as part of its Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PG&G) program.  
 The grants will support research and data collection to improve the understanding of the formation of the Earth and solar system. The goal of the program is to streamline the gathering, synthesis, and comparative study of data that will ultimately help scientists understand the extent and influence of planetary geological and geophysical processes on bodies of our solar system, including its origin and evolution, as well as the nature of Earth and the history of its formation in comparison to other planets.
   "With this funding, Brown University can continue the information gathering and data analysis which may ultimately lead to important scientific breakthroughs regarding the origins of our planet and the larger solar system," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased NASA has recognized Brown for its excellent work and has awarded these funds to ensure that it will continue," he continued. 
   The PG&G program provides funding for specific investigations of planetary surfaces and interiors, satellites (including the moon) and satellite systems, ring systems, in addition to smaller solar system bodies such as asteroids and comets. The grants have been allocated to five proposals by Brown, and are listed as follows:
   * Planetary Impact Processes - $450,000 
   * Volcanic Landforms and Deposits on the Moon and Venus: Ascent and 
  Eruption Processes and Implications for Geological Evolution - $269,000 
   * Geological Mapping of Ganymede: A Post Galileo View - $180,000 
   * The Rheology of Particulate-Bearing Water Ice, with Applications to Mars, Icy Satellites, and Earths Cryosphere - $142,572 
   * Remote Assessment of Mineralogy - $40,000.
