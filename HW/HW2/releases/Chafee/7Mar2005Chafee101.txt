SEN. CHAFEE COMMENTS ON JOHN BOLTON'S NOMINATION TO BE AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
  "The nomination of Undersecretary of State John Bolton brings a seasoned member to the Diplomatic team that will represent us through some very difficult times ahead. 
   Undersecretary Bolton has been an outspoken critic of the United Nations (UN). However, I have been assured that he will bring a more balanced approach to his new role. While I believe that the UN is a worthy organization that accomplishes much good, such as administering the recent elections in Iraq, I also understand that it needs to move forward with necessary reforms to improve the organization.
   I look forward to speaking with Undersecretary Bolton at his confirmation hearings about the myriad issues that he will be confronting if he is confirmed.
   I am saddened that the United States will no longer have the respected, moderate voice of John Danforth representing us at the United Nations."
