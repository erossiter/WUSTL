SEN. CHAFEE SEEKING INTERNS FOR SPRING SEMESTER
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that his Providence office is seeking interns for the 2005 spring semester. 
   Senator Chafee noted, "This is a great opportunity for any college student who wishes to learn more about our American government and I encourage anyone who may be interested to apply."
   As interns in the state office, students will learn about how government operates and responds to the needs of constituents. They will gain valuable work experience assisting staff in writing letters, handling legislative research, and responding to concerns of residents. Interns also lend a hand with general office duties.
   Individuals with excellent writing skills and a strong interest in government should send a cover letter and resume to Senator Lincoln Chafee, 170 Westminster Street, Suite 1100, Providence, RI 02903, Attention: Tim Mooney. Deadline for applications is Tuesday, January 18, 2005.
