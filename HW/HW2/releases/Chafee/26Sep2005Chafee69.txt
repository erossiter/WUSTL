WOONSOCKET TASK FORCE ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE RECEIVES $500,000
  Today, Sen. Lincoln D. Chafee joined Woonsocket Mayor Susan D. Menard at Woonsocket City Hall to announce a Drug-Free Communities grant from the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy. The award will be distributed to the Woonsocket Task Force on Substance Abuse (WTFSA). A member of the President's Drug Control Policy Office notified Chafee of the award, which totals $500,000 for five years. 
   The funding will allow the WTFSA to strengthen its coalition work as it continues to focus on its mission of developing, implementing, and advocating effective communitybased substance abuse prevention initiatives in the City of Woonsocket.
   "The allocation of this highly competitive grant is great news for the city of Woonsocket and a testament to the exceptional work being performed by the staff of the WTFSA. Involving students, parents, and teachers in prevention efforts is an effective strategy to surround impressionable young people with positive messages about the negative effects of drugs and substance abuse," said Senator Chafee. "This approach of education through every avenue available will reach students and help them develop a peer base that will provide a positive influence," he continued.
   The program has set forth the following goals and strategies to improve its overall effectiveness:
   * Assessing, expanding, and empowering WTFSA coalition membership by placing a focus on diversity, strengthening leadership skills, and increasing collaboration with other substance abuse organizations;
   * Developing and implementing communication strategies to raise community awareness about the dangers of youth access to alcohol, marijuana, and steroid use. To realize this goal, WTFSA plans to collaborate with the Woonsocket Police Department, faith-based organizations, and minority cultural organizations to initiate a media campaign with strong, direct messages aimed at changing community norms and behavior regarding alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and steroid use, in addition to increasing public awareness of penalties related to purchasing for or selling substances to minors;
   * Decreasing youth access to alcohol and tobacco by increasing compliance checks and party patrols;
   * Developing a strong parental leadership component to the efforts of WTFSA by increasing education to Hispanic families through bilingual literature which highlights the risks of drug use as well as how to educate youth and improve their drug resistance skills. In addition, WTFSA will engage a range of parents to act as spokespeople for campaign efforts, raising community awareness on prevention, risk, and resistance;
   * Increasing youth leadership, decision-making, and drug resistance by providing more opportunities for youth to develop leadership skills;
   * Developing the next three-year substance abuse plan by utilizing updated community needs assessment data as well as by engaging key community leaders, parents, and the general public to work together to develop an effective, comprehensive plan.
   Mayor Menard praised the efforts of the staff at WTFSA: "I thank the efforts of Lisa M. Carcifero, Executive Director of WTFSA and those involved in these important programs that help our citizens on a daily basis. Substance abuse prevention programs that are run by WTFSA play a critical role in encouraging all to stay drug free," she said.
