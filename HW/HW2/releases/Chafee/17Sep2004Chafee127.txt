NARRAGANSETT INDIAN TRIBE RECEIVES $211,759 FOR TRIBAL OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has been notified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) has awarded the Narragansett Indian Tribe a $211,759 grant for the creation of the Tribal Office of Environmental Protection. The goal of the office is to help improve the Tribe's self-sufficiency in preserving the reservation lands, providing the Tribe with the means of improving the quality of life for all Tribal members. 
   "The Narragansett Indian Tribe has always maintained a tradition of protecting and preserving their Tribal lands, which include some of Rhode Island's most beautiful areas," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased that the Administration for Native Americans has acknowledged the respect the Tribe has for the environment as well as their commitment to its upkeep and preservation," he continued.
   In addition to the initial creation of the Tribal Office of Environmental Protection, funds will be used to pay the salaries of staff members, who will be responsible for the set up and management of the new office. An environmental consultant will also be hired to advise and assist in the promulgation of environmental regulations that will govern Tribal Trust lands, to reflect the goals and objectives of the Environmental Protection Office. Some of the major objectives of the office will include:
   * A reorganization of the Tribe's environmental protection services under one office, including the incorporation of the existing Tribal Department of Natural Resources, creating the needed environmental codes and overall policy base to direct future activities in environmental protection. 
   * Facilitating proper environmental protections by maintaining the Narragansett culture and heritage. The new office will work closely with the Tribe's youth and elders to involve them in proper environmental protection activities.
   * Sustaining an efficient, cost-effective method of environmental protection, characterized by conservation, policy compliance and pollution prevention.
   * Developing an environment that provides a place for housing, health and social services, economic enterprises, cultural expression and governance of the Tribe's people.
