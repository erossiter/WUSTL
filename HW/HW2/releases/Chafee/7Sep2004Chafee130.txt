SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $77,842 GRANT FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION IN RHODE ISLAND
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the Rhode Island Department of Health will receive $77,842 to improve child and adolescent health by enhancing their capacity to prevent violence.  
 The State Health Department is one of eight recipients to receive funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the two-year program that will work to support change in societal norms and environmental conditions contributing to violence.
   "Through this funding the State will be able to focus on protecting and preventing our youth from becoming involved in violence," said Senator Chafee. "It will strengthen our efforts to prevent violence in our communities with financial support, training and technical assistance to better understand the situations that contribute to and help people avoid violence."
   The program will provide information on risk and protective factors for various forms of violence including youth suicide, child maltreatment, teen dating violence, sexual violence, school violence, community violence and bullying. Research findings will be used to guide the development of prevention strategies that can address these forms of violence.
   Rhode Island was selected from a number of applicants that were reviewed by public health experts. Other states selected for funding include Colorado, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Virginia.
