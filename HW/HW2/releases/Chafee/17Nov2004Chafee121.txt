PAWTUCKET WOODLAWN WEED AND SEED PROGRAM AWARDED $225,000 GRANT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee was notified today by the U.S. Department of Justice that the City of Pawtucket has been awarded $225,000 for the Pawtucket Woodlawn Weed and Seed Program.  
 The grant, awarded by the by the Community Capacity Development Office will be used for the continuation of the program, designed to weed out crime and seed a better neighborhood in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Pawtucket.
   "Only one year after it's inception, the Woodlawn Weed and Seed Program has proven effective in crime reduction, increasing community policing efforts resulting in an overall positive impact on the communities around Pawtucket," Senator Chafee said.
   This funding marks the second award for the Pawtucket Woodlawn Weed and Seed Program, whose goals primarily focus on increased law enforcement, prevention, intervention, and treatment, as well as neighborhood restoration of communities within the Woodland neighborhood. The designated area includes the City of Central falls to the north, the City of Providence to the south, and the Downtown Central Business District to the East.
   During this second period of the program's implementation, law enforcement efforts will focus on reducing instances of overall crime in the community, with a specific focus on drug-related crime. An increase in police presence will play an essential role in achieving this goal. Prevention, intervention, and treatment objectives will include providing opportunities for youth and families through the establishment of safe havens and positive youth development. Finally, neighborhood restoration goals will include implementing a multi-faceted, holistic approach that is grounded in the direct participation of residents as leaders and through the development of a comprehensive community strategies plan.
