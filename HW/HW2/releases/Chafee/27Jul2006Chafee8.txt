GAO REPORT CRITICAL OF CLEAN AIR
  At the request of Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) effectiveness in limiting toxic air emissions, as governed by the Clean Air Act. Chafee made the following comments in response to the report's findings, which were critical of the EPA's regulation of clean air:  
   "I would like to express my appreciation to the staff of the GAO for issuing this report. The GAO's findings clearly indicate that the EPA has a long way to go in meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act. In light of this information, I believe the Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which I am a member, must have a stronger role overseeing the EPA and its progress. Furthermore, I believe periodic assessments are necessary to determine where funding gaps exist for the Agency that, if closed, would allow the EPA to meet its Clean Air Act requirements."
