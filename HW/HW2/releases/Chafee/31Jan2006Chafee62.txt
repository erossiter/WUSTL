SEN. CHAFEE PRAISES LIFE OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  Today, Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) made the following comments after learning of the passing of Coretta Scott King, widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.: 
   "It is with great sadness that I learn of the passing of Coretta Scott King. A remarkable woman, Mrs. King capably took up the crusade for universal civil rights and equality following her husband's assassination in 1968. In her subsequent years, she worked to continue her husband's legacy, establishing the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, and successfully lobbying for the designation of husband's birthday as a national holiday in 1985.
   As the matriarch of the King family in times of unprecedented racial tension, she held them together despite death threats and the bombing of her home, in addition to the stabbing, and numerous arrests of her husband.
   Following her husband's death, Mrs. King was a tireless advocate for social justice, working to ensure that all people were afforded the same opportunities to achieve the 'American Dream,' regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, age, or economic status. She fought for economic equality, a better system of health care, better educational opportunities for the less fortunate, nuclear disarmament, and environmental protection.
   My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to members of the King family, particularly her four children, and all that were touched by the message that she and her husband worked tirelessly to weave into the social fabric of the United States."
