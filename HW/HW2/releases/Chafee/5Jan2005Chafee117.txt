SEN. CHAFEE NAMED CHAIRMAN OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON FISH, WILDLIFE, WATER
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee was selected chairman of the Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife, and Water of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW).  
 Falling under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee are many of the key issues dealt with by EPW, including water infrastructure projects, endangered species legislation, clean water/water pollution issues, as well as virtually all fish and wildlife issues; including fisheries, wetlands and wildlife refuges. The selection was made Tuesday by members of the committee.
   "I am honored to receive this subcommittee chairmanship where I can be an effective advocate for clean water and an updated water infrastructure, as well as fisheries - all projects particularly important to Rhode Island. I wish to thank Chairman Inhofe for this opportunity to chair this important subcommittee," Senator Chafee said.
   Senator Chafee takes the helm of the subcommittee building on an exceptional record as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Superfund and Waste Management, where he was a strong advocate for the protection of the environment. While chairing this committee, he introduced and passed legislation to clean up and reuse abandoned and contaminated properties, known as Brownfields. He also sponsored a measure to implement the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, in addition to a bill to provide new funding to help prevent groundwater contamination caused by leaking underground storage tanks.
