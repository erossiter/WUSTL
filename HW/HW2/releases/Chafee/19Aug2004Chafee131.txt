SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $13,387 USDA GRANT FOR MOBILE VILLAGE IN MAPLEVILLE
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a $13,387 Water and Waste Disposal Grant for the Maplehill Mobile Home Park Residents' Association in Mapleville, Rhode Island.  
 The Rural Development funds will be used to complete a preliminary engineering study on the park's water system.
   "This Predevelopment Planning Grant will provide the Village at Maplehill with the capital needed to identify the upgrades required to ensure that the park's septic system operates in an environmentally responsible way," said Senator Chafee.
   The mobile home park has its own water system, which currently serves 198 mobile homes, and approximately 750 users. The preliminary engineering report will provide the necessary information to determine its condition, capacity, and projected life. This will allow the Association to plan for future repairs and improvements.
   The Village at Maplehill received a $1.1 million in FY 2004, a loan of $271,575 and a grant of $814,725 in FY 2002.
