SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES NOMINEE FOR U.S. ATTORNEY
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that President George W. Bush will be sending the name of Robert Corrente to the United States Senate for confirmation to fill the position of United States Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. 
   In making the announcement, Chafee highlighted Corrente's keen intelligence, independent thinking and his wide range of legal experience.
   "Robert Corrente is a superb choice for U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island. He has a stellar reputation among his peers and is widely regarded as a talented litigator. He brings solid leadership experience to the position as a partner at Hinckley Allen, and former Chair of the Rhode Island Judicial Nominating Committee, appointed by Governor Almond. Bob's role as Chairperson of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Ethics Advisory Panel has given him valuable preparation for the demanding job of U.S. Attorney. There will be many challenges that he will face immediately upon his arrival and I am confident that he will meet those and be an outstanding U.S. Attorney for the people of Rhode Island," Chafee said
   If confirmed by the Senate, Corrente will replace Craig Moore who has been acting U.S. Attorney since the retirement of Meg Curran.
   Corrente is a 1978 graduate of Dartmouth College and he graduated from New York University School of Law in 1981. He is a Partner in the Litigation Practice Group at Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP in Providence and a member of the Rhode Island, Massachusetts and American Bar Associations.
