RHODE ISLAND RECEIVES FUNDING FOR NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has been notified that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the Rhode Island Justice Commission a grant totaling $294,000 for improved access to criminal history and sex offender record systems.  
 The award comes as part of the 2005 National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP), which assists states in improving the Nation's public safety by enhancing the quality, completeness, and accessibility of the Nation's criminal record systems and the extent to which such records can be used and analyzed for criminal justice and authorized noncriminal justice programs.
   "I am always happy when federal agencies recognize Rhode Island for the allocation of federal funding, allowing for our state to purchase the most technologically advanced crime-fighting equipment while minimizing the burden on the RI taxpayer," Senator Chafee said. "Through the installation of these new instruments, the safety of Rhode Island's citizens will be enhanced, via a coordinated effort to allow criminal records to be accessed on a national level. The rapid identification of criminal violators from other states is important to ensure that those persons are sanctioned appropriately."
   Funds will be used for the purchase and installation of software for the Rhode Island Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (RILETS), as well as livescan systems for eight local agencies within the State, which will enable electronic fingerprint transmission at the time of arrest. Additionally, the Restraining/No Contact Order Database will be enhanced to improve the acceptance rates of protection orders when they are submitted to the National Crime Information Center. Technical support will also be provided for systems, network, and telecommunications services to the users of the RILETS network.
