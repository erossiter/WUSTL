SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION FOR CITY OF WOONSOCKET
  The City of Woonsocket will receive grant awards totaling $1,958,310 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today. All of the funds will go to help reduce housing and shelter costs in Woonsocket, making living more affordable for low and moderate income residents.  
   Of the award, $1,356,180 will be awarded under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, while $544,272 will be awarded as part of the HOME awards program. Additionally, the Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) Program will receive $57,858. 
   "I am very pleased to hear of this substantial award which will help Woonsocket improve its shelters and urban housing, while also making infrastructure and other improvements to serve those in need," Senator Chafee said. 
   Under the CDBG program, the funding will help develop a viable urban community in Woonsocket by assisting with the cost of providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, while expanding economic opportunities for low and moderate income citizens. 
   The HOME program will help increase the supply of decent, affordable housing to low and very low income families by supplementing the costs of Woonsocket's housing programs. 
   Finally, the ESG funds will be used to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters throughout the Woonsocket area.
