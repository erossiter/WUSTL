SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY GRANT FOR DISPLACED RHODE ISLAND WORKERS
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has dispersed a National Emergency Grant Award of $625,000 to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training.  
 This funding is earmarked for employment transition services for workers dislocated from Cranston Logistics and Swarovski North America located in Cranston, Rhode Island, Sun Life Financial located in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and Boston Financial Data Services, Inc., located in Providence, Rhode Island.
   "It is so important that these funds are put to the support and training of these Rhode Islanders," Senator Chafee said. "I am hopeful that this money will go a long way towards aiding in their transition to new career opportunities."
   Authorized through the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, this grant will help to provide an array of services for approximately 150 individuals displaced by the closing of these branches and companies in Rhode Island. The services outlined in this grant include assessment, individual counseling, career planning, employment development, retraining, occupational skills training, job-readiness training, and adult education. Supportive services often include childcare, transportation assistance and job-related certifications, uniforms, and equipment. The U.S. Department of Labor provides the grant to the state, which in turn is charged with delivering tangible services to dislocated workers.
