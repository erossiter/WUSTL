SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES GRANT TO REDUCE GUN-RELATED CRIMES
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice has notified him that the Rhode Island Justice Commission will receive a $232,197 grant from the Office of Justice Programs as part of an ongoing effort to reduce firearms-related crimes.  
 The award is part of the Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative, a national program that aims to reduce gun crime by working with municipal programs that target these crimes, and providing prevention programs with additional resources necessary to operate successfully.
   "Reducing the number of gun-related crimes is the fundamental step in ensuring the safety of the people of Rhode Island," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased that this money is being made available to help local law enforcement work together with both state and federal authorities to achieve this objective," he continued.
   The fiscal year 2004 Rhode Island Project Safe Neighborhoods program will continue to operate using a multi-pronged approach, as it did during fiscal year 2003. The strategy includes community prosecution, specialized police tactics, as well as youth outreach programs structured to combat gun crime in Providence. In addition to reducing firearms-related crimes committed by both juveniles and adults in Providence, the program's goals include the detection and tracking of hotbed areas for gun-related crimes, as well as the assessment of current officer deployment strategies, investigative efforts, and project activities designed to reduce firearms-related offenses. Additionally, the program aims to evaluate local communities that are affected by gun-related violence in order to develop and strengthen relationships with neighborhood residents.
