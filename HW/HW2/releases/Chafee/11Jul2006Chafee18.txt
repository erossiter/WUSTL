SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON INDIA COMMUTER RAIL ATTACKS
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) issued the following statement regarding reports of several explosions on Mumbai train lines:  
   "The attack which took place today on Mumbai's commuter rail was a truly a deplorable act, and those responsible should be sought out and brought to justice. 
   As the death toll continues to rise, it is becoming clear that yet again innocent civilians have been chosen as targets. My thoughts go out to the victims and their families at this time. I believe it is important that we look deeply into the causes of these events to ensure that civilized nations are doing everything possible to prevent these attacks."
