SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES INDIAN HOUSING FUNDS
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today expressed his concern about reductions in funds allocated to the Narragansett Indian Tribe to provide suitable living conditions for the Tribe's residents.  
 Under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Indian Housing Block Grant program, the Tribe has recently received $589,825 for fiscal year 2005, a 13 percent reduction in funding from fiscal year 2004. Funding is supposed to receive another substantial cut in fiscal year 2006, when it is expected that $370,000 will be given to the program.
   The reductions in funding have significantly hampered the Tribe's plans to build additional housing units. Approximately 42 tribal members are on a growing waiting list for housing assistance. Currently, some tribal families are without housing and living in tents on Narragansett Property.
   "In this time of crisis both at home and abroad, I appreciate the budget constraints that threaten many government programs. I am, however, concerned if such cuts put Rhode Island Residents in jeopardy. I hope that adequate funding levels can be maintained for this critical housing program," Senator Chafee said.
   As part of this annual funding, two replacement homes have already been built, and plans have been approved to construct one additional house. Funding will also go to repair and renovate additional homes, which are deteriorating. Repairs to several septic systems and wells will also be undertaken with this funding.
