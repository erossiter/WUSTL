SEN. CHAFEE SECURES ADDITIONAL $1.35 MILLION FOR RHODE ISLAND PUBLIC TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) has received additional funding in the amount of $1,351,372 from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The award will provide the balance of RIPTA's fiscal year 2005 funding for the purchase of vehicles. The current funds, in addition to the $2,535,741 already secured by Sen. Chafee, provide a total of $3,887,113. RIPTA will use these funds for the procurement of seven fixed route replacement buses. 
   Senators Chafee and Reed requested the funds as part of the fiscal year 2005 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act.
   "I am happy to hear that RIPTA has been awarded these funds which will help replace its aging transit buses and commuter bus coaches, as well as to expand flex-route services with additional vehicles," Senator Chafee said. "RIPTA now has been given an opportunity to move forward aggressively in improving the existing high quality of service it provides, resulting in an even more dependable transportation system. Rhode Islanders can look to RIPTA to continue to be an outstanding, economical, and environmentally responsible way to get to work, school, or anywhere else around the state," he continued.
   RIPTA's General Manager Alfred J. Moscola was also pleased with the award:
   "These federal funds will help us strengthen our fleet by replacing aging equipment with new fixed-route buses. This funding will also allow us to expand our Flex Service, which is especially designed for underserved communities in our state's suburban and rural areas. Thanks to this appropriation, we'll also be able to enhance security at Elmwood facility. We thank Senator Chafee for his terrific assistance in securing federal funding for Rhode Island's public transportation network," he said.
