SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO NATION
  Chafee Statement on the President's Address to the Nation:
   "I was heartened to hear the President reaffirm his support for comprehensive immigration reform in last night's address. I agree that a more secure border needs to be the cornerstone of our immigration policy, and I look forward to examining the President's proposal to temporarily deploy the National Guard to supplement federal border control efforts.  
   I also support the President's call for substantial improvements in personnel and technology at our border. As a cosponsor of the McCain/Kennedy immigration legislation, I have supported such increases as well as other facets of the President's plan. 
   I stand behind the President's proposal for a temporary worker program, which would meet the needs of our economy by matching foreign workers with employers who have unfilled jobs. By requiring potential workers to pass criminal background checks and returning them to their home country at the conclusion of employment, our nation's security would be enhanced. 
   Finally, I support the President's realistic approach to addressing the millions of undocumented immigrants that are already here. I agree that illegal immigrants should be held accountable for breaking the law. This should include payment of back taxes, working in a job for several years, undergoing rigorous background and security checks, learning English and American civics, and satisfying additional criteria. After immigrants meet all of these requirements, they should be able to apply for citizenship, placed at the back of the line behind those who abided by the rules and followed the law. 
   This is a contentious issue that affects most Americans. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle to enact a responsible plan to address all aspects of the immigration issue."
