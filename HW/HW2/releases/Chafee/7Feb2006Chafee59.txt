SEN. CHAFEE COMMENTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  "The budget proposal that the President has forwarded to Congress obviously reflects the President's priorities. Congress must now begin the process of attempting to reconcile the President's priorities with our own. As the Senate works through the budget process, I will be seeking ways to ensure that my priorities receive adequate funding, while attempting to steer Congress away from increasing deficits and debt. 
   I am pleased that the President has recognized the need to reform the Congressional budget process. I was happy to see at least a modified paygo (pay-as-you-go) proposal. While it applies only to mandatory spending, this is at least a step in the right direction. The President has also proposed funding of $50 million to implement programs to reduce diesel fuel emissions - something I have supported in the past as a cosponsor of the authorizing legislation.
   While fiscal discipline must be our priority, there are some areas where the President's budget either cuts too deeply or fails to recognize the positive impact of a program. We need to increase maximum Pell Grant awards, and meet our obligations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Further, we cannot continue to reduce federal revenues while continuing to adequately fund our national priorities. We should not do harm to vital programs for the needy such as Medicaid and Medicare and we need to pay for any tax cuts. I will urge my colleagues to proceed cautiously when dealing with these issues.
   I am mindful that at the end of the day, the President's budget proposal is only that: a proposal. We in Congress must continue to work to rein in deficits while keeping our commitments to national priorities such as fighting the war on terror, education, the elderly and veterans."
