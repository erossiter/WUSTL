SEN. CHAFEE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO DESIGNATE NEWPORT REVOLUTIONARY WAR ROUTE NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) has cosponsored legislation to designate a historical revolutionary war route which originates in Newport as a National Historic Trail. The trail is a 650-mile path that was traveled by French troops under the command of General Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau to join forces with General George Washington's revolutionary army and defeat the British, thus winning the Revolutionary War.  
   The Washington - Rochambeau Revolutionary Route, as it will be known, was taken in 1781-1782 and spans from Newport, Rhode Island to Yorktown, Virginia. The Journey began in Rhode Island, where General Rochambeau led the French army out of Newport and Providence to join with Washington and his rebel army. 
   "Rhode Island has no small place in our country's history," Senator Chafee said. "This is an example of the instrumental role played by our state's people, location, and resources were to the founding of this country, and I am pleased to join in introducing this legislation which recognizes yet another instance in which Rhode Island was central in shaping the history of our nation." 
   Chafee joins Senators Lieberman (D-CT), Warner (R-VA), and others as an original cosponsor of S. 3737, the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act. If passed, the Act will designate the route as a National Historic Trail, and will give administrative authority over the trail to the Secretary of the Interior.
