SEN. CHAFEE HOSTS HEARING ON RHODE ISLAND'S PREPARATION FOR 2006 HURRICANE SEASON
  Today, at the request of Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs conducted an extensive field hearing to assess Rhode Island's readiness for the upcoming hurricane season.  
   Chafee, a member of the Homeland Security Committee, hosted and participated in the hearing, titled "Rhode Island Homeland Security Priorities: Preparation for the 2006 Hurricane Season," which was held at the Rhode Island Foundation building in Providence. The hearing was convened by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), the Committee's Chairman. 
   "Hurricane Katrina showed us in very vivid fashion that threats to our nation occur in many different forms, and Rhode Island is no stranger to the devastating effects of hurricanes," Senator Chafee said. "Under the stewardship of Senator Collins, the Homeland Security Committee has held extensive hearings on the federal, state, and local response to Hurricane Katrina, and we have found numerous problems in coordination between key government agencies. As we work to correct these problems and ensure that they are not repeated, I requested this hearing to assess Rhode Island's preparedness and level of vulnerability should a category four or five hurricane hit our coastline. I would like to thank Chairwoman Collins for agreeing to hold today's hearing on this vital topic." 
   The Committee heard testimony from a panel of state and federal officials on Rhode Island's preparation and planning for the upcoming hurricane season as well as what resources have been dedicated to hurricane preparedness, and what else may be necessary. Additionally, the committee heard testimony on the federal government's role in disaster preparation, and Rhode Island's overall preparedness for all potential disasters. The Panelists included: 
   * R.I. Governor Donald L. Carcieri, 
   * Providence Mayor David Cicilline, 
   * Executive Director of the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency Chief Robert J. Warren, 
   * Acting Region I FEMA Director Kenneth Horak, 
   * Adjutant General of the Rhode Island National Guard Brigadier General Robert Thomas Bray, and 
   * Fire Chief and Emergency Management Director of Warwick John E. Chartier
