SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON MIERS
  "Harriet Miers has a long and distinguished record of service to her community and country. 
   While this is important, the United States Senate is required to make a comprehensive review of all candidates in order to provide the necessary advice and consent. Unfortunately, after a review of Ms. Miers record, many questions about her judicial philosophy remained that could only be answered through the release of internal White House documents. Ms. Miers recognized that this release could threaten the independence of the Executive Branch.
   I respect the decision of Ms. Miers to withdraw her nomination. I know that she has accomplished much in her career and wish her the very best as she continues her distinguished service to our nation."
