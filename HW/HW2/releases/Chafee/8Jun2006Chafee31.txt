SEN. CHAFEE COMMENT ON DEATH OF ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Chafee Comment on the Death of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi:   
   "Our men and women serving in the U.S. military should be commended for their quick and decisive action in striking and killing terrorist leader Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and several of his cohorts. 
   Zarqawi's brutal tactics of suicide and roadside bombings threatened the safety of our military as well as innocent Iraqi civilians. His death is a significant blow to the terrorist network within Iraq. Although significant challenges remain, this is a positive step in reducing the violence in Iraq."
