SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES OVER $3 MILLION FOR CITY OF PAWTUCKET
  The City of Pawtucket will receive grant awards totalling $3,272,546 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sen.  
 Lincoln Chafee announced today. All of the funds will go to help reduce housing and shelter costs in Pawtucket, making living more affordable for low and moderate income residents.
   Of the award, $2,330,954 will be awarded under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, while $851,176 will be awarded as part of the HOME awards program. The remaining $90,416 will be allocated as part of the Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) Program.
   "This funding is critical in supplementing Pawtucket's budget, allowing the City to make much needed improvements to its urban communities without relying on property tax revenue," Senator Chafee said. "Whether it is through the replacement of eroding infrastructure, assisting in the cost of home heating, supporting community food banks, or even assisting with home loan programs, the benefits resulting would not be possible without this federal assistance."
   Under the CDBG program, the funding will help develop a viable urban community in Pawtucket by assisting with the cost of providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and will expand economic opportunities for low and moderate income citizens.
   The HOME program will help expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low and very low income families by supplementing costs of Pawtucket's housing programs, assisting them in meeting local needs and priorities.
   Finally, the ESG program will use funding to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters throughout Pawtucket.
