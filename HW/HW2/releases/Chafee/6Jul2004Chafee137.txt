SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES GRANT TO ASSIST CHILDREN WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has notified him that Qualitymetric, Inc., has been awarded $103,579 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  
 The award will be used to further the development of an effective system to measure the health status of children with chronic health conditions across a wide variety of medical care settings and services.
   "Developing a system to provide Rhode Island's children with a practical and precise system to evaluate and treat them for a variety of medical conditions is a top priority of mine," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased that this money is being made available to ensure that a proper data collection and evaluation process is in place," he continued.
   Primarily, the funding will be used to resolve issues surrounding the conceptual framework, sampling, and data collection used to develop a generic, computer-adapted testing (CAT) system for measuring the health and functioning of children. The main goals of the planning grant include:
   * Developing a conceptual framework, and constructing definitions and specific content to provide for a broad conceptualization of "health status". These include the domains of physical functioning, psychological well-being and social and role participation.
   * Demonstrate the validity of data collection on the internet from both caregivers and children.
   * Build a prototype web-based Pediatric Health Status CAT and evaluate its feasibility, accuracy and efficiency.
