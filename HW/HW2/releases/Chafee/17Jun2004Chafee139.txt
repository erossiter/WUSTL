  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has notified him that the Rhode Island Hospital will receive a $60,289 grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences for trauma and inflammation research training.  
 The award will be used to further the training and development of trauma scientists and advancing the understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-related disease.
