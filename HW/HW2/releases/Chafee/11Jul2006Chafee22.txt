SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $400,000 FOR VICTIMS OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that Women and Infants Hospital will receive a $399,869 grant for the "Depression Prevention for Poor Pregnant Women" study, which seeks to reduce the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) in economically and socially disadvantaged women. PPD is depression that occurs in 10-16% of women who have recently given birth.  
   "Postpartum depression is a serious public health problem, which affects more than 400,000 mothers and their families each year. As a husband and father, I recognize the importance of a mother's mental and physical health for her newborn and family. This program will allow health care providers to better prevent the onset of postpartum depression in Rhode Island's most at-risk mothers," Senator Chafee said. 
   The grant, awarded through the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), will be used to study the effectiveness of intervention programs in treating pregnant women on public assistance who are at risk for PPD. Specifically, the trial will examine the usefulness of the Reach Out, Stand Strong, Essentials (ROSE) program for new mothers, which targets economic and social risk factors that may play a significant role in the development in PPD. Unlike many methods of treatment, the ROSE program identifies and treats mothers before and after they give birth. 
   "I am pleased that the NIMH has awarded the Women and Infants these funds. By better identifying high risk patients and administering successful prevention techniques, I hope we can reduce the incidence of harmful outcomes associated with PPD."
