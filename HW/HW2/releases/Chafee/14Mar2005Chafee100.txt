SEN. CHAFEE SECURES $620,887 IN STATE WILDLIFE GRANTS
  U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works' Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife and Water Chairman Sen.  
 Lincoln Chafee announced today that Rhode Island has received a $620,887 State Wildlife Grant (SWG) from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The funding will be used to protect and preserve natural habitats supporting rare and unique species via land acquisition. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) will be responsible for the distribution of the monies.
   "Preserving, protecting, and increasing habitats in Rhode Island that sustain wildlife is one of my primary concerns, and I am pleased that funding has been allocated to the Department of Environmental Management to serve this purpose," Senator Chafee said. "I have full confidence that the great staff at DEM will formulate and conduct a comprehensive search for available land, and that they will make an outstanding choice for the use of these funds," he continued.
   This grant will add to previously awarded funding which RIDEM will use to develop a comprehensive conservation development plan for acquiring lands. Following the development of the plan, a parcel of land will be determined for acquisition, then purchased. Currently, the RIDEM has received approximately $2.5 million in funds as part of the State Wildlife Grant program.
   "As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife, and Water, I will continue working to protect wildlife and their habitats," Chafee further stated.
