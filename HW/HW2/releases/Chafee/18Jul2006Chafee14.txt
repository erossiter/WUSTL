SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $5,000 USDA GRANT FOR SHELLFISH STUDY IN NARRAGANSETT BAY
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a Rural Business Enterprise Grant of $5,000 for the RI Rural Development Council. The funds will be used for technical assistance to prepare a mussel production feasibility study for the West Passage in Narragansett Bay.  
   "Not every problem requires a million dollar solution. USDA has been an important partner in this effort, and I'm hopeful that the study will yield a good product that Rhode Island's shell fishermen can take to market," said Senator Chafee. 
   The feasibility study seeks to employ a method to move or transplant mussels to colder, deeper waters within the Bay area at a specific time of the year so as to minimize the impact of spawning pea crabs which adhere to the shells of mussels, thus causing restaurants to consider the product inferior. Developing a method for protecting Rhode Island mussels from predators will make the mussels more marketable thus retaining fisheries' jobs and potentially increasing the incomes of local commercial fishermen. 
   The RI Rural Development Council also received two grants totaling $28,000 in FY 2006 and a $12,000 grant in FY 2005.
