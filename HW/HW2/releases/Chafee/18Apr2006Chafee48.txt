SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERROR ATTACK IN TEL AVIV
  Sen. Chafee Statement on Monday's Terror Attack in Tel Aviv:  
  "Monday's terror attack in Tel Aviv, in which nine people were murdered, is a terrible tragedy and a vicious act of violence. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the fallen, as well as to those who were injured, including the 16 year old American who is in serious medical condition. 
   Each terror attack is awful in its own right. Yet this attack, which a Hamas spokesman called 'a legitimate act of self-defense,' has dire implications. While Palestinian President Abbas described the attack as 'despicable,' he has been accused by some as having committed an offense for his correct characterization of the bombing. 
   I believe a peaceful, contiguous Palestinian state living side by side with a safe and secure Israel is in everyone's best interest - the Palestinians, the Israelis, the region, the United States. Movement toward that solution simply cannot happen when a terrorist organization runs the Palestinian Authority and refuses to take even the most basic step, namely renouncing violence, to become a legitimate governing entity. It is more imperative than ever that we strengthen the voices of non-violence amongst the Palestinians, especially that of President Abbas. 
   I believe the terror attack is a tragic setback to the peace process and in the strongest possible terms I condemn the attacks, and those, including Hamas, who condone them."
