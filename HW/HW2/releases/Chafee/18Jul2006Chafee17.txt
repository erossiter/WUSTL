SEN. CHAFEE STANDS IN SUPPORT OF STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Today, Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) cast votes in strong support of the expansion of stem cell research, a scientific breakthrough which has the potential to be effective in the improved understanding and treatment of deadly and disabling diseases and conditions that affect more than 100 million Americans.  
   "I was proud to support groundbreaking legislation which may help us to understand, treat, and defeat debilitating diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and many others," Senator Chafee said. 
   "We in the United States Senate should not stand in the way of progress. Expanding the current federal stem cell research policy to include stem cell lines regardless of the date on which they were derived from a human embryo will include stem cells created for fertility procedures that are no longer needed for clinical purposes. This expansion would help scientists explore this promising research without the restrictions of the Administration's current policy," he continued. 
   Chafee voted for three measures: 
   * H.R. 810: The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act: This legislation expands the President's stem cell research policy to include stem cell lines from embryos created at fertility clinics. The embryos must be in excess of clinical need, voluntarily donated by their owners for no compensation. Chafee is an original cosponsor of an identical measure (S. 471) which originated in the Senate. 
   * S. 2754: The Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act: This act encourages the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to explore alternatives to embryonic stem cell research which would derive stem cells without destroying embryos. The measure also encourages adult stem cell research. The act does not change current law or provide NIH with authority to do research that it is not already capable of doing. 
   * S. 3504: The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act: This bill prohibits scientists from cultivating embryos whether by a natural pregnancy or by artificial means exclusively for research purposes. Scientists are not engaging in this practice currently nor are there plans to do this. This bill is a preemptive measure to prevent this kind of research from ever taking place.
