SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTH KOREA WEAPONS TESTING
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, released the following statement regarding the test-firing of at least six missiles over the Sea of Japan on Wednesday morning.  
   "I am greatly concerned about North Korea's reluctance to heed the warnings of neighboring countries in conducting weapons tests. Unfortunately, this action by North Korea will have an adverse effect on the stability of the region and must be taken very seriously. However, I support the White House's commitment to a 'diplomatic solution' at this time. 
   Certainly, calls from the international community for economic sanctions on North Korea will be an option. Indeed, this will undoubtedly put increased pressure on the Chinese - as they retain large economic interests in North Korea and provide food to that nation's impoverished - as they will have to decide whether to join these calls for sanctions. Any economic sanctions imposed on North Korea should be done in close conjunction with China. 
   While this test was clearly a sign of defiance towards the U.S., the failure of the Taepodong missile sent a very clear statement that North Korea's capabilities are far behind the rhetoric coming out of Pyongyang. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I look forward to working with Chairman Lugar and others in monitoring this situation carefully and determining what actions the United States should take in the future. Anytime the arms race escalates, it is a serious concern and it is in all of our best interests to get back to arms control"
