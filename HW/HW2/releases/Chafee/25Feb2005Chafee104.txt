RHODE ISLAND AWARDED $589,670 TO IMPLEMENT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REEMPLOYMENT, ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has been notified by the U.S. Department of Labor that Rhode Island has been awarded a grant in the amount $589of,670 for the implementation of a new system to provide reemployment and eligibility assessment (REA) services to claimants of unemployment insurance benefits.  
 The funding will be used to conduct in-person assessments of claimants at One-Stop Career Centers throughout Rhode Island. It will also provide states with the resources needed to help unemployment insurance beneficiaries ease their search for jobs, and expose them to various services offered at the Career Centers.
   "The funding provided by this grant will bolster the effectiveness of Rhode Island's existing Career Centers, helping those receiving unemployment insurance locate and secure good jobs," Senator Chafee said. "I am pleased this funding has been allocated by the Department of Labor and I hope this new program will continue to be funded in the future," he continued.
   This announcement for fiscal year 2005 represents the first year that funds have been awarded under this program. The funds will be dispersed to each of Rhode Island's six One-Stop Career Centers, located in East Bay (Warren), Pawtucket, Providence, Wakefield, West Warwick, and Woonsocket.
