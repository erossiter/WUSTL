YOUTH IN ACTION RECEIVES GRANT TO PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded Youth in Action (YIA) a grant in the amount of $49,600.  
 The funds will provide substance abuse prevention/reduction programming that aims to help high risk youth avoid substance abuse and related risky behaviors, and challenge them to grow into successful community leaders.
   "Providing programming that aims to teach kids to stay off the street and to give back to the community as leaders is the major function of Youth in Action. In this time when state and local budgets are tight, federal monies are essential to keep these programs functioning to strengthen our most needy communities." Senator Chafee said.
   YIA is the only non-profit organization in Rhode Island that specifically focuses on youth leadership development. Based in Providence, YIA's mission is to empower low income, urban youth to strengthen local communities. For seven years, YIA has been a place where more than 450 youth have participated in advanced, hands-on leadership training, helping more than 9,400 youth with HIV, pregnancy prevention, street outreach, violence prevention, arts activities, and community renovation projects.
