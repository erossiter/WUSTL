SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES ADDITIONAL $7.26 MILLION IN LIHEAP FUNDING FOR ENERGY AID
  Sen. Chafee has announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded Rhode Island an additional $7,263,573 to help low-income Rhode Island families pay their heating bills. The funds are being administered under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) administered by HHS. Rhode Island received this amount as part of $1 billion in emergency LIHEAP funding released today by HHS, which included $500 million in emergency contingency funds for areas most adversely affected by rising energy prices. Chafee voted to approve the legislation providing the $1 billion, and Rhode Island has benefited from additional LIHEAP funds that will help subsidize energy costs for its neediest residents.  
   Throughout fiscal year 2006, Rhode Island has been the recipient of $21,581,127 in LIHEAP funding. 
   "I am very pleased to hear of this award, and I am especially proud to have supported the legislation, which provided a substantial increase in funds to help Rhode Island residents meet their home heating needs," Senator Chafee said. "As our state faces some of the nation's most expensive energy costs, this money is vital to improve the quality of life for so many Rhode Islanders. It is my sincere hope that the administration takes a critical look at the need to release the additional $101 million in emergency assistance currently in reserve," he continued. 
   Senator Chafee has been a consistent advocate for the release of additional LIHEAP funding, writing to President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Frist requesting $900 million in emergency funding as part of a comprehensive appropriations package addressing the impacts of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, he joined a bipartisan group of Senators in writing to Senate Committee on the Budget Chairman Judd Gregg and Ranking Member Kent Conrad, requesting $3 billion to fund LIHEAP as part of the fiscal year 2006 budget. Chafee also requested that the allocation provide for advance funding for fiscal year 2007 to pre-purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in the spring and early summer.
