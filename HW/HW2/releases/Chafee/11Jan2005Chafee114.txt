SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE TSUNAMI DISASTER
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee recently commented on the tragic loss of life and devastation caused by the Indian Ocean earthquakes and tsunamis. 
   "I have been saddened to see the unfolding tragedy that has affected over a dozen nations on the Indian Ocean, causing massive loss of life and devastation across these countries. My thoughts and empathy certainly go out to the victims and their families at this difficult time.
   "I am pleased that President Bush appointed former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton to spearhead the fundraising mission for the victims and their families. This bipartisan effort of working together to help out those in need is indicative of the true spirit of America, and I am thankful that partisan differences have been put aside to help the nations ravaged by this disaster."
   Chafee also applauded the recent work of the 109 th Congress in passing a provision allowing taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions made in January 2005 for the relief of victims in areas affected by the tsunami on their 2004 tax return. The provision was signed into law January 7 th .
   For those interested in helping out the victims of the tsunami, information about organizations helping disaster victims can be found on both the USA Freedom Corps and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) websites.
