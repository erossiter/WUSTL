SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES RAYTHEON CONTRACT MODIFICATION
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee has been notified that the U.S. Department of the Navy has awarded Raytheon Co. a $13,152,658 contract modification for 35 weapons replaceable spare and repair parts for the MH-60R Airborne Low Frequency Systems (ALFS).  
 Of the award, 67 percent or $8,812,280 of the work will be performed in Raytheon's Portsmouth facility.
   "I have always taken pride in Rhode Island companies such as Raytheon, and their contributions to the production of military equipment," Senator Chafee said. "I am thankful that the Navy has awarded this contract modification to Raytheon, and I hope they continue to remember the contributions of Rhode Island companies when making future contract decisions," he continued.
   ALFS is the primary sensor of the anti-submarine warfare helicopter. The system is capable of deploying and retrieving the sensor from a hovering helicopter, to a depth of 2,400 feet. When integrated into the MH-60R Helicopter, ALFS provides the capability to command, process, and output sonar data, as well as process sonobuoy signals while the helicopter is hovering. The sonar also provides environmental data gathering, acoustic signal analysis data gathering, and underwater communication capabilities. Funds will not expire at the end of the fiscal year.
