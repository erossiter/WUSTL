SEN. CHAFEE ISSUES STATEMENT ON TAX CUT VOTE
  "The middle class taxpayers who are targeted by these cuts are very deserving of tax relief.  
 I have supported these tax cuts in the past and would be willing to support them now if they are done in a way that does not increase the debt. I have worked diligently with some like-minded colleagues to identify ways to pay for these changes. I am dismayed that the Congress has again been put in the position of choosing between short-term political gain and responsible fiscal management. I for one am very reluctant to saddle future generations with the bill for this fiscally ruinous policy."
