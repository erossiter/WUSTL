SEN. CHAFEE APPLAUDS NEW SECURITY MEASURES AT T.F. GREEN AIRPORT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today praised an announcement by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) selecting T.F. Green State Airport as the first of five airports to install a new explosives trace detection portal at a passenger security checkpoint in the Rhode Island airport. T. F. Green will be used to test the cutting-edge technology and its effectiveness in an airport environment. 
   "I applaud the efforts of the TSA and of T.F. Green officials in bringing this innovative device to Rhode Island," Senator Chafee said. "This technology is an important step in advancing airport security and I am pleased that T.F. Green is at the forefront of airport safety and transportation security," he continued.
   The trace portal machines, the GE EntryScan3, will begin an operational testing period today at T.F. Green, and by the end of July will be implemented in four (4) additional airports across the country. The tests will continue for approximately 30 to 45 days in each airport. At T.F. Green, passengers will enter the trace portal after they have passed through one of the airport's metal detectors, and while standing still will receive several quick "puffs" of air, which are then analyzed by the portal for traces of explosives. Information gathered from this observational test and evaluation will be essential in evaluating security programs in the future, as well as for specific threat conditions, special events, or other modes of transportation.
