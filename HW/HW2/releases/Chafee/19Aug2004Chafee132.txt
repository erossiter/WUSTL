SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES USDA GRANTS FOR CENTRAL FALLS RECYCLING, TRASH COLLECTION VEHICLES
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved two grants to the City of Central Falls.  
 The $79,000 in Rural Development funds will be applied toward the purchase of new trash collection and recycling trucks.
   A $50,000 Community Facility Grant will be used to purchase two 2005 specialized recycling trucks that will enable the City of Central Falls to administer its own recycling program. Another $29,000 grant will help fund a trash collection truck.
   The City is currently under contract with a private vendor. However, with the proper equipment, Central Falls will cancel these contracts and conduct trash collection and recycling services throughout the city, rather than outsourcing the work.
