SEN. CHAFEE ANNOUNCES $10 MILLION FOR T.F. GREEN AIRPORT
  Sen. Lincoln Chafee announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded the Rhode Island Airport Corporation a $10 million grant for T.F. Green Airport.  
 The award will be issued under the Airport Improvement Program, and will be used to mitigate adverse noise that affects communities surrounding Green. This will include the acquisition of land for noise compatibility within a 65 - 69 decibel Day Night Average Sound Level (DNL), which is the Federal Aviation Administration's established noise threshold that residents should be expected to tolerate.
   "I am pleased that these funds are being awarded to T.F. Green to allow for the acquisition of lands and other materials in order to reduce noise pollution and improve the quality of life for residents and businesses near the airport," Senator Chafee said.
   "I applaud the U.S. Department of Transportation for recognizing the importance of T.F. Green to transportation, tourism, and ultimately the economy of Rhode Island," he continued.
   Primarily, these funds will be used to implement noise mitigation procedures, which will assist residents who may be exposed to airport noise at or above the 65 DNL threshold. This may be accomplished by the purchase of affected property around the airport or can conversely be used to soundproof any schools or homes that may be subject to an unhealthy DNL range.
