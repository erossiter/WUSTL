SEN. WARNER JOINS IN ANNOUNCING $8 MILLION GRANT FOR HARRISONBURG-AREA POULTRY BUSINESSES
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., joined his Congressional colleagues in announcing that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded an $8 million grant to the Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative Inc., to establish a loan fund aimed at helping poultry businesses in the Harrisonburg area.  
   The funds will help the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative purchase a poultry processing plant in Hinton, Virginia, to help save 700 jobs there. 
   The Cooperative was established in March 2004 to save the Hinton plant from closing, and has 134 members, many of whom raise birds for the plant. Members of the cooperative have committed up to $2.5 million in additional matching equity contributions to help further in purchasing the plant. 
   Funds for these grants are authorized annually by Congress to the USDA Rural Development program to increase economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for rural residents across America through economic development and loan activities. 
   Joining in the announcement, Sen. Warner said, "Congressman Goodlatte spearheaded this effort and I am pleased to have joined with him. This is fantastic news for the Harrisonburg area and for the entire Shenandoah Valley. Farming is the oldest industry in Virginia, and we must do what we can to preserve the viability of poultry farming across the Commonwealth."
