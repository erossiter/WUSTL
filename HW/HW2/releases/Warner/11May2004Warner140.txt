SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $90.31 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR FREDERICKSBURG REGION
  Today, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $90.31 million worth of additional key military infrastructure projects in the Fredericksburg region including $16.28 million at Fort A.P. Hill and $74.03 million at MCB Quantico. 
   These projects include $24.47 that were not contained in the Administration's original budget request.
   Following is the list of the projects:
   FORT A.P. HILL
   * Military Operations in Urban Terrain (Mout) Training Facility - $10.8 million 
   * Shoot House Training Facility - $3.98 million 
   * Special Operations Ground Mobility Support Bldg. - $1.5 million MCB QUANTICO 
   * Bachelor Enlisted Quarters - $15.1 million 
   * 2 Helicopter Hangar Facilities - $39.74 million 
   * Road Improvements - $1 million 
   * The Basic School Armory - $4.6 million 
   * The Basic School Hq Facility - $4.5 million 
   * Fiber-optic Information Infrastructure and Backup Generation Capacity for the Network Operations Center - $9.2 million 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate later this month, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law.
   Chairman Warner said, "These projects, and the $24 million in infrastructure projects we included for Dahlgren in last year's bill, further reinforce the vital role that the Fredericksburg region plays, and will continue to play in our Nation's security. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that the military personnel in the Commonwealth will continue to lead in keeping America free."
