SEN. WARNER APPLAUDS USDA DECISION TO PROTECT VIRGINIA FORESTS
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., applauded a decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that would protect roadless areas in Virginia's national forests.  
   The decision, announced today by Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns, would establish a permanent regulatory direction for the management of "inventoried roadless areas" in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. 
   In December 2005, former Governor Mark Warner petitioned the USDA "requesting the initiation of a state-specific rulemaking to address the management of inventoried roadless areas." 
   The Department accepted the Governor's petition, and, as a result, Virginia and the U.S. Forest Service will now jointly develop a rule for the protection of roadless areas in Virginia's National Forests, covering some 390,000 acres. 
   Senator Warner said, "As a longtime supporter of conserving roadless areas in our National Forests, I commend the Secretary of Agriculture for accepting Virginia's request, and I look forward to continuing to participate in the process. 
   "The natural beauty of the Commonwealth is a treasure that we need to preserve for future generations, and this decision sets us on a path to do just that."
