CHAIRMAN WARNER, SEN. LEVIN ANNOUNCE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF FISCAL 2005 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Today, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., Ranking Member, announced that the committee has completed its markup of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2005. The bill authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy.  
   "The brave young men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families deserve our absolute, unwavering support. As the Committee reports this bill to the full Senate, hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, active and reserve component, and countless civilians are serving courageously and taking risks in outposts all around the world and on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. Americans are proud of what they have accomplished in the cause of freedom. This bill sends that strong message," said Warner. 
   "I join with Senator Warner in commending the men and women of our Armed Forces for their magnificent performance in Afghanistan and Iraq," Senator Levin said. "The bill reported by the Armed Services Committee will promote the national defense, improve the quality of life of our men and women in uniform, and make the investments we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The unanimous vote of our Members in support of this bill reflects the able leadership and balanced approach which Senator Warner has shown in the finest tradition of our Committee. The bill does not, however, provide the money needed to support our day-to-day military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This money will be needed to support our troops in the field, and I will work to provide the needed funding as the bill moves forward." 
   The Armed Services Committee has reported out a bill that contains a 3.4 percent real increase in defense spending and emphasizes the priorities of combating terrorism, homeland defense, new capabilities to continue the transformation of the Armed Forces, and quality of life improvements for members of the Armed Forces. "The stunning military successes we have witnessed on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan validate the investment of the American taxpayers over the years in our Armed Forces. We are grateful to our men and women in uniform, and their families, for their valor, professionalism and sacrifice. This bill gives our service men and women the equipment they need, the enhanced quality of life they and their families deserve, and the promise of a transformed force for the future. I urge all of my colleagues to support prompt passage of this bill in the Senate," concluded Warner.
