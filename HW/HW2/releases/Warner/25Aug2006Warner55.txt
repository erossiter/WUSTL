SEN. WARNER SUPPORTS SECRETARY OF INTERIOR'S PROPOSAL FOR VIRGINIA OFFSHORE ENERGY PRODUCTION
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-VA, commended the Secretary of Interior for the Department of Interior's (DOI) decision to include the Commonwealth of Virginia in its proposed 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Plan. Virginia is the only Atlantic coast state included in the proposed 5-Year Plan.  
   The decision would allow for the production of natural gas and oil in federal waters - not state waters - off the Virginia coast beginning in 2011 if the President chooses to modify the current withdrawal from leasing activities and Congress modifies the annual appropriations moratorium. 
   Current presidential withdrawals and the congressional moratorium have placed more than 85 percent of the OCS around the lower 48 states off limits to energy development, including all federal waters off Virginia's coast. 
   Senator Warner said, "This proposed 5-Year Plan is the first breakthrough step toward placing Virginia in a position to help America meet its future energy needs. I have been working for years and will continue to press for the passage of my legislation to enable the Commonwealth to share in federal revenues as well." 
   Earlier this year, Senator Warner introduced legislation that would allow Governors of individual states to petition the Secretary of the Interior for a waiver from the current moratoria on offshore production of natural gas or oil and keep a portion of the leasing revenues that are currently paid to the federal treasury. Senator Warner's legislation remains pending in the Senate Energy Committee.
