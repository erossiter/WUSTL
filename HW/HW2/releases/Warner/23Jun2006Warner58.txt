  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has decided to locate two new community-based outpatient clinics in Norfolk and Lynchburg, Virginia.

   The Norfolk clinic will provide primary care, mental health, and eye care services for veterans, and the Lynchburg facility will provide primary care and mental health services. Both clinics will be staffed and run by the VA. 
   The two facilities will be staffed to serve veterans as follows:

   34 staff members 
   * Lynchburg

   Senator Warner said, "As a veteran with modest service in two wars, I recognize that caring for our veterans remains among the foremost obligations of our grateful nation. The opening of these two clinics will help the VA provide timely and high-quality care for Virginia's veterans."
