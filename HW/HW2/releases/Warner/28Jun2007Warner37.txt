SEN. WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMMIGRATION BILL VOTE
  Today, I voted to prevent this immigration bill (S. 1639) from proceeding to a final vote in the Senate. 
   While it was important for the Senate to consider and debate immigration legislation, in my view, this bill was seriously flawed. The immigration issue is one of the most significant matters of concern to our citizens, and we have a duty to responsibly address it in the future. 
   We must vigorously enforce our laws already on the books and provide much more control over our borders.
