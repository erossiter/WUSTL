SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES PROJECTED INCREASE OF 25.3 PERCENT IN FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDING FOR VIRGINIA
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that a key Senate panel has passed an increase in federal highway funding for Virginia over the next six years.  
   The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which Senator Warner serves as a senior member, formally sent a bill to the full Senate yesterday that allocates $283.9 billion in highway funding. 
   Referred to as SAFETEA (the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005), the bill sets the actual percentage levels for the return states will get on the federal gas-tax contributions they make as part of our national highway system over six years. 
   Known as a "donor state" because of its history of contributing more than it receives in federal highway funds, Virginia will get a gradually increasing rate of return on its contributions, from 90.5% last year to 92% in FY2009. The changes represent an increase of 25.3% in actual funding for Virginia over six years to approximately $5.3 billion. 
   In 1998, the last time Congress addressed the funding levels, Senator Warner worked with his colleagues on the Committee to increase Virginia's return from 79% to the current level of 90.5%. 
   In announcing the increase today, Senator Warner said, "Virginia's high population density relative to other states means that we will remain a donor state in the federal highway system for the foreseeable future. However, this increase in our return will translate into $1 billion more dollars for Virginia's highways over the next six years. We must do all we can to reduce congestion in our urban areas and increase access and mobility in our rural areas, and this extra funding will help us get there." 
   After debate and passage by the full Senate, the bill will need to be reconciled with a House version, and then signed by the President to become law.
