SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION GRANT FOR NORTHERN VIRGINIA COMPANY
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the Department of Labor (DOL) has approved a $1,000,000 federal grant to a Northern Virginia company to stimulate interest in career opportunities within the geospatial industry.  
   This grant is appropriated annually by Congress to the Department to Labor to increase public awareness of career opportunities within certain technology sectors. 
   With the grant, Nortel Networks of Reston, Virginia, will aim to increase public awareness of opportunities in the geospatial industry through resources such as video programming, live webcasts, and other media through the company's "Kidz Online" initiative. 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "In an increasingly technological age, we should do all we can to help educate future workers about opportunities they may otherwise not recognize. The geospatial industry is making great strides, particularly in the defense field, and I am pleased that a Virginia company will help make students aware of future prospects within this field."
