SENS. WARNER, ALLEN ANNOUNCE $1.8 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHERN VIRGINIA, WASHINGTON
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., and Sen. George Allen, R-Va., announced that the Senate has approved $1.8 million for vital projects they have supported in the Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. areas.  
   * $850,000 for The Women's Center founded in 1974, which provides counseling, education and information to women and their families with respect to their psychological, legal and career needs. It also provides low-cost and no-charge bilingual services to low income and immigrant neighborhoods. The Center has locations throughout Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
   * $450,000 for Second Chance Employment, a non-profit organization, providing at-risk women and their dependents financial security through comprehensive training and employment placement services. 
   * $200,000 for the All Faith Consortium, Inc for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP). This program is designed to assist District of Columbia Veterans with housing, substance abuse treatment, job training, and case management and to equip them with the necessary skills to accommodate their quest for self sufficiency. 
   * $300,000 for The Capitol Area Food Bank to help acquire a new warehouse and meet the growing demands of the hungry in the Washington Metropolitan Area. These funds will be put together with revenue generated from a capital campaign targeting individuals, companies and foundations. Last year alone they had to turn away two million pounds of food and other products due to the limits of its current facility. 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "These projects will help many area residents get a leg up toward future success and rewarding careers. I am pleased that Congress has approved this funding." 
   "I am pleased that we have approved funding for these important projects," Senator Allen said. "These funds will ensure that people, no matter what their race, gender or background will have the tools they need to succeed."
