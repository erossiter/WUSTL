SEN. WARNER PRAISES PASSAGE OF BILL DESIGNATING ROUTE 15 CORRIDOR AS NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA
  Today the Senate passed the "Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area Act," part of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act (S. 2739), by a 91-4 vote. The bipartisan legislation, originally sponsored by Sen. John Warner, R-Va, and co-sponsored by 6 of his colleagues, designates a 175-mile corridor encompassing many historic lands in four states along U.S. Route 15, including Virginia, as a National Heritage Area. 
   National Heritage Areas are intended to encourage residents, government agencies, non-profit groups and private partners to plan and implement programs and projects to recognize, preserve and celebrate many of America's defining landscapes. Today, there are 37 National Heritage Areas across the United States.
   Generally following the path of the Old Carolina Road (today's Route 15), the "Journey Through Hallowed Ground" area is home to considerable historic, cultural and natural treasures, including Monticello, Montpelier, Manassas and Gettysburg. The area encompasses eight presidential homes or sites, 15 National Historic Landmarks, 47 historic districts and the largest collection of Civil War battlefields in America.
   With the help and tutelage of the National Park Service, this latest National Heritage Area will be managed by The Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership, a non-profit entity whose sole purpose is to make known the wealth of the Hallowed Ground's offerings.
   "In Virginia, we are lucky to have a region that is worthy of the recognition and celebration that a National Heritage Area designation affords," said Warner. "No area in America could possibly be more deserving of this status than the corridor affectionately known as The Journey Through Hallowed Ground, which will now receive the historic recognition it deserves."
