SEN. WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  I commend the President for a gracious introduction of Speaker Pelosi, and for a strong speech, laying out some workable new priorities for our domestic and foreign policy. 
   We agree that a failed state in Iraq presents a threat to regional and world peace, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues in the coming days to offer the President our best thinking on a new military strategy, and on how the Iraqis must deal with their own sectarian violence. 
   My colleague Jim Webb delivered a heartfelt message, and, through his personal reflections, earned the respect of military families across America.
