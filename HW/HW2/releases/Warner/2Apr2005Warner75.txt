SEN. WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., delivered the following statement on the passing of Pope John Paul II: 
   "The whole world, not just the Catholic Church, has lost a leader whom we all revered and admired for his courage and undaunted leadership. Particularly during the Cold War, and throughout his Papacy, the entire world looked to Pope John Paul II as an inspiration to those less fortunate, and as a symbol of all that is great and dear to our hearts. May he rest in peace, and may future Popes be guided by his example."
