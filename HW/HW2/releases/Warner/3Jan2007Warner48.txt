SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES FIRST-TIME DESIGNATION OF HAMPTON ROADS FOR KEY HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM
  On Wednesday, January 3, 2007 Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the Department of Homeland Security has for the first time designated Hampton Roads as a "High-Threat Urban Area," thus making it eligible for federal grants aimed at protecting the region from terrorist attacks.  
   Senator Warner is a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which oversees DHS and its grant programs. 
   In its announcement, the Department included the "Norfolk Area," which will include most of Hampton Roads, on its list of 45 metropolitan locations that will be eligible to compete for a share of $746.9 million in federal grants under its "Urban Area Security Initiative Program" (UASI) for Fiscal Year 2007. 
   The National Capital Region of Washington, DC, which includes much of Northern Virginia, was also included on the list. 
   Separately, the Department announced that Hampton Roads will be eligible for a number of other DHS preparedness grant programs, including the $163.9 million Transit Security Grant Program, the $201 million Port Security Grant Program, and the $31.5 million Metropolitan Medical Response System Program. 
   In addition, the Commonwealth of Virginia and all Virginia municipalities will continue to be able to receive other DHS grants related to homeland and national security. 
   Senator Warner said, "Since this program's inception, we have worked to get Hampton Roads included in this flagship DHS preparedness program, in recognition of its large population, and critical national security infrastructure. With this new status, Hampton Roads communities will join the nation's top metropolitan areas in becoming eligible for critical assistance from the federal government as they work to keep Virginians safe.".
