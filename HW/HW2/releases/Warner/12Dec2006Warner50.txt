SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF TEACHER TAX DEDUCTION
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va. announced that Congress has passed his legislation providing a two-year extension of the teacher tax deduction as part of a broader tax bill, H.R. 6111.  
   In 2002, Senator Warner worked with his colleagues to pass the original Teacher Tax Relief Act, which provides teachers an "above-the-line" deduction in the amount of $250 for expenses they incur in purchasing supplies for the classroom. However, the deduction in the original bill expired after two years, and has been extended twice since then. 
   Now passed as part of a broader tax bill, Warner's provision will extend the deduction again, providing approximately $400 million in federal tax relief for teachers over the next two years. 
   "As they work hard for our children, America's teachers often reach into their own pockets to make sure they have the best classroom supplies. I feel strongly that the federal government should help make up for their personal financial burden - which some estimate at over $500 per year - by way of a modest tax break. It's the right thing to do. 
   "These out-of-pocket costs can place considerable financial burdens on our teachers. I'm pleased that Congress has voted to help them with these costs, as we all work to make our schools the best they can be," Senator Warner said. 
   Passed unanimously Friday evening by the Senate, and by the House earlier in the week, the bill needs only the signature of President Bush to become law.
