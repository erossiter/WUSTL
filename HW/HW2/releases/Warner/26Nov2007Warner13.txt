SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES NAMING OF RICHMOND COURTHOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED JURISTS
  Today, Senator John Warner (R-VA) announced that early next week he will introduce, along with Senator Jim Webb (D-Va), a bill naming the new Federal Courthouse in Richmond for Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III and Judge Robert Merhige, Jr. Both judges were lawyers who throughout their careers adhered to the principles of "equal justice under law."  
   Robinson was one of the key attorneys for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1960, achieving national acclaim with his representation of the Virginia plaintiffs in the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. This decision declared "separate but equal schools" unconstitutional. After his work with the NAACP, Judge Robinson became the first African-American to be appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 1964, eventually becoming a justice for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1966, and later Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Circuit in 1981.
   Merhige was appointed Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia where he served for 30 years. While on the federal bench, Merhige presided over important litigation, namely ordering the University of Virginia to admit women, and later ruling in favor of desegregation of a dozen Virginia school districts. His courage in the face of significant opposition is testament to his dedication to the rule of law. 
   "I have been down to Richmond to see the new courthouse and I can tell you it is a magnificent structure and as such I carefully took this responsibility in its naming," said Senator Warner. "No name is more fitting for this important structure than naming it after two legal giants - both jurists - The Robinson-Merhige Federal Courthouse"
   Construction of the Federal Courthouse is expected to be completed sometime next summer.
