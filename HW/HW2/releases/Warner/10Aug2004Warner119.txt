SEN. WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON REP. GOSS NOMINATION
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement on the President's nomination of Rep.  
 Porter Goss as Director of Central Intelligence: 
   "I commend the President for his timely nomination of Congressman Porter Goss to be Director of Central Intelligence and I strongly endorse this choice. 
   "I have had the opportunity to work with Congressman Goss in many legislative conferences and also on the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community in 1995-96, which was established by legislation I introduced as part of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. 
   "Porter Goss is a dedicated, hard-working public servant who came up through the ranks of the intelligence business and has continued his interest and advocacy for the men and women of the intelligence profession during his years in Congress, most recently as the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   "He is a very able, experienced choice who understands the intelligence profession and understands Congress. He will serve as an important bridge between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch as we work together to build the best intelligence community possible. 
   "The President has chosen well and I strongly support his choice of Congressman Porter Goss."
