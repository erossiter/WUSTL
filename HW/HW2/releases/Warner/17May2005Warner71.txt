SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $107.6 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR TIDEWATER AREA
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the United States Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $107.6 million worth of additional key military projects in the Tidewater area of Virginia that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   Following is the list of the projects: 
   * $86.7 million in advanced procurement funding for the CVN-21 aircraft carrier at the shipyards in Newport News, Va. 
   * $8 million for research on modeling and simulation of urban military operations at Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va. 
   * $5 million to continue the development of a Free Electron Laser at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory in Newport News, Va. 
   * $2.5 million to develop an integrated environmental monitoring system for waterborne hazards at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point, Va. 
   * $2 million for the Virtual Parts Engineering Research Center at Hampton University in Hampton, Va. 
   * $2 million for the development of wireless sensor systems for machine maintenance to Oceana Sensors in Virginia Beach, Va. 
   * $1.4 million to develop a wireless medical record management system to Norfolk State University in Norfolk, Va. 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that businesses from the Commonwealth will continue to help our men and women in uniform perform their vital missions."
