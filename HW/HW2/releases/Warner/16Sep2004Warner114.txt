SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $6 MILLION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS IN VIRGINIA BEACH
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has approved a $6,000,000 federal grant to the City of Virginia Beach to develop integrated communications networks for first responders.  
   These funds are appropriated annually by Congress to the Department to cover the purchase of communications equipment, enhancements to communications infrastructure, and project management expenses for first responders in communities across America. 
   Virginia Beach and its surrounding communities will utilize this grant to initiate an Overlay Regional Interoperability Network (ORION), an interoperable communications system that will allow military, federal, state, and civilian first responders from the region to communicate effectively in an emergency. 
   On September 14, Senators Warner and Allen, along with Congressmen Schrock, Scott, and Forbes, and Congresswoman Davis, wrote the Department of Justice in support of this important grant. 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "Top-notch communications are absolutely essential to public servants who respond to emergencies or natural disasters. I am pleased that Virginia Beach will receive this grant to help our first responders keep us safe in an emergency."
