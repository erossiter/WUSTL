SEN. WARNER: MEDICAL UPDATE
  Last fall, Senator Warner was treated for a common heart condition known as atrial fibrillation. Over the course of the past several months, his heart rhythm and rate have been normal.
   Senator Warner recently experienced a return of atrial fibrillation, and in consultation with the Capitol Physician's Office and his private doctors, is pursuing a re-evaluation and readjustment of medications which require regular monitoring and observation within a hospital environment.
   Yesterday, Senator Warner came to his office, consulted with the Capitol Physician, completed his office appointments and left for a scheduled admission to Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he remains for observation.
