SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $76 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN, SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the United States Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $76 million worth of additional key military projects in Southern and Southwestern Virginia that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   Following is the list of the projects: 
   * $10 million for the Foreign Supplier Assessment Center in Martinsville, Va. 
   * $4 million for Luna Innovation's nanomaterial manufacturing facility in Danville, Va. 
   * $5 million for Supervision visual enhancement technology developed by The Egg Factory located in Roanoke, Va. 
   * $2.5 million for nanophotonic research at Luna Innovation located in Blacksburg, Va. 
   * $40 million for modernization of the Army munitions plant in Radford, Va. 
   * $3 million for research on unmanned vehicles at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. 
   * $3 million for electric gas turbine research at Synchrony Corp. in Roankoke, Va. 
   * $3.5 million to develop composite materials for Navy seaframes at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg,, Va. 
   * $2 million to develop ultra wideband wireless sensor networks at Innovative Wireless Corp. in Forest, Va. 
   * $3 million to develop photonic sensors for marine gas turbines at Prime Photonics Corp. located in Blacksburg, Va. 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "I'm particularly pleased that we were able to allocate funding once again for Luna Innovations. Nanotechnology will play a vital role in our military's future. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that businesses from the Commonwealth will continue to help our men and women in uniform perform their vital missions."
