SEN. WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEDICAL PROCEDURE
  At 1:00pm today a successful, minor surgical procedure was performed to repair a very small aperture on Senator Warner's femoral artery in his anterior thigh.  
   Apertures are not uncommon following catheterization which was required for his ablation therapy. The aperture condition is medically classified as a "false aneurysm" in his anterior thigh. 
   Doctors have advised that the successful procedure, performed at Inova Fairfax Hospital, will require the Senator to spend the night for observation and expect that he will be able to return to work later this week. Further, they have reiterated that the Senator's heart is in excellent condition and his heart rhythm and rate are normal, following the non-surgical procedures earlier this month.
