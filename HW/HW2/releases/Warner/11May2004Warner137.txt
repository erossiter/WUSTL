SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $132 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR TIDEWATER REGION
  Today, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $132 million worth of additional key military projects in the Tidewater region of Virginia that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   Following is the list of the projects: 
   * $15 million for a Power Unit Assembly Facility in Newport News, VA. 
   * $3 million for research efforts in virtual part engineering at Hampton University. 
   * $2 million for research in High Briteness Electronics at William & Mary. 
   * $1.5 million for information assurance research at Norfolk State University. 
   * $9 million for the Virginia Advanced Ship Carrier Integration Center in Newport News, VA. 
   * $9 million for research on the development of a free electron laser at Jefferson Lab. 
   * $2 million for the Integrated Littoral Sensor Network at Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. 
   * $9 million for the development of advanced modeling and simulation technologies for the Joint Forces Command. 
   * $2 million for Wallops Island test launches. 
   * $70 million for additional ship depot maintenance. 
   * $9 million for the construction of a Navy SEAL operations center at Little Creek, Va. 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate later this month, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "This funding will go a long ways in ensuring that the Hampton Roads region remains a stalwart leader in the defense of our nation. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that the military personnel in the Commonwealth will continue to lead in keeping America free."
