SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $829,925 LABOR GRANT FOR VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has approved an $829,925 federal grant to Virginia Commonwealth University for the Telework/Telecommuting Pilot Research Initiative.  
   These grants are appropriated annually by Congress to the Department to Labor for the purpose of investigating, developing, and validating strategies likely to yield the largest number of telework positions for people with disabilities in cooperation with federal and state agencies. 
   The Telework/Telecommuting Initiative will focus on the following research priorities: 
   * Using telework as a return-to-work strategy specifically for people with disabilities receiving federal and state workers' compensation. 
   * Using telework as an alternative strategy for increasing competitive employment for disabled veterans returning from tours of duty. 
   * Surveying public (federal and state agencies) and private employers to identify supporting conditions and strategies that are necessary to effectively implement and sustain telework for people with disabilities. 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "In an increasingly technological age, telecommuting can help some of the most talented workers from all over Virginia contribute to the economic advancement of the entire country and even the world. I am pleased that this grant will help VCU continue to contribute in this important area of research."
