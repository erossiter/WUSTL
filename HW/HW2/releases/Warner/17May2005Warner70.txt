SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR CHARLOTTESVILLE AREA
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the United States Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $2 million worth of additional key military projects in the Charlottesville area of Virginia that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   The bill includes $2 million in funding to develop nanomagnetic materials for future military applications, to the General Electric facility in Charlottesville, Va. 
   This project was approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "This funding will provide important resources to key projects in the Charlottesville area. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that businesses from the Commonwealth will continue to help our men and women in uniform perform their vital missions."
