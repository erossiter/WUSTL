CHAIRMAN WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI P.O.W. MISTREATMENT
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement on the reports of mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners of war:  
   "These allegations of mistreatment, if proven, represent an appalling and totally unacceptable breach of military conduct that could undermine much of the courageous work and sacrifice by our forces in the war on terror. This is not the way for anyone who wears the uniform of our armed forces to act. 
   "Accordingly, I have asked the Department of Defense to brief Armed Services Committee members as soon as possible on the allegations and what it is doing to get to the bottom of this situation. We are working to get this briefing scheduled for tomorrow."
