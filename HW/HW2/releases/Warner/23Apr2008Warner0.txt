SENS. WARNER, WEBB ANNOUNCE GLOUCESTER POST OFFICE DESIGNATION IN HONOR OF REP. DAVIS
  Senators John Warner (R-VA) and Jim Webb (D-VA) were pleased to announce the Senate's unanimous passage of a bill to name Gloucester, Virginia's Main Street post office in honor of the late Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis. 
   The measure, which was sponsored by the full Virginia delegation in both the House and Senate, passed the House last Thursday, April 10, 2008. It now goes to the President to sign into law.
   "Given Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis' commendable public service at the federal and state levels, I was pleased to join with Senator Webb to offer this small token of recognition and gratitude for someone who had given so much to the Commonwealth and her country" said Senator Warner.
   "Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis was a tireless and effective advocate for her constituents in the Hampton Roads community where she grew up," said Senator Webb. "I am proud to be a member of the Virginia delegation that worked collectively to get this designation passed in an expeditious fashion. This hometown recognition is an appropriate way to commemorate her life and all of the hard work and accomplishments that encompassed it."
