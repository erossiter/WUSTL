CHAIRMAN WARNER ANNOUNCES SENATE RESTORATION OF $250 MILLION IN CUTS TO CARRIER PROGRAMS AFFECTING HAMPTON ROADS
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the Senate has passed his amendment, as introduced today, restoring $250 million in projected cuts in nuclear aircraft carrier work impacting Hampton Roads shipbuilders. 
   On Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense had cut $250 million from two carrier programs for the next fiscal year: the CVN-21 Advanced Procurement ($140 million reduction from an overall request of $1.4 billion), and the CVN RCOH program ($110 million reduction from the requested $333 million.)
   This afternoon, Senator Warner conferred on the Senate floor with Senator Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who was managing the Defense Appropriations bill in the full Senate. Senator Stevens agreed, together with Democratic senators, to accept Senator Warner's amendment that restored the $250 million to the two programs. 
   The amendment was passed by unanimous consent. 
   Senator George Allen, R-Va., joined as a co-sponsor in Chairman Warner's amendment. 
   Chairman Warner said, "These carrier programs are critical to America's military efforts in the war on terror. I am pleased that Senator Stevens has adopted this amendment restoring the funds. This will make a big difference in the planning for our sailors, carrier groups, and hard-working shipbuilders."
