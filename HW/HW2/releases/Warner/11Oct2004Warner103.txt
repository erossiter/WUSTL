SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF $10 BILLION TOBACCO QUOTA BUYOUT, $3 BILLION IN EMERGENCY AGRICULTURE FUNDS
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that Congress has approved legislation that provides for a $10 billion tobacco quota buyout, and $3 billion in emergency relief for farmers.  
   The provision to end the depression-era tobacco quota system was included in a larger tax bill (known as FSC-ETI) that the Senate approved today by a vote of 67-17-1. 
   Sen. Warner said, "The sun is shining on Southside and Southwest Virginia today. Tobacco farmers and their families deserve all the credit for this bill, because it would not have passed without their steadfast and unwavering support over a number of years. This is a fair buyout for Virginia's farmers, and it will create an environment for our producers to compete in a global market." 
   By voice vote today, the Senate also approved the FY05 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which includes emergency supplemental funds for farmers who have suffered crop losses in 2003 and 2004 natural disasters. In addition, the bill will also set aside $50 million specifically for Virginia's farmers who suffered losses as a result of last summer's Hurricane Isabel. 
   Senator Warner said, "I am pleased that, under this bill, many hard working farmers of Virginia will receive compensation for natural disasters of the past two years. These funds will enable our growers to recover from their losses and continue to provide a stable food supply for America and other countries."
