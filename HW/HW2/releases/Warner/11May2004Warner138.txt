SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $32 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR NORTHERN VIRGINIA AREA
  Today, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $32 million worth of additional key military projects in the northern Virginia area that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   Following is the list of the projects: 
   * $5 million toward special operations management and control systems, to Electronic Warfare Associates of Herndon, VA. 
   * $4 million for Expeditionary Technology Insertion, to Symbol Technologies of McLean, Va. 
   * $4 million for document exploitation software tools, to CACI of Arlington, Va. 
   * $1 million for Six Sigma professional development programs, to VSE Corporation of Alexandria, Va. 
   * $2 million for submarine information assurance systems, to Progeny Systems Corporation of Manassas, Va. 
   * $3 million for surface ship combat system enhancements, to DDL Omni Corporation of McLean, Va. 
   * $3 million for anti-terrorism surveillance system technology, to Argon Corporation of Fairfax, Va. 
   * $4 million for NULKA advanced shipboard defense technology, to Sippican Corporation of Gainesville, Va. 
   * $2 million for Fly-by-Light guidance technology, to BAE Systems in Arlington and Manassas, Va. 
   * $3 million for research on biodefense pharmaceuticals to George Mason University of Fairfax, Va. 
   * $1 million for the CoBRA chem-bio defense response aid, to the Defense Group, Inc. of Alexandria, Va. 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate later this month, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "Funding for these projects will provide valuable resources for Northern Virginia communities. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that the military personnel in the Commonwealth will continue to lead in keeping America free."
