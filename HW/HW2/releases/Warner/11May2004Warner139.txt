SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $24 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR GREATER RICHMOND AREA
  Today, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $24 million worth of additional key military projects in the greater Richmond area of Virginia that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   Following is the list of the projects: 
   * $7 million toward advanced personal body armor development for Magellan Systems of Richmond, VA. 
   * $2 million for research on quantum gate electronics technology at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. 
   * $2 million for baseline combat operations centers for the USMC, to Bae Mauer of Fairfield, Va. 
   * $2 million to test emergency battlefield pharmaceuticals for Operation Iraqi Freedom, to Diffusion Pharmaceuticals in Charlottesville, Va. 
   * $9 million for integrated ship bridge system development to Sperry Marine, of Charlottesville, Va. 
   * $2 million for additional resources to treat brain and spinal cord injuries for Operation Iraqi Freedom combat veterans, to the elements of the Brain Injury Research Center in Richmond and Charlottesville, Va. 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate later this month, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "This funding will provide important resources to key projects in the Greater Richmond area. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that the military personnel in the Commonwealth will continue to lead in keeping America free."
