CHAIRMAN WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON TAGUBA REPORT CERTIFICATION
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, delivered the following statement on the status of the Taguba report documents received by the Committee: 
   "Last night, the Senate Armed Services Committee received a Memorandum for the Record from the Department of the Army, certifying that the Committee now has 'a true and accurate copy' of the Taguba report as forwarded by General Taguba to his chain of command.
   "The Memorandum also indicated that, among the annexes, 'there are statements and or other documents that reference enclosures or attachments that were not made part of the actual report.'
   "General Taguba made the decision that these enclosures and attachments would not be included in his report, however I have requested them from the Department as part of our Committee's review.
   "In a May 13 letter to Secretary Rumsfeld, I requested 'all legal reviews and related documentation concerning approval of interrogation techniques for use in Department of Defense intelligence gathering operations, including in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay.'
   "I continue to believe that the Department is complying in good faith with this request, and will continue to monitor its cooperation on these and other matters connected to our oversight of the prisoner abuse situation."
