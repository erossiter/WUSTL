SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES HOMELAND SECURITY AWARDS FOR TWO VIRGINIA-BASED SMALL BUSINESSES
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has chosen two Virginia-based small businesses to receive awards for projects aimed at strengthening the defense of our homeland.  
   Cigital Inc., of Sterling, Va., and Luna Innovations Inc., of Blacksburg, Va., will receive up to $100,000 each to conduct research related to DHS projects. Cigital's research falls into the category of real-time malicious code identification, and Luna's research will focus on detecting concealed weapons and/or explosives at a distance. 
   These awards are appropriated annually by Congress to DHS's Advanced Research Projects Agency for the Small Business Innovation Research program. 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "Protecting our homeland remains one of our highest national priorities. I am pleased that these Virginia companies are doing their part to keep our country safe."
