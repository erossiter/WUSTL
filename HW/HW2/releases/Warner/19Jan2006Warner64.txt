LONGTIME SEN. WARNER'S CHIEF OF STAFF TO RETIRE FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that his longtime Chief of Staff, Susan Aheron Magill, will retire next month after 28 years Congressional service, 24 of which were spent in his office.  
   During her 18 years as Chief of Staff, Ms. Magill held a number of additional positions of responsibility from time to time. In 1996, she served as Executive Director for the Joint Congressional Committee for President Clinton's second inauguration, a panel chaired by Senator Warner. 
   Given her lifelong interest in education, Ms. Magill has served for nine years on the Board of Visitors of her alma mater, the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, including the last three as the college's Rector. She is also a member of the Advisory Board of Mount Vernon and the National Council of Young Political Leaders. 
   Ms. Magill now moves to the private sector, taking a senior executive position in government affairs for the Pew Charitable Trusts, a distinguished non-profit, non-partisan charitable organization based in Philadelphia. 
   Senator Warner said, "Susan Magill has devoted the last 24 years to advancing the interests of Virginia and the nation as my 'right hand' in the Senate; I wish Susan and her family the best of good fortune as she undertakes this new challenge." 
   Ms. Magill said, "It has been an honor to work with Senator Warner on behalf of the people of Virginia. I am grateful to him for the tremendous opportunities he has given me, and for the privilege of working with so many dedicated people both in and out of government." 
   With the retirement of Ms. Magill, Ann Loomis, who has served as Senator Warner's Legislative Director for 18 years, will assume the reins as his new Chief of Staff. Chris Yianilos, who now serves as the Senator's Deputy Legislative Director and Counsel, will become Legislative Director and Counsel.
