SEN. WARNER, REP. WOLF ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR WINCHESTER ARMORY
  Today, Chairman John W. Warner, R-Va., and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., announced that federal funding for the design of a new armory to house the Winchester National Guard is included in the FY 2005 Military Construction appropriations bill approved by Congress today.  
   The House passed the FY 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill on October 9, followed by the Senate on October 11. The bill sets aside $530,000 for the design of a new armory and is expected to be signed by the President soon. 
   Sen. Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, "I am pleased that we were able to include funding for the Winchester Armory in this bill. These funds will enable us to move forward on replacing this old facility, and will help our National Guard forces continue their important contribution to our national defense." 
   "This has been a priority for Senator Warner, State Senator Potts, and Delegate Sherwood for many years," Congressman Wolf said. "By working together we have been able to make this project a reality, and I appreciate all of their hard work on the federal and state levels." 
   Congressman Wolf expressed his gratitude to all the past and present Guardsmen who have served at the armory. "This funding is an important step in replacing the existing facility. I am hopeful this good news will reach those from here who are currently deployed."
