SENATE, HOUSE COMPLETE CONFERENCE ON NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006
  Today Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the Committee's Ranking Minority Member, announced that the Senate and House conferees reached agreement on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. The bill authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. 
   Senator Warner said, "This is a strong, bipartisan bill that serves the interests of the men and women of our armed forces, their families, and our nation. The bill provides our military with the resources to win the war on terror and defend our interests around the globe, thereby safeguarding Americans here at home.  
   "It was essential that Congress include important provisions on detainee policy and on our operations in Iraq. Senator McCain's measure on the standards for detention and interrogation, which I have supported from the beginning, puts America's policies into law and will further protect members of our military and their civilian counterparts as they perform vital intelligence operations. 
   "In addition, the inclusion of the bipartisan, forward-looking Warner-Frist legislation on Iraq will help Americans better understand our policy there, and underscores the importance of supporting the people of Iraq this coming year as they continue their transition to full sovereignty." 
   Senator Levin said, "In this bill, we improve the quality of life for our service members and their families by increasing military pay and improving health care benefits. Besides increasing basic pay above the rate of inflation, this bill contains bonuses and special pays designed to encourage young men and women to enlist and to remain in military service, and we extend military health care benefits to every member of the Selected Reserve who commits to continued service. 
   "By establishing in law that the United States will not subject any individual in our custody, regardless of nationality or physical location, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, this bill should help restore America's reputation around the world, increase the cooperation we receive from other nations in the war on terrorism, and protect our troops from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment at the hands of others. 
   "Additionally, the provision on United States policy on Iraq in the bill sends a strong message to the Administration and Iraqis that calendar year 2006 should be a period in which Iraqi security forces take the lead for security in Iraq, thus creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and that the Administration should tell the Iraqi leaders that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq, within the schedule they set for themselves."
