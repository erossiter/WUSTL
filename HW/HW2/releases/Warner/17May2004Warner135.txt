SEN. WARNER APPLAUDS PEOPLE OF SOUTHSIDE VIRGINIA OVER NEW TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., applauded the people of Southside Virginia for their efforts to secure an Economic Development Administration grant of $6 million to Mid-Atlantic Broadband, a Southside non-profit cooperative, facilitating a new broadband communications network.  
   "Today we celebrate the efforts of the US Economic Development Administration, Virginia's Tobacco Commission, and the people of Southside. I am proud of all who have worked so hard to make this a reality. In a region hard hit by job losses, technology investments can help pave the way for new jobs and business." 
   The EDA funds will be matched with $6 million by the Virginia Tobacco Commission to construct and operate the new regional network linking businesses, communities and educational institutions throughout the region. This first phase of the network will run along Route 58 and portions of Route 220 and Route 360 to connect Stuart, Martinsville, Rocky Mount, Ferrum, Danville, South Boston, Keysville, Clarksville, South Hill, Lawrenceville, Emporia, and numerous industrial parks to promote economic development in the region.
