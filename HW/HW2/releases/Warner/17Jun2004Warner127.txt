CHAIRMAN WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRISONER ABUSE OVERSIGHT
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, delivered the following statement on the status of the Committee's oversight of the Department of Defense in connection with the prisoner abuse matter:  
   "Several media outlets have inquired into the status of my Committee's oversight of the prisoner abuse matter, begun last month with three open hearings. 
   "There has been no lessening of my resolve to continue the Committee's essential oversight of this matter, given its importance to the proud men and women of our armed forces and to our nation's image abroad. 
   "Last month, I requested that Secretary Rumsfeld provide the Committee all relevant documents on this matter, and I feel that the Department is complying in good faith. We received documents from the Department last week, and received more today. I will continue to monitor the Department's cooperation with our request. 
   "Last week, our Committee's hearing with Secretary Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of State Armitage and General Myers on the transition to Iraqi sovereignty was postponed due to the memorial events for President Reagan. We have rescheduled that hearing for next Wednesday. For the past three weeks, Senator Levin and I have been managing the annual Defense Authorization bill on the floor, which we hope to finish as soon as possible. We will resume our hearings on the prisoner abuse issue after that point. 
   "Recently, I met with Senator Hatch and confirmed that the Judiciary Committee will work with the Armed Services Committee on the aspects of the prisoner abuse matter that touch on the Department of Justice, including on Justice Department documents that may be relevant to our work."
