SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $585,714 FOR RICHMOND LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has approved a federal grant of $585,714 for the Regional Community Policing Institute (RCPI) in Richmond for the training of law enforcement officers in the Commonwealth.  
   These funds are on top of the nearly $700,000 that Senator Warner helped secure for the facility, known as the Virginia Community Policing Institute (VCPI), earlier this year. 
   Funds for these grants are appropriated annually by Congress to the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to support a national network of law enforcement training centers, of which the Richmond facility is a part. 
   The RCPIs are located across the country to address the region-specific community policing training needs of law enforcement agencies and citizen members of community organizations that work together with them. 
   Since their introduction in 1997, the institutes have trained more than 280,000 officers and citizens nationally in topics ranging from reducing gang violence to homeland security. 
   The Richmond-based VCPI is a statewide resource providing state-of-the-art community-policing training for Virginia's law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. More information on the VCPI is available at www.vcpionline.org. 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "The Department of Justice's COPS program provides critical, region-specific training for America's law enforcement professionals. I am pleased that Richmond will receive this funding to help our dedicated public servants work to keep our communities safe."
