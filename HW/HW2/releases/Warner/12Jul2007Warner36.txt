SEN. WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI BENCHMARKS REPORT
  As the author of the provision establishing the July 15 report on Iraqi benchmarks, I believe this report will contribute measurably to the American people's understanding of the current situation, and will serve as an important reference for the Senate as it continues its work on Iraq legislation next week.  
   I am disappointed that, after great sacrifice by U.S. and Iraqi troops since the announcement of the surge in January, the Iraqi government has not met critical political benchmarks in that period. That government is simply not providing leadership worthy of the considerable sacrifice of our forces, and this has to change immediately.
