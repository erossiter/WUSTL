SENS. WARNER, WEBB SECURE FUNDING TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE, EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES IN VIRGINIA
  Earlier this week, Senators John W. Warner (R-Va.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.) secured $3.1 million for Virginia investment projects in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill for the 2008 Fiscal Year. The legislation provides important increases in federal funding for education, workforce development and training programs, public healthcare, and medical research studies.
   "Many of our nation's most vital domestic programs related to medical research and healthcare, unemployment services, and education are funded in this bill," Warner said. "This funding is critical for communities and organizations in Virginia who need federal assistance to continue to provide and expand quality healthcare, work force training, and educational services at the local level," Warner added. 
   "I am a strong believer that access to affordable, quality health care and early education programs are key to successful communities," said Senator Webb. "This bill secures vital funding for community health centers across the Commonwealth that serve as a safety net for Virginians who wouldn't otherwise have the means to see a primary care doctor."
