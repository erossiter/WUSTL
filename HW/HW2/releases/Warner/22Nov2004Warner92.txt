SENS. WARNER, ALLEN ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROVAL OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PROJECTS IN WESTERN VIRGINIA, SHENANDOAH VALLEY
  Today, Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and George Allen, R-Va., announced that the United States Senate voted Saturday night to approve funding for the following projects in Western Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley.  
   Following is a list of the projects: 
   * $500,000 for the operations of the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic Foundation and $1.5 million for the preservation of historically significant lands. 
   * $600,000 to resolve the parking situation at Old Rag Mountain, a popular hiking destination in Shenandoah National Park. 
   * $1.38 million to preserve High Top Mountain, a 925-acre parcel of land adjacent to the Appalachian Trail in Greene County. 
   * $250,000 for the renovation of the George C. Marshall Museum in Lexington. 
   * $250,000 for the Art Museum of Western Virginia in Roanoke which is in the planning phase for a new 100,000 square foot, $30 million facility to house its growing collection of 19th and 20th century American art. 
   * $1 million for the creation of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library in Staunton. 
   * $500,000 for the Virginia Military Institute to create a science and security minor which will prepare graduates for careers in national and homeland security. 
   * $650,000 for the Goshen Dam at Lake Merriweather because it does not meet safety regulations. 
   * $5 million for the Roanoke River Flood Control Project to provide needed flood control in the downtown area of Roanoke. 
   * $300,000 for James Madison University for the National Center for Rural Science and Mathematics Education. 
   * $660,000 for the Virginia Community Policing Institute to continue providing community policing, training and technical assistance to Virginia's law enforcement agencies and communities. 
   Senator Warner said, "I am particularly pleased that the bill contains $500,000 for the Virginia Military Institute to create a 'Science and Security Minor' program of study. In the post 9/11 world, our country faces new challenges like never before. In order to meet these challenges, and ensure our national, homeland, and economic security, America needs more educated minds trained in the fields of the hard sciences, engineering, and in certain foreign languages. 
   "Unfortunately, today, our institutions of higher learning are not producing enough graduates to meet these needs. VMI's new 'Science and Security Minor' will help America meet these new challenges. On a national level, we must encourage more and more American students to pursue these courses of study. Doubling Pell Grant awards for students who major in these high need areas would provide a serious incentive, and this is an initiative I continue to work to achieve in the United States Senate." 
   Senator Allen said, "These significant federal funds will help to support and continue efforts to improve the lives of the people of Western Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley and make this beautiful historic region a better place to live, work, visit, learn and raise a family." 
   "Such initiatives will provide for better healthcare and valuable educational insights as well as create new jobs and considerably boost tourism throughout the Valley and Western Virginia. Funding for the George C. Marshall Foundation will ensure that the history of a great American will continue to be preserved and promoted for the enjoyment of thousands of tourists to the Lexington area and our Commonwealth. Whether hiking or learning about key Civil War battles, President Wilson or VMI, this funding will enhance enjoyment of residents and visitors to this beautiful, historic part of our Commonwealth." 
   Now passed by the Senate as part of the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, the legislation will await action by the House of Representatives on an enrolling correction which is expected on Wednesday before being sent to the President's desk to be signed into law.
