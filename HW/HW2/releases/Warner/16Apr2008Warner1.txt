SEN. WARNER'S ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNIVERSARY OF VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY
  One year ago today, the horrific shootings at Virginia Tech claimed 32 innocent lives. 
   In remembrance of the lives of promise that were forever lost that shocking day, I'd simply like to read each of their names into the Congressional Record.

   The day after the shooting, I mourned with the campus community at a convocation held on the campus of Virginia Tech. While the mourning of that tragic day continues for all of us, in the past year the Tech family has come together to support each other in a way that all of America admires. I know that those who have suffered most in the tragedy, and their families, remain in the thoughts and prayers of not only all Hokies, but indeed Americans across the country.
