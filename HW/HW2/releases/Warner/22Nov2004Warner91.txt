SEN. WARNER CRITICIZES INSERTION OF SURPRISE TAX-RETURNS PROVISION IN SPENDING BILL
  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., criticized the last-minute insertion into a spending bill of a surprise provision that would give certain Congressional members and their staff access to individual and corporate tax returns, and indicated his strong approval of efforts to remove it from the bill.  
   The unannounced provision reportedly was inserted by a member of the House of Representatives into the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, which Congress approved on Saturday. 
   Following its discovery, the Senate took swift action by passing a resolution that, when approved by the House, will strip it from the bill before it is presented to the President for signature. The House is expected to approve the Senate resolution on Wednesday. 
   Senator Warner said, "I am outraged that a House member has tried through this provision to breach the traditional confidentiality of individual Americans' tax returns. There is no reason for this measure, and this last-minute act violates all principles of judgment and common sense. I am pleased to have joined other members of the Senate in supporting efforts to ensure it never becomes law."
