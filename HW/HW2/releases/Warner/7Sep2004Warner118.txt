SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES IMPORTANT DEFENSE CONTRACT FOR BLACKSBURG COMPANY
  Today, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the Navy has chosen a Blacksburg, Virginia, company for an important technology contract totaling close to $2 million.  
   The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Carderock - Philadelphia, has awarded a contract valued at $1,999,682 to Prime Research, LC, a subsidiary of Prime Photonics, LC, of Blacksburg, for a program to develop and manufacture fiber optic sensors. 
   The goal of the program is to develop high temperature photonic sensor instrumentation to support the Navy's Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) program for marine power gas turbine engines in order to increase the efficiency, reliability, and performance of turbine-powered surface ships. 
   Additionally, the sensor systems developed under this program will have applications for similar gas turbine platforms within the Navy, Army, Air Force, Department of Energy, and the commercial turbine industry. 
   In announcing the contract, Senator Warner said, "Our Navy is always looking for new technologies to become even more efficient, and I am pleased that this exciting, Virginia-based program will help our Sailors do just that."
