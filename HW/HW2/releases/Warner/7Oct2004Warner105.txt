  Today Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., announced that the Department of Justice (DoJ) has approved $153,852 in federal funds to local law enforcement agencies and city governments in Virginia to improve security on school grounds.  
   These funds are appropriated annually by Congress to DoJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services for the Save Our Schools program, aimed at helping local communities deter crime by assisting with the installation of metal detectors, locks, lighting and security equipment. 
   The grants can also be used to help pay for security assessments, training, and other measures aimed at protecting against crime in schools. 
   The grants will be divided as follows: 
   * Albemarle County Police Department, Charlottesville, Virginia, $30, 000 
   * Frederick County Sheriff's Department, Winchester, Virginia, $33,852 
   * Hopewell Bureau of Police, Hopewell, Virginia, $10,000 
   * City of Manassas, Virginia, $50,000 
   * City of Winchester, Virginia $30,000 
   In announcing the grant, Senator Warner said, "We must do all we can to make schools as safe as possible for our children, and these grants will help Virginia communities do just that." 
   "I am pleased that we have approved funding for these important projects," Senator Allen said. "These funds will ensure that people, no matter what their race, gender or background will have the tools they need to succeed."
