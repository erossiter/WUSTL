SEN. WARNER ANNOUNCES $62 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILITARY PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN VIRGINIA
  Today, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to fund $62 million worth of additional key military projects in Southern and Southwestern Virginia that were not included in the Pentagon's original budget request.  
   Following is the list of the projects: 
   * $5.5 million for Advanced Nanomaterial Research for Luna Innovations in Danville and Blacksburg, VA. 
   * $16 million to build new precursor facilities at Radford Army Ammunition Plant. 
   * $6.8 million for the Joint Unmanned Testing Facility in Danville, VA. 
   * $19.8 million for additional night vision equipment made by ITT of Roanoke. 
   * $2 million for the demilitarization of obsolete munitions at Radford Army Ammunition Plant. 
   * $2 million for the Bioinformatics research at Virginia Tech.
   * $10 million for the Foreign Supplier Assessment Center in Martinsville, VA. 
   These projects were approved by the Committee late last week as part of its markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The bill must now receive the approval of the full Senate later this month, and then be reconciled with a version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives. The final bill requires the signature of the President to become law. 
   Chairman Warner said, "I'm particularly pleased that we were able to allocate funding for Luna Innovations. Nanotechnology will play a vital role in our military's future. I'm proud of Virginia's contribution to our national defense, and this funding will ensure that the military personnel in the Commonwealth will continue to lead in keeping America free."
