SENS. SPECTER, SANTORUM ANNOUNCE FINAL PASSAGE OF FUNDING FOR NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA PROJECTS
  Sens. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the U.S. Congress has provided final approval of funding for several defense-related projects in northeastern Pennsylvania for fiscal year 2005.  
   Senator Specter said, "I am pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate have approved this funding for these important projects. These projects, key to our nation's defense, will be invaluable in our continuing war against terror. I am confident that these projects will go far in supporting the men and women who serve our country." 
   "This funding is critical in improving our national defense and equipping our troops with the most up-to-date information, technology and equipment," said Senator Santorum. "These projects will provide Pennsylvania with the opportunity to take the lead in defense-related research and development." The U.S. Congress gave its final approval last night to the FY 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill. The House and Senate approved the measure in separate votes. The legislation now goes to the President for his signature. Funding was approved for the following projects: 
   * $8.5 Million for General Dynamics in Luzerne, Lackawanna and York counties for the Precision Guided Mortar Munition (PGMM), a laser-guided 120-mm mortar with extended range capability. PGMM will more than double the range of current 120-mm mortars and, for the first time, give them the capability to engage long range point targets with vastly reduced collateral damage and logistical support required. 
   * $4.2 Million for Gentex in Lackawanna County for Isolation Units with Reactive Nanoparticle Materials. The treatment and transport of contaminated, infected or diseased casualties has been a systemic problem for the military with no viable solutions in place. It has been discovered that reactive nanoparticles, consisting of specially formulated metal oxides and polyoxometallates, are capable of destroying viruses such as SARS. 
   * $4 Million for Medico and Pocal Companies in Lackawanna County for Mortar Anti-Personnel Anti-Material (MAPAM). MAPAM represents a significant product improvement to the M720 Series High Explosive 60-mm mortar ammunition in that it greatly increases lethality. MAPAM/60-mm mortar has demonstrated, through testing by the Army, a 70% increase in lethality over the current U.S. 60-mm mortar ammunition. This represents not only increased combat capability but can translate into a reduced ammunition load for soldiers and Marines. 
   * $2 Million for Medico in Lackawanna County for High Explosive (HE) M720A1 for the 60-mm. This item is one of the highest priority unfunded requirements in the Marine Corps. The current stockpile of serviceable cartridges is insufficient to support the War Reserve.
