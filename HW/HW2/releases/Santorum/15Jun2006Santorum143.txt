SEN. SANTORUM HOLDS BRIEFING ON RECENT ADVANCES IN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today hosted a panel of distinguished scientists to discuss alternative methods to deriving embryonic-like - or pluripotent - stem cells in ways that do not require the destruction of a human embryo.  
   Earlier this year, Senator Santorum introduced the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cells Therapies Enhancement Act (S. 2754) to intensify such research into deriving pluripotent stem cells. Study of these cells may lead to improved understanding of or treatments for disease. The Santorum-Specter bill will ensure that NIH puts more money into this promising area, increasing the possibility of further advances in the field. 
   "I appreciate this opportunity to hold a meaningful discussion regarding this issue," said Senator Santorum. "Recognizing the ethical issues surrounding embryonic stem cell research and potential scientific advances that may alleviate these issues, S. 2754 seeks to intensify research into ways to derive pluripotent stem cell lines from alternative sources, ones that do not require the creation of human embryos for research purposes or discarding, destroying, or knowingly harming a human embryo or fetus. I am confident in this bill - it is pro-scientific progress, pro-stem cell research, and pro-cures for diseases, but does not compromise my commitment to protecting innocent embryonic life." 
   Participants in today's panel discussion included: Dr. Markus Grompe, Oregon Health and Science University; Dr. William B. Hurlbut, Stanford University, Member of the President's Council on Bioethics; Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch, White Head Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Dr. Alan Russell, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Institute; Mr. Francisco Silva, PrimeCell Therapeutics, LLC; and Mr. George Sing, Stemnion.
