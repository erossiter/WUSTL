SEN. SANTORUM ENCOURAGES FEMA TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO PENNSYLVANIANS AFFECTED BY RECENT FLOOD DAMAGE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today sent a letter to R. David Paulison, Director of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to express concern regarding several Pennsylvania counties affected by recent flooding that have not yet been declared eligible for Individual Assistance.  
   "I have toured several of the affected counties in the Commonwealth, and I am certain that these counties are eligible for Individual Assistance, and I believe that further Public Assistance declarations may be warranted," Senator Santorum stated in the letter. "Accordingly, I request that you review the number of FEMA personnel that are assigned to the Pennsylvania disaster recovery effort to make sure that there are adequate personnel tasked to this important effort. Further, I request that you review the findings of the Preliminary Disaster Assessment (PDA) teams in an expedited fashion so that all appropriate disaster aid reaches my constituents as quickly as possible." 
   On Friday, Senator Santorum visited Luzerne, Bucks and Susquehanna counties and on Saturday he traveled to Columbia, Susquehanna, Northampton, and Bucks counties, some of the hardest hit areas of the state. 
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to the many Pennsylvanians who are struggling to piece back together their lives, property, and businesses," Senator Santorum said. "I am thankful to our local and state emergency responders and volunteers for all their hard work to help their fellow Pennsylvanians in this time of need and I encourage all Pennsylvanians to do what they can to help communities recover."
