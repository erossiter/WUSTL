SEN. SANTORUM MAKES STATEMENT FOLLOWING FIRST RULING ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT BY U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's ruling on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003:  
   "Judge Phyllis Hamilton made her position against this legislation very clear since the beginning of these proceedings. Her handling of this case - which included barring the submission of medical records as evidence - ensured an incomplete, biased record. This is a travesty. 
   "I was not surprised to learn that the San Francisco District Court granted a permanent injunction against the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, and I fully expect the Justice Department to take this up on appeal. 
   "We restructured the law to address the concerns raised by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2000, which struck down a Nebraska statute banning partial-birth abortion. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 provides a more precise definition of the procedure and includes factual findings of Congress, which clearly show that a partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to preserve a woman's health. The law does contain an exception to preserve the life of the mother. 
   "I stand by my belief that this is a constitutional act. I know the Department of Justice will continue to work hard to protect innocent life. I am hopeful that the Nebraska and New York cases will provide a decent and full record of evidence on which the Supreme Court can make a decision."
