SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE $20 MILLION FOR CHESTER HOUSING AUTHORITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Chester Housing Authority will receive $20 million through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Home Ownership for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) program. 
   The Chester Housing Authority will use the funding to revitalize the Chester Towers public housing development. A total of 300 units will be demolished, and replaced with 101 affordable rental units and 24 home-ownership units. The revitalization development plans also include computer training and job readiness programs. Approximately 280 families will benefit from the proposed revitalization projects. 
   The HOPE VI program provides funding for the demolition and reconstruction of obsolete, severely distressed public housing. Ultimately, HOPE VI enhances communities by decentralizing poverty and giving families an opportunity to live in mixed-income neighborhoods with better educational and employment opportunities. 
   "This funding is vital to the development and revitalization of the neighborhoods of Chester," said Senator Santorum. "The HOPE VI program provides residents with the skills they need to secure employment." 
   "The HOPE VI program has been very successful in providing low-income families with better housing, employment, and educational opportunities," Senator Specter said. "I am very pleased to see Chester receive the resources it needs to provide these same opportunities to its residents in need."
