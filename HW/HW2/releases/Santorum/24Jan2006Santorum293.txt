SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES $3.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FROM DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is providing Pennsylvania with $3,597,437 in federal grants through HUD's Youthbuild Program.  
   The Youthbuild Program enables young adults between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four to complete their high school education and achieve on-the-job training in construction skills. Students build or renovate single-family homes and multi-family apartments, which are sold at affordable prices, to low-and very low-income persons as well as homeless individuals and families. 
   Last year Senator Santorum joined his colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, Christopher Bond (R-MO) and Ranking Member, Patty Murray (D-WA) urging them to include $90 million for Youthbuild in the budget for fiscal year 2006. The letter garnered bipartisan support from fifty-three senators. 
   "These grants will help Pennsylvania youth prepare for a future in construction trades, while learning professional, life and leadership skills. Youth who are seeking homebuilding skills to prepare them for future employment can enroll in a local Youthbuild program to receive on-the-job training while earning their high school equivalency diplomas," said Senator Santorum. 
   "This program provides an excellent opportunity for Pennsylvania's underprivileged young adults to develop useful skills and a heightened sense of community while helping to provide those in need with affordable housing," said Senator Specter. "I am pleased HUD has provided these funds to support the Youthbuild Program in Pennsylvania."
