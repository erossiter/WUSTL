SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR POTTSVILLE PROJECT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the Federal Transit Administration has awarded a $420,499 grant for the engineering and design of the Union Station Trade and Transit Center in Pottsville. The project is part of the redevelopment of the former Pennsylvania Railroad Union Station site. The Union Station Trade and Transit Center intermodal terminal will accommodate the Schuylkill Transportation System (STS), Greyhound and Trailways, and a park-and-ride facility. 
   The grant will fund assessment and cost estimates, a traffic and parking study, an environmental study, geo-technical engineering work, site appraisals, pre-construction and construction management services, and site design concepts. 
   "It is important that we continue to grow and expand Pennsylvania's mass transportation facilities. This funding will provide safety, accessibility and structural improvements, which will increase commuter comfort and usability," said Senator Santorum. 
   "The Union Station Trade and Transit Center is an excellent example of growth and development in the region," Senator Specter said. "This facility will be a hub for public transportation in Pottsville, providing citizens with safe, accessible and varied options for commuting."
