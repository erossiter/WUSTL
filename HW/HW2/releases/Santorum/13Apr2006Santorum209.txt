SEN. SANTORUM SPEAKS OUT AGAINST IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on recent developments in Iran and legislation he sponsored to foster democratic change inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
   "It is time for the U.S. Senate to debate and pass the Iran Freedom and Support Act. This legislation is needed now more than ever in light of the recent developments in Iran's nuclear capability. My bill has strong bipartisan support with 52 cosponsors. This legislation is a way to promote democracy inside Iran, and will hopefully help foster the development of a democratic government in Iran that is not committed to developing nuclear weapons. The fact that more than half of the U.S. Senate is supporting the legislation speaks to the strengths of the bill and the need for action."
   The Iran Freedom and Support Act has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In March, Senator Santorum testified before the Committee and encouraged members to report the legislation to the full Senate for consideration.
