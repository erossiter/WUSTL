SEN. SANTORUM ADVOCATES TO PREVENT CUTS TO FOOD STAMP PROGRAM
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, recently joined 14 of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Sen.  
 Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, requesting that he continue his leadership to protect the food stamp program and reject any proposed cuts by the U.S. House of Representatives as he works to resolve the differences between the Senate and House reconciliation bills. 
   "I am pleased that the Senate was able to find savings without making any cuts to the food stamp program," said Senator Santorum. "However, I am concerned that the proposed cuts by the House will impact low-income individuals who benefit from the food stamp program. Having traveled to each and every county in my state and heard firsthand from my constituents about this vital program, I understand that food stamps are essential for some families to put food on the table. We must never neglect those who are less fortunate, who rely on food stamp benefits for basic nourishment." 
   During Senate Agriculture Committee consideration of its budget reconciliation package, Senator Santorum strongly advocated for shielding nutrition programs from funding cuts to continue to provide a safety net for needy Americans.
