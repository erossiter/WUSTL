SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FINAL APPROVAL OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA ENERGY AND WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a Senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced federal funding for Energy and Water projects contained in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "This funding is crucial to the environmental and economic stability of the communities associated with significant waterways in Pennsylvania. Through this funding we will be able to more efficiently transport products in and out of Philadelphia, as well as preserve the beauty of the Presque Isle State Park," said Santorum. "Following the severe flooding across the state this fall, I am pleased to see the significant funding designated for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project. Thousands of people along the Susquehanna River have endured more than thirty years of devastating floods; hopefully this project will help save homes and businesses from future flooding." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues in both the House and Senate have provided this funding for important projects throughout Pennsylvania," Specter said. "These projects will enhance the lives of community residents in a variety of ways, including making the Port of Philadelphia competitive with other ports, protecting residents from floods and preserving our state landmarks." 
   * $7.3 million for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which has been an ongoing since Tropical Storm Agnes caused widespread flooding in 1972. In January 1996, floods nearly breached the levee system, forcing emergency officials to evacuate more than 100,000 people. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and the community suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage. 
   * $1.65 million for the continuation of the Delaware River Main Channel Deepening project. The existing 40-foot-deep channel restricts the efficient movement of tankers, dry bulk carriers and container vessels. The 45-foot deepening project will result in transportation savings to commodities consisting of crude oil imports, iron ore imports, and scrap exports. 
   * $310,000 for sand replenishment at the Presque Isle State Park. A natural landmark, the peninsula consists of 55 off-shore, rubble mound breakwaters along the lakeward length of the Presque Isle Peninsula and placement of approximately 560,000 tons of beach sand fill. The initial construction was completed in 1992. However, in order to maintain the beaches, periodic repair and replenishment of the beach sand will be required for 50 years. 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is awaiting the President's signature.
