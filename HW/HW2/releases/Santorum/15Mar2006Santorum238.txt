SEN. SANTORUM EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENT PANEL'S 'FRESH LOOK' AT IRAQ
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today praised President Bush for cooperating with an independent group organized by the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). "The Iraq Study Group" will conduct a forward-looking, independent assessment of the current and prospective situation on the ground in Iraq, its impact on the surrounding region, and consequences for U.S. interests, according to USIP. 
   USIP is organizing The Iraq Study Group with the support of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Center for the Study of the Presidency (CSP), and the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.
   On January 5th, Senator Santorum sent a letter to President Bush expressing his concerns regarding the military operations in Iraq and the need to better assess the progress toward achieving the goal of building a democracy in the Middle East. In the letter, Senator Santorum called for the creation of a panel of experts to objectively and critically report to the American people on the progress being made in Iraq. Additionally, on January 12th, Senator Santorum delivered a speech at Valley Force Military Academy calling for a "fresh look" at the situation in Iraq.
   "I believe that all Americans will benefit from an objective assessment of our continuing successes in Iraq and the challenges our troops face there," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that the Iraq Study Group will have the opportunity to provide this important new perspective on what needs to be done to ensure our success in Iraq so that the brave men and women serving our country can return home safely."
