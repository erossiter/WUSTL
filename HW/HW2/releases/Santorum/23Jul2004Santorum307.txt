SENS. SPECTER, SANTORUM ANNOUNCE FINAL PASSAGE OF FUNDING FOR SOUTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA PROJECTS
  Sens. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the U.S. Congress has provided final approval of funding for several defense-related projects in the Southeastern Pennsylvania area for fiscal year 2005. Sen. Specter said, "I am pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate have approved this funding for these important projects. These projects, key to our nation's defense, will be invaluable in our continuing war against terror. I am confident that these projects will go far in supporting the men and women who serve our country."  
   "This funding is critical in improving our national defense and equipping our troops with the most up-to-date information, technology and equipment," said Senator Santorum. "These projects will provide Pennsylvania with the opportunity to take the lead in defense-related research and development." 
   The U.S. Congress gave its final approval last night to the FY 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill. The House and Senate approved the measure in separate votes. The legislation now goes to the President for his signature. Funding was approved for the following projects: 
   * $11 million to Drexel University in Philadelphia County for the Applied Communications and Information Networking (ACIN) Program. ACIN will adapt and equip the Department of Defense with state-of-the-art communications and networking technology to facilitate command and control, cooperative engagement, precision strikes, intelligence dissemination, logistics, and daily operations. 
   * $7 million to Metro Machine, Inc., in Philadelphia County for a Ship Disposal Program. This program will assist the Navy in meeting its goals of decreasing its existing inventory in a cost-beneficial and environmentally sound manner. Additionally, it will reduce the Navy's financial and environmental liabilities associated with maintaining the inactive ship inventory and thereby ensure a long-term return on this short-term disposal investment. 
   * $5.6 million to Gestalt in Montgomery County for the Distributed Mission Interoperability Toolkit (DMIT) program. DMIT is a suite of tools that provide rapid interoperability among Air Mission C4I systems and simulation models. This system aids decision makers to carry out strategic and tactical adjustments that result in the coherent and successful utilization of disparate coalition forces and adapts to meet the current demands of a new world security environment. 
   * $4.9 million to International Engineering and Manufacturing in Delaware County for Science and Engineering Lab Data Integration (SELDI). This program provides a maintenance and logistics information management tool that improves missile and aircraft readiness and safety while reducing support costs significantly. 
   * $3.9 million to Piaseki Aircraft in Delaware County for the VTDP Compound Helicopter Technology Flight Demonstration program. This funding would complete the transition of the Navy's YSH-60F/VTDP Compound Helo ATD to the Army. This funding will assist in the completion of component qualification tests, final assembly of the flight test aircraft and commencement of functional and ground tests leading to flight. 
   * $2.5 million for the Universal Space Network, Inc. in Montgomery County to support further testing and validation of a Civil Reserve Space Service (CRSS) Initiative. The funds will also support the use of commercial tracking antennas that have demonstrated the performance standards established for the CRSS Initiative by the Air Force's Center for Research Support. 
   * $2.8 million to DRS Technologies in Philadelphia County to increase interoperability requirements for Naval battle groups. This funding will assist the Navy in obtaining innovative avionics integration solutions which will reduce the size, weight and volume in legacy and new design platforms. 
   * $1.8 million to Villanova University for the Applied Research in Computing Enterprise Services (ACRES). This program will leverage existing enterprise technology research and development success in the commercial arena, focusing both academic and industry research on unique military issues not addressed by commercial technology. The research will provide increases in the efficiency of military operations, improve intelligence gathering and sharing and lower the cost of developing future command and control systems. 
   * $1.4 million to Drexel University in Philadelphia County for the National Bioterrorism Civilian Medical Response Center (CIMERC). In 2000, Drexel University received a Congressional designation as the National Bioterrorism Civilian Medical Response Center (CIMERC). Since its inception, CIMERC has been working with the US Army (Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center at Fort Detrick, MD) to develop a demonstration test-bed for new technologies related to bioterrorism which are linked to bioterrorism civilian preparedness and crisis response. 
   * $1.4 million to L-3 SPD Electrical Systems in Philadelphia County for the High-Speed Power Node Switching Center. This center will provide the circuit breakers and switchgear necessary to distribute the increased electrical power of an all-electric ship in the confined, crowded space and limited weight environment of a naval ship. 
   * $2 million to Rajant Corporation in Delaware County for Portable and Mobile Emergency Broadband Systems. The systems will ensure the secure and efficient transmission and routing of voice, video, and data traffic at a disaster site and enable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate rescue and recovery efforts. 
   * $1.4 million for Temple University in Philadelphia County for Regional Medical Distributive Learning. This program, which is part of the Temple University Medicine's Health Sciences Library, utilizes incoming medical research, data and distance learning techniques to provide interactive information exchange, accreditation courses, and distributive learning for medical personnel including levels of federal, state and local emergency responders. 
   * $1.4 million to American Competitiveness Institute in Philadelphia County for the DD(X) Ship System Power Electronics Technologies program. This program will develop and demonstrate high power switch and conversion equipment manufacturing methods and processes that will ensure affordable solid state power electronics system technologies in direct support of the DD(X) program, including specific manufacturing and process improvements at the system and component level with a direct integration into high density advanced motors, solid state switch and distribution systems. 
   * $1 million to Franklin Fuel Cells in Chester County for Copper-Ceramic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Technology research. Deployment of fuel cells has the potential to greatly reduce military fuel costs and distribution logistics. However, current fuel cell technologies must use either hydrogen or zero/low sulfur fuels which makes them impractical for military deployment. This program will design, fabricate, and demonstrate a 2 kW copper-ceramic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) auxiliary power unit prototype to be delivered to the Navy no later than July 2007. 
   * $1 million to Silicon Power in Chester County for the Electromagnetic Gun Initiative. The goal of the effort is to develop a switch module that would achieve the established targets for power level, size, and mass of a pulse-power system for a 2-megajoule electromagnetic gun system (EMGun).
