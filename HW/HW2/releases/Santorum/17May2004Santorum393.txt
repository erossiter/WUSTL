SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE UPON ENFORCEMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS RULING ALLOWING SAME-SEX MARRIAGES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented on today's enforcement of the Massachusetts' Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage:  
   "Marriage has been defined for 6,000 years as a commitment between a man and a woman bonding together in love, providing a stable environment in which to raise children. Children need a mother and a father, and changing the definition of marriage sends a message to future generations that a mother and a father are not necessary for raising a healthy family. 
   "The law enacted today in Massachusetts represents a national crisis. Now that the state has issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples, out-of-state couples will seek recognition through the courts in their home states. Marriage is a public good that serves as a foundation for society. The only way we can protect traditional marriage is for Congress to pass a federal constitutional amendment upholding the definition as that of a union between a man and a woman, and then let the people, not the courts, decide what is best for all Americans." 
   Passing a federal constitutional amendment requires two-thirds passage in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of the states.
