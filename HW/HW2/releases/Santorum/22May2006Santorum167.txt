SEN. SANTORUM JOINS ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES IN ALLENTOWN TO UNVEIL MAJOR ANTI-GANG INITIATIVE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today joined United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in Allentown at a press conference to announce the launch of an Anti-Gang Initiative for the Route 222 Corridor.  
   "It is disturbing to see that violent, gang-related crime has surfaced as a serious problem throughout the Lehigh Valley," said Senator Santorum. "I appreciate Attorney General Gonzales taking the time to visit Pennsylvania to get a first-hand account of the problems confronting Allentown, Easton, Bethlehem, Reading and Lancaster due to the influx of gangs throughout the region. The Anti-Gang Initiative that we are announcing today shows tremendous promise to bring about real changes which will help establish safer, more secure neighborhoods and communities in the Route 222 Corridor." 
   The Anti-Gang Initiative unveiled today by the Department of Justice is intended to prevent gang-related violence, enforce existing laws against violent gang offenders, and assist in prisoner re-entry to society. The Initiative has three key components: prevention, enforcement, and a grant-funding program. 
   Prior to the major announcement, Attorney General Gonzales and Senator Santorum joined Ed Pawlowski, Mayor of Allentown, and other local officials for a walking tour through an Allentown neighborhood. Senator Santorum and Attorney General Gonzales met with residents of the neighborhood along the way to learn about how the violent crime and gang violence are affecting their community.
