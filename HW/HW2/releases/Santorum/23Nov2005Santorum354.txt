SEN. SANTORUM DONATES COMPUTERS TO PENNSYLVANIA SCHOOLS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced five schools that received computers as part of the United States Senate Computers for Schools Program.  
   The program helps public schools take advantage of the information technology age by channeling surplus computers into classrooms across the country. Senators have the option of participating in the program to return technology paid by taxpayers back to the taxpayers by way of donating computers to public schools. 
   "I am pleased to have this opportunity to give back to Pennsylvania schools in a direct way. It is crucial that public schools be equipped with modern technology so that they can be a competitive force in producing prepared and quality students who possess basic technology skills that are fundamental to any career choice," said Senator Santorum. 
   Pursuant to the authorizing statute, all registered public schools in the United States and territories are eligible for the program. The term "public school" means a public elementary or secondary school as such terms are defined in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801). Only registered, public schools may participate in this program. Public schools can register on the GSA website at http://www.computers.fed.gov. 
   The following schools have each received five computers: 
   * Monessen Senior High School in Monessen, Westmoreland County 
   * Brownsville High School in Brownsville, Fayette County 
   * Olney High School in Philadelphia, Philadelphia County 
   * John P. Turner Middle School in Philadelphia, Philadelphia County 
   * Chester Village Charter School in Chester Township, Chester County.
