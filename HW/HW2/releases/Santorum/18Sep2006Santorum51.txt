SEN. SANTORUM DELIVERS FEDERAL FUNDING TO FIGHT CRIME IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today presented federal funding secured through the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Justice appropriations bill to support the Montgomery County Pro-Active Law Enforcement Initiative Project.  
   "I am pleased to present $211,000 in federal funding to increase Montgomery County law enforcement's ability to fight crime. Hopefully various law enforcement agencies will coordinate and communicate, and act as one voice to reduce crime and make Montgomery County a safer place to live, work, and raise a family," said Senator Santorum. 
   The Montgomery County Pro-Active Law Enforcement Initiative Project is formerly known as C.L.E.A.N., this program at its height was comprised of twelve officers and one prosecutor. Today only three officers and one prosecutor remain assigned to the Pro-Active Law Enforcement Initiative Project, substantially reducing the ability of the network to achieve its mission. With this funding, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office can more effectively reduce crime. 
   "The concept pioneered by the CLEAN program proved how bringing together various law enforcement agencies to fight for a common goal is effective in combating street level crime," said Montgomery County District Attorney, Bruce Castor. "Senator Santorum has yet again shown his commitment to law enforcement in Montgomery County by helping us continue fighting crime using the CLEAN model."
