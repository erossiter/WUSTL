SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON WORLD AIDS DAY 2006
Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement regarding World AIDS Day 2006:  
 "World AIDS Day is an opportunity to highlight the pandemic of HIV/AIDS and give a voice to the more than 41 million people suffering with AIDS worldwide. Combating HIV/AIDS is one of the greatest challenges of our time and World AIDS Day reminds us all that, as Americans, we have the responsibility to aid and provide adequate funding to the men, women, and children affected by HIV/AIDS around the world. We must remain unwavering in our commitment to fight HIV/AIDS." 
 Throughout his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Senator Santorum has worked in a bipartisan fashion to provide funding for those suffering from HIV/AIDS. Earlier this year, Senator Santorum successfully worked to increase the United States' contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to $866 million in fiscal year 2007.
