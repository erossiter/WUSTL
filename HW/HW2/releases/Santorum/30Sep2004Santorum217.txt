SEN. SANTORUM HONORED BY SENIOR CITIZENS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was presented with the Medicare Choices Leadership award from Pennsylvania senior citizens.  
   A group of seniors traveled to Washington, DC to present the award to Senator Santorum on behalf of the Coalition for Medicare Choices, and to thank him for his leadership on Medicare issues and expanding their health care choices through the Medicare Advantage program. 
   "I am honored to receive this award and I thank the Pennsylvanians who traveled to Washington to show their support for Medicare," Senator Santorum said. "As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am proud to have played an active role in crafting the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which will provide seniors with more health care choices, better benefits, and bring Medicare more into line with 21st century medicine." 
   Senator Santorum was also presented with the Ben Franklin Award and the Guardian of Seniors' Rights Award, which is a top honor from the 60 Plus Association, for his work to protect Social Security and Medicare. The 60 Plus Association is a senior advocacy group comprised of 4.5 million seniors. The organization honors Members of Congress who vote in favor of legislation benefiting senior citizens. 
   "Pennsylvania has one of the largest populations of seniors in the country," Senator Santorum said. "As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I take great pride in representing and listening to the concerns of older Pennsylvanians and I appreciate the 60 Plus Association for acknowledging my voting record in the United States Senate."
