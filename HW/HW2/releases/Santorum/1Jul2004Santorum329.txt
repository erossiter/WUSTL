SEN. SANTORUM COSPONSORS LEGISLATION HONORING SOJOURNER TRUTH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, is an original cosponsor of bipartisan legislation that calls for the revision of a statue commemorating women's suffrage located in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol to include a likeness of activist Sojourner Truth.  
   The legislation, sponsored by Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), acknowledges Sojourner Truth as a towering figure among the founders of the movement for women's suffrage in the United States. The "Portrait Monument," as it is commonly known, was sculpted by Adelaide Johnson, and currently features the portrait busts of Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. It was presented to the Capitol as a gift from the women of the United States by the National Women's Party, and was accepted on behalf of Congress by the Joint Committee on the Library on February 10, 1921. Five days later, the statue was unveiled coinciding with the 101st anniversary of the birth of Susan B. Anthony, and was installed in the Crypt of the U.S. Capitol until an act of Congress in 1996 relocated it to the Rotunda. 
   The statue of the three female suffragists includes a large slab of stone that has never been sculpted. It appears that a fourth person was intended to be included as part of the piece. 
   "This legislation calls for the empty piece of stone to bear the likeness of Sojourner Truth, the only African American among the group in the current sculpture," said Santorum. 
   "Sojourner Truth, a woman who was once a slave, led a life of great hardship and adversity only to become an activist who worked to bring an end to slavery, and help lead women's suffrage in America," said Santorum. "I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that recognizes the role of Sojourner Truth in the historical movement that gave all women in America the constitutional right to vote."
