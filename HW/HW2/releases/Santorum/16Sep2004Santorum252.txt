SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES COMPASSION CAPITAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced that the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded funding, through the Compassion Capital Fund, to faith and community-based organizations in Pennsylvania.  
   This funding will be given to five organizations throughout Pennsylvania that work on issues such as at-risk youth, homelessness, healthy marriages and serving people in rural communities. It will also allow the organizations to increase their effectiveness, enhance their ability to provide social services and create partnerships to better serve those in need.

It is important that we continue to help those who are less fortunate by offering assistance and guidance in their time of need."
