SEN. SANTORUM COSPONSORS AMENDMENT TO PROMOTE MINE SAFETY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of Senate Republican Conference, today announced Senate passage of an amendment to provide tax incentives for mine safety equipment. Sen.  
 Santorum cosponsored the amendment with Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Robert Byrd (D-WV). 
   "I am pleased to work with my colleagues from West Virginia - who know firsthand the need for enhanced safety measures to protect miners from the hazards of their jobs," said Senator Santorum. "The tax incentives included in this amendment will have a profound effect on the ability of mines -small and large - to purchase the most up-to-date equipment to ensure the safety of the mine." 
   The amendment provides tax incentives to companies for the purchase of costly advanced mine safety equipment. Many mines, particularly small operations, have a hard time affording equipment that is not required, but which would make the mine a safer place. This amendment will help make this new technology more affordable by providing partial expensing for the equipment. This equipment includes: emergency communication technology; electronic location devices; emergency oxygen-generating, self-rescue devices that provide oxygen for at least 90 minutes; pre-positioned supplies of oxygen to allow miners in case of accident to survive at least 48 hours; and comprehensive atmospheric monitoring systems which monitor the levels of carbon monoxide, methane, and oxygen present in all areas of the mine. 
   The amendment also provides a partial tax credit for the amount employers spend to train their employees as mine rescue teams.
