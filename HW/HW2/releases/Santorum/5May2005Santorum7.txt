SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS WILLOW GROVE NAVAL AIR STATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was in Montgomery County today to express his support for the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NASJRB) Willow Grove.  
   "The installation has been a valued asset to our nation for over 60 years and has played a key role in meeting our national security requirements," said Senator Santorum. "I have continually highlighted the strengths of NASJRB Willow Grove during my tenure in the Senate, and I will work to ensure that Pennsylvania continues to benefit from its presence." 
   Senator Santorum recently met with members of the Suburban Horsham Willow Grove Chamber of Commerce to discuss NASJRB Willow Grove. Additionally, Senator Santorum sent a letter to Admiral Vern Clark, Chief of Naval Operations for the Department of the Navy, voicing his support for NASJRB Willow Grove and urging the Navy to continue its much valued commitment to the installation.
