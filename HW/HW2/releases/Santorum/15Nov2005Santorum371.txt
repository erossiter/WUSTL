SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA INFRASTRUCTURE, FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that Congress has approved federal funding for Army Corps of Engineers projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is part of the Fiscal Year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.  
   "This funding provides for flood protection projects and maintenance of the waterway infrastructure; the failure of which would be devastating to flood prone communities and the industries that depend on Pennsylvania's rivers," said Senator Santorum. 
   "I am pleased my Congressional colleagues have provided this funding for these important projects throughout Pennsylvania," Senator Specter said. "These projects will enhance the lives of community residents in a variety of ways, including making the Port of Philadelphia competitive with other ports, protecting residents from floods and securing our essential locks and dams system." 
   The Fiscal Year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill passed the Senate on November 14, 2005 with a vote of 84-4. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 9, 2005. The bill will now be sent to the President for his signature. 
   Projects contained in today's announcement include: 
   * $50.8 million for Locks and Dams 2, 3, and 4, Monongahela River in Allegheny County for rehabilitation. The nearly century old locks and dams are the last of the old and undersized locks on the Monongahela River system and are structurally unstable. There is a substantial chance that important structural components of these facilities could fail at any time which could devastate water supplies to communities and vital industries, as well as stalling commerce through the Port of Pittsburgh; 
   * $15 million for Emsworth Locks and Dams, Ohio River in Allegheny County for rehabilitation. The proposed project includes replacement of the dam gates, gate hoisting machinery, electrical power and distribution system and scour protection system; 
   * $10.496 million for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which has been ongoing since Tropical Storm Agnes caused widespread flooding in 1972. In January 1996, floods nearly breached the levee system, forcing emergency officials to evacuate more than 100,000 people. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and the community suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage; 
   * $2.25 million for the Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project. The existing 40 foot deep channel restricts the efficient movement of tankers, dry bulk carriers and container vessels. The 45-foot deepening project will result in transportation savings to commodities consisting of crude oil imports, iron ore imports, and scrap exports; 
   * $1.275 million for the Upper Ohio River Navigation Study of Emsworth, Dashields, Montgomery Locks and Dams in Allegheny County to continue a long-term feasibility study on the three aged structures; 
   * $750,000 for the Three Rivers Wet Weather Demonstration Program in Allegheny County to reroute streams from municipal sewers into restored natural channels in Sheraden Park in Pittsburgh and Stowe Township; 
   * $750,000 for the Fairmount Dam Fishladder in Philadelphia County to increase efficiency by reconfiguring the structure to allow for passage of American Shad. The reconfiguration will provide access to a habitat that will spawn and rear Shad and other migratory fish on the Schuylkill River; 
   * $465,000 for the Presque Isle Peninsula in Erie for maintenance of the beaches, periodic repair and replenishment of the beach sand; 
   * $430,000 for the Upper Tioga River Watershed in Tioga County for a restoration report, which will identify the economic benefits of restoring the Upper Tioga River Watershed for local, state and national interests.
