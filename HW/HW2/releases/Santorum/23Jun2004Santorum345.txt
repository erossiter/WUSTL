  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced the Senate passage of S. 2400, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, which authorized more than $356 million for defense-related activities in Pennsylvania for fiscal year 2005.  
   "It is important that we provide our servicemen and women the equipment and technology they need to defend and protect our country," said Senator Santorum. "This legislation reaffirms Pennsylvania's strong role in our national defense." 
   Pennsylvania provisions in the bill include funding for research, development, test and evaluation initiatives; operations and maintenance funding for military operations; increases improving the lives of our military personnel; and significant increases in funding to support procurement accounts for the military services. 
   The bill authorizes the following for research and development initiatives: 
   * $3 million for further testing and validation of the Civil Reserve Space Service which supports the use of commercial satellite tracking and other control networks to enhance the Air Force Satellite Control Network. Universal Space Network of Horsham, PA has been working with the Air Force on this initiative. 
   * $3 million for continued development of the Portable and Mobile Emergency Broadband System, which provides wide-area, rapidly deployable wireless voice and data communications for connectivity between personnel in and around the "hot zone" to the command center. The Rajant Corporation of Wayne, PA has been leading research efforts on this technology. 
   * $10 million for continued development efforts on the Army's Precision Guided Mortar Munition. This funding would help reduce risk and accelerate fielding of this 120 mm mortar by doubling the range capability to engage targets with vastly reduced collateral damage. General Dynamics of Red Lion, PA and Medico Industries of Wilkes-Barre, PA are both working on this project. 
   * $15 million for additional work on the Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser, which provides warfighters with a weapon to defend against a wide variety of threats. Brashear, LP of Pittsburgh, PA has been a partner on this program. 
   * $2 million for development and upgrade manufacturing techniques for munitions that are environmentally friendly and improve the lethality of armor piercing rounds. Partners on this research initiative include Osram Sylvania of Towanda, PA, General Dynamics of Red Lion, PA and Penn State University. 
   * $10.5 million for the Army's efforts to develop the next generation of ground vehicles and improve current tactical vehicles. Alcoa of Pittsburgh, PA has been a leader in this research. 
   The bill authorizes the following for operations and maintenance initiatives: 
   * $262 million added for the Army's operations and maintenance account to provide essential military items to our warfighters as quickly as possible. Language in the bill's report specifically identifies the Advanced Combat Helmet, developed by the Army and Mine Safety Appliances of Pittsburgh, PA as an item worthy of procurement. 
   The bill authorizes the following for procurement accounts: 
   Senator Santorum introduced an amendment to the bill authorizing $5 million for the procurement of either M109-based command-and-control vehicles or field artillery ammunition support vehicles for the Army. The new vehicles manufactured by United Defense, LP of York, PA would provide the Army with improved operational capabilities. The Senate unanimously agreed to adopt this amendment.
