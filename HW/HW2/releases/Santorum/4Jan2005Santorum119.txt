SEN. SANTORUM LAUNCHES NEW SENATE WEBSITE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announces that he has launched a new Senate website for his constituents.  
   "As a United States Senator, one of my highest priorities is to remain accessible and responsive to the people of Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum said. "The new website enables constituents to email me with their questions and concerns. It also provides Pennsylvanians with an opportunity to quickly access an array of information ranging from my views on important issues to tourism and regional information from the Keystone State." 
   The Senator's website can be accessed at . One new feature of the site is a regional map, which provides constituents with one-click access to the Senator's office in their area of the Commonwealth. Another new feature is an online quick poll, which offers visitors to the site an opportunity to cast their vote on a current issue, and view the results of the poll instantly. 
   Pennsylvania constituents visiting the site can email Senator Santorum, schedule tours of various Washington D.C. attractions, request American flags, learn about federal grant programs, seek help from federal agencies, and access Congressional internship applications. Additionally, the site provides the contact information for the Senator's nine offices. The site offers members of the press as well as constituents access to the Senator's press releases, statements, speeches, weekly columns, as well as video and audio clips. 
   "Today marks the official start of the 109th Congress and so it is appropriate that the website is launched on such an occasion. I am hopeful that my constituents will find the new website to be user-friendly and resourceful."
