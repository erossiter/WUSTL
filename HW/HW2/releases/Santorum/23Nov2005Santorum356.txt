SEN. SANTORUM URGES STATE OFFICIALS TO TAKE ACTION ON BEHALF OF PENNSYLVANIA'S SENIORS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, sent a letter to Gov.  
 Rendell to express his concern regarding the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) program and the new Medicare prescription drug coverage. 
   "I have heard concerns from many constituents across our state expressing their anger and frustration over the lack of coordination between PACE and the new Medicare prescription drug coverage," said Senator Santorum. "My hope is that this letter to Governor Rendell regarding this urgent matter will result in immediate action on the part of state officials to resolve the issues at the state level that are preventing PACE beneficiaries from taking advantage of what should be a wonderful benefit for many Pennsylvanians. If the current issues with the PACE program can be resolved, Pennsylvanians stand to gain hundreds of millions of dollars to both ensure a smooth transition, and most importantly, enhance benefits for Pennsylvania's seniors." 
   Senator Santorum today held an information and registration seminar regarding the new Medicare prescription drug coverage. 
   "One of my greatest responsibilities as a United States Senator is advocating on behalf of Pennsylvania's seniors to protect their health so they can age with the comfort and dignity they deserve. I was proud to support the Medicare Modernization Act, and I am committed to ensuring that Pennsylvanians are provided with a smooth transition if they choose to enroll in a new plan that will protect their health and save them money on prescription drugs," said Senator Santorum.
