SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES $11.4 MILLION IN PROPOSED FUNDING FOR LETTERKENNY ARMY DEPOT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that S. 2974, the Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005, includes an appropriation of $11.4 million for Letterkenny Army Depot located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.  
   The Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) intends to use this funding for improvements to the depot's missile storage igloos. LEAD is the major storage site for tactical missiles and munitions on the East Coast. It is a joint military service operation. LEAD has 902 storage igloos that were constructed in the 1940's to store low-tech ammunition. Upgrades to the missile storage igloos will provide the depot with a more efficient means of access for the storage and transportation of munitions stored at LEAD. 
   "I am pleased that this funding for the Letterkenny Army Depot has been included in the legislation brought up today, " Santorum said. "I look forward to the Senate passage of this important legislation so that the Letterkenny Army Depot receives the resources they need to upgrade the missile storage units." 
   The Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005 provides funding for the planning, design, construction, alteration and improvement of military facilities worldwide, both for the active and reserve forces. It serves as the source for the U.S. share of the NATO Security Investment Program, and provides funding to implement base closure and realignments authorized by law. 
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense. The improvements at the Letterkenny storage site will allow us to continue the efforts to achieve a more safe and secure nation," Santorum said.
