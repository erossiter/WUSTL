SEN. SANTORUM JOINS REPS. HART, MURPHY IN PITTSBURGH TO DISCUSS WAYS TO EMPOWER PENNSYLVANIANS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE DECISIONS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, participated in a panel discussion in Pittsburgh with Reps.  
 Melissa Hart (R-PA-4th) and Tim Murphy (R-PA-18th) about Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and expanding Pennsylvanians' access to quality and affordable heath care. 
   "Health Savings Accounts empower individuals in their healthcare decisions and give them an asset that they own, control and can use for their health care as they grow older," said Senator Santorum. "If an individual lives a healthy lifestyle, takes advantage of preventive care, and does not ignore health warning signs until significant hospitalization or surgery is necessary, the HSA continues to grow tax-free, as a nest egg for the future." 
   Health Savings Accounts give consumers a stake in how their healthcare dollars are spent and allow more freedom, choice, and responsibility for healthcare decisions. Also known as "medical IRAs," these accounts create an opportunity for employees and employers to put money aside to be spent tax-free as long as it is spent on health care. 
   "I supported the passage of H.R. 1, which established HSAs, and I am pleased that Pennsylvanians are taking advantage of this new insurance option," Senator Santorum said. "I will continue to support legislation that would enable uninsured and self-employed individuals to use pre-tax dollars to buy health insurance, and I will work to ensure that all Pennsylvanians have access to quality and affordable health insurance."
