SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON AMERICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, JOB CREATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on U.S. economic growth and job creation:  
   "President Bush's Jobs and Growth tax relief package, enacted last year, has encouraged consumer confidence, and business and job growth, to help keep our economy strong and become stronger. Economic figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor today reveal that our economy is moving in the right direction but there is more work to be done. 
   "We've seen the national unemployment rate continue to decline from its peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003. In fact, in July the rate decreased to 5.5 percent, the lowest unemployment rate since October 2001. This decline reveals that average, hard-working Americans are finding work. At 5.5 percent, the unemployment rate is below the average of the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. 
   "The manufacturing sector, an industry vital to Pennsylvania's economy, has also seen an increase in jobs, adding 91,000 jobs since January, including 10,000 in July. 
   "In July, 32,000 jobs were created nationwide, bringing the total to over 2.3 million jobs created since August 2003. We must continue to increase our nation's job growth by pushing forward on a pro-growth economic agenda that meets the needs of the American people. 
   "Stable jobs, strong businesses and industries, and consumer confidence all have key roles to play in maintaining America's powerful economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
