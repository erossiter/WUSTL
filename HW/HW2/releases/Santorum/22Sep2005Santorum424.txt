SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO GUARANTEE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FOR SENIORS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced s. 1750, the Social Security Guarantee Act of 2005, legislation requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a written guarantee of a monthly benefit to each Social Security recipient, along with a guaranteed annual cost-of-living increase, to any individual born before 1950.  
   "I have held dozens of town hall meetings throughout Pennsylvania, and the main theme I heard from seniors was that they were concerned that efforts to strengthen Social Security for younger workers may jeopardize their benefits," said Senator Santorum. "It's important to let our seniors know that the benefits that they worked so hard for will not change. By guaranteeing benefits to seniors and eliminating these fears, the Social Security debate can focus on real solutions for Americans who were born after 1950. This legislation is an important first step to broader reform, reassuring seniors that their benefits will be there for them - Guaranteed." 
   In 1960, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Fleming v. Nestor that Americans have no legal right to their Social Security benefits. The Social Security Guarantee Act would create a legal right for seniors to receive a monthly Social Security benefit. 
   "Many Americans rightly feel a powerful sense of ownership over their Social Security benefits after contributing a lifetime's worth of hard work into the system," said Senator Santorum. "By guaranteeing benefits, we can now begin to focus on ensuring benefits for future generations, while providing the peace of mind to seniors that they deserve." 
   Senator Santorum is Chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aging.
