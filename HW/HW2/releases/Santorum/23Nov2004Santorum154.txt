SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF ALLENTOWN/READING AREA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate has passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which provides funding for several transportation projects in the Allentown/Reading area.  
   "I am pleased that Congress has approved funding to expand and improve our roadways and mass transit infrastructure in communities in and around Allentown and Reading," Senator Santorum said. "It is important that Pennsylvania continuously maintain and modernize transportation throughout the Commonwealth in order to ensure the safe travel of its citizens, create more efficient means of transportation, and sustain a robust economy." 
   "It's heartening to see my colleagues recognize the importance of these transportation projects, which are vital to driving local economies in the Allentown/Reading area," Senator Specter said. 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   These announcements include: 
   * $3 million for the Route 412 Corridor Improvements Project, which will be used for the 3rd Street Corridor improvements sub-project, part of the broader Route 412 Improvements project which consists of the widening of 412 from I-78 to the Minsi Trail Bridge, transportation systems improvements, and replacement of an access ramp to the Hill to Hill Bridge. The project is critical to the redevelopment of 1,800 acres of brownfield left by Bethlehem Steel. 
   * $2 million to the Berks Area Reading Transportation Authority (BARTA) for the design, engineering and construction of a Park-N-Transit facility in downtown Reading. This facility will provide 350 critically needed parking spaces and serve as a major transfer point in the BARTA bus system, allowing riders to connect to services provided throughout the County. The project will also compliment SEPTA's Schuylkill Valley Metro rail project, allowing riders to utilize the park-n-ride facility. 
   * $1 million for the American Parkway Project in Allentown, consisting of a four-lane urban arterial highway with a signature bridge over the Lehigh River, connecting Center City Allentown with U.S. Route 22. Funds will be used for corridor improvements, including context sensitive design of the bridge structure.
