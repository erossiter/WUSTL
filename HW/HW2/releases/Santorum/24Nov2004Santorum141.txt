SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA ENERGY PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced federal funding for projects in Pennsylvania. The energy funding is part of the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "This funding will allow communities in Pennsylvania to continue to seek ways of providing more efficient means of energy production," Senator Santorum said. "The research conducted as a result of this funding will provide expansive knowledge of improvements to energy production." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues have approved funding for these important Pennsylvania projects," Senator Specter said. "The research these projects yield will result in cleaner and more efficient energy production, and will increase our productivity and competitiveness in the global market." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   Funding has been approved for the following projects, which would be allocated through the Department of Energy (DOE): 
   * $69.25 million for the National Energy Technology Lab in Allegheny County to fund operations and research. 
   * $15.6 million for Advanced Turbine Systems Research by Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation in Allegheny County and others to develop coal based power generation facilities, which can utilize large and secure reserves of coal in Pennsylvania and elsewhere in cleaner and more efficient ways. 
   * $5.3 million for Ion Transport Membrane (ITM) Syngas Project, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., in Lehigh County to fund technologies to produce synthesis gas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) from natural gas in a single step, a key component of fuel cell development. 
   * $5.1 million for Vision 21 Hybrids Transition Program by Siemens Westinghouse to continue important work on tubular solid oxide fuel cell technology.
