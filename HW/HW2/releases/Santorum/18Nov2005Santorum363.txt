SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF CHARITABLE GIVING INCENTIVES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today applauded the charitable giving provisions that were included in the Tax Relief Act of 2005 (S. 2020). The charitable giving provisions included are part of Sen. Santorum's CARE Act (S. 1780), which he introduced in the Senate earlier this year.  
   "I am pleased that the heart of the charitable giving incentives in the CARE Act have passed the Senate as part of the tax reconciliation bill," said Senator Santorum. "These provisions would help charities on the front lines get the resources necessary to meet the numerous needs in our nation's communities while providing individuals further incentives for giving." 
   Provisions from Senator Santorum's CARE Act that were incorporated into the Tax Relief Act of 2005 include: 
   * The opportunity to deduct a portion of charitable contributions for the 83 million Americans who do not currently itemize on their tax forms. This represents more than two-thirds of American tax filers and this group is estimated to contribute $36 billion to charities; 
   * Incentives for individuals to give tax-free contributions from their IRAs for charitable purposes, helping a wide range of charities and likely providing billions of dollars to help make higher education more accessible and affordable; 
   * Incentives for an estimated $2 billion worth of food donations from farmers, restaurants, and corporations to help those in need. America's Second Harvest estimates that this is the equivalent of 878 million meals for hungry Americans over 10 years. This incentive is strongly supported by food banks, farm bureaus, and hunger advocacy groups around the country; 
   * Enhanced deductions for charitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic and scholarly compositions that will allow artists that donate their work to deduct the fair market value of that donation; 
   * Charitable deductions for contributions of food and books for schools and libraries; 
   * Mileage reimbursements for charitable volunteers.
