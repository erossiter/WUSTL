SEN. SANTORUM JOINS CONGRESSIONAL DAIRY FARMER CAUCUS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, recently became a member of the Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus, a bipartisan group made up of House and Senate members focused on policy affecting the dairy industry.  
   "Joining the Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus will allow me to stay even more informed on the important issues within the dairy community," said Senator Santorum. "As an United States Senator representing the fourth largest dairy producing state in the country, it is important that I remain active and up-to-date on the interests and concerns of the many dairy farmers throughout Pennsylvania and work to best support those interests in the United States Senate." 
   The Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus will also help the dairy industry communicate to government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Trade Representative, and others about the concerns regarding policies that may affect the industry. 
   According to the USDA, Pennsylvania produced 860 million pounds of milk last year, an increase of 8.2 percent from the previous year; making it the fourth largest milk producing state in the country. 
   Senator Santorum has been a longtime supporter of Pennsylvania dairy farmers. Earlier this year, he led the fight to extend the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program through 2007. The MILC program supplements dairy producers during market downturns by providing dairy farmers with a compensatory payment whenever the minimum monthly market price of milk falls below a trigger price.
