SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS SENATE APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR LABOR, HEALTH, EDUCATION PROGRAMS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, voted in favor of an amendment, which passed the Senate today, to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution that would increase funding for labor, health and education programs by $7 billion. 
   "I was proud to support this amendment because it increases funding for various programs which I strongly support, such as the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program. Both the CSBG and the SSBG programs have been tremendous resources in Pennsylvania as they provide services to reduce poverty and help low-income families and communities.
   "Another program which I have consistently supported is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This amendment calls for an increase in funding for LIHEAP, which helps states like Pennsylvania receive additional funding for home heating and cooling assistance.
   "This amendment also aims to increase funding for federal health programs, including biomedical research, education and child care programs, such as Head Start, and workforce and job training programs. I appreciate the hard work of Senators Specter and Harkin, who cosponsored this important amendment."
