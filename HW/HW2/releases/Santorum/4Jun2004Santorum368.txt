SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for several fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   These grants are the first round of funding from the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. Congress approved $750 million in direct assistance for the 2004 program to support firefighters throughout the country. 
   This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the U.S. Congress and ODP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs. 
   "It is important to provide our fire departments and emergency personnel with the tools and training they need to protect our families and communities in Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will help local fire departments continue to enhance their technology so they can better protect the communities they serve." 
   In response to the Department's decision to provide the grant, Senator Specter said, "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people. This grant will help ensure that they can continue to protect our communities. I commend the Federal Emergency Management Agency for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services."
