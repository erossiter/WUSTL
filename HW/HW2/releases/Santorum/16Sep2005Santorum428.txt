SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF RESOLUTION SUPPORTING PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, applauded his Senate colleagues for the unanimous approval of a Senate resolution expressing a strong disapproval of the Senate with regard to the recent decision by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California in the case of Newdow, et al. v. The Congress of the United States of America, et al. ruling that the recitation of the current Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because of the phrase "under God."  
   "The Pledge of Allegiance is a unifying force in this nation. It draws all of us, regardless of race, religion, gender or national origin together in support of the common good. This decision is a prime example of why we need to put judges on the bench that will strictly interpret the law and not legislate from the bench," said Senator Santorum. 
   "I am pleased that my Senate colleagues supported this resolution. At a time when we should be uniting as a nation to support our troops around the world, it is a shame that an activist court is seeking to divide the nation instead of pursuing the selfless principle of the common good," said Senator Santorum.
