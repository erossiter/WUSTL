SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HOME ENERGY COSTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made available an additional $1 billion in low-income energy assistance, including $50,129,376 for Pennsylvania. These funds are administered by the Administration for Children and Families through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Pennsylvania has received $191,055,179 in LIHEAP funding so far this year. 
   The additional funding is provided by S. 2320 which transferred funds appropriated by the Deficit Reduction Act from FY2007 to FY2006. Senator Santorum cosponsored the bill, which was signed into law by the President on March 20, 2006.
   "I am very pleased that Pennsylvanians have received additional funding for the LIHEAP program," said Senator Santorum. "I have always been a strong advocate for LIHEAP and understand how challenging it can be for low-income families to meet the rising costs to heat their home."
   Since being elected to Congress in 1990, Senator Santorum has been a consistent supporter of LIHEAP. Senator Santorum's support for LIHEAP has come in several forms. In 1991, he twice voted against the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations bill primarily because it did not provide enough LIHEAP funding. Since this time, Senator Santorum has written no less than nine letters to his colleagues on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees urging sufficient LIHEAP funding. Senator Santorum has also written six letters to both President Bush and Clinton requesting that they prioritize LIHEAP in the annual budget process and release emergency LIHEAP funding when these funds were desperately needed. Senator Santorum supported three bipartisan amendments to various appropriations bills that would have provided additional LIHEAP funding this year.
