SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE $2.77 MILLION FOR PHIL. HOUSING AUTHORITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Philadelphia Housing Authority will receive $2,766,000 through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Home Ownership for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) program. 
   The funding will allow the Philadelphia Housing Authority to demolish 402 severely distressed public housing units at the Abbortsford Homes public housing development. 
   The HOPE VI program provides funding for the demolition and reconstruction of obsolete, severely distressed public housing. Ultimately, HOPE VI enhances communities by decentralizing poverty and giving families an opportunity to live in mixed-income neighborhoods with better educational and employment opportunities. 
   "This funding is vital to the development and revitalization of the neighborhoods of Philadelphia," said Senator Santorum. "The HOPE VI program provides residents with the skills they need to secure employment." 
   "The HOPE VI program has been very successful in providing low-income families with better housing, employment, and educational opportunities," Senator Specter said. "I am very pleased to see Philadelphia receive the resources it needs to provide these same opportunities to its residents in need."
