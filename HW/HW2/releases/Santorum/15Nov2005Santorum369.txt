SEN. SANTORUM PARTICIPATES IN HOMELAND SECURITY SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today participated in the Committee of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs' Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, and International Security oversight hearing on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Sen.  
 Santorum attended the hearing at the request of Sen. Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK), who serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee. 
   The hearing examined the security threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. Today's hearing comes before next week's meeting of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will consider referring Iran to the U.N. Security Council for the imposition of sanctions. 
   Witnesses at the hearing included: former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich; former Senator Alfonse D'Amato; former CIA Director R. James Woolsey; Dr. Gary S. Samore; Mr. Ray Takeyh; and Mr. Ilan Berman. 
   Senator Santorum is the sponsor of S. 333, the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005, a bill that supports the ability of the people of Iran to freely choose their own government, provides assistance to pro-democracy organizations, and strengthens provisions contained in the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act.
