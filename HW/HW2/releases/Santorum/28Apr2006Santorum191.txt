SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR JEFFERSON TOWNSHIP
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Rural Development has approved a Water and Waste Disposal direct loan and grant for Jefferson Township, Mercer County. The loan is in the amount of $1,282,000 and the grant provides $847,900. 
   The funding will be used to create a sewage collection system for 175 equivalent dwelling units in Jefferson Township, Mercer County with treatment at Hermitage. The area currently has malfunctioning on-lot sewage facilities resulting in serious health concerns.
   "I am pleased to have played a role in helping Jefferson Township obtain these important funds which will improve the sewage collection system," said Senator Santorum. "USDA Rural Development programs are important to keeping Pennsylvania clean and maintaining a safe and healthy environment. As Pennsylvania's first Senator to serve on the Agriculture Committee since 1904, I am committed to working with USDA Rural Development for the benefit of the Commonwealth."
