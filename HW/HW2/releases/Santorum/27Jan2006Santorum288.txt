SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR FIRE PREVENTION SAFETY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for fire companies in Pennsylvania. 
   "I pleased that the Union Hose Company of Annville and the Progress Volunteer Fire Department will benefit greatly from these grants," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will help to provide the knowledge and skills necessary to better protect Pennsylvania families from fire and fire-related hazards." 
   "These fire prevention and safety programs will help protect the citizens of Pennsylvania and the firefighters who risk their lives every day," Senator Specter said. "I commend the Department of Homeland Security for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services."
