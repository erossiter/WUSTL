SEN. SANTORUM CO-HOSTS FREE GRANT WRITING SEMINAR
  The office of Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development today co-hosted the first day of a two-day free Grant Writing Seminar for community- and faith-based organizations at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania at the Miller Learning Center in Edinboro. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development were on hand today and will be on hand tomorrow to provide instruction and tips on how to qualify for tax-exempt status and become more competitive for federal grant funds.  
   "These seminars are a great benefit to Pennsylvanians who run organizations that work to make our communities a better place to live, work and raise a family. The first day of the seminar has been a success with more than 70 people attending and we expect that tomorrow will be just as informative and helpful," said Senator Santorum. 
   Senator Santorum has worked to level the playing field for community and faith based organizations. He authored provisions in the 1996 welfare reform law allowing community- and faith-based organizations to compete as contractors in certain publicly funded service programs. In the 109th Congress, Senator Santorum introduced the CARE Act to help provide community- and faith-based organizations with the tools they need to help improve communities.
