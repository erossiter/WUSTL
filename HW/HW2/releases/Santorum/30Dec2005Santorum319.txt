SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $47.8 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP PENNSYLVANIA'S ELDERLY, DISABLED
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced federal funding for Pennsylvania from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for local programs in the form of Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program grants and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities grants. Both Section 202 and 811 grants are competitive and provide interest-free capital advances to nonprofit organizations.  
   "This is a significant announcement that HUD is providing Pennsylvania with more than $47.8 million for various programs that will provide housing for low-income elderly and persons with disabilities," said Senator Santorum. "This funding is crucial to helping elderly Pennsylvanians and those with disabilities live independently. The organizations, which provide assistance to these individuals, also ensure that men and women are receiving the support services and activities they need to live a fulfilling and comfortable life." 
   The Section 202 program helps expand the supply of affordable housing with supportive services for the elderly. It provides low-income elderly with options that allow them to live independently but in an environment that provides support activities such as cleaning, cooking, and transportation. HUD provides selected applicants with interest-free capital advances to finance the development of supportive housing for the elderly. The capital advance does not have to be repaid as long as the project serves very low-income elderly persons for forty years. 
   The Section 811 program allows persons with disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services. HUD provides selected applicants with interest-free capital advances to help finance the development of rental housing such as independent living projects, condominium units and small group homes with the availability of supportive services for persons with disabilities. The capital advance can finance the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition with or without rehabilitation of supportive housing and the advance does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income persons with disabilities for at least forty years.
