SEN. SANTORUM ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING TODAY'S CLOTURE VOTE ON MARRIAGE AMENDMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today following the Senate's 48-50 vote against proceeding to a debate on the text of S.J. Res. 40, the Marriage Amendment.  
   "Although I'm disappointed that we aren't able to continue the debate on Marriage Amendment in the Senate, I am pleased that we've been able to have three days of thoughtful, constructive debate on the importance of preserving and protecting traditional marriage as that of the union between a man and a woman. I see this vote today as a first step in the process of preserving the integrity of the institution of marriage for future generations. 
   "Through this debate the American public has had an opportunity to express their support for the institution of marriage. My office has received thousands of phone calls, letters, e-mails and faxes from Pennsylvanians in support of the Marriage Amendment. 
   "The future of marriage is a timely and vital dialogue and the American people deserve to have their voices heard. My Senate colleagues and I will continue to press for the passage of the Marriage Amendment, so that activist courts will not have the final say in this crucial matter."
