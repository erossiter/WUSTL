SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES VOLUNTARY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING LAW
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee introduced the Food Promotion Act of 2005, legislation that will create a voluntary country of origin labeling system for food products. Sen.  
 Cornyn is an original cosponsor. 
   "It is widely accepted that the existing mandatory labeling program is overly burdensome and hurts the very people it was designed to aid. This legislation builds on existing programs by creating a voluntary system that is geared towards providing the consumer with as much labeling information as possible," said Senator Santorum. "By recognizing regional, state, and brand name labels, we can utilize existing labeling programs to serve the same purpose of a national label. Consumers still receive the same information regarding where their food comes from, but in a more cost-efficient way." 
   The bill would replace the expensive mandatory labeling program with a more efficient, less expensive voluntary system for beef, veal, lamb, pork, fish, and produce. Instead of a national country of origin system, products would be labeled along the supply chain wherever it is most efficient to do so. This system would vary depending upon the product and is consistent with hundreds of voluntary programs currently recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture. 
   "This voluntary system continues to promote U.S. products, without requiring the burdensome red tape. We are trying to create the best of all worlds for producers, distributors, retailers and most importantly - the consumer."
