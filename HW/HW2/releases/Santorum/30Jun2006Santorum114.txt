SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF LOUIS BRAILLE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT
  Sen. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced Senate passage of S. 2321, The Louis Braille Commemorative Coin Act. The bill was introduced in February by Sen. Santorum and Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT), in support of a nationwide campaign to promote Braille literacy. A ten-dollar surcharge from the sale of each coin will benefit Braille literacy programs directed towards blind youth.  
   "Braille is the most effective tool the blind have to obtain success in the workplace and day-to-day life - yet according to the National Federation of the Blind, less than ten percent of blind children are being taught to read and write in Braille," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that 71 of my colleagues joined me in a bipartisan fashion in cosponsoring this bill. Supporting Braille literacy ensures that more visually impaired Americans will be able to lead lives filled with opportunity and independence." 
   Jim Antonacci, President of the National Federation of the Blind of Pennsylvania said, "Senator Santorum is to be commended for his understanding of the need for blind children and adults to become literate in Braille and for taking the lead in promoting the passage of this legislation." 
   Born almost 200 years ago in France, Louis Braille is recognized as the creator of "Braille" - a system of raised dots used by the blind to read and write. The National Federation of the Blind was founded in 1940 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. There are 235,000 blind and visually impaired people living in Pennsylvania.
