SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION DEBATE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented today on the immigration debate in the Senate. 
   "As we approach the immigration debate on the floor of the Senate, I hope my colleagues will ensure this is a dignified debate befitting our nation's tradition as a haven for legal immigrants, including my own family members. I am hopeful that there is bipartisan agreement that people of faith should not have to make the difficult choice between helping the needy and potential criminal consequences.
   "It is important to our communities that we continue to allow people of faith to feed the hungry, care for the sick and meet the needs of the least among us without fear of prosecution. However there should also be broad agreement that those who place individuals seeking a better life at grave peril through human smuggling must be punished."
