SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE PROJECTS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the U.S. Senate has approved funding for defense-related projects in central Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill.  
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense and I am proud of the people and organizations that help to make our state a top competitor for defense projects that create jobs and strengthen our economy," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will enable these important defense projects in central Pennsylvania to move forward in the effort to achieve a more secure nation." 
   "A number of Pennsylvania companies are enhancing the way our Armed Forces operate," Senator Specter said. "These projects will go far in supporting the brave men and women who serve our country. I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate have recognized the valuable contribution these projects will make to our nation's defense." 
   Projects which have been approved to receive funding in central Pennsylvania include: 
   * $4.2 Million for Pennsylvania State University in Centre County for a Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LUUV) Test Bed. The Navy needs unmanned systems to reduce the vulnerability of manned platforms and multiply their effectiveness. The LUUV will provide an off-board, unmanned vehicle with a variety of capabilities that will be applicable to both guided submarines and littoral combat ships; 
   * $4.2 Million for General Dynamics in York County for Mid Range Munition (MRM) (CE) TM3. Funding will continue development of the Army's Mid Range Munition (MRM). The MRM will give the Army's current and future gun systems their first intelligent munitions, providing accurate engagements against maneuvering and hidden targets, in all weather conditions. It is effective far beyond the range of today's conventional tank ammunition; 
   * $3.5 million to JLG in Fulton County, for the All Terrain Lifting Army System (ATLAS). The ATLAS is a self-deployable rough terrain, manually operated forklift capable of operating efficiently in nuclear, biological, and chemical environments; 
   * $2.8 million to the Pennsylvania National Guard for the Northeast Regional Counter-drug Training Center. Established in 1998, the Northeast Counter-drug Training Center (NCTC) provides no-cost counter drug training and education to law enforcement and drug demand reduction specialists in 18 northeastern states; 
   * $2.3 million for General Dynamics in York County for 120mm Tank Ammunition M1028 Canister. The M1028 canister round is highly effective in open terrain or urban combat operations providing the US Abrams fleet with a new capability to engage and defeat infantry targets. 
   * $1 million to General Dynamics in York County for the procurement of M1028 120mm Tank Anti-Personnel Canister Cartridges, designed to provide the Abrams (M1 Series tank) with devastating lethality at close range against heavily armed infantry, in either open or urban terrain.
