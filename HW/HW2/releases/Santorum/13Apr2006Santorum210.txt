SEN. SANTORUM AFFIRMS HIS STRONG COMMITMENT TO PENNSYLVANIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES DURING NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on the importance of small businesses as America celebrates National Small Business Week. 
   "I would like to commend the thousands of small businesses across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Small businesses embody the promise of the American dream - the opportunity for a hard-working individual to turn his or her ideas into a successful, profitable enterprise.
   "Throughout my tenure in the United States Senate, I have been a strong advocate for small businesses. In March 2006, I introduced the Second-Stage Small Business Development Act, which would create new opportunities for small businesses to overcome challenges and continue to build on their successes. This bill is continuing to gain support and I look forward to Senate passage.
   "I am committed to making health care more affordable for Pennsylvania's small businessmen and women. Ensuring that Pennsylvania's small businesses have access to quality and affordable health care remains one of my highest legislative priorities, which is why I cosponsored S. 406, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2005.
   "I look forward to continuing to work hard on behalf of small businessmen and women throughout Pennsylvania."
