SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO ASSIST STUDENTS IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education, announced today that the Department of Education has selected several western Pennsylvania institutions of higher education to receive federal funding under the TRIO Student Support Services Program.  
   "I applaud the Department of Education for granting financial assistance to TRIO Student Support Services Programs in Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "Many of Pennsylvania's higher education students will benefit greatly from this funding. Services such as personal counseling, mentoring programs, and academic advising and assistance with course selection will help students remain focused on their academic goals." 
   "The services offered by the TRIO Student Support Services Program are essential to fostering success in students who face challenges due to low-income status or disabilities," Senator Specter said. "I applaud the initiative of the Department of Education in providing this funding to give these students more tools to achieve their goals." 
   The Student Support Services (SSS) Program provides grants to institutions of higher education for projects offering students support services and opportunities for academic development. The programs assist students with basic college requirements and serve to motivate students toward the successful completion of their postsecondary education. The SSS program may also provide grant aid to current participants who are receiving Federal Pell Grants. The goal of SSS is to increase the college retention and graduation rates of its participants and facilitate the process of transition from one level of higher education to the next.
