SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON IMPROVING LABOR MARKET; ECONOMY SHOWS TWELVE STRAIGHT MONTHS OF JOB GAINS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on economic growth and job creation:  
   "Economic figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor today reveal that our economy continues to show signs of steady improvement and growth. The national unemployment rate continues to decline from its peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003. In August the national rate fell to 5.4 percent - the lowest unemployment rate since October 2001. In fact, at 5.4 percent the unemployment rate is below the average rate of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In Pennsylvania, the most recent unemployment rate of 5.3 percent remains lower than the national average. 
   "President Bush's Jobs and Growth tax relief package, enacted last year, has boosted consumer confidence and encouraged business and job growth. In August alone, 144,000 jobs were created nationwide, bringing the total to over 1.7 million new jobs created since August 2003. The manufacturing sector, which is vital to Pennsylvania's economy, added 22,000 new payroll jobs in August bringing the total to 107,000 new manufacturing payroll jobs created since January. 
   "We must continue to move our economy forward and increase our nation's job expansion with a pro-growth economic agenda that makes tax relief permanent, reduces frivolous lawsuits, and provides American workers with skills to meet the needs of our changing economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
