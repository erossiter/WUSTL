SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate has passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which provides funding for several transportation projects in southeastern Pennsylvania.  
   "I am pleased that Congress has approved funding to expand and improve our roadways and mass transit infrastructure in southeastern Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum said. "It is important that Pennsylvania continuously maintain and modernize transportation throughout the Commonwealth in order to ensure the safe travel of its citizens, create more efficient means of transportation, and sustain a robust economy." 
   "It's heartening to see my colleagues recognize the importance of these transportation projects, which are vital to driving local economies in southeastern Pennsylvania," Sen. Specter said. 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   Projects that will receive funding include: 
   * $10 million for the SEPTA Schuylkill Valley Metro Project to support the engineering of the Schuylkill Valley Metro line and facilitate travel from downtown metropolitan areas to suburban job centers. This project involves the construction of a 62-mile corridor between Philadelphia and Wyomissing, via Norristown, Phoenixville, Pottstown, and Reading. 
   * $6 million to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) for the construction of a multi-modal transit facility in Ardmore that relocates the SEPTA R-5/Amtrak Ardmore Station into a new multi-modal mixed-use facility. The transit center will be integrated with the development of the new Gateway Town Center mixed-use facility that will incorporate centralized commuter and public parking, retail and housing. 
   * $4 million for the 26th Street Extension (Philadelphia Naval Business Center) to improve and extend 26th Street in Philadelphia, from the Platt Bridge and Penrose Avenue intersection through the west end of the Philadelphia Naval Business Center until it intersects with Broad Street and the newly constructed League Island Boulevard. This new road will expand the traffic capacity into the Business Center and provide a more direct link to a number of important destinations via I-76, I-95, and I-476, including Center City, University City, the Philadelphia International Airport, and Delaware and Chester counties. 
   * $3.5 million for SEPTA's involvement in the Job Access/Reverse Commute program in southeastern Pennsylvania. This program assists thousands of low-income individuals nationwide to access jobs in suburban areas. Initial Job Access activities have focused primarily on serving TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), and low-income populations during traditional and nontraditional work hours. 
   * $3 million to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for the I-95 Interchange Project. The Interchange project is the last remaining incomplete Interstate gap project on I-95 between Maine and Florida. 
   * $2.1 million for the SEPTA Bucks County Intermodal Facility to fund improvements at the Croydon and Levittown SEPTA stations. Improvements at these facilities will include the installation of bus shelters and signage, station improvements, and parking expansion. 
   * $725,000 for the National Bio-Terrorism Civilian Medical Response Center (CIMERC) at Drexel University. CIMERC has joined with many city and regional governmental and non-governmental organizations including the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in determining how to most effectively respond in an integrated manner to a bioterrorist attack and to bolster the transportation system's state of preparedness for such an incident. 
   * $500,000 to the Delaware River Port Authority for the Cruise Terminal Intermodal Facility project which includes the design and construction of a new intermodal facility at the Philadelphia Cruise Terminal which will receive passengers, along with their luggage, who are arriving at the terminal via automobile, bus, taxi, or airport shuttle. 
   * $500,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - TraumaLink, a pediatric trauma research center. TraumaLink research findings will be disseminated to those who can effect change, including National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and will focus on field crash investigation, engineering investigation to determine injury mechanisms and countermeasures, behavioral science research into risky behavior determinants, psychological consequences of injury and epidemiological surveillance.
