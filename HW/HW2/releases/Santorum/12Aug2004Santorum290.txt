SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULING VOIDING SAME SEX MARRIAGE LICENSES ISSUED IN SAN FRANCISCO
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today following the California Supreme Court ruling that same-sex marriage licenses issued in San Francisco are not valid:  
   "I am pleased that the court ruled against allowing a public official to blatantly disregard the rule of law, and in this particular instance, attempt to redefine marriage in America. It is in the best interests of American society that we preserve and protect marriage as the union between a man and a woman. 
   "Ultimately, the only way to uphold states' rights is for their legislatures to have the opportunity to vote on a Federal Marriage Amendment, which also enables the American people to weigh in on the issue. Last week more than 71 percent of the citizens of Missouri voted to reaffirm traditional marriage. The voters in California have previously done so as well. The Senate took the first step towards a constitutional amendment last month when it held three days of thoughtful, constructive debate on the importance of preserving and protecting traditional marriage, our most basic social institution for protecting our children and future generations. 
   "My office has received thousands of phone calls, letters, e-mails and faxes from Pennsylvanians in support of the Marriage Amendment. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to press for the passage of the Marriage Amendment that will preserve traditional marriage. The future of marriage is a timely and vital dialogue and the American people deserve to have their voices heard."
