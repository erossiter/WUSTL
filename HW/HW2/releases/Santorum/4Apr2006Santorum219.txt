SEN. SANTORUM'S LETTER TO U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL PROMPTS OFFICIAL REVIEW OF LAWRENCE COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, recently received word that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of the Inspector General has responded to his letter outlining concerns with the Lawrence County Housing Authority in New Castle, Lawrence County. 
   In February 2006, Senator Santorum received letters from Pennsylvania State Representative Frank LaGrotta (D-10) and Mayor Wayne Alexander, City of New Castle, regarding improprieties relating to the Lawrence County Housing Authority and the possible misappropriations of federal funding through their spin-off 501 (c) (3) organization, Affordable Housing. On February 24, 2006 Senator Santorum sent a letter to HUD Inspector General, Kenneth M. Donohue, regarding this matter.
   "I have been working with local officials for more than a year on this and many other issues regarding the use of federal funding by the Lawrence County Housing Authority. I am pleased to learn that HUD will honor my request for a thorough review of the Lawrence County Housing Authority and their subsidiaries," said Senator Santorum.
   HUD has conducted internal financial reviews of the Lawrence County Housing Authority and found that there were improper financial transfers and disposal of equipment.
