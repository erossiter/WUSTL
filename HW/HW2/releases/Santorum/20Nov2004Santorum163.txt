SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF MISCELLANEOUS TRADE AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT
  Sen. Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued a statement in support of passage of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1047, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act:  
   "I am pleased that the Senate has passed the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act. This legislation is crucial to improve American production and make our manufacturers here at home more competitive in the global market. 
   "This bill removes burdensome taxes on products coming into the United States. Through a variety of duty suspensions, production costs of American-made products will be lowered. Pennsylvania manufacturers will be saving money that can now be spent on creating more jobs and lowering the cost of the product to the consumer. 
   "This is important legislation that needed to be acted upon now. The 107th Congress concluded without passing a bill to extend the duty suspensions that expired. As a result, American companies were left footing the bill for taxes on components and product parts needed to produce American goods. This prevented the United States from reaching its competitive potential in the global market. 
   "I thank Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and Ranking Member Max Baucus for moving quickly on this matter and for acknowledging the positive response to my letter signed by fifty-five of my colleagues, who share my goal of improving American products and business."
