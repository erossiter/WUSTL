SEN. SANTORUM COSPONSORS RESOLUTION TO HONOR ROSA PARKS IN U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, cosponsored S. Con. Res. 62, a concurrent resolution calling for a statue honoring Rosa Parks to be placed in the United States Capitol building.  
   "The historic halls of the Unites States Capitol are filled with works of art honoring the men and women who contributed to the great history and advancement of our nation. The collection would not be complete without honoring the first lady of the civil rights movement. It is most appropriate that we place a statue honoring Rosa Parks in the Capitol building so that we may always remember the spirit of this American heroine," said Senator Santorum. 
   Senator McConnell (R-KY) sponsored the bill, which is currently being considered by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.
