SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR BROWNFIELDS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing federal grants for brownfields in Pennsylvania.  
   Brownfields grants serve as the foundation of the EPA's Brownfields Program. The grants support revitalization efforts by funding environmental assessment and cleanup activities of brownfields. A brownfield site is property where expansion, redevelopment, or reuse may be complicated by the presence of environmental contamination. 
   Both Senators Santorum and Specter have cosponsored legislation that promotes the cleanup of brownfield sites. In May 2004, Senator Santorum sponsored legislation (S. 2394) that would allow the cleanup costs of brownfields to be a permanent fixture of the tax code. The legislation extends current tax provisions to offset the costs of revitalizing brownfield sites, and would make the incentives permanent. The bill also repeals the provision in the law that requires a taxpayer who uses the cleanup deduction to pay income tax on that amount when he or she sells the property. 
   Senator Specter has been a long-time supporter of redeveloping brownfields, which restores potentially environmentally contaminated land for productive use. Senator Specter was a cosponsor of S.350 in the 107th Congress, now law, which authorized funds to aid in cleanup efforts. In 2003, the Administration proposed to eliminate the Housing and Urban Development Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI). Senator Specter helped restore the program, and BEDI is currently funded at $25 million in fiscal year 2004. 
   "This funding is crucial in order to rehabilitate the brownfield sites and allow for the land to be put back into use," said Senator Santorum. "These grants will improve Pennsylvania's environment and generate good-paying jobs and affordable housing in areas where they are most needed." "I am pleased the EPA has provided this funding to aid the cleanup activities at these brownfield sites," Senator Specter said. "Properly cleaning up the hazardous materials contaminating these properties is necessary to enhance environmental safety, spur economic development, and create new jobs in these areas."
