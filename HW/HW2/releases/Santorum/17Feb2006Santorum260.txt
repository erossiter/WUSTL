SENS. SANTORUM, DODD INTRODUCE LOUIS BRAILLE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), today introduced the Louis Braille Commemorative Coin Act in support of a nationwide campaign to promote Braille literacy. A ten dollar surcharge from the sale of each coin will benefit Braille literacy programs directed towards blind youth. 
   "Braille is the most effective tool the blind have to obtain success in the workplace and day-to-day life- yet according to the National Federation of the Blind less than ten percent of blind children are being taught to read and write in Braille," said Senator Santorum. "Supporting Braille literacy ensures that more blind Americans will be able to lead lives filled with opportunity and independence."
   "Braille opens the doors of the world to the blind and visually impaired," said Dodd. "This initiative will allow us to support a national Braille literacy campaign to teach more people this critically important skill."
   Born almost 200 years ago in France, Louis Braille is recognized as the creator of "Braille" - a system of raised dots used by the blind to read and write.
