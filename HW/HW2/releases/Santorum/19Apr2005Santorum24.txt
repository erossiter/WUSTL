SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS COMMEMORATIVE COIN HONORING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DESEGREGATION OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today cosponsored legislation that would create a commemorative silver dollar honoring the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.  
   Little Rock Central High School was the site of the first major national test for the implementation of the historic decision of the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in 1954. The courage of the first nine African American Little Rock Central High School students known as the "Little Rock Nine" was recognized by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a significant event in the struggle for civil rights. 
   "The struggle for racial equality in our nation's schools was indeed a challenge," said Senator Santorum. "As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of our nation's public schools, we continue to honor these nine high school students who heroically entered the Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas determined to receive an equal education. The courage of the 'Little Rock Nine' will be uniquely honored with this commemorative coin for generations to come." 
   S. 582, the Little Rock Central High School Desegregation 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, calls for 500,000 coins to be minted by the Treasury and issued beginning January 1, 2007, with a portion of the funds covering production costs and the rest slated for improvements and programs at the Central High Museum and Visitor Center.
