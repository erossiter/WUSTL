SEN. SANTORUM JOINS CONGRESSIONAL RECYCLING CAUCUS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that he has joined the newly formed Senate Recycling Caucus.  
   "I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Recycling Caucus," said Senator Santorum. "I believe it is important to promote legislation that is beneficial to the recycling industry, as well as to educate my colleagues about the recycling industry. I have also been a strong proponent of recycling, and have taken steps to ensure that my office serves as a model for recycling and conservation of resources." 
   The bi partisan Congressional Recycling Caucus creates a way for members in both the House and Senate to obtain an in-depth education about the recycling industry and help promote recycling in America. In the Senate, the Recycling Caucus is co-chaired by Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Tom Carper (D-DE).
