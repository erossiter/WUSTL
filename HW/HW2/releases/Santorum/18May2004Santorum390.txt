SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON AGREEMENT TO VOTE ON JUDGES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following comments today regarding the announcement of an agreement with Senate Democrats allowing the Senate to vote on twenty-five judicial nominees by the end of June, and the Administration's agreement to not exercise its right to appoint circuit or district court judge nominees to the bench during recess:  
   "I am pleased that an agreement has been reached for the Senate to vote within the next month on twenty-five pending judicial nominees, five of whom are from Pennsylvania. Third Circuit Court nominee Franklin S. Van Antwerpen (Northampton County), and Pennsylvania Eastern District nominees Gene Pratter (Philadelphia), Lawrence Stengel (Lancaster County), Juan Sanchez (Chester County) and Paul Diamond (Philadelphia) are highly qualified and well- respected individuals who will make significant contributions at the federal level. After months of unnecessary delay, I expect all five nominees to receive Senate confirmation and begin to serve in their new capacities."
