SEN. SANTORUM CONTINUES WORK ON LOBBYING REFORM LEGISLATION
  During today's Senate Rules Committee markup of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006, U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, offered four amendments to the bill. 
   "My goal is to work with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to develop a robust, comprehensive reform package that becomes a strong bipartisan bill we can move through the Committee process and pass on the floor of the Senate," said Senator Santorum. "This bill, including the amendments that I offered today, is focused on making Congress more accountable to the people we represent."
   "I commend Senator Santorum for offering several important lobbying reform amendments in the Rules Committee today," said Senator John McCain (R-AZ). "I was particularly pleased with his amendment that would require Senators to pay the charter rate when traveling on private aircraft. Although this amendment was defeated, I congratulate Senator Santorum for his hard work and leadership on the critical issue of lobbying reform." 
   Senator Santorum offered the following amendments at the Rules Committee markup:
   * Corporate Jets Amendment - This provision would ensure that Senators and their employees who use corporate or charter air travel must pay the fair market value for that travel, instead of reimbursing at the rate of a first-class fare.
   * Employment Negotiations Amendment - This amendment would modify the Senate rules to prohibit the negotiation or arrangement of a job in the private sector before the election is held for a Senator's successor. This amendment does allow a Senator to have such negotiations if they disclose them publicly and in writing to the Secretary of the Senate within three days of the beginning of negotiations.
   * Restrictions on Spouse/Family Lobbying Member's Staff Amendment - The language would prohibit a Member's spouse or family member that is a registered lobbyist from having any official lobbying contact with the staff of that Member.
   * Slowing the Revolving Door Amendment - This amendment would extend the current ban on former Senators lobbying the Senate from one year to two years.
   The Senator's amendments regarding employment negotiations and restrictions on lobbying by a Member's spouse or immediate family member were adopted by the Committee and added to the bill. However, the revolving door amendment and the corporate jets amendment were not adopted.
   "While I wish all of my amendments had been successful, I am pleased that this process is moving forward in a bipartisan manner and look forward to improving the bill on the floor," said Senator Santorum.
