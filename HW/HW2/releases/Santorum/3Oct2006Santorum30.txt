SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF ANIMAL ENTERPRISE TERRORISM ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today applauded the passage of a bill to improve and strengthen the existing federal animal enterprise terrorism law. This bill was drafted in a bipartisan, bicameral manner in reaction to the expanded scope of violent and threatening activity recently conducted against scientists and others conducting important medical research and scientific innovation.  
   "With at least twelve reported incidents of agri-terrorism in Pennsylvania ranging from paint stripper thrown on the car of a research scientist, to the destruction of rare and valuable flowers at a nursery, to spray-painted warnings and threats, it is clearly impacting the agri-business in the Commonwealth and potentially chilling the medical and scientific research in our universities and bio-technology sector," said Senator Santorum. "This bill preserves the First Amendment rights to free speech and protest, but draws the line at criminal intimidation and violence and reflects the concerns of agri-business owners, farmers and the PA Farm Bureau." 
   Senator Santorum is a cosponsor of S. 3880, the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. The bill was supported by a broad coalition from farmers and agri-business owners, including the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau; colleges, universities and medical centers across the state including Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania, Slippery Rock University and the University of Pittsburgh; bio-technology companies and professional associations such as the Pennsylvania Veterinary Medical Association. The bill passed on September 29, 2006, unanimously with Senator Santorum's strong support.
