SEN. SANTORUM SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced S. 1896, the Schools Safely Acquiring Faculty Excellence (SAFE) Act of 2005, legislation that would allow states to choose to have FBI background checks conducted on individuals who would be working with children in public schools.  
   "Our nation's schools must provide a secure and comforting environment that nurtures and encourages each student to achieve his or her fullest potential. It is of the utmost importance that we have access to complete information regarding the background of every person employed to work with students at a public school," said Senator Santorum. "The Schools SAFE Act would provide parents and teachers across the country with the peace of mind that comes with knowing that individuals working with our children on a daily basis are fit to do so." 
   In Pennsylvania, a federal background check is only required for school employees who have lived in Pennsylvania for less than two years, while teacher applicants that are residents of the Commonwealth are not required to undergo any FBI background check at all. Although some states do participate in a program in which background information is voluntarily shared, efforts to conduct thorough background checks have often met troubling barriers that prevent schools from accessing complete information. 
   "I am pleased that my Senate colleagues have recognized the importance of the Schools SAFE Act by including this legislation in a larger legislative package approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee today," said Senator Santorum. "This development brings us significantly closer to ensuring the safety of our children in the classroom."
