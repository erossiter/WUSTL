SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE PROJECTS IN SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved funding for defense-related projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which must be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by the President.  
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense and I am proud of the people and organizations that help to make our state a top competitor for defense projects that create jobs and strengthen our economy," said Senator Santorum. "If approved by the full Senate, this funding will enable these important defense projects in southeastern Pennsylvania to move forward in the effort to achieve a more secure nation." 
   "A number of Pennsylvania companies are enhancing the way our Armed Forces operate," Senator Specter said. "These projects will go far in supporting the brave men and women who serve our country. I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate Appropriations Committee have recognized the valuable contribution these projects will make to our nation's defense." 
   Projects which have been approved to receive funding in Southeastern Pennsylvania include: 
   * $6.5 million to Drexel University in Philadelphia County for the Applied Communications and Information Networking (ACIN) Program. ACIN will continue to adapt and equip the Department of Defense with state-of-the-art communications and networking technology to facilitate command and control, cooperative engagement, precision strikes, intelligence dissemination, logistics, and daily operations; 
   * $6 million to Gestalt in Montgomery County for the Distributed Mission Interoperability Toolkit (DMIT) program. DMIT is a suite of tools that provide rapid interoperability among mission oriented C41 systems and simulation models. DMIT's tools capabilities provide for the efficient translation of air mission tasks from C41 systems into a format that is compatible with mission simulator formats; 
   * $5 million to Piasecki Aircraft, in Delaware County for a VTDP Compound Helicopter Technology Flight Demonstration project. This funding will demonstrate the Vectored Thrust Ducted Propeller (VTDP) technology's potential to increase speed, range, survivability, and reduced life cycle costs; 
   * $5 million for Bentley Systems (Exton, PA) to engage in the Pentagon Integrated Campus Pilot Program. This initiative would perform data integration to improve facility operations and management at the Pentagon. Specifically, funds would be used to implement an automated system for controlled access to facilities information for planning, capital project design, construction management, commissioning, data/physical security and crises response. 
   * $4 million to Analytical Graphics, in Chester County for a Satellite Assets for Joint Navigation Warfare project. The ability to jam GPS guided weapons is becoming increasingly available. Funding for this project will aid in the development of tools, which can accurately model the threats faced by U.S GPS guided weapons, allowing for better testing, more thorough test analysis, and more accurate planning for the development of GPS guided weapons; 
   * $3 million to Vision Technologies, in Philadelphia County for a Machinery Control Surveillance System. This project will utilize a video system to augment current Damage Control Quarters (DCQ) capabilities and monitor mission-critical spaces aboard gas turbine ships; 
   * $2.5 million to Rajant Corporation in Delaware County for a Portable and Mobile Emergency Broadband System. This system will provide portable wireless broadband communication for the rapid deployment of secure, self powered, high bandwidth applications in remote sites or disaster areas where existing internet communications have been disrupted. Funding will provide for the development of technology, which will enhance security, integrate the system with other military and homeland security networks, and increase the system's range and capacity; 
   * $2.5 million to Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells North America in Chester County for an Affordable Lighweight Power Supply Development project. This program will provide the Air Force with a durable and cost effective high temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM), the single most critical component preventing the widespread introduction of light weight fuel cells as a power source; 
   * $2 million to Drexel University in Philadelphia County for the National Bioterrorism Civilian Medical Response Center (CIMERC). In 2000, Drexel University received a Congressional designation as the National Bioterrorism Civilian Medical Response Center (CIMERC). Since its inception, CIMERC has been working with the US Army to develop a demonstration test-bed for new technologies related to bioterrorism which are linked to bioterrorism civilian preparedness and crisis response; 
   * $1.5 million to the Power and Energy Corporation, in Bucks County for a Pure Hydrogen Supply from Logistics Fuel project. Fuel cells harness the chemical energy of hydrogen to generate electricity without combustion or pollution. The Navy is conducting research to develop fuel cell technology for shipboard use, which extracts hydrogen fuel from logistic fuels; 
   * $1 million to Franklin Fuel Cells in Chester County for Copper-Ceramic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Technology research. Deployment of fuel cells has the potential to greatly reduce military fuel costs and distribution logistics. However, current fuel cell technologies must use either hydrogen or zero/low sulfur fuels which makes them impractical for military deployment. This program will design, fabricate, and demonstrate a 2kW copper-ceramic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) auxiliary power unit prototype to be delivered to the Navy no later than July 2007; 
   * $1 million to 3e Technologies in Indiana and Philadelphia counties for a Security Video Distribution System for Shipboard Force Protection. This funding will provide for research and design for a system capable of viewing and controlling both live and stored video from any computer, handheld PC, or Portable Digital Assistant (PDA) on a Navy ship using the shipboard network. Current systems do not have this ability. This system will drastically increase situational awareness ship-wide; 
   * $1 million to Navmar Applied Sciences, in Delaware County for CURTIS Upgrades to the P3C BMUP Aircraft. This project will increase intelligence-gathering capabilities of Naval P-3C Aircraft, while also improving the aircraft's ability to relay gathered intelligence to operational commanders and ground personnel. 
   * $2.1 million to SAP for an Army Medical Department Enterprise Resource Planning project in Cumberland County. The U.S. Army Medical Material Department (AMEDD) is charged with providing medical supplies to the Army worldwide. Funding will upgrade the AMEDD's medical support to combat forces by transitioning operationally critical medical logistics capabilities from the legacy Tactical Army Medical Material Information System (TAMMIS) into a newer Enterprise Resource Planning system. This transition will lead to quicker medical supply replenishment, lighter supply chain burdens, and greater responsiveness in treating wounded soldiers in the field.
