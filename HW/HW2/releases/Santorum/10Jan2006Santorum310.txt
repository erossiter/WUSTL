SEN. SANTORUM MEETS WITH JEWISH FEDERATION OF LEHIGH VALLEY, VISITS NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT COMPANY IN ALLENTOWN
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was in Allentown today to meet with the Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley and to visit Night Vision Equipment Company where he received a demonstration of equipment and spoke with Night Vision employees.  
   Senator Santorum met with the Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley to give an update on federal legislation update and to discuss issues of importance to the Jewish community. 
   "I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with members of the Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley. Various issues including showing support for Israel, combating terrorism in the Middle East and around the world, defending religious freedom and recognizing heroes of the Holocaust have been important to me during my years in the Senate. I look forward to continuing my record of commitment to Israel and the Jewish Community throughout the United States and the world," said Senator Santorum. 
   "The Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley is pleased that Senator Santorum has come to the Jewish Community Center today to hear the views and opinions of members of the Lehigh Valley Jewish Community," said Barry Halper, Chairman of the Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley. "As Americans, members of the Jewish Community share concerns regarding the war in Iraq, security of Israel, Iran's capability to develop nuclear weapons, the on-going genocide in the Darfur region of the Sudan as well as domestic issues. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss these critical issues with the Senator." 
   Since being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, Senator Santorum has demonstrated a commitment to Israel and to the Jewish community through his voting record, legislation he has introduced over the past eleven years and his several visits to Israel. 
   Senator Santorum's Senate record includes: 
  * Cosponsorship of the Jerusalem Resolution, which provides for the recognition of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel before the U.S. recognizes a Palestinian state. 
   * Introduction of the Syria Accountability Act of 2003, which would halt Syrian support for terrorism, end its occupation of Lebanon, stop its development of weapons of mass destruction, cease its illegal importation of Iraqi oil, and hold Syria accountable for its role in the Middle East. President Bush signed this legislation into law in December 2003. 
   * Introduction of a Senate resolution condemning the harmful, destructive, and anti-Semitic statements of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, and to demand an apology for those statements of hate and animosity towards all Jewish people. This bipartisan resolution passed the Senate unanimously in December 2005. 
   * Introduction of the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005, which would hold the current regime in Iran accountable for its threatening behavior and to support a transition to democracy in Iran. 
   * Introduction of the Workplace Religious Freedom Act -- legislation which restores a balanced approach to religious freedom in the workplace. This crucial measure would restore provisions in the Civil Rights Act, currently undermined by the courts, which required employers to accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees. 
   * Cosponsorship of legislation extending the existence of the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group for 2 years. President Bush signed this legislation into law in March 2005. 
   While at Night Vision, Senator Santorum announced $5 million in federal funding, which will be used by the U.S. Army to purchase Mini-IR MX2 thermal imagers, a handheld night vision device that enables soldiers to see in total darkness. Senator Santorum worked to secure this funding in the fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. In past years, Senator Santorum was successful in securing $6.5 million to equip the Army with the miniature hand-held imagers. 
   "I appreciate the opportunity to speak with employees and to learn more about the life-saving equipment made by Night Vision," said Senator Santorum. "I was proud to work with Senator Specter and Congressman Dent to provide federal funding for the important work Night Vision is doing to further protect our military personnel. The amazing technology exhibited in the Mini-IR MX2 has proven beneficial to the men and women serving our nation abroad and I am pleased that the Army will be equipped with additional Night Vision equipment." 
   "This equipment not only allows soldiers to see in total darkness, but also in extreme circumstances such as a sandstorm," continued Senator Santorum. "Most importantly - it reduces the risk of friendly fire." 
   "I am pleased that Senator Rick Santorum visited Night Vision Equipment Company and was able to see firsthand some of the latest night vision technologies that are being used to make certain that our soldiers safely 'own the night' while they conduct critical missions associated with the Global War on Terrorism," said Chris Wright, Vice President and General Manager for Night Vision Equipment Company. "Senator Santorum, with strong support from Senator Arlen Specter and Congressman Charlie Dent, helped secure the funding needed to fulfill the Army's request for our Mini-IR MX2 thermal imagers."
