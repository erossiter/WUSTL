   "The severe storms and flooding that Pennsylvania suffered at the hands of tropical depressions Ivan and Frances devastated many areas of the state. My thoughts are with those individuals and families who lost property and personal belongings in the floods and destruction. It is important that those in need are aware of the assistance that is available. I'd like to remind Pennsylvanians of the upcoming deadline, Thursday, November 18, to file federal disaster assistance claims."
