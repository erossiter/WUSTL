SEN. SANTORUM VISITS CONEMAUGH TOWNSHIP AREA HIGH SCHOOL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today spoke with students at Conemaugh Township Area High School about the importance of civic participation.  
   "I am very pleased that students here at Conemaugh Township Area High School are interested and immersed in the upcoming election," Senator Santorum said. "Projects like 'Rock the Vote 2004' have fostered this interest and help students realize the importance of voting and being involved in the political process. I enjoy interacting with young people so passionate about the issues. We are facing a unique time in our nation's history and it is important that citizens of every age have their voices heard." 
   Senator Santorum was invited to speak at Conemaugh Township Area High School by Pennsylvania Student Voices, a program that works to encourage active civic and political engagement of students and increase understanding of political processes and institutions. Currently, 135 schools in Pennsylvania participate in Student Voices. The teachers at Conemaugh Township Area High School integrated the Student Voices program into their senior class project, "Rock the Vote 2004" rally and mock election. 
   "Conemaugh Township Area High School would like to thank Senator Santorum for meeting with the senior class today to discuss issues important to students and residents in Conemaugh Township," Joan Williamson, teacher at Conemaugh Township Area High School said. "The Senator provided an opportunity for seniors to further educate themselves on the issues, the political process, and raise community awareness of the importance of voting."
