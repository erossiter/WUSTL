SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES ENERGY ASSISTANCE TO HELP LOW-INCOME PENNSYLVANIANS WITH HOME HEATING COSTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will release an additional $79.9 million in Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding. Pennsylvania will receive $11,268,959 million. Last week, Sen. Santorum sent a letter to President Bush urging him to release all remaining LIHEAP contingency funds to provide heating assistance for the upcoming winter to low-income families and senior citizens.  
   "This is great news for the many low-income and elderly Pennsylvanians who need help with their heating bills this winter. I have been a consistent supporter of LIHEAP funding because I understand how challenging it can be for low-income families to meet the rising costs to heat and cool their home," said Senator Santorum. "Every Pennsylvanian should have the resources they need to stay warm and healthy as we enter into the cold months ahead." 
   Since being elected to Congress in 1990, Senator Santorum has been a consistent supporter of LIHEAP. Senator Santorum's support for LIHEAP has come in several forms. In 1991, he twice voted against the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations bill primarily because it did not provide enough LIHEAP funding. Since this time, Senator Santorum has written no less than nine letters to his colleagues on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees urging sufficient LIHEAP funding. Senator Santorum has also written eight letters to both President Bush and Clinton requesting that they prioritize LIHEAP in the annual budget process and release emergency LIHEAP funding when these funds were desperately needed. Senator Santorum supported three bipartisan amendments to various appropriations bills that would have provided additional LIHEAP funding this year.
