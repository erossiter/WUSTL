SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR UPGRADES TO LOCKS AND DAMS ON MONONGAHELA RIVER
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that Congress has passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill which provides $35.5 million for the replacement and modernization of Locks and Dams 2, 3, and 4 on the Monongahela River. 
   "I have been working for years to secure money for this project and I am pleased to see funding has been appropriated for important upgrades to the locks and dams on the Mon River," said Santorum. "The repair and replacement of these locks and dams is critical to the safety of the residents of southwestern Pennsylvania as well as the economic stability of the region." 
   "Communities and businesses in Southwestern Pennsylvania rely on the Monongahela River Locks and Dam system to strengthen and spur economic development," Specter said. "Senator Santorum and I have been long supporters of this project, and I am pleased this funding is being allocated to continue the viability of the Monongahela River navigation system." 
   The modernization of the Locks and Dams, authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, includes replacement of the existing dam with a new gated dam and rehabilitated auxiliary chamber floodway bulkhead structure at Lock and Dam 2; removal of Lock and Dam 3; and construction of new twin [84 x 720-foot] locks at Lock and Dam 4. Locks and Dams 2, 3, and 4 on the Monongahela River are among the last of the old and undersized locks on the Monongahela River System.
