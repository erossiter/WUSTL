SEN. SANTORUM CHAMPIONS INCENTIVES AND INCREASED OPTIONS FOR PLANNING, SAVING FOR LONG TERM CARE
  Most Americans are not planning for, and are not prepared for the financial impact of long-term care for themselves and their loved-ones. Individuals in need of long-term care - seniors and those with disabilities - should have the opportunity to age with respect and dignity - receiving services of their choice, in the setting of their choice. 
   The Medicaid program cannot sustain the projected explosive growth in long-term care spending - it is essential that we have more private dollars, rather than taxpayer dollars, being spent on long-term care services. We must do more to encourage planning and personal responsibility for long-term care to address needs today and in the future.  
   Themes include: 
   * Incentives for family care giving and keeping families together, incentives to plan for and fund long-term care options such as home-health and adult daycare, which allow families to stay together and support family caregivers. 
   * Personal responsibility and less dependency on taxpayer funded government programs such as Medicaid - which will preserve and strengthen Medicaid for those in need. 
   This legislation would also provide a financial vehicle for individuals with disabilities and families of disabled children and adults to plan for and fund long-term care services, providing greater flexibility (e.g., home and community based services such as home-health) than current government programs can provide. 
   The legislation has 4 provisions to address needs today (i.e., FSAs) and in the future (i.e., longterm care accounts, long-term care insurance, and life annuities). The legislation provides incentives for long-term care insurance, alternatives to long-term care insurance (long-term care account to address the needs of those who are uninsurable, such as individuals with pre-existing conditions), and creates life care annuities. 
   Allow Employers to offer Long-Term Care Insurance under Cafeteria Plans 
   Expand current rules to permit employers to offer long-term care insurance to employees in cafeteria plans (pre-tax dollar benefits such as 401(k)s and FSAs). Current list of authorized benefits that an employer can offer employees does not include long-term care insurance. 
   Enhance Healthcare Flexible-Spending Account (FSA) Rules 
   Enhance healthcare flexible-spending account rules to allow funds to be used for long-term care services (such as home-health, adult daycare, respite care, etc) for a family member (including parents, in-laws, spouse, siblings, children). For example, employed individuals covered by FSAs could use the account to pay for services for a family member while they are at work - allowing the individual to remain in the workforce and the family member to receive services best suited for their needs. 
   Create Long-Term Care Accounts - Pre-Funding Long-Term Care Needs 
   Create HSA-like savings accounts for long-term care needs. Many individuals are uninsurable due to pre-existing conditions (i.e., medical diagnosis, disabilities), while others are reluctant to purchase long-term care insurance (for reasons including not wanting to spend money on a policy that may never be needed, or fear that the company will not be around decades from now when care may be needed). 
   * Create an investment account with IRA/HSA1-like features that individuals can use to set aside tax-preferred money for the use of long-term care services for themselves or a family member (including parents, in-laws, spouse, siblings, children). Set an annual limit of $5,000 on amount that could be deposited - would increase annually by medical care cost adjustment. 
   * Funds could be used for bona fide long-term care expenses (i.e., home-health, adult daycare, assisted living, nursing home care, etc) 2 or for the purchase of long-term care insurance or life care annuity for account owner or a family member. Money spent on behalf of a family member would not be subject to gift taxes. 
   * Similar to HSAs, money would go in pre-tax, would grow tax-deferred and could be taken out tax-free as long as taken out for long-term care needs. 3 
   * Upon death, unused amounts in the accounts could be rolled-over into the same type of account for a loved-one. 
   Create Life Care Annuities 
   One of the most significant reasons that individuals do not purchase long-term care insurance is the hesitation of spending significant amounts of money over the years on a policy that may never be needed. Current law does not allow for long-term care policies to build-up a cash value. 
   * Create life care annuities - combining a life annuity and long-term care insurance. Annuity would pay a steady income that would increase significantly in the event of a disability, to be used to pay for long-term care expenses. 
   * Long-term care insurance and annuities are both underutilized tools to plan for retirement. Combining the products makes them more affordable than if each were purchased separately. 
   * Life care annuities address the market problems with life annuities (healthier than average tend to purchase, driving up the cost) and long-term care insurance (sicker than average tend to purchase, driving up the cost) - the risks of each offset each other. The annuity reduces the need for underwriting, therefore significantly increasing the people that would be eligible (estimated 21% increase, from 77% to 98% of 65 year olds would be eligible) 4. 
   1. Unlike HSAs the accounts would not need to be paired with a high-deductible health plan. 
   2. As defined by US Code Sec. 7702B(c) - necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, and rehabilitative services, and maintenance or personal care services. 
   3. If taken out for other purposes, it would be subject to penalties similar to those to which 401(k) and IRAs are subject.
