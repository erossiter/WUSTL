SEN. SANTORUM SETTLES FRIENDLY SPORTS WAGERS WITH SENS. MURRAY, CANTWELL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today settled the score with Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) following friendly wagers he made with both Senators last month as his hometown Pittsburgh Steelers took on the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.  
   Senators Murray and Cantwell presented Senator Santorum a 'Made in Washington' basket that included: Seabear Wild Salmon, Caffe Appassinato coffee, Chukar cherries, Washington apples from Frank's Produce and Red Hook Beer from their home state of Washington. 
   After thanking the senators from Washington for their generosity, Senator Santorum commented, "This season has been a great ride for the Steelers and their fans - considered underdogs they came up with the ultimate big win. It was incredible to be home in Pittsburgh and soak up the tremendous amount of energy and excitement from the fans - it was an unforgettable night." 
   "Senators Murray and Cantwell now know what Senators Martinez and Allard learned pretty quickly after the Orange Bowl and AFC Championship -- this was not the year to bet against Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum continued. 
   The Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks 21-10 on February 5, 2006. Senator Santorum wagered Clara's Pittsburgh Pierogies and Quaker Steak & Lube hot wings.
