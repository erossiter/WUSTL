SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ASSIST VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced legislation this week to help volunteer firefighters receive quality firefighting equipment. Rep.  
 Mike Castle (R-DE) sponsored a companion bill (HR. 1787) in the House of Representatives, which passed yesterday by a vote of 397 to 3. 
   The "Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2004" (S. 2793) will encourage donations of surplus firefighting equipment by reducing the threat of civil liability to heavy industry organizations and wealthier fire departments who currently destroy valuable firefighting equipment in order to avoid lawsuits. This bill eliminates civil liability barriers to donations of equipment by raising the liability standard for donors from "negligence" to "gross negligence." 
   This legislation will ensure that quality equipment, otherwise wasted, will now benefit volunteer firefighters. The "Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2004" is modeled after a bill passed in the Texas state legislature in 1997 and signed by then-Governor George W. Bush, which resulted in more than $6 million in additional equipment donations from companies. Arizona, Missouri, Indiana, and South Carolina have passed similar legislation at the state level. 
   "We have all witnessed the heroic acts of selflessness and sacrifice of the firefighters in New York City and in the Washington, D.C. area. I am proud to sponsor this legislation which will provide our nation's dedicated volunteer firefighters with additional safety equipment," Santorum stated. "I urge my colleagues in the United States Senate to support the passage of this important legislation."
