SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS UNFAIR MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITALS
  Sens. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Arlen Specter, Senior Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, strongly united in fighting for fair and equitable reimbursement for Pennsylvania hospitals, are demonstrating that commitment again today with the introduction of the Hospital Payment Improvement and Equity Act. This legislation is one of many strategies that the two Senators are employing to address the current disparities in Medicare reimbursement experienced by Pennsylvania hospitals.  
   Senators Santorum and Specter secured a temporary fix three years ago with the Medicare Modernization Act. Unfortunately, this funding will expire in six short months, and not all Pennsylvania hospitals benefited from this funding in the first place. This legislation addresses both of these problems. 
   Without an extension, hospitals that benefited from the funding will face drastic and severely damaging cuts in Medicare reimbursement, and will again be faced with decisions that have the potential to negatively impact their ability to provide important community health care and will cost valuable jobs to our Commonwealth's economy. 
   While a permanent solution to Medicare reimbursement disparities problem is preferred, it is unrealistic that this laudable goal could be accomplished and implemented before the provision expires in 2007. As Senators Santorum and Specter work to solve these problems, this legislation will provide an extension of this funding. 
   Senator Santorum, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, is working to secure inclusion of the Hospital Payment Improvement and Equity Act in upcoming Medicare legislation, which may be considered later this year.
