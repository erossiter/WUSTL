SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES HUD FUNDING FOR LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARD CONTROL AND HEALTHY HOMES PROGRAMS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control (OHHLHC) has approved funding for Pennsylvania.  
   "Lead-based paint poses serious health risks, especially for young children; in the past I have supported the National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week to draw more attention to this all too common and tragic hazard," said Senator Santorum. "This funding - more than $6 million for our state - is important in assisting programs that identify and reduce lead-based paint hazards." 
   Pennsylvania is the recipient of the following federal funds: 
   * $3,000,000 to the Pennsylvania Lead Hazard Control Program operated by the Department of Health, Bureau of Family Health, Division of Child and Adult Health Services, Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control Section for a 36-month lead hazard control grant. The program will include child lead screening, follow-up, case management, identification and control of lead hazards in homes, outreach, and education. 
   * $3,000,000 to Lawrence County for the elimination and/or the control of all identified lead hazards in 205 housing units involving low to very-low income families with children less than six years of age. The targeted areas established the Northwest Region Lead Hazard Control Grant (NWR-LHCG) Consortium of more than 70 working partners and their own supporting agencies and organizations. 
   * $200,000 to the National Nursing Centers Consortium (NNCC) located in Philadelphia, to conduct outreach on lead poisoning prevention. This is a major health hazard in many Philadelphia communities where the age and condition of the housing stock puts thousands of children at risk. This project implements a three-tier education and outreach campaign to reach high-risk communities and link them to other health services for smoking cessation, asthma, nutrition/exercise, working in at-risk areas that are not covered by another project, Lead-Safe Babies. This project will also link outreach recipients to programs for lead hazard treatment.
