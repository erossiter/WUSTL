SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SENTENCING OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement regarding Saddam Hussein being found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging:  
   "This weekend's news is a significant day for the millions of Iraqi people that were oppressed by Saddam Hussein. It is long overdue that a democratically formed court of law found Saddam Hussein guilty for the cruel and inhumane treatment of his own people over the course of his brutal dictatorship. This court's ruling is a milestone in Iraq's path in ending a horrific chapter where tens of thousands where murdered and tortured."
