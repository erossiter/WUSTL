SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON HIS CHILDREN'S SCHOOLING STATUS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement regarding his children's enrollment in The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School:  
   "After home schooling our children for five years and annually submitting the voluminous documentation to the Penn Hills School District, we enrolled our children in a public charter school. 
   "With the approval of the Penn Hills School District, for four years my children attended The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School, while we split time between Pennsylvania and Washington. 
   "The school district has just informed us that after reviewing our situation, only children who live in a community on a full time basis are eligible to be educated in a public cyber charter school program. 
   "Karen and I believe it is important for our family to be with me when I am working in Washington; as I always say the most important job I have is as a husband and a father. 
   "As a result Karen and I have made the decision to immediately withdraw all five of our school-aged children from The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School. 
   "We will now resume the practice of home schooling our children so that we can travel across Pennsylvania and continue to fulfill my pledge - that I have met every year - to visit each of Pennsylvania's sixty-seven counties. 
   "Being able to experience public cyber education firsthand has been a tremendous experience for my family, and I believe that it could be an invaluable experience for many families in Pennsylvania. 
   "I want to thank the administration of the Penn Hills School District for the courtesy they extended to me during this time."
