LACKAWANNA COUNTY EXPANSION PROJECT RECEIVES U.S. FOREIGN TRADE ZONE DESIGNATION WITH HELP FROM SEN. SANTORUM
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced approval for the General Purpose Foreign Trade Zone #24 at Valley View Business Park and Jessup Small Business Center.  
 The expansion project was granted through the Eastern Distribution Center, Inc. The Scranton Lackawanna Industrial Building Company (SLIBCO), a division of the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce and The Rockefeller Group, the exclusive Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) developer of the project, were instrumental in this announcement.
   "The designation of this site as an FTZ is vital to northeastern Pennsylvania to retain existing business as well as attract new industry and will allow for critical financial investments in the Pennsylvania economy," Senator Santorum said. "I had the opportunity to visit the site in 2003 with officials from the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce and I believe this is a natural fit for expansion of the Foreign Trade Zone." 
   The FTZ expansion project at Valley View Business Park and Jessup Small Business Center encompasses over 5.4 million square feet for distribution and light manufacturing operations, which positions the site to become one of the largest business parks in the greater Scranton Wilkes-Barre area. The site is anticipated to generate over $490 million of investment in the community. 
   "I will continue to work with community leaders throughout the region to develop more projects like the Valley View Business Park and Jessup Small Business Center, which help to spur the local economy by attracting businesses and jobs to northeastern Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum said.
