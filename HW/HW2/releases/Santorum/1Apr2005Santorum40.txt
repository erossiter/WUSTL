SEN. SANTORUM REACTS TO LABOR DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, offered comments today regarding economic growth and job creation:  
   "Economic figures released by the Department of Labor today indicate steady growth in the economy. 110,000 jobs were created during the month of March bringing the total number of jobs created since May 2003 to over 3 million, continuing the trend of 22 consecutive months of job growth. The unemployment rate also showed signs of improvement, falling from 5.4 percent to 5.2 percent. More Americans are working than ever before." 
   The President has put forth an ambitious agenda to ensure that America's economy remains the most prosperous in the world. I remain committed to passing legislation that creates an atmosphere for economic growth and job creation. We must ensure that our nation's high schools graduate students with the skills necessary to succeed in a competitive global workforce. Making tax cuts permanent and providing all Americans with greater control over their own health care and retirement will help to move our nation toward an ownership society. 
   "Pennsylvania's economy also continues to grow. Additional professional and business services jobs were added in February, and Pennsylvania's unemployment rate for February stood at 5.2 percent, below the national average for February. I will continue to work hard for industry and small business in Pennsylvania to ensure our state's economy is one of the strongest in the nation."
