SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO KEEP PENNSYLVANIA MANUFACTURERS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced four duty suspension bills that are designed to improve the ability of the Sony manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant, Westmoreland County to stay globally competitive.  
   "If passed, these duty suspension bills will save manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and maintain the United States as a global competitor of manufacturing advanced display televisions," said Senator Santorum. 
   Key components that are used to manufacture these TVs in the U.S. face a tariff when imported into America. This adds to the price of the product and places it at a competitive disadvantage versus foreign manufactured TVs. The suspension of taxes on the importation of these items will not hurt the domestic industry, since these products are not manufactured domestically. 
   There is a fledgling business of manufacturing advanced display TVs in the U.S. in danger of a premature collapse. Duty suspension for these television components will provide a sustaining incentive to maintain and grow domestic production. 
   "With the support of my colleagues in the Senate, we can pass these duty suspension bills to make the U.S. television-manufacturing sector more competitive with foreign manufacturers," said Senator Santorum. 
   The four duty suspension bills provide the following: 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Liquid Crystal Device Panel Assemblies for Liquid Crystal Device Projection Type Televisions. 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Liquid Crystal Device Panel Assemblies for Liquid Crystal Device Direct View Televisions. 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Plasma Flat Panel Assemblies for Televisions. 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Electron Guns for High Definition Cathode Ray Tubes for Televisions.
