SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE AMERICANS' ACCESS TO BREAKTHROUGH MEDICAL TREATMENTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced legislation to establish three new grant programs through the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Center for Research Resources.  
 This legislation is intended to speed the pace of research resulting in cures and treatments, often referred to as taking research "from bench to bedside." 
   There have been major breakthroughs in biomedical science over the past few decades that have provided an unprecedented amount of information for improving health and preventing disease. This legislation would provide the funding to take that information and use it to improve Americans' health. These programs would improve partnerships between clinical research centers and health care providers. The three new grant programs include clinical research support grants, demonstration projects, and infrastructure grants. 
   "Pennsylvania is fortunate to have some of the best and most active NIH research programs in the country," Santorum said. "This funding will translate the invaluable research from these institutions into real treatments and cures that will improve the health of countless Americans." 
   This legislation would help Pennsylvania institutions like the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State and the University of Pennsylvania translate their remarkable research into practical treatments and improvements to health care.
