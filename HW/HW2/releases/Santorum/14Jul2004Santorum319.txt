SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE $8.5 MILLION TO AID WORKERS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the United States Department of Labor has released $8,537,047 in National Emergency Grant Funds to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
   With this funding, the 1,630 Pennsylvania workers who are certified for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits in Pennsylvania will continue to access training and employment services. The funding will also pay for transportation and relocation expenses so displaced workers can transition to new jobs. 
   In March 2004, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao awarded a $15,823,851 National Emergency Grant to assist the state. The Department released $6.2 million of that aid immediately, and the $8.5 million released today is the second installment of the initial award. 
   "I am pleased that the Department of Labor has recognized the need to provide funding for programs that will help equip individuals who are trying to re-enter the workforce," said Senator Santorum. "This funding is crucial to providing Pennsylvanians with the skills and information necessary to improve employment opportunities and job retention." 
   "This funding will be used to help 1,630 Pennsylvania workers who have been hit hard by unfair foreign imports and manufacturing jobs going overseas," Senator Specter said. "It is important when dealing with foreign trade that we don't turn a blind eye to American workers at home."
