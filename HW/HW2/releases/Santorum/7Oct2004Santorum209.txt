SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE $72 MILLION IN ENERGY AID FOR PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Department of Health and Human Services has provided $72.1 million in aid to assist Pennsylvania's low-income families in paying their heating bills. 
   "As we approach the winter season, this important funding will help low-income families who need assistance paying their heating bills," Senator Santorum said. "It is my hope that every Pennsylvanian will have the resources they need to stay warm and healthy as we enter into the cold months ahead." 
   "Pennsylvania suffers from torrid summers and frigid winters," Senator Specter said. "This funding comes at a key time when cold weather is approaching, and will help low-income families avoid potentially life-threatening conditions." 
   This funding is part of $1.2 billion in assistance that the Department has released today through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. LIHEAP helps eligible families pay the costs of heating and insulating their homes in the winter, and cooling their homes in the summer. More than 4.5 million low-income households across the country receive assistance each year.
