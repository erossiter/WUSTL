SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS BILL TO HELP PREGNANT, PARENTING COLLEGE STUDENTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, cosponsored S. 1966, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act of 2005.  
 This legislation would help relieve pressure on student parents. 
   The bill would provide grants to institutions of higher education to establish student services offices for pregnant students, parenting students, prospective parenting students anticipating a birth or adoption, and students who are placing or have placed a child for adoption. Senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) is the original sponsor of the bill. 
   Some of the student services that are encouraged by the bill include family housing, local or on-campus child care, flexible academic scheduling, referrals for prenatal care and delivery, education supporting responsible parenting and healthy marriages, and maternity coverage in student health care plans. 
   "Many students are faced with the very difficult challenge of balancing the pressures of school with those of pregnancy and parenting. Unfortunately, these challenges may result in a pregnant woman dropping out of college or having an abortion," said Senator Santorum. "If pregnant or parenting students have access to student services like on-campus child care and health care options, they are better enabled to both parent their children and finish their schooling." 
   "I am proud to join Senator Dole in supporting this legislation, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this important bill," said Senator Santorum.
