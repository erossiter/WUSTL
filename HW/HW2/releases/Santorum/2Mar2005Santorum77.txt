SEN. SANTORUM ROLLS OUT SENATE REPUBLICAN POVERTY ALLEVIATION AGENDA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, joined colleagues today in rolling out the Senate Republican Poverty Alleviation Agenda.  
   The comprehensive agenda to empower families in need was introduced by Senators Santorum, Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Jim Talent (R-MO) at a press conference on Capitol Hill today. 
   Two Pennsylvania leaders in the fight against poverty joined Santorum at today's press conference: Rev. Herb Lusk, Founder & President of People for People in Philadelphia, and Rev. Luis Cortes, President & CEO of Nueva Esperanza in Philadelphia. 
   "This agenda encourages an ownership society through personal asset building; helps private charities better serve the needs of the poor; recognizes the importance of faith-based charities in delivering social services; strengthens families by promoting healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood; and promotes work opportunity as the key to independence and a better life," Santorum said. 
   The twelve-point plan is comprised of the following provisions: 
   * Charitable Giving/CARE Act: Boost charitable giving and assist faith-based and community charities to help millions more people in need. 
   * Welfare Reform Reauthorization: Build on the success of welfare reform to free more people from the cycle of welfare dependency by expanding work opportunity and strengthening families. 
   * Hunger Relief: Promote incentives to encourage food donation and delivery. 
   * Individual Development Accounts: Provide low-income, working Americans the opportunity to build assets through matched savings accounts. 
   * Work Opportunity Tax Credit/Welfare-to-Work: Help welfare recipients find jobs that transition them from dependence to self-sufficiency. 
   * Low-income Housing Assistance: Encourage the rehabilitation and construction of affordable housing and consider GSE reforms to help low-income families. 
   * Faith-based as Full Partners: Ensure faith-based organizations have a level playing field to compete for federal grants to deliver essential social services. 
   * Prisoner Reentry/Mentoring: Help those forgotten in the nation's prisons and their children by providing more support and facilitating a healthy reentry into society. 
   * Charitable Liability Reform: Provide liability protections for businesses and individuals that make equipment and facilities available for charitable purposes. 
   * Vouchers: Create a commission to develop proposals on expanding choice for beneficiaries to improve options and social service delivery for those in need. 
   * Family Opportunity Act: Expand eligibility under the Medicaid program to help low-income families obtain services for their severely disabled children. 
   * Marriage Penalty Relief/Child Tax Credit: Permanently eliminate the unfair tax burden on married couples and make permanent the child tax credit to reduce child poverty. 
   "I'm pleased that my Republican colleagues support this important and proactive agenda to combat poverty across our nation." Santorum continued, "Compassionate conservatism relies on faith, family, and civic organizations to strengthen communities and expand opportunity for all Americans." 
   The Senators were also joined by leaders in the fight against poverty: Dave Donaldson, President & CEO, We Care America; Robert Woodson, Founder & President, National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise; and Todd Bassett, National Commander, The Salvation Army.
