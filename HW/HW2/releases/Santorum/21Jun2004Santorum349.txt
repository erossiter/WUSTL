SEN. SANTORUM HONORED FOR 'PRO-SENIOR VOTING RECORD'
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, has received a Lawmaker of the Month Award from the 60 Plus Association, a national senior citizens organization with 5,460 members in Pennsylvania.  
   "I am honored to be a recipient of the Lawmaker of the Month Award from the 60 Plus Association," said Senator Santorum. "Pennsylvania seniors make significant contributions to the Commonwealth's economy and job market. Seniors deserve more Medicare coverage choices and the opportunity to retain the savings they have spent their entire lives earning." 
   In announcing Senator Santorum as a recipient of the award, 60 Plus Association President Jim Martin praised the Senator for his "pro-senior voting record." Mr. Martin cited Senator Santorum's support of legislation that: 
   * Reforms Medicare by giving seniors more choices of coverage, including a voluntary prescription drug benefit; 
   * Repeals the death tax, which hurts small businesses and family farms; 
   * Repeals the Earnings Limit for seniors 65 to 69; 
   * Supports the work of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security; 
   * Opposes taxes on Social Security benefits. 
   "Senator Santorum has always been someone Pennsylvania seniors can count on," said Mr. Martin. "Some of his recent work in the U.S. Senate has focused on issues that will have a positive impact on the lives of seniors. That's why he has been chosen as a Lawmaker of the Month for June, 2004."
