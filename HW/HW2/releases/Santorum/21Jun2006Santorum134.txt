SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HOMELESS VETERANS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that Pennsylvania has been awarded three grants to address the problems of homelessness among America's veterans.  
   The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) is administered by the Assistant Secretary for Veteran's Employment and Training at the Department of Labor. HVRP grantees enroll thousands of homeless veterans annually in programs that involve emergency shelter, substance abuse counseling and treatment, job counseling and referral, employment assistance, transportation, housing and clothing. HVRP requires grantees to use available resources in the local community, including faith-based and community organizations and social service agencies. 
   "The HVRP program has been a tremendous success, helping many veterans across Pennsylvania and the entire country," said Senator Santorum. "It is critically important that we do all we can to ensure the well-being and safety of veterans who are suffering and do not have a place to call home. As a U.S. Senator, I have consistently fought for veteran's benefits because I believe it is our duty as Americans to ensure the quality of life for the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our nation." 
   The following grants have been awarded: 
   * $300,000 for the Veterans Leadership Program of Western Pennsylvania, Inc. in Pittsburgh. 
   * $250,000 for Impact Services Corporation in Philadelphia. 
   * $75,550 for the YWCA of Greater Harrisburg.
