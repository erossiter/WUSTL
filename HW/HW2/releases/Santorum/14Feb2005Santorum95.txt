SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON BUSH'S RENOMINATION OF JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement following President Bush's announcement of the renomination of twenty judicial nominees:  
   "I am hopeful that with this new Congress, we will see a fresh start to the Senate confirmation process. Democrats obstructed the process during the 108th Congress, including unprecedented filibusters denying ten highly qualified judicial nominees a fair up-or-down vote. These kinds of partisan delaying tactics will only prevent our judicial system from operating in the fair and balanced manner that it was intended. 
   "Every judicial nominee put forth by President Bush deserves to have a timely up-or-down vote on the floor of the United States Senate. I will work with my colleagues to ensure a fair process for all nominees."
