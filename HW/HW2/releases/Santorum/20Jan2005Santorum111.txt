SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF BUSH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement regarding the Inauguration of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush:  
   "The Inaugural ceremony of President George W. Bush is an historic event in our nation's history. Every four years, Americans witness the swearing-in ceremony of the President, which represents a continuity of leadership and the peaceful transition of power in our country. It is a remarkable occasion that showcases democracy at its best. 
   "During his first term, President Bush guided our country through the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. In addition, President Bush put forth policies that spurred job creation, made our public schools more accountable, put money back into the hands of hard-working Americans, and secured our homeland. 
   "During today's 55th Inaugural address, President Bush expressed a vision for America that will continue to lead our country toward a better future. I look forward to working with President Bush in his second term to continue to keep America safe from future terrorist attacks; provide affordable and quality health care all Americans; promote strong and healthy families; and continue to create an environment to encourage growth in the economy in a time of prosperity and opportunity."
