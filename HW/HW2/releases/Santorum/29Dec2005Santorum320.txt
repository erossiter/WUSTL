SENS. SANTORUM, MARTINEZ OFFER FRIENDLY WAGERS TO CELEBRATE 2006 ORANGE BOWL
  Sens. Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Mel Martinez (R-FL) have struck a friendly wager on the outcome of the 2006 Orange Bowl game between the Penn State Nittany Lions (10-1) and the Florida State Seminoles (8-4). Sen.  
 Santorum has anted up Penn State Creamery ice cream and Sen. Martinez is wagering Bradley's Country Smoked sausage. 
   "It's going to be a great game to watch and it's an added bonus to see a match-up between two of the winningest coaches in college football," said Senator Santorum. "Unfortunately for Senator Martinez he will have to wait for another opportunity to try Penn State Creamery ice cream." 
   Martinez said, "Playing Penn State is a great honor for us. It will be a great match of two of the most legendary coaches in college football however, I would not bet against Bobby Bowden when he's the underdog. I look forward to a great game but also a humbling result for Penn State." 
   The 72nd annual Orange Bowl will be played in Miami on Tuesday, January 3rd, 2006 at 7pm.
