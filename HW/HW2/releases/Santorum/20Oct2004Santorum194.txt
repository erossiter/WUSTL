SEN. SANTORUM VISITS ALLENTOWN CENTRAL CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL TO CELEBRATE RESPECT LIFE MONTH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today spoke with students at Allentown Central Catholic High School about his steadfast support of the pro-life movement.  
   Allentown Central Catholic High School held a pro-life prayer service, "Praying for a Culture of Life." As the featured guest speaker for the event, Senator Santorum spoke about his involvement in fighting for the protection of the unborn. The Senator also highlighted his work on two important pieces of legislation, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act and the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 - both pieces of legislation that Senator Santorum sponsored in the 108th Congress and were signed into law by President Bush. 
   "Allentown Central Catholic High School is honored to have such a nationally recognized leader of the pro-life movement speak to the students today as we celebrate and observe Respect Life Month," said Father Frans J. Berkhout, President of Allentown Central Catholic High School. 
   "In the United States Senate I have worked to pass legislation that reflects the value my faith places on the sanctity of human life," Senator Santorum told the students. "As Catholics we should be working to build a culture of life and a civilization of compassion. You are at a crucial point in your life where you will be making decisions about issues that will challenge your religion and faith. I encourage you to stand strong, and to remember the teachings here at Central Catholic as you go out into the world." 
   Central Catholic is celebrating "Respect Life Month" and they are recognizing the work of individuals who have worked for and supported the pro-life cause.
