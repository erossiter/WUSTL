SENS. SPECTER, SANTORUM ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Arlen Specter, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, and Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help assure their protection as they safeguard our communities. I commend the Department of Homeland Security for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services." 
   "This funding will provide our first responders with the training they need to provide communities in Pennsylvania with the best protection possible," said Senator Santorum. "It is important that local fire departments and emergency personnel are outfitted with the equipment, tools, and skills they need to ensure the safety and security of Pennsylvanians during times of need." 
   These grants are the first round of funding from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. Congress approved $650 million in direct assistance for the 2005 program to support firefighters throughout the country. 
   This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the U.S. Congress and SLGCP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs.
