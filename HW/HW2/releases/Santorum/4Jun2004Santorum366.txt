SEN. SANTORUM MAKES STATEMENT ON U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH, JOB CREATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today on U.S. economic growth and job creation:  
   "President Bush's Jobs and Growth tax relief package enacted a year ago has helped drive the strong improvement in our economy. Our nation's economy continues to grow stronger, according to new data released by the U.S. Department of Labor today. 
   "Almost one million jobs have been created in the past three months, with 248,000 payroll jobs created in May alone. The national unemployment rate remains steady at 5.6 percent, down 0.7 percentage points from a peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003. These rates are below the average of each of the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. 
   "In addition, manufacturing employment has been on the rise for the past four months, adding 32,000 jobs in May. 
   "Last month, the Senate passed the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act, which will repeal tariffs imposed by the European Union on nearly 100 American-made products, and cut taxes for U.S. manufacturers. I am hopeful that the House will soon pass this legislation to protect U.S. manufacturers, including those in Pennsylvania. 
   "Stable jobs, strong businesses and industries, and consumer confidence play an important role in maintaining America's economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
