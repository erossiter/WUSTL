SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE 20 ADDITIONAL COUNTIES ADDED TO PRESIDENT'S DISASTER DECLARATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, announced today that President Bush has added fifteen additional counties ravaged by Tropical Depression Ivan to the Disaster Declaration. The twenty additional counties are: Bedford, Bradford, Clarion, Clinton, Columbia, Franklin, Fulton, Jefferson, Juniata, Lebanon, Mifflin, Monroe, Montour, Northumberland, Pike, Snyder, Tioga, Union, Wayne and York. 
   Earlier this week President Bush declared a major disaster for twenty-six counties in Pennsylvania, including: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Blair, Bucks, Butler, Cameron, Carbon, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Green, Huntingdon, Indiana, Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Northampton, Perry, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Washington, Westmoreland, and Wyoming Counties. 
   By declaring a major disaster for Pennsylvania, President Bush enables affected residents to be eligible for federal assistance that can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration may also be available to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance.
