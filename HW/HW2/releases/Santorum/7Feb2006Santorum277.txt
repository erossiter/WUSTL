SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES SPORTSMEN'S PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced S. 2249, the Sportsmen's Privacy Protection Act, which would repeal the federal mandate that requires states to collect Social Security numbers for recreational licenses.  
   "I have heard from a lot of hunters and sportsmen's groups about their legitimate concerns in giving their Social Security number when applying for a hunting license because the numbers are rarely protected as they should be," said Senator Santorum. "In Pennsylvania and many other states, recreational licenses remain in a paper book often with multiple entries on a page. In my view, there are significant privacy concerns to disclosing Social Security numbers when outdoor enthusiasts purchase their hunting, fishing or recreational licenses." 
   "This important legislation restores the privacy rights of recreational hunters and fishermen, while maintaining an effective system of child support enforcement," said Senator Santorum. "I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation that restores the privacy rights of recreational hunters and fishermen."
