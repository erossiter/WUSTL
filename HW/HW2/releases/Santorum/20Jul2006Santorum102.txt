SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO COMBAT INTERNET PREDATORS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today applauded passage of the Project Safe Childhood Act. Sen. Santorum sponsored the bill, which was included as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.  
   "I am pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate agreed that this program was a necessary tool in the fight to protect our children from online predators," said Senator Santorum. "As the father of six children, I know that our children face daily dangers on the internet from predators with harmful motives. I intend to work closely with the Department of Justice to fully implement this expanded initiative and ensure that our children are protected from these predators." 
   In February, the Department of Justice launched Project Safe Childhood, an initiative to "combat the proliferation of technology-facilitated sexual exploitation crimes against children." On May 17, 2006, the Department of Justice released a document that outlines the need for this project, an overview of the program and guides for how law enforcement, parents, teachers, and communities can come together to implement this program effectively. 
   Senator Santorum introduced this bill on June 5, 2006 in Pittsburgh where he was joined by Mary Beth Buchanan, United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and members of the Internet Crimes Against Children task force from the local Pittsburgh area. 
   The provisions will authorize and expand Project Safe Childhood, add new elements requested by DOJ to strengthen the Project, increase penalties for registered sex offenders, increase penalties for child sex trafficking and sexual abuse, increase penalties for child pornography, create Children's Safety Online Awareness Campaigns, and authorize grants for online child safety programs.
