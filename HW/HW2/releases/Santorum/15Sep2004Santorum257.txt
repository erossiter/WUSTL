SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVAL FOR AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved federal funding for agricultural projects in Pennsylvania. This funding is part of the FY05 Agriculture Appropriations bill.  
   "Agriculture is vital to Pennsylvania and I am committed to supporting efforts to increase the development of technology in agriculture throughout the Commonwealth," said Santorum. "I am pleased that these projects have received funding so Pennsylvania can remain a competitive leader in agriculture." 
   "These programs will strengthen the state's agricultural industry by developing innovative technologies to improve production and management of Pennsylvania's farms," Senator Specter said. "I applaud my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee for funding these agricultural projects that are fundamental to keeping Pennsylvania's economy strong." 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved funding for the following projects: 
   * $1 million to the Agriculture Research Service for the study of Biomedical Materials in Plants. This funding will allow for the continued research at Thomas Jefferson University and elsewhere of tobacco and other plants as a medium to produce vaccines and other biomedical products for the prevention of many human and animal diseases. This technology has the potential to shift a great deal of tobacco production to a vehicle for preventing, curing, and treating viruses and cancers in place of smoking, chewing, and other current uses. (Philadelphia) 
   * $667,000 for the Milk and Dairy Safety and Quality Research program at Penn State University. Penn State is recognized as a leader in research concerning the production of safe and wholesome dairy products. This funding will help researchers at the University better understand the microbiology of the Listeria organism and make progress in determining the process and handling parameters that will ensure a safe milk supply. (Centre County) 
   * $650,000 for Hides and Leather Research conducted at the Eastern Regional Research Center. This center, located in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, has been developing new methods of tanning cattle hides produced in the U.S. to process them in a cost effective, environmentally sensitive fashion that enhances their value and is competitive in world markets. This is the only USDA facility that conducts research on these agricultural products. (Montgomery County) 
   * $444,000 for Dairy Farming Management and Profitability projects at Penn State University. This funding will benefit projects focusing on the economic and social dimensions of dairy farming, risk analysis, the economic impact of implementing voluntary animal health programs, development management, and the adoption of technology, in an attempt to help farmers increase their profitability. (Centre County) 
   * $355,000 for Penn State University's Improved Dairy On-Farm Management Practices program. Last year, Congress provided funding for work done in Pennsylvania to research new and improved on-farm management practices. Innovative research directed at the farm level is essential to sustain the nation's dairy industry. This year's funding provides for further research in areas such as manure management techniques, odor abatement, induced lactation, and animal health program management improvements. (Centre County) 
   * $250,000 for Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at Penn State University and the Rodale Institute. This project studies the cycling of nutrients in soil and crops with a special emphasis on the development of indices for measurement of soil health. The original goal of this research was to understand the cycling of nutrients from animal agricultural production systems through soil and water into crops and back to food for animals or directly to humans in the case of vegetable production. (Centre and Berks Counties) 
   * $222,000 for Agricultural Entrepreneurial Alternatives for Small Farmers at Penn State University. This program delivers farm and community level educational programs and assistance. Farm-level programs focus on developing alternative enterprise opportunities, generating business and marketing plans and providing market research and feasibility studies. Community-level programs focus on assessing and strengthening the local agricultural business climate and developing regional marketing alliances. (Centre County) 
   * $87,000 for the Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial for fungi research. This funding will help provide for ongoing, long-term field research on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi research and other soil-based investigations. AM fungi benefits crops through increased nutrient uptake, increased resistance to diseases and drought, and improved soil water holding capacity. The Farming Systems Trial is a randomized, split block, replicated trial for conventional and organic farming systems has been in place at The Institute for side-by-side comparisons, since 1981. (Berks County) 
   * $50,000 for the Research Institute for Family Health and Wellness at Marywood University. The establishment of this institute will improve family health in a three-county area - Lackawanna, Luzerne and Wyoming. Marywood University will focus on nutrition and obesity; fitness; tobacco use; geriatric-related concerns; chronic diseases; and food safety. (Lackawanna County) 
   * $50,000 for The National Center of Excellence in Foods and Nutrition Research (NutriCore). This program would implement a national approach to increase levels and results of nutrition research and development. NutriCore would be a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in Indiana with regional hubs in Pennsylvania, California, Texas, Mississippi, and Iowa. The Center would operate under a cooperative research and development agreement with USDA, which would provide direction and oversight. (York County) 
   * $50,000 for Pennsylvania Cooperative Livestock Protection Program, which will be developed by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture in conjunction with USDA, Penn State University, and agricultural organizations. This program would provide Pennsylvania's 59,000 agricultural producers with technical and operational assistance in identifying, controlling, and abating damage, animal health problems, and economic loss caused by certain nuisance wildlife species. 
   * $50,000 for Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture's Center for Dairy Excellence. This funding would be used to expand the On-Farm Profit Team Program, which provides education and training on improved dairy farm management. 
   * $3.312 million for AgrAbility. This program helps farmers with disabilities and their families succeed in rural community life by providing information on modifying their farm or tools to adapt to their new lifestyle. 
   * $2.5 million for Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA). This program provides farmers with fast, up-to-date information free of charge on a wide range of issues facing the agricultural community, including pest control, sustainable agriculture, marketing, and soil fertility. 
   * $2.25 million for Coffee and Cocoa Disease Resistance/Alternative Crop Research through the United States Department of Agriculture, an undetermined amount of which will go to Pennsylvania. This research is vital to help control a range of domestic and tropical fungal and pest diseases which are currently plaguing the cocoa crops that are vital for domestic chocolate production, including the Pennsylvania chocolate industry. In addition, this research has proven effective in the U.S. Government's counter-drug "alternative crop" strategy for Central and South America, which helps farmers in the region grow profitable, legal crops. 
   * $1.7 million for Viticulture Consortium to provide for grape and wine research in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Washington. The purpose of the consortium is to assist grape producers in improving yields, reducing production costs, and increasing product.
