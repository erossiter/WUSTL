SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR ALLENTOWN-READING FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for several fire companies in the Allentown/Reading area. 
   "This funding will provide our first responders with the training they need to provide communities in Lehigh and Berks County with the best protection possible," said Senator Santorum. "It is important that local fire departments and emergency personnel are outfitted with the equipment, tools, and skills they need to ensure the safety and security of Pennsylvanians during times of need." 
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help assure their protection as they safeguard our communities. I commend the Office of Domestic Preparedness for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services." These grants are the nineteenth round of funding from the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. Congress approved $750 million in direct assistance for the 2004 program to support firefighters throughout the country. 
   This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the United States Congress and ODP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs. Grants have been approved for the following companies in the Allentown/Reading area: 
   * $58,145 for Catasauqua Fire Department in Lehigh County. 
  * $54,783 for Greenfields Fire Company in Berks County. 
  * $47,782 for Western Salisbury Fire Department in Lehigh County.
