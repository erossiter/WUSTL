SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER URGE PRESIDENT BUSH TO PROVIDE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, today urged President Bush to declare Pennsylvania a major disaster in response to severe flooding, tornados and high wind damage caused by remnants of Tropical Depression Ivan which ravaged parts of Pennsylvania. 
   The letter from the Senators today supplements Governor Rendell's request that President Bush provide federal assistance for thirty-four of Pennsylvania's sixty-seven counties which suffered severe damage from the storm. By declaring a major disaster in the Commonwealth, President Bush enables affected residents to be eligible for federal assistance that can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration also will be available to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance.
