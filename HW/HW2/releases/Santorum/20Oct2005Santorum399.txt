SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON HIS SUPPORT OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the following statement today regarding his support of an increase to the federal minimum wage:  
   "I am disappointed that the United States Senate was not able to pass a reasonable increase to the federal minimum wage. 
   "I believe it is time for a minimum wage increase, which is why I voted in favor of an amendment offered by Senator Enzi that would have raised the minimum wage while easing some of the unnecessary and costly administrative and regulatory burdens that small businesses face, such as reducing unfair penalties imposed on employers for first-time paperwork errors. 
   "While I believe Senator Enzi's amendment offered the best alternative to the current system, I also supported an amendment sponsored by my Democratic colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, that would have increased the federal minimum wage by $1.10. Unfortunately, this amendment also failed to pass. 
   "I remain committed to enacting legislation that will benefit hard-working Pennsylvanians who deserve reform that enables them to better provide for their families, but avoids placing unnecessary burden on small businesses."
