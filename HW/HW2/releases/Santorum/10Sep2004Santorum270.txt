SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE PORT SECURITY AWARDS FOR PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) has approved funding to support efforts in critical national seaports and terminals to enhance port security through increased facility and operational security. 
   "As our nation continues to face the threat of terrorism, safety and security continue to be top priorities for Pennsylvania residents. These grants will allow for Pennsylvania to take the necessary steps to improve security at seaports and throughout terminals across the Commonwealth," said Senator Santorum. 
   "In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we need to fund measures that increase security throughout the nation," Senator Specter said. "These grants will help ensure we are strong against any threat at our ports of entry and against any terrorist organization attempting to gain entrance. I commend the Department of Homeland Security for providing funding to keep our ports and terminals safe." This funding is part of the Fiscal Year 2004 Port Security Grant program, which provides funding to enhance security at federally regulated public and private ports, terminals, and U.S. inspected passenger vessels or ferries. The following projects in Pennsylvania will receive funding: 
   * $188,000 for the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority in Erie County for surveillance. 
   * $134,000 for the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority in Philadelphia County for surveillance.
