SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE CONFIRMATION OF VAN ANTWERPEN TO CIRCUIT COURT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, announced today that the United States Senate confirmed the nomination of Franklin S. Van Antwerpen to be a justice on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
   Judge Van Antwerpen presently serves on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and was nominated by the President on November 21, 2003. His confirmation hearing was held on January 28, 2004, and chaired by Senator Specter.
   "This confirmation is long overdue and much deserved," said Senator Santorum. "Judge Van Antwerpen is a well qualified and outstanding individual, who has a fair and balanced assessment of the law; he will make an excellent addition to the Circuit Court."
   "I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate have confirmed the nomination of such a highly respected jurist who has been so active in his community," said Senator Specter. "Judge Van Antwerpen brings the combination of education, academic skills, practical experience, great volunteer efforts with the Legal Aid Society, and will make an outstanding addition to the Circuit Court."
   Judge Van Antwerpen received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Maine in 1964 and his Juris Doctor degree from the Temple University School of Law in 1967.
