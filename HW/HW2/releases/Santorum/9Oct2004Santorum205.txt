SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF SENATE INTELLIGENCE AND HOMELAND SECURITY OVERSIGHT REFORM RESOLUTION
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding Senate passage of the Senate Intelligence and Homeland Security Oversight Reform Resolution:  
   "Today the Senate passed S. Res. 445, the Senate Intelligence and Homeland Security Oversight Reform Resolution, by a vote of 79-6. This historic legislation brings much needed reform to Senate oversight of our intelligence community. I commend Majority Whip Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Whip Harry Reid (D-NV) for their dedicated work. I am pleased that my colleagues acknowledged the recommendations issued in the final report of the 9/11 Commission and addressed the need for this reform. 
   "Currently jurisdiction over homeland security and intelligence is scattered throughout many different committees in the Senate. As the 9/11 Commission proved in their final report, the current system is inefficient and dysfunctional. The Senate Resolution passed today streamlines incoming national intelligence and beefs up the Senate Intelligence Committee. The stature of the Senate Intelligence Committee will be elevated from a select committee to a permanent status. This legislation also eliminates the provision on term limits for members of this committee in order to provide more expertise to important national security issues. 
   "This legislation is Congress's attempt to correct our shortcomings and to better protect our homeland. The only way that we can truly protect Americans at home and abroad is to provide members of Congress with access to real-time intelligence, so that we can make informed, expeditious, and beneficial decisions regarding our homeland security."
