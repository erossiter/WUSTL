SEN. SANTORUM DELIVERS FUNDING TO PHILADELPHIA VETERANS MULTI-SERVICE, EDUCATION CENTER
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today presented funding to the Philadelphia Veterans Multi-Service and Education Center.  
   Senator Santorum presented the Philadelphia Veterans Multi-Service and Education Center with $550,000 from the Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration. The center will use the funding to expand their employment training outreach programs, which assist veterans transitioning from military duty to civilian jobs. The outreach programs are uniquely designed to provide intensive support to veterans returning to work in the Philadelphia area. 
   "It is our responsibility to be prepared to assist veterans once they return home - as transitioning back into civilian life after military service can be extremely difficult," said Edward J. Lowry, Executive Director of the Philadelphia Veterans Multi-Service and Education Center. "Thanks to Senator Santorum, we will be more prepared to meet this challenge." 
   "It's a pleasure to present this funding to the Philadelphia Veterans Multi-Service and Education Center today," said Senator Santorum. "It is very important that our veterans are provided with the appropriate support and training so they may have a positive experience when returning home from military service. I commend the Philadelphia Veterans Multi-Service and Education Center for their tireless efforts to assist our nation's veterans."
