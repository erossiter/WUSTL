SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS LEGISLATION HONORING LIFE, LEGACY OF ROSA PARKS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, cosponsored a bill to create a commemorative postage stamp honoring the life and work of Rosa Parks.  
   "I am proud to support this important bipartisan bill because I feel it is most appropriate to honor the life and legacy of Rosa Parks with a commemorative postage stamp so all Americans can be reminded of her courage, spirit and conviction," said Senator Santorum. 
   The United States Postal Service commemorative stamp selection criteria generally requires that an honoree be deceased at least 10 years before issuing a commemorative stamp. Senator Santorum wrote a letter to the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee requesting that they consider Rosa Parks as an exception to this rule and issue a stamp in her honor. 
   In November 2005, Senator Santorum cosponsored S.Con.Res. 62, a concurrent resolution calling for a statue honoring Rosa Parks to be placed in the United States Capitol building. President Bush recently signed this legislation into law.
