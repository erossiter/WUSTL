SEN. SANTORUM MAKES STATEMENT AFTER VISITING WITH CAMPBELLTOWN RESIDENTS FOLLOWING DEVASTATING TORNADO
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today about his visit to Campbelltown, Pennsylvania.  
 On Wednesday afternoon a tornado tore a seven mile path of destruction through Country Squire Estates, located in Lebanon County. 
   "Today I traveled to Lebanon County to assess the damage and offer support to the residents in the aftermath of the tornado that swept through Campbelltown, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas, on Wednesday. 
   "It's important to me to support those people who have gone through the horrible experience of having someone injured, or losing a home or having a home damaged. We are so thankful that there were no fatalities as a result of the severe weather. 
   "The local Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) and the American Red Cross are working around the clock to help those who are in need of shelter, food, clothing and other basic needs. Utility companies are working to restore power lines, and clean up trees and other debris from streets and areas throughout the town. 
   "I was so pleased and proud to see the great spirit that's alive in Campbelltown. So many people have come together during this difficult time and to offer support to friends and neighbors whose lives have been impacted by this storm. I thank everyone who has pitched in to help those in need during this difficult time. 
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to those who have lost their homes, businesses, farms or suffered damage to their properties. It is my hope that the clean up and recovery efforts can proceed quickly so that those individuals who have suffered losses can begin to rebuild their lives."
