SEN. SANTORUM PRAISES PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that H.R. 5441, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act, which passed the Senate today, included a provision which he strongly supported that prohibits the confiscation of firearms during an emergency or major disaster.  
   The amendment, sponsored by Senator David Vitter (R-LA), will ensure that no firearms will be seized either temporarily or permanently during an emergency or major disaster unless the possession of the firearm is prohibited by federal or state law, or is evidence in a criminal investigation. 
   "In the days following Hurricane Katrina, law enforcement officials in New Orleans ordered the confiscation of firearms from law-abiding gun owners - in some cases at gunpoint, depriving law-abiding gun owners the ability to protect themselves and their families amid the post-Katrina chaos," said Senator Santorum. "The measure passed by the Senate today will ensure that this travesty never happens again." 
   Earlier this year, Senator Santorum cosponsored legislation similar to this amendment, S. 2599, the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006.
