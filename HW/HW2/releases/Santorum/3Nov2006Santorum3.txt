SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON RELEASE OF VALUABLE INFORMATION IN PRE-WAR DOCUMENTS DISCOVERED IN IRAQ
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented today on a story published in The New York Times that calls to question the release of valuable information contained in captured pre-war documents discovered in Iraq.  
   "It is incumbent on the President, as our Commander in Chief, to hold members of the intelligence community accountable to the law if an error was made in improperly posting sensitive information on the Internet." 
   "In the legislation that I authored, and in correspondence with the President, the Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, I have always stressed that we must guard against the dangerous disclosure of classified information in the interest of national security." 
   "Releasing captured Iraq documents is imperative to prevailing in our military campaign in Iraq. These documents are necessary to help the American people understand the nature of the threat we face and the justification for our invasion of Iraq. There are many things that need to be done in this war, but none of them will happen unless the American people come to grips with the terrible fact that we are at war, and there is no way to escape it." 
   Senator Santorum introduced legislation in March requiring the Director of National Intelligence to make available military documents and photographs recovered in Iraq and Afghanistan. Specifically, the bill requires the Director of National Intelligence to make publicly available on an Internet website documents captured in Afghanistan or Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, or Operation Iraqi Freedom. The legislation authorizes the Director of National Intelligence to withhold making a document publicly available if the release of the materials would be harmful to America's national security interests.
