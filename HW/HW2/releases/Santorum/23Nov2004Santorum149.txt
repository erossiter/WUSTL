SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ALLENTOWN PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced federal funding for projects in the Allentown area, contained in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "I applaud my colleagues in the United States Senate for approving the Health and Human Services funding for these projects in Allentown," Senator Santorum said. "The funding will equip Allentown and its surrounding communities with emergency care centers, quality primary health care services, the most advanced health care modernizations, improving the health and wellness of the citizens of Allentown." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues have approved this important funding for the Allentown area," Senator Specter said. "These projects are vital to ensuring quality primary and emergency care, as well as advanced preventive care measures, for the area's residents." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   Projects to receive funding include: 
   * $700,000 for the Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown to construct a seven-story building which will expand and equip a new Catheterization Lab and advance capabilities to perform peripheral vascular procedures. 
   * $700,000 for Sacred Heart Hospital in Allentown to construct an emergency department. 
   * $700,000 for Saint Luke's Hospital in Allentown to construct an emergency department. 
   * $250,000 for Good Shepard Rehabilitation Home in Allentown to construct a new outpatient pavilion which would be a 20,000 sq. ft., two-story structure to house orthopedic rehabilitation to include back & neck, shoulder, knee and therapy programs, Chronic Pain programs and a Center for Health & Wellness programs. 
   * $100,000 for Community Services for Children in Allentown for a nursery designed to remediate and reverse the impact of drug use by pregnant mothers on their newborn infants. 
   * $100,000 for Saint Joseph Medical Center in Reading to construct an extended hour urgent care facility in Center City Reading to address emergency room crowding. This facility will provide immediate treatment for a wide range of non-life threatening conditions, most of which do not require the life-saving services of a full-service hospital emergency department.
