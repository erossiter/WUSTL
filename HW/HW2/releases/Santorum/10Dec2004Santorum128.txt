SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR NEW CASTLE AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced $1 million in funding for the New Castle Area Transit Authority.  
 The funding is included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
   "The residents of Lawrence County are fortunate to have access to safe, public transportation in and around the region," Senator Santorum said. "I am pleased that the New Castle Area Transit Authority has received $1 million in funding, enabling four buses to be replaced with newer, larger buses, and one to be added for New Castle commuters traveling into the City of Pittsburgh. The additional bus services will help to make commutes easier and faster for residents." 
   "I appreciate Senator Santorum's support of the New Castle Area Transit Authority," said Vicki Antonio, Assistant Manager of the New Castle Area Transit Authority. "We are now able to replace four buses, one of which will be dedicated to providing additional transportation to and from Pittsburgh. Without the support of Senator Santorum, we would not have been able to upgrade our deteriorated buses." 
   The New Castle Area Transit Authority provides the residents of New Castle, Shenango Township, Union Township, Neshannock Township, and Lawrence County with safe, dependable, and affordable public transportation. The New Castle Area Transit Authority employs 40 people and serves over 1,000,000 people each year.
