REP. SANTORUM PRESENTS FUNDING FOR ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE IN LACKAWANNA COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was in Lackawanna County today to present funding for the City of Scranton.  
   Senator Santorum presented the City of Scranton with a check for $300,000 from the Housing and Urban Development Economic Development Initiative portion of the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The funding will be used for a Southside redevelopment project specifically targeting Cedar Avenue. Chris Doherty, Mayor of Scranton, and Lackawanna County Commissioners Bob Cordaro and A.J. Munchak joined Senator Santorum in Scranton for the funding announcement. 
   "Cedar Avenue is in desperate need of revitalization, and I am pleased that I was able to help secure this funding, " Senator Santorum said. "This funding will allow work to continue on several projects that are reducing crime, rehabilitating neglected historic structures, and revitalizing neighborhoods in Scranton. The project fosters economic growth in an area of the city where blight and vacancy is high in order to preserve the historic character of the City of Scranton. I appreciate Mayor Doherty's work to redevelop this area in need." 
   "We appreciate the support that Senator Santorum has given to the people of Scranton and south Scranton in particular," said Mayor Doherty. "This grant will allow for the start of renovation of Cedar Avenue and lower south Scranton. This would not have happened without Rick Santorum's support."
