SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that Congress has approved federal funding for transportation projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Departments of the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (TTHUD) Fiscal Year 2006 Appropriations bill.  
   "I am pleased that Congress has approved funding to expand and improve our roadways and mass transit infrastructure," Senator Santorum said. "It is important that Pennsylvania continuously maintain and continue to modernize transportation throughout the Commonwealth in order to ensure the safe travel of its citizens, create more efficient means of transportation, and sustain a robust economy." 
   "It is encouraging to see my colleagues recognize the importance of these transportation projects in Pennsylvania," said Senator Specter. "These projects are necessary advancements and are vital for driving the local economies in the Commonwealth." 
   The Fiscal Year 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill was passed by the full Senate and the House of Representatives on November 18, 2005. It will now be sent to the President for his signature. 
   Funding for the following Pennsylvania projects has been approved: 
   * $55 Million for the Port Authority of Allegheny County North Shore Connector. This light rail system will be vitally important in connecting the heart of Pittsburgh, the Golden Triangle, to the North Shore area. The North Shore Connector will improve transit service along the Allegheny corridor and aid new development projects, which include Pittsburgh's two stadiums, Alcoa's corporate headquarters, a 240-unit apartment complex, an office building, a new theater, and a parking garage; 
   * $10 million for the Northwest New Jersey-Northeast Pennsylvania Passenger Rail Service Project to startup rail service between Scranton, PA and New York City. A dire need exists for this service to alleviate congestion that is occurring on Interstate 80, the only existing transportation option in this corridor. This project will provide commuter rail services to Monroe and Pike Counties, two of the fastest growing counties in Pennsylvania in terms of population growth; 
   * $4 million for the SEPTA Schuylkill Valley Metro Project to support the engineering of the Schuylkill Valley Metro line and facilitate travel from downtown metropolitan areas to suburban job centers. This project involves the construction of a 62-mile passenger rail corridor between Philadelphia and Wyomissing, via Norristown, Phoenixville, Pottstown, and Reading; 
   * $3.1 million for the Port Authority of Allegheny County for the purchase of 35 new buses to replace those which have completed their useful service lives and are eligible for retirement by virtue of age or mileage standards. Twenty percent of the Port Authority's bus fleet is beyond its useful life and the Authority replaces an average of 75 buses per year. The new buses will be used in the route network which serves 255,000 riders each day throughout the region; 
   * $2 million for the Lancaster Intermodal Center. The City of Lancaster's urban revitalization plan is closely linked to having a multimodal, interdependent transportation system that will facilitate walking and provide connections to city buses. The intermodal facility will strengthen community revitalization efforts and enhance public transportation options in downtown Lancaster; 
   * $2 million for the Mon Fayette Expressway for completion of design, right-of-way and initial construction of the Uniontown to Brownsville section of the Mon Fayette Expressway and National High Priority Corridor #31 of the National Highway System. The Mon Fayette Expressway is a very important economic redevelopment highway through the economically depressed Mon Valley. Adjacent sections, both north and south, are complete and open to traffic; 
   * $1.5 million for the Capital Area Transit/Corridor One project. This funding will provide for final design and construction of a 30-mile regional light rail system in the Harrisburg metropolitan area. The first segment of this rail line will extend from West Mechanicsburg to Harrisburg and from Harrisburg to Elizabethtown; 
   * $1.25 million for the Union Station Intermodal Center in Pottsville. This project involves the redevelopment of approximately four acres at the intersection of State Route 61 and Union Streets, into a new transportation hub for Schuylkill County, including: expanded county bus service, regional bus transportation service, a parking garage, a future link for passenger rail service, and 18,000 square feet of office, retail space, and restaurants. In addition, historical streetscape improvements - such as architectural landscaping and period lighting are planned along Union Street and Progress Avenue to make the site a focal point of economic revitalization in Schuylkill County; 
   * $1 million for the National Bioterrorism Civilian Medical Response Center at Drexel University. In 2000, Drexel University received a congressional designation as the National Bioterrorism Civilian Medical Response Center (CIMERC). Presently, the center is developing an advanced biosensor prototype and non-equilibrium plasma technologies for decontamination of HVAC systems. Recognizing that transportation systems are a terrorist target, the ability to utilize an instrument that is designed to aid with preplanning exercises, has resource allocation and etiologic bioagent spread prediction application, as well as post-epidemiological investigation applications is of critical importance; 
   * $225,000 for the Church Street Transportation Center in Williamsport. This proposed intermodal center will be constructed as a four-story building with 500 plus parking spaces. The Center will also include facilities for transit use. The Church Street Transportation Center is a key component of Williamsport's downtown revitalization strategy. The vision for downtown Williamsport seeks to enhance the City's visitor appeal through a mixed-use development concept that includes retail stores, a cinema, and conference center.
