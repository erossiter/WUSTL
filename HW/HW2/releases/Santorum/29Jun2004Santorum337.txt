SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR SEPTA HYBRID BUSES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the Federal Transit Administration has approved a $589,999 grant for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) to purchase hybrid electric buses. 
   SEPTA will use this grant, in conjunction with additional funding earmarked by Congress, to purchase 13 new replacement 40-ft. hybrid electric buses. These buses will utilize new technology to reduce exhaust emissions and fuel consumption, and improve brake life. 
   "I am pleased that SEPTA will invest this funding in providing cleaner, more efficient public transportation for Southeast Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "As technology advances it is important that we use modern research to develop environmentally friendly products that also lessen our reliance on natural resources which are becoming increasingly scarce." 
   "Public transportation is vital to growth and quality of life in the Philadelphia area," Senator Specter said. "I am pleased to see SEPTA employing this innovative and environmentally conscious technology on their bus operations, ensuring riders have the most advanced public transportation system available."
