SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF BROADCAST DECENCY LEGISLATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced Senate passage of S. 193, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act. Sen. Santorum is an original cosponsor of the bill, which increases the fines levied by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for obscene and indecent broadcasts from $32,500 per violation to $325,000 per violation.  
   "This legislation will ensure the FCC's enforcement actions are meaningful deterrents," said Senator Santorum. "As the father of six young children, I believe that programming that airs indecent material over the public airwaves is irresponsible, and I am glad that we have given the FCC the tools to better combat this issue."
