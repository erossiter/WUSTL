SENS. SANTORUM, CANTWELLL, MURRAY OFFER FRIENDLY WAGER IN ANTICIPATION OF SUPER BOWL XL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) has struck a friendly wager with Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) on the outcome of the 2006 Super Bowl between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Seattle Seahawks. The Senator whose team loses will provide a lunch of favorite food from their team's hometown. Sen. Santorum has offered up Clara's Pittsburgh Pierogies and Quaker Steak & Lube Wings while Sens. Cantwell and Murray are wagering smoked salmon, apples and coffee.  
   After finalizing the details of the wager Senator Santorum commented, "I want to congratulate the Seahawks on their first trip to the Super Bowl and their finest season yet. However, my hometown team, the Pittsburgh Steelers are back in familiar territory, making their sixth Super Bowl appearance. With four rings already in hand, this is definitely the year we get the one for the thumb. Go Steelers." 
   "The Steelers may have a few rings, but what they don't have is the 12th man. And it's that great Washington state spirit that will be with the Seahawks as they win big on Super Bowl Sunday," Senator Murray said. "I look forward to sampling some Pittsburgh hot-wings as the Seahawks taste victory in Detroit." 
   "The Seahawks have had an amazing season and fans have lived up to our legendary 12th man status," said Cantwell. "Getting to Super Bowl XL shows America what we've always known here in the Northwest: That the Seahawks should not be taken lightly. The Steelers are a formidable foe, but I'm putting my money on the Hawks. On February 6th, fans across the Northwest will be rewarded for 30 years of unwavering support and Pittsburgh's pierogies will be headed our way. I'm looking forward to heading to Detroit with the rest of the Seahawk's 12th man Traveling Squad next weekend. It's going be a great victory." 
   Super Bowl XL will be played in Detroit on Sunday, February 5, 2006 at 6 pm.
