SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES TELEWORK TAX INCENTIVE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced the Telework Tax Incentive Act, a bill that would provide a tax credit for employees who work from home.  
   "This legislation encourages employers to allow their employees to telecommute from home," said Senator Santorum. "With today's advanced technology, telework should be a part of the 21st century workplace. Forty percent of our nation's jobs are already compatible with telecommuting. It creates the best of all worlds for both employers and employees, giving working parents the flexibility to meet everyday demands. Plus, telecommuting has the added benefit of being good for the environment, as it reduces gas consumption and emissions." 
   The bill would provide a $500 tax credit for workers who "telecommute," or work from their home. The credit could be applied towards the purchase of equipment that facilitates such work, including printers, fax machines, or office furnishings. The credit could be taken by either the employer or the employee, whichever party absorbs the expense of setting up the at-home worksite. In order to be eligible for the tax credit, an employee must telework a minimum of 75 days per year. Additionally, the credit is prorated based on the number of months the employee teleworks. Senator Santorum previously cosponsored legislation that set up telecommuting pilot programs in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Houston and Denver. 
   "I am encouraged by the initial results of our pilot programs, as well as by the expansion of telework options within the federal agencies. Across the nation, forty million Americans telework each year. By providing a further incentive for workers to telecommute, we are maintaining worker productivity while dramatically improving quality of life both in and out of the office," said Senator Santorum.
