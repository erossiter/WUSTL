SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON COMPROMISE REACHED IN JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS DEBATE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement in response to the compromise reached on judicial nominations: 
   "Tonight, we saw a positive beginning in the process of voting on judicial nominees. I am pleased that highly-qualified nominees Brown, Pryor and Owen will finally be confirmed in the Senate. Although I am concerned that two nominees are not assured an up or down vote, this compromise is a step forward and all options are still on the table. As I have under Republican and Democratic presidents, I will continue to support an up or down vote for every judicial nominee."
