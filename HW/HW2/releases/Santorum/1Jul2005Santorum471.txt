SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON RETIREMENT OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE O'CONNOR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today offered remarks regarding Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  
   "Today's announcement of Justice O'Connor's retirement creates an opportunity to celebrate the tremendous contributions she has made to our country since joining the Supreme Court in 1981. Throughout her admirable service on the Court, Justice O'Connor has proven herself to be a strong defender of the Constitution. She has established a legacy of fairness and has sought pragmatic solutions to the most difficult problems the Court has faced. 
   "As Justice O'Connor steps down from the Supreme Court, we look back upon the last twenty-four years with great appreciation for her service and the extraordinary career of the nation's first female Supreme Court Justice. 
   "Justice O'Connor is not easily replaceable. I expect the President to nominate a highly qualified individual with the experience and intellect comparable to Justice O'Connor. The nominee should be open-minded, free of bias, and committed to applying the law as written. 
   "I look forward to participating in a fair confirmation process and hope to confirm a distinguished and highly qualified American to replace Justice O'Connor on the Court."
