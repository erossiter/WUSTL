SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR BEAVER COUNTY TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Transit Administration, has provided $331,927 for the Beaver County Transit Authority (BCTA). 
   "I am pleased that BCTA will invest this funding in providing new and efficient public transportation for Beaver County," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will allow for more commuter service between Beaver County and the Pittsburgh region." 
   This funding will enable BCTA to purchase one replacement commuter bus, and will partially fund the cost of a second bus. The buses currently in use have serviced Beaver County between 14 and 19 years. In addition to its fixed route throughout Beaver County, BCTA provides commuter service into Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Airport region. 
   "The citizens of Beaver County depend on the excellent transportation the Beaver County Transit Authority provides," Senator Specter said. "Replacing these buses is essential to ensuring service continues at the highest caliber and I applaud the Federal Transit Administration for providing this funding."
