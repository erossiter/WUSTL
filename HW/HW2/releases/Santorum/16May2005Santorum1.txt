SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON REVISED LANGUAGE ON TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S PROHIBITED ITEMS LIST
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today acknowledged that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) updated its prohibited items list so that new, unfilled lighters are allowed on checked luggage at U.S. airports.  
   On April 14, 2005, the TSA banned all lighters from the passenger cabins of aircraft. In response, Senator Santorum sent a letter to the TSA requesting a review of the prohibited items list and considers an exception for unfilled, new lighters. 
   "Effective today, the TSA will allow airline passengers to pack cigarette lighters without fuel in checked baggage," said Senator Santorum. "Prohibiting empty lighters on flights would have directly impacted a major manufacturer and employer in my home state. Zippo Manufacturing Company is one of the largest cigarette lighter manufacturers, employing 750 people in Bradford, McKean County. Many people purchase these signature lighters as souvenirs and gifts for friends and family while on vacation or traveling." 
   This revised prohibited items list clarifies that empty lighters, like the ones manufactured by Zippo, are not considered hazardous materials. New Zippo pocket lighters are always sold without fuel, and the lighter itself is not considered hazardous material.
