SEN. SANTORUM ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING RULING ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT BY DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on U.S. District Judge Richard Casey's ruling on the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003:  
   "While this ruling is a disappointment, it is not unexpected given the previous decisions by the Supreme Court. Judge Richard Casey believed he was bound by his duty to follow a previous Supreme Court decision. However, I give Judge Casey credit for allowing crucial and factual evidence to be submitted to the record and a healthy discussion of the facts to ensue. 
   "This case in New York has a very good record of evidence, which will ultimately be submitted to the Supreme Court for their reconsideration of a ban on partial birth abortion. I am pleased to see that Judge Casey confirmed what Congress established - that partial birth abortion is a 'gruesome, brutal, barbaric, and uncivilized medical procedure' and that partial birth abortions subject fetuses to severe pain. 
   "This case also brought to light a significant piece of information - that in no case 'could the Plaintiffs point to a specific patient or actual circumstance' in which partial birth abortion was 'necessary to protect a woman's health'. 
   "The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, passed overwhelmingly by the Congress and signed into law by President Bush in November of 2003, is a true act of compassion and bans a hideous procedure that has never been shown to be medically necessary to protect a woman's health. "I stand by my belief that this is a constitutional act. I know the Department of Justice will continue to work hard to defend this law and preserve and protect innocent life."
