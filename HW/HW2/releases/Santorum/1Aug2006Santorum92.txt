SEN. SANTORUM CELEBRATES SENATE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO HELP SECURE AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today praised Senate passage of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.  
   "I am very pleased that the Senate has passed this bipartisan bill that will help us lower gas prices and heating and cooling bills for American families and secure our energy independence. This bill will reduce our dependence on unstable foreign sources of oil and increase American natural gas and oil supply. S. 3711 directs new oil and gas leasing in 8.3 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico, an area containing an estimated 1.26 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The natural gas supply made available through this bill is enough to heat and cool nearly 6 million American homes for 15 years. As I have consistently stated throughout this debate, the only sure way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil is to develop affordable and reliable American energy resources," said Senator Santorum. 
   Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Senator Santorum has been a tireless advocate for lowering gas prices for all Americans and reducing our nation's reliance on foreign sources of oil. Senator Santorum championed the nation's first coal-to-liquid fuel plant, which will be located in Pennsylvania. This proven technology has the potential to significantly reduce our nation's dangerous and costly dependence on foreign oil. Senator Santorum also supported the Energy Policy Act (P.L. 109-58), which included numerous provisions to utilize biofuels and ethanol, as well as provide additional incentives for the utilization of hybrid automobiles. Senator Santorum has also worked aggressively to lower energy and natural gas prices faced by senior citizens and low-income Pennsylvanians through his work to secure funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).
