SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL GRANTS FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved additional grants for several fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   "I am pleased that local fire departments and emergency personnel have received this additional funding," said Senator Santorum. "It is essential that the brave first responders who provide safety to Pennsylvanians are prepared with the skills and equipment necessary to continue their fine work." 
   "I am pleased to see that the Department of Homeland Security has used these additional funds to benefit Pennsylvania's first responders," Senator Specter said. "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people. This funding will help assure that these fire companies are equipped with essential resources so they can continue to safeguard our communities." 
   This additional funding is part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's U.S. Fire Administration. The funds are to be used by the nation's firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations, fund firefighter health and safety programs, acquire new fire apparatus, support emergency medical service programs, and fund fire prevention and safety programs. 
   Since June of 2003, over 8,600 fire departments have received over $693 million from the 2003 Assistance to Firefighters Grant program. 
   The following Pennsylvania fire companies have received funding from the program: 
   * $225,000 for Community Fire Company, Landingville in Schuylkill County.
