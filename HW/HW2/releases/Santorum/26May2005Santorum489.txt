SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN, ANIMALS FROM POISONOUS AUTO PRODUCTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, is an original cosponsor of the Engine Coolant and Antifreeze Bittering Agent Act of 2005.  
 The legislation would require engine coolant and antifreeze manufacturers to add a bittering agent to their products to discourage ingestion of the sweet smelling auto products. 
   "As the father of six children and a dog owner, I understand the importance of protecting our loved ones from dangers that are found throughout our homes," said Senator Santorum. "Even a teaspoonful of these highly toxic substances can be fatal. I am proud to support this legislation which will prevent these tragic occurrences." 
   Hundreds of children and thousands of animals are accidentally poisoned each year from ingesting engine coolant and antifreeze, highly toxic subjects. Many of these tragedies could be prevented if just a few drops of an innocuous bittering agent called denatonium benzoate were added to the antifreeze. 
   The Engine Coolant and Antifreeze Bittering Agent Act of 2005 is sponsored by Senators George Allen (R-VA) and Mark Pryor (D-AR). Representatives Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and Gary Ackerman (D-NY) have introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.
