SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF PORT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on Senate passage of the H.R. 4954, the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006:  
   "I am pleased that the Senate has passed this important legislation. Ensuring the safety of all Americans is our most important job as elected officials, and I believe this is a critical step towards further securing our nation by addressing security issues at U.S. shipping ports and foreign ports. 
   "Among other things, the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 authorizes funding for port security grants, training and exercise programs to be distributed based on risk, as the 9/11 Commission has recommended. The bill will strengthen existing programs and create a new pilot project that will help to ensure that dangerous cargo is found before it even arrives in a U.S. port. Additionally, the bill contains an amendment which I cosponsored to include $3.5 billion for transit security over three years. I cosponsored this amendment because it is important to ensure that the millions of Americans who use public transportation every day are secure. The Madrid, London, and Mumbai bombings have shown that terrorists have focused on transit systems as a target. Because of this threat, I felt it was imperative that the Senate fund much needed transit security improvements."
