SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR NORTH SHORE CONNECTOR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that Congress has passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill which provides $55 million for the North Shore Connector project. 
   "I am very pleased to announce this funding with Senator Specter," said Senator Santorum. "This funding is essential to the economic renewal and revitalization along the Allegheny corridor. The light rail system is vitally important to connecting the heart of Pittsburgh to the North Shore area." 
   "This funding will be a tremendous benefit for the residents and businesses of Pittsburgh," Senator Specter said. "The North Shore Connector is indispensable because it will provide greater accessibility to parts of the city which will have a direct effect on the local economy." 
   This funding will be used to extend light rail from downtown Pittsburgh under the Allegheny River to the North Shore, which includes PNC Park and Heinz Field. Senator Santorum and Senator Specter have been actively working to secure funding for several years. Since fiscal year 1999, Senators Santorum and Specter have successfully secured $96 million for the North Shore Connector project. 
   The North Shore Connector will improve transit service in Allegheny County and aid new development projects, which include Alcoa's corporate headquarters, a 240-unit apartment complex, an expanded convention center and hotel, an office building, a new theatre, and a parking garage.
