SEN. SANTORUM CALLS FOR REMOVAL OF SYRIAN TROOPS FROM LEBANON
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement regarding Senate passage of Senate Resolution 77, which he introduced with Sens.  
 Sam Brownback (R-KS), George Allen (R-VA), Jim DeMint (R-SC), and Richard Burr (R-NC): 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate have supported this resolution which condemns all acts of terrorism in Lebanon and calls for the removal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Passage of this resolution is a reflection of our solidarity with the people of Lebanon in their quest for a truly democratic form of government. 
   "In 2003, President Bush signed the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, legislation that I introduced to authorize specific tools for the President to use against the Government of Syria to halt its support for terrorism and withdraw its armed forces from Lebanon. 
   "While President Bush has imposed two of the six different sanctions authorized by that Act, this most recent resolution urges the President to consider imposing additional sanctions on Syria. 
   "Terrorism is one of the most disruptive forces to peace in the Middle East and throughout the world. This resolution reflects our serious concerns about the role Syria plays in the Middle East and the world community. We have a responsibility to stop support for terrorism and hold those who are engaged in it accountable."
