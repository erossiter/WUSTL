SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LANDMARK BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION RULING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented today on the 50th Anniversary of the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court Brown v. Board of Education ruling:  
   "The anniversary of the landmark ruling of Brown v. Board of Education reminds us that it was only fifty years ago that there was a strong feeling in this country that children could be separated in schools because of their race. While a lot of progress has been made within our educational system, we have to keep in mind that the achievement gap is still a problem. We have a lot of work to do to ensure that Americans of all races receive the education they need, and have the opportunities that all Americans deserve to succeed in our society. 
   "The No Child Left Behind Act has proved to be a monumental step in transforming existing educational policy and focusing our educational priorities on achieving academic proficiency for all of our children. It directly targets those who are still not able to get the quality education they deserve so that they can achieve the economic success that every American has a right to."
