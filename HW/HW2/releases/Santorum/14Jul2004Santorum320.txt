  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, today announced that the Pennsylvania Department of Education has received a $1,491,600 State Program Improvement for Children with Disabilities Grant from the United States Department of Education. 
   "I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has presented this opportunity for private organizations to pair with public education institutions to provide children with disabilities with the most skilled and experienced teachers and administrators," said Senator Santorum. "The children of Pennsylvania are the future of the Commonwealth and it is imperative that we provide them with opportunities for a bright and prosperous future." 
   "Children with special needs deserve the most qualified teachers and administrators to help them meet each educational challenge," Senator Specter said. "I applaud the U.S. Department of Education for ensuring that Pennsylvania's disabled children will have access to the best teachers and educational opportunities available." 
   The grant will support local education agencies in providing effective practices that improve outcomes for all students, and professional development to ensure that all special education personnel are highly qualified. This funding will promote partnerships and collaboration through contracts developed between institutions of higher education, local education agencies, and parent training institutions.
