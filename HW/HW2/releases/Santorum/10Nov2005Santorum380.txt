SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES TERRORIST LOBBY DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2005
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, this week introduced the Terrorist Lobby Disclosure Act of 2005.  
   The bill requires Members of Congress and employees of the Legislative Branch to disclose, on a quarterly basis, any contacts with representatives or officials of governments that have been designated as state sponsors of international terrorism. The contacts must be reported to the U.S. Department of State, Secretary of the Senate, and the Clerk of the House of the Representatives. The Terrorist Lobby Disclosure Act of 2005 ensures that the congressional committees of oversight are also duly informed of these contacts. The bill does not prohibit these contacts; rather, it simply requires disclosure and transparency in the conduct of Members' and staff official duties. 
   "As we commit valuable human capital and resources to prosecute the Global War on Terror, we ought to know if Members of Congress or their staff are meeting with representatives of terrorist nations", said Senator Santorum. "The American people and those in our Armed Forces deserve to know if the individuals entrusted to protect our democracy are meeting with representatives of regimes that are actively opposed to America and her interests." 
   Iran, Syria, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan are the six governments that the U.S. Secretary of State has designated as state sponsors of international terrorism. These are governments that engage directly in terrorist activity; support terrorist groups by providing funding, arms, or other material support; or provide training, logistical support, sanctuary, or diplomatic facilities for terrorists.
