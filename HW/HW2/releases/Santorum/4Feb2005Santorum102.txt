SEN. SANTORUM REACTS TO LABOR DEPARTMENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today regarding economic growth and job creation:  
   "Economic figures released by the Department of Labor today indicate steady growth in the economy. 146,000 jobs were created during the month of January bringing the total number of jobs created since May 2003 to 2.7 million, resulting in 20 straight months of job gains. The national unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2%, the lowest rate since September 2001. At 5.2%, the unemployment rate is well below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s. 
   "I am pleased to see the economy continue to show a steady upward move. I look forward to working in the 109th Congress to create policies and launch initiatives that will help achieve further economic success for all Pennsylvanians. I will continue to work with President Bush and my colleagues in the United States Senate to push for pro-growth economic policies that create jobs, and I will continue to oppose tax increases that burden working families."
