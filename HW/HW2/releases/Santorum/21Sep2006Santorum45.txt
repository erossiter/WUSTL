SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO SECURE AMERICA'S ENERGY FUTURE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced groundbreaking legislation to decrease the United States' dependence on foreign oil.  
   "America is engaged in a war against Islamic fascism that involves major Middle East oil producers, and our energy dollars are fueling the enemy, threatening both our national and economic security," said Senator Santorum. "It is time that we make real investments in our nation's energy security. To achieve greater energy security and lower costs for consumers, we need to access all available American energy resources now and redouble our efforts to find other fuels to transition away from our dangerous and costly dependence on foreign oil and gas." 
   The Empower America Act: Securing America's Energy Future will put the United States on a path to energy security by: 
   * Investing more than $20 billion for research and development, loan guarantees, and grants to support the development and commercialization of renewable fuels, clean coal, nuclear, and advanced technology vehicles. 
   * Extending important tax incentives to encourage the production of renewable energy and alternative fuels and promote the use of hybrid vehicles. 
   * Allowing the environmentally sensitive production of domestic energy resources on the outer continental shelf and the coastal plain of ANWR. 
   * Encouraging the construction of new and the expansion of existing refineries, biorefineries, and coal-to-liquid facilities to meet the domestic motor fuels needs of today and tomorrow. 
   * Supporting conservation by giving new authority to modify fuel efficiency standards, incentivizing telecommuting, bolstering energy efficiency efforts, and undertaking an ambitious public information initiative. 
   "My legislation is a forward-looking and balanced approach to energy security that builds on the progress of the landmark Energy Policy Act of 2005, and emphasizes research into cutting-edge technologies, promotion of alternative fuels like ethanol and greater efficiencies across energy sectors," said Senator Santorum. 
   Approximately 17 percent of U.S. oil imports come from the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia is the number 3 supplier of petroleum to the U.S. Nearly two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves are located in the Middle East; 45 percent of reserves are located in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran.
