SEN. SANTORUM CALLS ON SEN. KERRY TO APOLOGIZE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement in response to recent comments made by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA):  
   "Senator Kerry owes an apology to every man and woman serving this country in Iraq, and to the families of the more than 2,800 American patriots who have given their lives in service to this nation. To suggest soldiers bravely serving their country are only doing so because they didn't 'make an effort to be smart' in school is deeply offensive. We are indebted to the service and sacrifice of those who wear the uniform, and John Kerry's demeaning comments are despicable."
