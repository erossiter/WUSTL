SENATOR SANTORUM NAMED 'HERO OF THE TAXPAYER'
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was recently presented with the 2006 "Hero of the Taxpayer" award by Americans for Tax Reform.  
   Americans for Tax Reform is a non-partisan coalition of taxpayers and taxpayer groups who work against increasing federal, state and local taxes. Americans for Tax Reform evaluates the voting record of each Member of Congress on critical legislation that will benefit taxpayers. The award is presented to Members of Congress whose voting record is determined to be taxpayer friendly. This is the eleventh time that Senator Santorum has received the award. 
   "I am honored to receive this award from Americans for Tax Reform," said Senator Santorum. "Americans work hard for their money, and they deserve to keep more of what they earn. While taxes are necessary for the administration of this country, I do not believe the government should inhibit the financial potential of our citizens. I am committed to the fight against raising taxes for hard working Americans."
