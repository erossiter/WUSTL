SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE PROJECTS IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the U.S. Senate has approved funding for defense-related projects in western Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill.  
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense and I am proud of the people and organizations that help to make our state a top competitor for defense projects that create jobs and strengthen our economy," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will enable these important defense projects in western Pennsylvania to move forward in the effort to achieve a more secure nation." 
   "A number of Pennsylvania companies are enhancing the way our Armed Forces operate," Senator Specter said. "These projects will go far in supporting the brave men and women who serve our country. I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate have recognized the valuable contribution these projects will make to our nation's defense." 
   Projects which have been approved to receive funding in western Pennsylvania include: 
    * $5 million for L3/Brashear in Allegheny County for the XM25 Advanced Airburst Weapon System, which is capable of firing 25mm air bursting ammunition and will be part of the next generation of infantry rifle system. Modeling of the system under simulated combat conditions indicates a fivefold increase in lethality over the weapons in current use; 
   * $2.5 million to SiMMtec, Inc. for Solid-State High-Output Diode Arrays in Allison Park, PA. The SiMM diode array is a new device that demonstrates superior performance over previous diode array designs and addresses known shortcomings; 
   * $1.9 million for Alcoa's Non-line of Sight Cannon (NLOS-C) and Mortar (NLOS-M). The objective of the Alcoa Collaborative Development Approach for Non-line of Sight Cannon (NLOS-C) and Mortar (NLOS-M) is to continue to develop, design, demonstrate, validate and implement a methodology that will enable incorporation of lightweight structural materials, optimized structural design and optimal integration of crew protection systems and structure. This program will cost- effectively address Department or Defense weight targets, performance requirements, and survivability criteria; 
   * $1.8 million for ALung Technologies Intravenous Membrane Oxygenator for research, development and clinical studies of the IMO. The technology could provide a valuable instrument for treating battlefield casualties of chemical and biological warfare, including inhalation anthrax; 
   * $1.75 million for National Tissue Engineering Center (NTEC) to fund the continuation of a broad-based research agenda including cell-based therapies, biomaterials, tissue engineering, medical devices, and artificial organs at the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative; 
   * $1.5 million for Lord Corporation in Erie County for an In-flight Propeller Balancing System (IPBS), which will develop and certify IPBS for the United States Air Force C-130 E and H series aircraft. Fleet implementation will decrease in-flight vibration levels by automatically and simultaneously balancing the four propellers, eliminate maintenance costs due to manual balancing by United States Air Force personnel, and provide increased aircraft availability and operational readiness; 
   * $1.5 million for the Vanadium Technology Program, of which Bear Metallurgical in Butler is a participant. Technological alternatives for certain steel applications utilizing greater vanadium content can reduce costs and improve readiness and the quality of weapons systems in our national security industrial base; 
   * $1 million for the Soldier Treatment Regeneration Consortium. This consortium will employ regenerative medicine techniques toward the development of advanced treatments for military applications. It will unite the clinical and research facilities of the nation's two leading regenerative medicine research institutes -- the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine (Pittsburgh, PA) and the Wake Forest University Regenerative Medicine Institute with the US Army's Institute for Surgical Research based at Fort Sam Houston; the San Antonio-based TRISAT trauma center collaborative; the Walter Reed Army Medical Center; and Tissue Genesis Inc., a developer of advanced bioreactor technology; 
   * $1 million for the University of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County for Vaccine Research in Biodefense and Emerging Infections Initiative. This project will focus on the development of new vaccines to protect against biological agents which pose a health risk to the U.S. population and are most easily weaponized for acts of bioterrorism, including the avian flu; 
   * $1 million for Trident Systems in Fayette County for Naval Special Warfare UUV Sensors and C2-STTR. This funding will facilitate the development of the system architecture for small Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV) capable of air delivery into mined littoral waters; 
   * $1 million for Eye See 360, Inc. in Pittsburgh for the Advanced Panoramic Sensor Systems to develop advanced visual imaging technologies and related sensor and computing technologies for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the Office of Naval Research; 
   * $500,000 to Morgan Advanced Materials and Technology in Elk and Potter Counties for Improved Self Sintered Silicon Carbide to Meet Body Armor Protection Requirements. This will complete the transition of self sintered Silicon Carbide components to meet the U.S. Army's small arms protection insert (SAPI) requirements. Funding will aid development of self-sintered material based on silicon carbide through weight management, crack damage management and geometric enhancements.
