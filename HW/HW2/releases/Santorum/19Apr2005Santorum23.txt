SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW POPE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement upon the announcement that German-born Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI, has been named the 265th Pope of the Catholic Church.  
   "This is a wonderful and historic day for the Catholic Church as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a holy and humble man who is a great thinker, leader and faithful servant of the Catholic Church, is selected to lead the Catholic Church as its Holy Father. 
   "Choosing the name Benedict, which means, 'Blessed One,' Pope Benedict XVI takes the name of Pope Benedict XV, who served as Pope during World War I and worked tirelessly for peace. 
   "I pray for Pope Benedict XVI as he begins his new role as the most reverent disciple of our Lord here on earth, and continues the work of former pontiffs to spread peace, unity, and respect for innocent life throughout the world. 
   "In his own words today, His Holiness called himself 'a simple, humble worker in God's vineyard.' I encourage all Catholics around the world to follow the example of our new Holy Father and work in that same vineyard as servants and disciples as we begin this new chapter in the Catholic Church."
