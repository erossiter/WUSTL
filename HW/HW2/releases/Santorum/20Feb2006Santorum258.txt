SEN. SANTORUM PRESENTS CITY OF PITTSBURGH WITH HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PEDESTRIAN TRAIL CONNECTING SOUTH SIDE WORKS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today presented a check to the City of Pittsburgh for $500,000 for the completion of the Pittsburgh Riverfront Trail system. The funding was included in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).  
   "Senator Specter and I have worked hard to bring funding to the area and we recognize the potential for the growth of the South Side. We have encouraged the efforts to redevelop what was once a mill site into a neighborhood that can sustain economic growth," said Senator Santorum. "The pedestrian trail will connect Tech Row and the South Side via the Hot Metal Bridge; this enhanced access between the two locations has the potential to generate more business for the South Side and promote commuter access to Tech Row." 
   In addition to this funding, Senator Santorum secured $300,000 in the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for the South Shore Riverfront Park. Senator Santorum has also been supportive of the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority's efforts and grant applications to revitalize the prime real estate of the South Side. The South Side Works and Riverfront Park projects are two examples of successful brownfield renewal. 
   "For those who bike to work or enjoy recreational riding, safety is a paramount concern," said Senator Specter. "The proposed enhancements to the Pittsburgh Riverfront Trail System ensure that bikers do not have to travel into busy city streets or highways. I am pleased to see this project proceed to the next level so this improved system can be made available to Pittsburgh residents."
