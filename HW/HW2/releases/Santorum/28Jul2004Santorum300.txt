SEN. SANTORUM PRESENTS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WARNER THEATRE IN ERIE COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, presented federal funding to the Warner Theatre Preservation Trust today.  
   Senator Santorum and Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) worked together to secure $75,000 for Erie's Warner Theatre, which is the last original unaltered Warner Brothers movie house left in the Untied States. The funding was secured through the FY 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill through HUD Economic Development Initiatives. First opened in April 1931, this theatre has been used continuously as a movie picture place, vaudeville house, or performing arts center for the greater Erie area. 
   "This theatre is the center for performing arts in the region and serves as an historical reminder of our nation's heritage of the performing and cinematic arts," said Senator Santorum. 
   Over the 73-year history of the theatre, the building has sustained significant structural damage, which needs to be repaired in order for the survival of this landmark. In 1994, the Warner Theatre Preservation Trust was formed to raise funds to restore and expand the theatre. It has succeeded in raising $13.8 million, which includes $9 million from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
   "Because of the national historical value of the theatre, we are greatly appreciative of Senator Santorum's and Senator Specter's work to secure this federal funding," said Barbara Hauck, executive Director of the Warner Theatre Preservation Trust.
