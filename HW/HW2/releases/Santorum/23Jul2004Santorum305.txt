SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE EIGHTH ROUND OF FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for several fire companies in Pennsylvania. 
   "This funding provides our first responders with the training they need to provide the communities of Pennsylvania with the best protection possible," said Senator Santorum. "It is important that local fire departments and emergency personnel are outfitted with the equipment, tools and skills they need to provide services and support to their communities in times of need." 
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help assure their protection as they safeguard our communities. I commend the Office of Domestic Preparedness for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services." These grants are the eighth round of funding from the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. Congress approved $750 million in direct assistance for the 2004 program to support firefighters throughout the country. 
   This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the U.S. Congress and ODP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs. 
   Grants have been approved for the following companies in Pennsylvania:
   * $72,540 for Winburne Volunteer Fire Company #1 in Clearfield County. 
   * $66, 294 for Shawnee Fire Company in Monroe County. 
   * $63,906 for Hershey Volunteer Fire Company in Dauphin County.
