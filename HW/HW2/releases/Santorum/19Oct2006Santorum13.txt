SEN. SANTORUM HONORED FOR HIS WORK TO PROTECT PENNSYLVANIA SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was recently named a "Guardian of Small Business" by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small-business advocacy group.  
   The NFIB awards the honor on the basis of each lawmaker's voting record on issues like tax relief, affordable health care, and liability and regulatory reform. This is the eighth time Senator Santorum has received this award, one time for each Congress since his election to the House of Representatives in 1990. 
   NFIB President and CEO Todd Stottlemyer praised Senator Santorum for "standing for small business," citing Senator Santorum's 88 percent NFIB voting record. In presenting the group's coveted "Guardian of Small Business" award, Stottlemyer said, "Small-business owners pay close attention to how their lawmakers vote on the issues affecting their businesses and employees and stand by those who stand for them." 
   "The record shows that Senator Santorum is a true champion of small business, having stood strong on the key small-business votes in the 109th Congress," said Stottlemyer. "This award reflects our members appreciation for supporting the NFIB pro-growth agenda for small business." 
   "I am honored to receive recognition from the National Federation of Independent Business," said Senator Santorum. "Small businesses are vital to the prosperity of our economy in Pennsylvania, and add so much to the character of our nation. It is essential that the government work to provide incentives that stimulate small business growth and work towards creating an environment that allows our nation's entrepreneurs to operate in a free marketplace, unfettered by overreaching government regulation."
