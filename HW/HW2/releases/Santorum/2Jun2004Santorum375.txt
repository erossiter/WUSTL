SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTH SHORE CONNECTOR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Transit Administration, has provided a New Start grant in the amount of $5,755,065 for the North Shore Connector Light Rail Transit Project. This announcement is a portion of nearly $10 million secured by Sens. Santorum and Specter in the FY04 omnibus appropriations bill. 
   The light rail system is vitally important in connecting the heart of Pittsburgh, the Golden Triangle, to the North Shore area. The North Shore Connector will improve transit service along the Allegheny corridor and aid new development projects, which include Pittsburgh's two new stadiums, Alcoa's corporate headquarters, a 240-unit apartment complex, an expanded convention center and hotel, an office building, a new theater, and a parking garage. 
   Since fiscal year 1999, Senators Santorum and Specter have successfully secured $41 million for the North Shore Connector project. 
   "This is significant funding which will build on the momentum of current development and expansion on the North Shore," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased the Federal Transit Administration granted this funding which will continue the economic renewal and revitalization along the Allegheny corridor." 
   "This funding will be a tremendous benefit for the residents and businesses of Pittsburgh," Senator Specter stated. "The North Shore Connector will provide greater accessibility to many parts of the city which will have a direct effect on the local economy."
