SEN. SANTORUM: UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made comments following a report released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics announcing a significant unemployment rate change in Pennsylvania:  
   "Pennsylvania's unemployment rate dropped to 4.9 percent from 5.4 percent in April, 2004. This means that 61,200 jobs have been created for Pennsylvanians in the past year. I am pleased that nearly 95 percent of all Pennsylvanians seeking employment have been successful. 
   "It is extremely important to me, in my role as your United States Senator, that I do all I can to enact policies and support initiatives that will help Pennsylvania create and maintain jobs. As I travel to all 67 Pennsylvania counties annually, I enjoy meeting residents and businesses to discuss federal legislation that will help local companies and communities in Pennsylvania acquire the capability to expand and grow."
