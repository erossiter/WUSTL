SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT HAS BECOME LAW
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented following President Bush signing the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 into law. This will create a Google-like search engine and database to track federal grants and contracts.  
   "As one of the first cosponsors of this legislation, I am pleased to announce that the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act has now become law. This will ensure that the federal government is accountable to the people it serves by giving Americans access to information about how their tax dollars are being spent," said Senator Santorum. 
   Senator Santorum was a cosponsor of S. 2590, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act. The bill requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish and maintain a single public website that lists all entities receiving federal funds, including the name of each entity, the amount of federal funds the entity has received annually by program, and the location of the entity.
