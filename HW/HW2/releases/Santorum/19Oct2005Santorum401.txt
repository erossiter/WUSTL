SEN. SANTORUM SUCCESSFULLY EXTENDS IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR PENNSYLVANIA DAIRY FARMERS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today announced an important milestone for the nation's dairy farmers. The Senate Agriculture Committee took a major step to extend the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program that expired at the end of September. If approved by the full Senate, the extension would run through 2007 when Congress plans to consider all major farm programs.  
   "As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I was pleased to be in a position to promote restoration of the MILC program in the budget reconciliation bill which the committee approved today," said Senator Santorum. "By an overwhelming vote of 6-14, the committee rejected an amendment that would have prevented my proposal to restore the program for the next two years. The committee had some hard financial choices to make to meet the budget proposal. MILC was in jeopardy, but I supported it vigorously during debate because the program is vital to Pennsylvania's dairy industry. I appreciate the leadership that Chairman Chambliss demonstrated in supporting my request that this program be restored." 
   "As a representative of the fourth largest dairy producing state in the nation, I am committed to fighting for the MILC provision as the legislative process continues on the Senate floor," continued Senator Santorum. 
   The MILC program supplements dairy producers during market downturns by providing dairy farmers with a compensatory payment whenever the minimum monthly market price of milk falls below a trigger price. Senator Santorum introduced S. 307, the MILC Extension Act, in February of 2005.
