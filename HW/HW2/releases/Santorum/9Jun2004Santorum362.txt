SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR READING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has approved funding for a Section 108 loan guarantee. 
   The City of Reading has been awarded a $1.5 million loan guarantee under Section 108 to provide funding assistance to KVP Falcon, a subsidiary of Summa Industries, Inc., to purchase machinery and equipment for its newly constructed facility in the Morgantown Road Industrial Park. 
   Section 108 provides public entities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large-scale physical development projects. This public investment is necessary to inspire private economic activity and the confidence that private firms need to invest in distressed areas, as well as provide initial resources. 
   "This funding provides an excellent opportunity for the private sector to make a specific contribution to the improvement and development of neighborhoods throughout the Reading community," said Senator Santorum. "It is encouraging that the Administration acknowledges the crucial relationship that can be fostered between Pennsylvania communities and local private industries." 
   "I am pleased that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided this funding to spur economic growth and development in Reading," Senator Specter said. "This public investment will help advance a public/private partnership that will improve the business environment and create jobs for the residents of eastern Pennsylvania."
