  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today attended a press conference at the U.S. Capitol with the Flight 93 Family Members who are urging Congress to support full funding for President Bush's $5 million budget request for land acquisition on behalf of the Flight 93 National Memorial. Senator Santorum expressed his support for the budget request. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), and Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA) also attended today's press conference. 
   "I am honored to stand here today in front of the U.S. Capitol Building - what we now know was the intended target of Flight 93 - with the family members of the heroes aboard Flight 93, and join them in encouraging Congress to fully support the budget request, so that construction of the Flight 93 National Memorial can soon begin," said Senator Santorum. "I will continue to work with my colleagues in the United States Congress to fully fund this request for the memorial's land acquisition. The heroes of Flight 93, and their families, deserve this memorial now, and it should not be held up any longer."
