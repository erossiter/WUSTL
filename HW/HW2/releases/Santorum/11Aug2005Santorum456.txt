SEN. SANTORUM, TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW PRAISE SONY MANUFACTURING FOR JOB CREATION IN SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today toured the Sony Technology Center in Mount Pleasant and participated in a roundtable discussion on the economy and job growth in southwestern Pennsylvania. Sen. Santorum was joined by U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow; Hideki (Dick) Komiyama, President and Chief Operating Officer, Sony Electronics Inc.; Chuck Gregory, President, Sony Technology Center - Pittsburgh; Michael L. Koff, Senior Manager, Corporate Communications and External Affairs, Sony Technology Center - Pittsburgh; and Sean Lydon, Director of Supply Chain Systems, Sony Technology Center - Pittsburgh.  
   "I am pleased that Secretary Snow is here to join me today in recognizing the role Sony has played in retaining and creating jobs in southwestern Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "Sony is a manufacturing success story in Pennsylvania and I have introduced legislation to help Sony keep jobs in our state and remain a top competitor in the global market." 
   In both the 108th Congress and the 109th Congress, Senator Santorum introduced legislation designed to temporarily suspend duties imposed on imports of certain television assemblies and components, as well as improve the ability of the Sony manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant to stay globally competitive as a manufacturer of advanced display televisions. Currently, key components that are used to manufacture these televisions in the U.S. face a tariff when imported into America. This adds to the price of the product and places it at a competitive disadvantage versus foreign manufactured TVs. 
   "I sent a letter to Secretary Snow inviting him to the Sony Technology Center in Mount Pleasant to see first hand the importance of providing temporary duty relief for the importation specifically of television assemblies and components," said Senator Santorum. "There is a fledgling business of manufacturing advanced display televisions in the U.S. in danger of a premature collapse. Duty suspension for these television components will provide a sustaining incentive to maintain and grow domestic production." 
   The four duty suspension bills provide the following: 
   * The temporary Duty Suspension for Liquid Crystal Device Panel Assemblies for Liquid Crystal Device Projection Type Televisions. 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Liquid Crystal Device Panel Assemblies for Liquid Crystal Device Direct View Televisions. 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Plasma Flat Panel Assemblies for Televisions. 
   * Temporary Duty Suspension for Electron Guns for High Definition Cathode Ray Tubes for Televisions.
