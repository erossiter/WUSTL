SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES CONSERVATION INNOVATION GRANTS FOR PENNSYLVANIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced this week that the Department of Agriculture has awarded Conservation Innovation Grants for two Pennsylvania projects.  
   "I am pleased that The Rodale Institute and the Pennsylvania Environmental Council have received this funding so they may begin their efforts to develop and implement promising new technologies," Santorum stated. "These innovative projects are important to help Pennsylvania farmers continue to protect the environment." 
   This funding was allocated to further the development and adoption of innovative conservation technologies and approaches through new projects and research. The Rodale Institute and Pennsylvania Environmental Council address issues such as agricultural air emissions, water quality improvement, water management, livestock nutrient management and market-based approaches to conservation. 
   Conservation Innovations Grants have been awarded to the following Pennsylvania environmental projects: 
   * $939,734 for Pennsylvania Environmental Council for designing, evaluating, and implementing a market-based system for delivery of conservation practice funding. 
   * $541,050 for The Rodale Institute for No-Till Plus, a one-pass cover roller/planter system that can reduce or eliminate herbicide and chemical fertilizer use on most no-till acres.
