SEN. SANTORUM DEFENDS PENNSYLVANIA BASES AT BRAC REGIONAL HEARING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today testified before the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) on behalf of Pennsylvania's military installations.  
   Senator Santorum was part of the Pennsylvania delegation including Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), and Governor Rendell who testified at the BRAC Commission Regional Hearing on behalf of Pennsylvania's military installations. 
   "I have been working hard with Senator Specter and Governor Rendell to defend our bases in Pennsylvania. Local officials and communities have been very supportive of their bases, and I am hopeful that the BRAC commission takes into consideration all of the information presented to them at today's hearing and we receive positive news as a result of our cooperative efforts," said Senator Santorum. 
   On May 13, 2005, the Department of Defense released its recommended list of bases for closure or realignment, which if approved by the BRAC Commission, would result in a net loss of over 1,800 Pennsylvania jobs. During the past four BRAC rounds ('88, '91, '93, '95) Pennsylvania has lost over 3,000 military positions and over 13,000 civilian positions. There are thirteen military installations in Pennsylvania that are recommended for closure by the Department of Defense.
