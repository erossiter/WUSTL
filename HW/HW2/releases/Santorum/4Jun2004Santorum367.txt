SEN. SANTORUM RECEIVES AWARD FROM NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, received the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2003 Legislator of the Year Award for his support of legislation to help thousands of Americans afflicted with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).  
   Senator Santorum was presented with a resolution and an award yesterday at a recognition event in Washington, DC. 
   The resolution recognized Santorum's work in securing a provision in the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003, which aims to correct the Medicare coverage inequity facing thousands of people on Medicare who receive and benefit from MS therapies. Santorum was also acknowledged for his active role in supporting the overall Medicare prescription drug benefit; his support for funding increases for the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and for cosponsoring the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to help many Medicare beneficiaries living in rural areas get the medical attention they need, including those who have MS. 
   "We are pleased to recognize the dedication of Senator Santorum on behalf of people with Multiple Sclerosis and other disabilities," said President and CEO for National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Mike Dugan. "His efforts in championing legislation to rectify the Medicare inequities are deeply appreciated by all who depend on Medicare coverage." 
   "I am honored to receive this award from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society," said Senator Santorum. "Those suffering with Multiple Sclerosis should not have to worry about getting the therapies and care they need to help them live day-to-day. I will continue to be a voice for the more than 400,000 Americans living with this debilitating disease."
