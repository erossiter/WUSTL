SENS. SANTORUM, ALLARD OFFER FRIENDLY WAGERS IN ANTICIPATION OF AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
  Sens. Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Wayne Allard (R-CO) have struck a friendly wager on the outcome of the 2006 AFC title game between the Pittsburgh Steelers (13-5) and the Denver Broncos (14-3).  
 The senator whose team loses will provide a lunch of favorite food from his team's hometown. Sen. Santorum has offered up Quaker Steak and Lube Wings and Sen. Allard is wagering Rocky Mountain Rib Eye Steaks. 
   "The Steelers defense, Big Ben and the Bus are just hitting their stride. Denver's nothing but a pit stop on the road to Detroit," said Senator Santorum. "Senator Allard should know that I like my steak Pittsburgh rare." 
   Allard said, "I'm making this bet because Senator Santorum and I are old, old friends. We were in the same "class" when we were first elected to the U.S. House, and I have supported him for a number of leadership positions. I watched the Steelers game last Sunday and they looked a little overweight, like they might run out of gas at our high altitude. I predict that our leaner, meaner Broncos will win in the 4th quarter." 
   The AFC Championship game will be played in Denver on Sunday, January 22nd, 2006 at 3 pm.
