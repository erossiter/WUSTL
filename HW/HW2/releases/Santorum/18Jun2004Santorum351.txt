SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PENNSYLVANIA JOB CREATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH
 Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement in reaction to this morning's U.S. Department of Labor announcement that 10,700 jobs were created in Pennsylvania in May.  
 The Commonwealth's unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, a decrease from 5.3% in April. 
   "An unemployment rate of 5.1 percent is a sign to the rest of the country that Pennsylvania businesses continue to prosper, and that President Bush's policies are working," said Senator Santorum. "We're seeing solid job growth in areas like manufacturing, which is vital to the Commonwealth's economy." 
   Pennsylvania's job growth is reflective of the expansion reported across the country. Nationally, 248,000 new jobs were created in May according to the payroll survey, and nearly one million new jobs have been created in the last 100 days alone. Pennsylvania's economy has added 44,000 payroll jobs in the past three months. 
   "Over the past three years, our nation's economy, as well as Pennsylvania's economy, has faced serious challenges, including a recession and terrorist attacks," said Senator Santorum. "But through it all, with President Bush's economic leadership, our economy has strengthened and continues to grow." 
   "I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
