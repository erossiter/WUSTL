SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF WELFARE REAUTHORIZATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made a statement following the Senate Finance Committee's approval of the Welfare Reform Reauthorization bill.  
 The Santorum Amendment, which establishes increased funding levels for responsible fatherhood, social services, and childcare, was included in the final version of the bill. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues on the Finance Committee have approved the Welfare Reauthorization bill, and I applaud efforts to continue moving this bill forward to final passage in the Senate. Since the 1996 welfare reform, welfare caseloads have been reduced by more than half. Building on these past successes, the time is long overdue to renew this critical program. 
   "We must help families increase earnings and raise their standard of living by increasing work opportunities, promoting healthy families and responsible fatherhood, and encouraging those who remain on welfare into the workforce. 
   "I am pleased that my amendment was accepted, which includes additional funding for the Responsible Fatherhood Initiative, which I have been working on with Senators Evan Bayh (D-IL) and Pete Domenici (R-NM). This important initiative complements efforts to promote healthy marriages and the well-being of children. My amendment includes a provision that will begin to restore the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funding with a $1 billion increase over five years. Additionally, the amendment would also increase funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) by an additional $1 billion over the next five years."
