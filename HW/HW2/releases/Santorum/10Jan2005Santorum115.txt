SEN. SANTORUM ATTENDS 2005 FARM SHOW IN HARRISBURG
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today participated in the Open Beef Cattle Judging Contest and met with members of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau while attending the 2005 Farm Show at the Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg.  
   "Each year I look forward to the Annual Pennsylvania Farm Show; it is a great example of some of the most valued aspects of our Pennsylvania culture - family, community, agriculture, and good food," said Senator Santorum. 
   Senator Santorum represents Pennsylvania's farming and agriculture community and interests while serving as a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee in the 109th Congress. He is also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade issues important to the farming industry, and the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus. 
   "During my tenure in the Senate I have led the fight to create the Farmland Preservation Program, through which Pennsylvania has already received more than $12 million, allowing for the protection and preservation of more than 13,000 acres of farmland," said Senator Santorum. "I am committed to continue working with my colleagues on issues that are important to Pennsylvania's rural communities - such as ensuring strong markets and fair prices for farmers and family access to quality health care."
