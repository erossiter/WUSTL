SEN. SANTORUM SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO ASSIST DISABLED VETERANS GAIN EMPLOYMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced the Disabled Veterans Fellowship Act of 2006, legislation that would establish a fellowship program for the congressional hiring of disabled veterans as legislative fellows.  
   The Disabled Veterans Fellowship Act of 2006 would establish a program to encourage the offices of Members of Congress, committee offices, and leadership offices to hire disabled veterans for temporary staff positions. 
   "The men and women returning from the line of duty fought bravely to protect our nation and bring freedom and democracy to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan - they deserve a seamless transition to civilian status," said Senator Santorum. "Securing employment can be difficult for returning vets, which is why I feel it is so important to design a program that will help disabled veterans acquire new skills for work." 
   The unemployment rate of veterans ages twenty to twenty-four years old is over 15% -- nearly twice the rate of their non-veteran peers. 
   "The Department of Veterans Affairs has many great programs to help disabled veterans in their search for employment - but I believe that more needs to be done," said Senator Santorum.
