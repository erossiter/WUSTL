SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR TRACKLESS TROLLEY IN PHILADELPHIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Transit Administration, has provided $990,029 to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) for the engineering, design, and acquisition of two trackless trolleys. 
   "It is important that we continue to grow and expand Philadelphia's mass transportation facilities. This funding will provide safety, accessibility and structural improvements, which will increase commuter comfort and usability," said Senator Santorum. 
   The new trackless trolleys will replace currently used trolleys that are 24 years old. SEPTA plans to replace 50 of the current trolleys. The funding announced today will fund the engineering, design, and replacement of two of those 50. 
   The replacement of these trolleys will enable SEPTA to incorporate current technology and proven components, along with passenger amenities to ensure overall safety, security and passenger comfort. 
   Philadelphia was the first city to regularly operate "trackless trolleys." Primitive trackless trolleys were first introduced in 1923, on Oregon Avenue in South Philadelphia. 
   "Trackless trolleys are a great alternative to buses, providing the same services with less air and noise pollution," Senator Specter said. "These trolleys are vital to the growth and quality of life in Philadelphia, and I applaud the Federal Transit Administration for providing funding for SEPTA to upgrade this tremendous transit system."
