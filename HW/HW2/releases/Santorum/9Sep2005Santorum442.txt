SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   "We rely on our local and volunteer firefighters to be the first responders in times of crisis and unfortunate catastrophes," said Senator Santorum. "It is important that local fire departments and emergency personnel are outfitted with the equipment, tools, and skills they need to ensure the safety and security of Pennsylvanians during times of need." 
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help assure their protection as they safeguard our communities. I commend the Department of Homeland Security for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services."
