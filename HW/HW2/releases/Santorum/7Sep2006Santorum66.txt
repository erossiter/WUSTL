SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HAZLETON INTERMODAL BUS TERMINAL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has awarded a grant in the amount of $1,802,790 to Hazleton Public Transit (HPT) for the construction of the Hazleton Intermodal Bus Terminal.  
   "I am pleased that Hazleton has received this important grant from the FTA," said Senator Santorum. "The Intermodal Bus Terminal will foster Mayor Barletta's vision for further economic growth in Hazleton and is another positive step toward stimulating the local economy and creating jobs. This, in addition to the Markle Building and Pine Street Neighborhood, is one of the key projects I have supported in Hazleton." 
   Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Senator Santorum has helped to secure more than $7 million for the Hazleton Intermodal, including $1.4 million in the Senate Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), a transportation funding authorization bill. 
   The Hazleton Intermodal Bus Terminal, located on Broad Street (State Route 309) between Mine Street and West Chestnut Street, will serve Hazleton Public Transit and Susquehanna and Capital Trailways, in addition to providing space for a sales office, waiting area for customers, multi-purpose meeting rooms, administrative offices, public restrooms, and a multi-level parking garage.
