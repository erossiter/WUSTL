SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP END HOMELESSNESS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced a bill to reauthorize the Interagency Council on Homelessness for two additional years.  
 The current authorization is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2005. 
   "Based on current information, there are far too many people who are suffering from homelessness," Senator Santorum said. "The Interagency Council on Homelessness is an important assembly of agencies which provide needed services to homeless individuals and families as well as prevention efforts. We must all work together to ensure the well-being and safety of those who are suffering and do not have a place to call home." 
   The Interagency Council on Homelessness was established in 1987. It is made up of 18 federal agencies and works to better coordinate the nation's response to homelessness. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs are heavily involved with leading the Administration's efforts to prevent, and ultimately end, chronic homelessness. 
   The Interagency Council on Homelessness is responsible for providing federal leadership to assist homeless families and individuals. The major activities of the Council include planning and coordinating activities and programs to assist homeless people, monitoring and evaluating assistance to homeless persons provided by all levels of government and the private sector, and disseminating information on federal resources available to assist the homeless individuals and families.
