SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF PENNSYLVANIA WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved federal funding for Pennsylvania projects contained in the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. 
   "While Pennsylvania's rivers provide transit that is essential to our local economies, without proper protection they also bring devastating floods to many Pennsylvania communities, as we saw at the end of June," said Senator Santorum. "This federal funding is crucial to helping communities build the protection they need, as well as maintain local economies."  
   "I am pleased my colleagues have provided this funding for these important projects throughout Pennsylvania," Senator Specter said. "These projects will enhance the lives of community residents in a variety of ways, including maintaining the ports in Philadelphia, protecting residents from floods and protecting our essential locks and dams system." 
   The Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill will now await action by the full Senate. 
   Projects contained in today's announcement include: 
   * $51 million for Locks and Dams 2, 3, and 4, Monongahela River in Allegheny County for rehabilitation. The nearly century-old locks and dams are the last of the old and undersized locks on the Monongahela River system and are structurally unstable. There is a substantial chance that important structural components of these facilities could fail at any time which could devastate water supplies to communities and vital industries, as well as stalling commerce through the Port of Pittsburgh; 
   * $17.909 million for the Philadelphia to the Sea dredging project to maintain the navigational depths of the Delaware River; 
   * $15 million for Emsworth Locks and Dams, Ohio River in Allegheny County for rehabilitation. The proposed project includes replacement of the dam gates, gate hoisting machinery, electrical power and distribution system; 
   * $5.6 million for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which has been ongoing since Tropical Storm Agnes caused widespread flooding in 1972. In January 1996, floods nearly breached the levee system, forcing emergency officials to evacuate more than 100,000 people. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and the community suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage. This project has provided Agnes-level protection since 2003 and was vital to protecting the community of Wilkes-Barre during the flooding this week; 
   * $2.5 million for the Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project. The existing 40-foot deep channel restricts the efficient movement of tankers, dry bulk carriers and container vessels. The 45-foot deepening project will result in transportation savings to commodities consisting of crude oil imports, iron ore imports, and scrap exports; 
   * $2.5 million for the Upper Ohio River Navigation Study of Emsworth, Dashields, Montgomery Locks and Dams in Allegheny County to continue a long-term feasibility study on the three aged structures; 
   * $950,000 for the Schuylkill River dredging project to maintain navigational channel depths on the Schuylkill River; 
   * $620,000 for the Presque Isle Pennisula for maintenance of the beaches, periodic repair and replenishment of the beach sand; 
   * $250,000 for the Delaware River Deepening Dredged Material Utilization in carrying out the 45-foot deepening project. This will result in transportation savings to commodities consisting of crude oil imports, iron ore imports, container ship movements and scrap exports; 
   * $250,000 for the Philadelphia to Trenton to maintain navigational channel depths and provide turning basins on the Delaware River; 
   * $175,000 for the Delaware River Basin comprehensive feasibility study investigating possible measures to improve flood plain management and flood damage protection; 
   * $100,000 for the Schuylkill River Basin, Wissahickon Creek feasibility study investigating possible measures for flood control, ecosystem restoration and water quality.
