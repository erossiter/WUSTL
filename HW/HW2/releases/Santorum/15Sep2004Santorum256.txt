SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR OPERATION SAFE STREETS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $230,000 for "Operation Safe Streets," a major Philadelphia crime prevention effort. 
   "I am pleased that 'Operation Safe Streets' has received funding that will allow this important program to continue their efforts to prevent crime and drug use on the streets of Philadelphia," Santorum stated. 
   "Shutting down drug markets in the City is essential to saving lives and preventing violent crime," Senator Specter said. "I am pleased my colleagues have approved this funding that will put more police on the streets to protect Philadelphia's communities." 
   "Operation Safe Streets" targets open-air drug markets operating near economically disadvantaged areas across the city, and seeks to insert Philadelphia police into these areas and permanently close down the markets. 
   Senators Specter and Santorum were previously successful in securing $500,000 for the program in the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. 
   The funding level, part of the Commerce/Justice/State appropriations bill, is pending final passage by both chambers of Congress and the President's approval.
