SEN. SANTORUM URGES BUSH TO FULLY FUND AMTRAK
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today sent a letter to President Bush regarding his request for the President's support of Amtrak in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 budget.  
   Senator Santorum sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Joshua Bolten in November 2005 outlining reasons for supporting Amtrak in the FY 2007 Presidential Budget Request and Amtrak's importance to Pennsylvanians. Senator Santorum noted that the response he received from Director Bolten was "less than adequate" and requested that President Bush include an Amtrak funding request that sufficiently meets the capital and operational needs of the railway. 
   Senator Santorum emphasized the importance of Amtrak to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Keystone Corridor between New York, Philadelphia, and Harrisburg experienced a nearly 20 percent increase in ridership in the last year, and the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia recently became Amtrak's second-busiest station, with over 3.7 million boardings in FY05. 
   "While I recognize the importance of reforming Amtrak and transforming it into a profitable railway, I do not believe this is a time when the federal government should abandon Amtrak," Senator Santorum stated in the letter. "I do not believe that we can allow Amtrak to wither on the vine by under funding its important service to my constituents and the nation."
