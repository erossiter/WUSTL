SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA EDUCATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, announced federal funding for projects in northwestern Pennsylvania, contained in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "This funding will help to maintain and increase the high standards set in education throughout northwestern Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "The world of education is moving forward at a rapid pace with new technology being introduced into classrooms virtually everyday. With funding like this, the goal is to provide all Pennsylvanians with a modern, quality education." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues have approved funding for these important northwestern Pennsylvania projects," Senator Specter said. "Education is the single greatest capital investment we can make in our nation's future, and this funding will provide resources that will empower students to become more productive members of society, live happier lives and make incredible contributions to our country." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature.
