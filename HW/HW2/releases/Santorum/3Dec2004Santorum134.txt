SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON GROWING ECONOMY, JOB GAINS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today regarding economic growth and job creation:  
   "Economic figures released today by the Department of Labor show a growing economy; 112,000 jobs were created in the month of November bringing the total number of jobs created since August of last year to 2.4 million. The result is 15 straight months of job gains. 
   "The President remains committed to moving our economy forward through a pro-growth economic agenda. As we approach the 109th Congress, I look forward to working with President Bush and my colleagues in the United States Senate to reform the tax code to make it simpler and fairer. Republicans have a plan to provide tax relief that will create incentives for small businesses, promote home ownership, and allow families to plan for the future. 
   "Stable jobs, strong businesses and industries, and consumer confidence all have key roles to play in maintaining America's powerful economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
