SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING TO COMBAT YOUTH VIOLENCE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today were in Philadelphia to announce federal funding to combat youth violence. The funding will assist the City of Philadelphia's Youth Violence Reduction Partnership and was contained in the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. 
   Also attending today's announcement was Philadelphia Mayor John Street, District Attorney Lynne Abraham, Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson and U.S. Attorney Patrick Meehan. 
   "As the father of six children I am committed to ensuring the safety of children throughout Pennsylvania. I am pleased to announce $1.25 million for Philadelphia to continue the fight to reduce youth violence," said Senator Santorum. "Senator Specter and I fought hard to make sure critical funding to help provide a brighter future for Pennsylvania's youth would be available to the City of Philadelphia's Youth Violence Reduction Partnership." 
   The City of Philadelphia Youth Violence Reduction Partnership provides youth at high risk of committing homicide or being victimized with intensive services designed to divert them away from violence and toward productive adulthood. In 1999, the City of Philadelphia created this initiative as a collaborative endeavor involving the police, the district attorney's office, and the adult and juvenile probation bureaucracies. Specifically, the program provides adjudicated offenders between the ages of 14 to 24 supervision, counseling, remedial education classes and job-placement assistance.
