SEN. SANTORUM MAKES STATEMENT FOLLOWING NEWS OF DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement:  
   "Today the world has lost one of its great leaders, former President Ronald Reagan. President Reagan was an optimist, who believed that America's best days were always ahead of her. President Reagan believed that the greatness of America was in its people. President Reagan always stood up for what he believed in, even when it was not popular." 
   "I believe his main legacy will be defeating the Soviet Union and helping to win the Cold War. His famous speech in front of the Berlin Wall, in which he ordered Mr. Gorbachev to 'tear down this wall,' will never be forgotten; the former President's foreign policy helped liberate all of Eastern Europe." 
   "While I'm deeply saddened to learn of his death, this is a chance to reflect on the qualities that Ronald Reagan stood for: his character and conviction not only changed the course of this country, but changed the course of the world." 
   "Karen and I offer our condolences to Mrs. Reagan and her family during this difficult time."
