SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON TRANSITION OF AUTHORITY IN IRAQ
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today upon the transition of authority in Iraq to an Iraqi Interim Government:  
   "Today is an historic day for the people of Iraq and for all those who worked to speed the transition of Iraq to a more democratic form of government. 
   "President Bush's plan called for the transition of authority and sovereignty to the people of Iraq - and that promise was kept. After years of despotic rule under Saddam Hussein, the nation of Iraq has moved one step closer to becoming a free and democratic nation. 
   "The hard work of our men and women in uniform serving in Iraq has resulted in the removal of a threat to the United States and to the Middle East. Together with Coalition Forces, U.S. troops have invested time and effort training security and defense forces in Iraq to take over the responsibility of protecting the Iraqi people. This transition could not have occurred without the leadership and direction of U.S. and Coalition Forces. 
   "This transition is essential in the process of establishing both a permanent constitution and democratic government in Iraq. While U.S. and Coalition Forces will maintain a military presence in Iraq for a period of time, I am confident that the interim government, led by Prime Minister Allawi, will continue efforts to steer Iraq towards a system of government that will serve as the foundation for a free, strong Iraq."
