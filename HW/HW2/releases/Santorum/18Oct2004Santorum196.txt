SEN. SANTORUM PRESENTS YOUNG PENNSYLVANIANS WITH CONGRESSIONAL AWARD
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today recognized more than 100 students from Dauphin, Lancaster, Bucks, Montgomery, Philadelphia, Delaware, and Chester counties, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia with the Congressional Award.  
   Any young person between the ages of 14 and 23 may apply to the non-partisan and voluntary Congressional Award program. Through the Congressional Award program, young Pennsylvanians work with an advisor to set goals in order to achieve guidelines detailed by the Congressional Award organization. 
   A participant must complete a number of hours in each of the following program areas: volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration. The Award, in the form of a certificate or medal, acknowledges a youth's commitment and fulfillment of goals set in the four program areas. 
   "These students here today represent the future of Pennsylvania; they have shown their commitment to self-improvement, development, and growth, through involvement and volunteerism in the community," said Santorum. "It is important to note that these young people did not achieve their goals alone, they did it with the guidance, encouragement, and love of caring parents, teachers, adult volunteers, and club leaders." 
   Sue Serio of FOX 29 WTXF News in Philadelphia served as the Mistress of Ceremonies, introducing the Senator and the medal recipients. Richard Stengel, President and CEO of the National Constitution Center, also joined the Senator. 
   Doug Farber, Grade 11 at Abington High School in Montgomery County who was presented with the Bronze Congressional Award Medal, said, "Through my service working toward the Congressional Award Medal, I have learned what it is like to manage a job, school work, and my other commitments. I have gained a sense of responsibility - I learned to meet deadlines and I have a sense of what it is like to give back to the community. I got so much out of participating in this programming including personal credibility and the feeling that I was able to use my skills to give back to the community. This has been a great self improvement experience and a wonderful opportunity to try new things."
