SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, JOB CREATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today regarding economic growth and job creation:  
   "Economic figures released today by the Department of Labor show a robust and growing economy. 337,000 jobs were created in the month of October bringing the total number of jobs created since August of last year to 2.4 million, resulting in 14 straight months of job gains. 
   "The President remains committed to moving our economy forward through a pro-growth economic agenda. I look forward to working with President Bush and my colleagues in the United States Senate to reform the tax code to make it simple and fair and to provide tax relief through the creation of opportunity zones and other incentives to attract new businesses, improve housing, spur job training, and enrich communities that have lost jobs with high-tech infrastructure. Furthermore, it is important that Congress enable more individuals to participate in job training programs and provide funding for community colleges in order to help workers find better, higher-paying jobs. 
   "Stable jobs, strong businesses and industries, and consumer confidence all have key roles to play in maintaining America's powerful economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
