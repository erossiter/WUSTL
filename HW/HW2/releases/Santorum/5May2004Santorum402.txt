SEN. SANTORUM HONORS HISPANIC AMERICANS ON CINCO DE MAYO
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, honors Hispanic Americans today on the Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo.  
   "Hispanic Americans have made important contributions to our nation's economy and defense," said Senator Santorum. "Their celebration of diversity continues to enrich and strengthen American culture." 
   The holiday of Cinco de Mayo, (Spanish for The Fifth Of May), commemorates the victory of the Mexicans over the French army at The Battle of Puebla in 1862. It is primarily a regional holiday celebrated in the Mexican state capital city of Puebla and throughout the state of Puebla, but is also celebrated in other parts of the country and in U.S. cities with a significant Mexican population. 
   Cinco de Mayo is sometimes confused with Mexican Independence Day (September 16), which commemorates the anniversary of the day in 1810 when Mexico declared its independence from Spain. 
   "Cinco de Mayo is a special holiday for Hispanic Americans," said Senator Santorum. "We have many important family, cultural and commercial ties with our neighbors in Mexico. I am pleased to send my warmest regards to all those celebrating Cinco de Mayo in Pennsylvania, and throughout the United States."
