SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER REQUEST FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR FIVE ADDITIONAL COUNTIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, today wrote President Bush requesting his aid in providing federal assistance to an additional five Pennsylvania counties ravaged by Tropical Depression Ivan. 
   The letter today supplements previous letters requesting assistance for forty-two counties in Pennsylvania. The five additional counties in today's letter are: Franklin, Tioga, Lebanon, Montour and York. 
   President Bush this week declared a major disaster for nineteen counties in Pennsylvania. Counties included in the declaration are: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Indiana, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lycoming, Northampton, Perry, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Washington, Westmoreland and Wyoming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is currently assessing the damage of the remaining twenty-eight counties that have yet to be made part of the President's declaration. By declaring a major disaster for Pennsylvania, President Bush enables affected residents to be eligible for federal assistance that can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration may also be available to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance.
