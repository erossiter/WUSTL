SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR PENN STATE PUBLIC BROADCASTING TO DEVELOP KEYSTONE DIGITAL EDUCATION PILOT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has awarded a $456,383 grant to Penn State Public Broadcasting for use in developing the Keystone Digital Education Pilot.  
   "I am pleased that this grant has been awarded to Penn State Public Broadcasting," said Senator Santorum. "The Keystone Digital Education Pilot is an important initiative that will greatly expand materials available to teachers. Educators in many Pennsylvania classrooms, particularly in rural areas, will have access to educational and multimedia materials and many other resources, all available through a website designed for their use." 
   The grant for the Penn State Public Broadcasting (WPSU-TV), in partnership with public television station WLVT-TV in Bethlehem and the Pennsylvania Department of Education, will be used to develop the Keystone Digital Education Pilot, a model for a statewide educational website for teachers. The initiative seeks to bring digital, multimedia materials and video-on-demand services to the classroom. 
   WPSU and WLVT will construct a digital, K-12 education web portal to 125 predominantly rural school districts. The web portal content will be available free-of-charge for school districts and public broadcasting entities and will be aligned to state standards.
