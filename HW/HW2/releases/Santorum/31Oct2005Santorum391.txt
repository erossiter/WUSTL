SEN. SANTORUM URGES SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ON HOME HEATING COSTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today sent a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Sen.  
 Gordon Smith (R-OR), regarding the increasing costs of home heating. 
   In the letter, Senator Santorum urged Senator Smith to hold a committee hearing to examine the steps companies are taking and what initiatives they are exploring to help alleviate burdensome home heating increases for America's elderly consumers. 
   "Constituents in many of our states are worried about how they are going to pay for these increases and what they will have to sacrifice to make ends meet," Senator Santorum stated. "I am particularly concerned about elderly constituents; my state of Pennsylvania routinely faces very harsh winters and has the second-highest number of seniors in the country. As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I believe that it is important that we bring attention to this issue and try to alleviate the heavy cost burden of a fundamental necessity such as heating one's home."
