SEN. SANTORUM SETTLES FRIENDLY SPORTS WAGERS WITH SENS. MARTINEZ, ALLARD
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today settled the score with Sens.  
 Mel Martinez (R-FL) and Sen. Wayne Allard (R-CO) following friendly wagers he made with both Senators earlier this month as two of his favorite Pennsylvania sports teams - the Penn State Nittany Lions and the Pittsburgh Steelers - took on teams from Florida and Colorado. 
   Senator Martinez handed off Bradford Country Store Smoked Sausage from his home state of Florida to Senator Santorum over the outcome of the 72nd Annual Fed Ex Orange Bowl played between the Florida State Seminoles and the Penn State Nittany Lions, their respective alma maters. The Nittany Lions beat the Seminoles 26-23 in triple overtime on January 3, 2006. Senator Santorum wagered Peachy Paterno ice cream from the Penn State Creamery. 
   "I took a gamble putting Penn State Creamery ice cream on the line - knowing that transporting it all the way to Florida would not be easy," said Senator Santorum. "But I had great faith that the Nittany Lions could not be stopped. What an exciting game!" 
   Senator Allard forked over Rocky Mountain Rib Eye Steaks after the Denver Broncos fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship game on January 22, 2006. Senator Santorum had wagered Pittsburgh's own Quaker Steak & Lube hot wings. 
   "What a great feeling it was to see my hometown team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, defeat the Denver Broncos to win the AFC Championship - all the while knowing that I would not have to deliver those delicious Quaker Steak & Lube hot wings to Senator Allard's office," said Senator Santorum.
