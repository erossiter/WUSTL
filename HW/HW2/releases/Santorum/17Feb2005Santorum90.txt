SEN. SANTORUM REINTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO COVER STILLBORN INFANTS UNDER SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced the reintroduction of legislation that will amend current law governing the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program to include insurance coverage for stillborn infants. Sen.  
 Santorum first introduced this legislation in the 108th Congress as S. 2982. 
   The SGLI program is available to all members of the Armed Services, their spouses, and dependents. Currently, when a servicemember's family experiences the death of a child, the family is entitled to a $10,000 child death benefit under the SGLI program. 
   However, if a servicemember's family experiences a stillbirth, the family is not eligible for a death benefit under the SGLI program, because current insurance standards require that a death certificate be issued for a child to be covered. Yet, neither a birth certificate nor a death certificate is issued for a stillborn infant. 
   "This legislation will amend the current law governing SGLI to make a stillborn child an insurable dependent for military families," said Senator Santorum. "For parents and families, experiencing the death of a child is an emotionally traumatic event. By including stillborn infants within the scope of the death benefit under the SGLI program, we can help ease the financial burden for military families at a time of great loss and emotional stress."
