DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor will invest $195 million in thirteen regional economies through the WIRED (Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development) initiative, $5 million of which will go to nine counties in northeastern Pennsylvania over three years.  
 WIRED is a new initiative that focuses on the role of talent development in driving regional economic competitiveness, increased job growth and new opportunities for American workers. Pennsylvania's award will be used to support the Wall Street West initiative, which aims to provide back up information services to financial markets in New York. 
   "Workforce development training is incredibly important to northeastern Pennsylvania's efforts to secure new technologies and job opportunities in the region," said Senator Santorum. "As I travel throughout the region and meet with community leaders and constituents alike, I consistently hear about the need for proper training and workforce development in order to attract new industries to the community - which is why this grant is vital to the regional economy and to Pennsylvanians. This grant creates a unique opportunity to provide redundant systems for our financial markets - the need for which became apparent on September 11, 2001." 
   Wayne, Lackawanna, Pike, Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, Luzerne, and Berks Counties are included in the grants, which will be administered through the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
