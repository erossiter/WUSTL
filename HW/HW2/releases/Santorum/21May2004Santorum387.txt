SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PENNSYLVANIA JOB CREATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement in reaction to this morning's U.S. Department of Labor announcement that 10,200 jobs were created in Pennsylvania in April.  
 The Commonwealth's unemployment rate remained steady for a second month at 5.3 percent.
   Pennsylvania's job growth is reflective of the outstanding expansion reported across the country. More than 600,000 jobs have been created nationwide in the last two months and 1.1 million jobs since last August. Manufacturing employment has also added 37,000 jobs across the U.S., reversing a trend of nearly four years of declines. While new jobs are emerging, the unemployed population is shrinking. This month the national unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent, well below its peak of 6.3 percent last June.
   "When President Bush was inaugurated three and a half years ago, our nation was already in an economic recession. Eight months later we faced the worst domestic attack in our country's history.
   Today we are much safer and seeing an economic turnaround because of the President's leadership through those troubled times.
   We still face challenges overseas as our military continues its war against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. But here at home we have evidence that our economy has finally rallied and businesses are looking to expand, create new positions, and generate more prospects for the American worker. Real incomes have risen ten percent since President Bush took office. This has placed the American worker in a better position to provide for his or her family, and American businesses in a better position to compete and win in the global market."
