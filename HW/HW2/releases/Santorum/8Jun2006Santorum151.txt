SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON DEATH OF AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement regarding the death of terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi:  
   "Our men and women who wear our country's uniform and who are in harm's way are to be commended for their dedication in defeating the terrorist network in Iraq. The past tactics of this brutal killer were daily reminders that our enemies will stop at nothing to destroy our way of life and kill anyone who disagrees with their vision to terrorize the world through their radical ideology. 
   "This morning's announcement is a major step forward in stabilizing the country of Iraq, and although major hurdles still remain, I am confident that the dream of a free and stable Iraq will be realized."
