SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR SMALL AIRPORTS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the United States Department of Transportation has awarded two small Pennsylvania airports over $700,000 in federal funding to increase commercial air service in their areas. 
   The Department of Transportation awarded Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) grants in the amount of $500,000 for Williamsport, PA and $220,000 for Bradford, PA. 
   "I am pleased that Williamsport and Bradford have received this important funding from the Department of Transportation," said Senator Santorum. "Not only will this funding expand commercial air service in these regions, but it will also have a significant economic impact as ridership and airport services increase." 
   "Increasing commercial air service at these two locations has the potential to yield tremendous economic benefits," Senator Specter said. "I applaud the Department of Transportation for providing the Williamsport and Bradford airports with a promising opportunity to increase their services and ridership." 
   Williamsport will use the funding to recruit a second carrier to the community. Bradford will use the funding to institute a comprehensive marketing and promotion campaign to increase ridership in the air service provided by Colgan Air to Pittsburgh under the Essential Air Service program. 
   The grants, appropriated a total of $20 million by Congress for fiscal year 2005, encourage commercial air service in some of America's smaller communities. This year's determination was especially competitive with 80 applicants, of which only 37 were chosen in the country.
