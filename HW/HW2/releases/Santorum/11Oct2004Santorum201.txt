SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES SENATE PASSAGE FOR EXPANSION OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced the Senate passage of bipartisan legislation yesterday, the Special Olympics Sports and Empowerment Act of 2004, which will allow more children and adults with intellectual disabilities to participate in the Special Olympics worldwide.  
   Senator Santorum introduced this legislation last month in partnership with Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). It will authorize $15 million in funding for Special Olympics for Fiscal Year 2005, which will expand the number of participants and programs around the world, increase the volunteer base, and work to combat the prejudice and stigmatization that many individuals with disabilities face. The House passed similar legislation October 6 sponsored by Congressman Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Congressman Steny Hoyer (D-MD). It will now go to President Bush for his signature. 
   "I am pleased that the United States Senate has passed the Special Olympics Sports and Empowerment Act that will enable more adults and children around the world to take part in the celebration of accomplishment, good sportsmanship and camaraderie as a Special Olympics athlete," said Santorum. "Under the athletic motto, 'Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt,' Special Olympics has provided many children and adults the opportunity to participate in healthy athletic competitions." 
   In June, Senator Santorum met with Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Special Olympics competitive swimmer Stacey Price, a native of Hershey, Pennsylvania, to announce this legislation. 
   Special Olympics was founded in Chicago in 1968. Thirty-six years later, more than 1.5 million children and adults from more than 150 countries around the world are directly benefiting from this program.
