SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS LEGISLATION TO HELP LOWER CALLING HOME COSTS FOR TROOPS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, cosponsored the Call Home Act of 2006, a bill to help lower the amount that troops pay to call home to their families or take care of personal business. 
   "The men and women of our military are bravely serving our nation around the globe. During their time overseas, it is important that our troops are able to keep in touch with their families and they should not have to worry about the high costs associated with calling home," said Senator Santorum. "I am proud to support this bill and encourage my colleagues in the Senate to do the same."
   The Call Home Act of 2006 would require the Federal Communications Commission to work with the Department of Defense and the Department of State to explore ways to reduce telephone rates for military personnel deployed overseas and their families, including waiving fees and assessments, deploying new technology such as Voice over Internet Protocol, encouraging phone companies to provide flexible billing for our troops and their families, and seeking agreements with foreign governments to reduce international surcharges on calls. The bill would update a 1992 law by expanding savings to troops serving in more countries, a reflection of the defense personnel now deployed all over the world in the global war on terror.
   The Call Home Act of 2006 is a bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Daniel Inouye (D-HI) and Ted Stevens (R-AK).
