SEN. SANTORUM ADDRESSES STATEWIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUMMIT IN PHILADELPHIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), a member of the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, today addressed the statewide affordable housing summit hosted by the Philadelphia Housing Authority at the Wilson Park Community Center in Philadelphia.  
   Senator Santorum has supported affordable housing for Pennsylvanians and particularly funding for the HOPE VI Public Housing Revitalization Program. Last year he supported significant funding for Pennsylvania, including $17 million for the Philadelphia Housing Authority to use for the revitalization of the Ludlow Scattered Sites development. 
   "When it comes to affordable housing, there has been no stronger voice in Pennsylvania than Senator Santorum. He has been instrumental in the preservation of affordable housing for thousands of Pennsylvanians and in particular the HOPE VI program," said Carl Greene, Executive Director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority. 
   Recently Senator Santorum wrote a letter to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Alphonso Jackson expressing serious concerns with HUD's proposed run on the Public Housing Operating Fund. In several meetings with Senator Santorum, housing authorities from across Pennsylvania have voiced their concerns that the implementation of the new rule is short-circuiting housing authorities' local autonomy. 
   "Under the new rule proposal, Pennsylvania housing authorities stand to lose local direction and oversight as well as tens of millions of dollars in federal assistance unless HUD changes course," said Senator Santorum. "In the past, Congress has established a trend of deregulation and greater local control for housing authorities. HUD should follow the intent of Congress to provide housing authorities greater opportunities to make decisions that are based on local needs, not one size fits all Washington programs."
