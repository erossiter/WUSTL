SEN. SANTORUM NAMED A 'SENIOR LIFE SAVER' BY RETIRESAFE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was recently named a "Senior Life Saver" by RetireSafe, a grassroots network of almost 400,000 seniors nationwide dedicated to promoting dynamic, pro-growth solutions to America's retirement security challenges. Sen. Santorum has been recognized for his outstanding efforts to provide safe, affordable medications to older Americans and to protect medical innovation for the future.  
   In announcing the award, RetireSafe President Michelle Plasari praised Senator Santorum for his continued record of support on seniors' health care issues in the 109th Congress. 
   "Senator Santorum is truly a senior life saver. Because of his leadership, seniors in Pennsylvania continue to have access to safe, affordable and innovative medications. Thanks to Medicare Part D, older Americans are now enjoying an average savings of $1,200 per year on their prescription drug bills and they have access to more preventive care under Medicare, care designed to keep them healthy and improve their quality of life," she said. "Senator Santorum's good work helps make this possible." 
   "Pennsylvania has one of the largest populations of seniors in the country," said Senator Santorum. "As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I take great pride in representing and listening to the concerns of older Pennsylvanians, and I appreciate ReitreSafe for acknowledging my voting record in the United States Senate." 
   The 2006 Senior Life Saver Award is awarded to Members of Congress for their efforts to protect and increase access to safe, affordable and innovative medicines and therapies for America's seniors.
