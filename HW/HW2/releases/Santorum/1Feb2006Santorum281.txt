SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO LIMIT U.S. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced the Palestinian Compliance Act of 2006, a bill that changes current law with respect to providing financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority.  
   "After learning the troubling news that Hamas had won a majority of seats in the Palestinian parliament, I resolved to make sure that the U.S. does not provide financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority until Hamas commits to ending all violence, disarming all militias, amending its charter, and recognizing Israel's right to exist, among other things. Until they do so, the United States must continue to place restrictions on any financial assistance provided to the Palestinian Authority," said Senator Santorum. 
   The bill modifies current waiver standards and creates new criteria that must be met in order for the President to issue a waiver and let U.S. financial assistance be provided to the Palestinian Authority. The criteria includes denouncing terrorism, making a commitment to disarm terrorist networks, pledging to uphold the human rights and civil and religious liberties of the Palestinian people, recognizing Israel's right to exist, renouncing the use of violence as a means to resolve disputes, and a commitment to prosecute those who have committed acts of terrorism. 
   The Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as Hamas captured, 74 seats of the 132-seat legislature in the January 26, 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections. Hamas has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Secretary of State and by the governments of Canada, Israel and European Union. Hamas has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks, which have killed hundreds of civilians and injured thousands more.
