SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES SECURE FENCE ACT OF 2006 BECOMES LAW
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that President Bush has signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 into law.  
   "As I travel the Commonwealth, my constituents overwhelmingly want Congress to address the problem of illegal immigration by securing our borders. Congress has responded to the call from the American people to stop the flood of illegal immigrants across our borders and to make our nation more secure by passing the Secure Fence Act. Today, as President Bush signs this bill into law, I am pleased that the U.S. border will be more secure as a result of this legislation." 
   The Secure Fence Act of 2006, along with the Homeland Security and Department of Defense Appropriations bills, have provided several major accomplishments over the past two years. These accomplishments include adding: 3,736 new Border Patrol Agents for a total of 14,555; 9,150 new Detention Beds for a total of 27,500; 370 miles of Border Security Fencing and 461 miles of Vehicle Barriers along the Southwest border; $682 million for Border Tactical Infrastructure and Facilities Construction; 1,373 Detention Personnel for a total of more than 5,500; and 460 new Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers for Seaport Inspections for a total 18,321 CBP officers at all ports of entry.
