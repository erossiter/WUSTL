SEN. SANTORUM HAILS FINAL PASSAGE OF COMBATING AUTISM ACT
Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today released a statement following final passage of his legislation, the Combating Autism Act:  
 "I am thrilled that my House and Senate colleagues this week approved this landmark legislation. This bill will do so much to improve the quality of life for children with autism and their families. I appreciate the amazing efforts and express my sincere gratitude to Senator Chris Dodd, and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman, Senator Mike Enzi, and Ranking Member, Senator Edward Kennedy, who have worked with me in a bipartisan fashion at each step of the legislative process to see this bill through Senate passage. I would also like to thanks Congressman Joe Barton for working with me to produce a final compromise that could be passed this year. It is my hope that the President will soon sign this critical legislation into law." 
 Senator Santorum introduced S. 843, the Combating Autism Act, in April 2005 with Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT). The bill will dedicate unprecedented and needed resources for autism research, screening, intervention, and education. The passage of this bill is due in large part to the tireless advocacy of the loving, dedicated families and friends of those affected by autism, who continue to raise awareness about the need to combat this epidemic and are an inspiration to all of us. 
 Senator Santorum passionately believes that we need to do a better job screening America's kids and ensuring that once a diagnosis is made, the necessary interventions are available. Early intervention will help every child live up to his or her full potential. The Combating Autism Act is a critical step toward achieving this goal.
