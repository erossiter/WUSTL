SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES SUCCESSES FOR PENNSYLVANIA INCLUDED IN FISCAL 2007 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the United States Senate unanimously passed the FY07 National Defense Authorization Act. 
   "I am very pleased that the Senate has passed this legislation which supports the men and women of our military forces, especially those who are deployed as part of the Global War on Terror. This bill also contains many key programs of importance to Pennsylvania, military families, and to our defense industrial base," said Senator Santorum.  
   Additionally, there were a number of programs championed by Senator Santorum that were included in this bill. 
   These programs include: 
   * $238 million added for recapitalization of Army Bradley Fighting Vehicles, a program listed on the Army's unfunded priorities list. Bradley Fighting Vehicle upgrades are performed by BAE Ground Systems of York, Pennsylvania. 
   * $170 million was added for upgrades to the M1A2 System Enhancement Program (M1A2 SEP) for the Army's Abrams Tank. Upgrades to this platform are essential to provide military personnel with the most current warfighting capabilities. General Dynamics Land Systems performs M1A2 SEP upgrades. General Dynamics Eynon, a Pennsylvania facility is involved with these upgrades. 
   * $2 million added for ongoing research activities at the National Tissue Engineering Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These funds will be used to pursue additional research, in partnership with the Army, on regenerative medicine for tissues and organs impaired by trauma. 
   * $3 million added for Army applied emergency hypothermia research efforts at the University of Pittsburgh's Safar Center. This research supports the ongoing, innovative, research and development efforts directed at saving the lives of severely injured combat casualties who would otherwise die from massive blood loss and cardiac arrest in the initial hour after wounding. The goal of the effort is to permit preservation of the viability of the brain and organism during cardiac arrest, until cardiopulmonary bypass and restoration of stable spontaneous circulation is achieved. 
   * $333 million added for the procurement of 12 new CH-47F helicopters for the Army. These aircraft will replace older CH-47D helicopters that were lost in operations in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. The CH-47F is manufactured by the Boeing Company at its Ridley Park, Pennsylvania facility. 
   * $2 million added for Navy research at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for efforts to enhance software reliability. This research focuses on the efficient production and post-deployment improvement of software throughout the defense supply chain, with emphasis on reliability and assurance. The resulting improvements to software quality and assurance will enable (1) higher levels of capability for new software-intensive systems without compromise to quality and safety requirements, (2) improved flexibility for existing software-intensive systems, (3) enhanced ability to assure security for critical systems, and (4) enhanced ability to support acceptance evaluation of outsourced software components and subsystems. 
   * $9.2 million added for the procurement of additional M1028, 120MM Tank Ammunition rounds for the Army. These rounds are manufactured by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems facility in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. 
   * $4 million added for equipment upgrades at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Because the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant has equipment in need of modernization, additional funds were authorized to begin the process of upgrading and modernizing this important ammunition plant. The funds will support procurement of new forge equipment for the ammunition plant. 
   * $12.5 million added for the procurement of 105MM, M915 DPICM, artillery ammunition for the Army. These rounds are manufactured at an ammunition facility run by the Day & Zimmermann Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
   * $140 million added for the procurement of additional MH-60S and MH-60R helicopters for the Navy. Many small and medium-sized suppliers throughout Pennsylvania have a vested interest in this program. These 9 aircraft (8 MH-60S and 1 MH-60R) will enhance Navy capabilities and will help the helicopter industrial base in Pennsylvania. 
   * $7.5 million added for a military construction project at the Army's Letterkenny Army Depot in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. The project involves the construction of an inland port staging facility. Ideally, this facility will be a partner in the effort to rapidly deploy military assets from the Port of Philadelphia to overseas locations. 
   The FY07 National Defense Authorization Act also included three floor amendments offered by Senator Santorum. 
   These Santorum floor amendments are: 
   SA 4210 - Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Department of Defense provide notice to Congress of the recognition of members of the Armed Forces for extraordinary acts of heroism, bravery and achievement. 
   SA 4275 - Authorizing $2 million for ongoing research on the Air Force's Advanced Aluminum Aerostructures Initiative. Research supporting this initiative is being conducted by Aloca of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
   SA 4276 - Authorizing $1 million for research on legged mobility robotic research for the Army. The University of Pennsylvania, a leader in this discipline, has been working with the Army to pursue additional investigation and experimentation in this field of robotics.
