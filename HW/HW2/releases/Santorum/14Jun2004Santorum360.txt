SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for several fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   These grants are the second round of funding from the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. Congress approved $750 million in direct assistance for the 2004 program to support firefighters throughout the country. 
   This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the U.S. Congress and ODP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs. 
   "Our families and communities rely on our first responders in times of need. We must provide our fire departments and emergency personnel with the tools and training they need to protect Pennsylvanians," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will help local fire departments continue to enhance their technology and skills so they can better protect the communities they serve." 
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help ensure that they can continue to protect our communities. I commend the Office of Domestic Preparedness for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services."

   * $205,200 for Fisherville Volunteer Fire Company in Dauphin County;
