SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER PRESENT FEDERAL FUNDING FOR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS, MEET WITH FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today presented federal funding to five local fire departments at Skyview Fire Hall in West Mifflin.  
   Funding was presented to the following companies in Allegheny County: 
   * $116,684 for Whitehall Fire Company; 
  * $53,937 for Unity Volunteer Fire Department; 
  * $51,553 for West Deer Number 1; 
  * $43,510 for Homestead Volunteer Fire Company; 
  * $36,184 for Ross/West View Emergency Medical Services Authority. 
   Senator Santorum cosponsored the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act (P.L. 106-398) which created the grant program enabling volunteer fire companies to receive the funding they need. Together, Senators Santorum and Specter have worked to secure millions of dollars in federal funding for Pennsylvania's first responders. With the support of Senators Santorum and Specter, funding for federal fire programs has increased by 445 percent since September 11, 2001, ensuring that our first responders are adequately prepared to deal with disasters. 
   "Ensuring that Pennsylvania's first responders get the support they need from the federal government is one of the most important things I do as a United States Senator," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased to be here today at the Skyview Fire Hall to present this important funding which will help to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for our firefighters to better protect Pennsylvania families from fire and fire-related hazards." 
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help assure their protection as they safeguard our communities. I commend the Department of Homeland Security for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services." 
   The funding presented today was included in the first round of funding from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the U.S. Congress and SLGCP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs.
