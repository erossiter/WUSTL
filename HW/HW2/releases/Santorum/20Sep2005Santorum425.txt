SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES HUD FUNDING FOR LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARD CONTROL, HEALTHY HOMES PROGRAMS IN PHILADELPHIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control has approved funding for Pennsylvania.  
   "I am pleased to see more than $8 million awarded to the City of Philadelphia for programs that identify and control lead-based paint hazards," said Senator Santorum. "Lead-based paint poses several serious health risks, especially for young children; in the past I have supported the National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week to draw attention to this all too common and tragic hazard." 
   The City of Philadelphia is the recipient of four grants detailed below: 
   * $4,000,000 for Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration and $2,999,999 for Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control. The purpose of both programs is to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible low-income privately owned housing. The funding will be used for lead evaluation, lead abatement, and lead-safe construction and maintenance work practices; promote job training and employment for local residents and businesses in these activities; integrate lead-safe work practices into housing maintenance, repair, weatherization, rehabilitation, and other programs that will continue after the grant period ends. 
   * $1,000,000 for the Healthy Homes Demonstration Program to develop, demonstrate, and promote cost-effective, preventive measures to correct multiple safety and health hazards in the home environment that produce serious diseases and injuries in children of low-income families. 
   * $600,000 for Lead Technical Studies to improve methods for detecting and controlling residential environmental health and safety hazards from lead and improve the cost-effectiveness of these detection and control methods.
