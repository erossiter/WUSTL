SEN. SANTORUM CHALLENGES GAMING APPLICANTS TO FUND NEW ARENA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), is challenging all applicants for the Pittsburgh gaming license to make a commitment to fund a new arena that would to replace the aging Mellon Arena.  
   "The Pittsburgh Penguins are a tremendous asset to our community. Building a new arena is not only critical to keeping our NHL franchise here - but is also important for the community as a whole. From the circus to concerts to children's events, the arena provides something for everyone," said Senator Santorum. "I strongly believe the new arena must be funded with the help of private investment and not by gaming revenues already targeted for critical property tax relief. I am calling on all the applicants competing for the single Pittsburgh slots license to come up with a plan that requires no new local tax dollars to fund a new arena. One gaming company has already made that commitment and I am hopeful that all the applicants will do the same. It is important that the local community understand what type of financial commitment the companies who are bidding for the gaming license will make towards helping fund the arena. This pledge needs to be public and the gaming commission should take this important commitment into consideration when awarding the license."
