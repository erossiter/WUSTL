SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HOUSING IN WESTERN PA
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that two housing authorities in western Pennsylvania will receive federal funding through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Home Ownership for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) program. 
   The following western Pennsylvania housing authorities will receive HOPE VI funds: 
   * $91,000 for the Washington County Housing Authority to demolish six severely distressed public housing units at the Frederick Terrace public housing development. 
   * $967,000 for the Housing Authority for the City of Pittsburgh to demolish 149 severely distressed housing units at the Addison Addition public housing development. 
   The HOPE VI program provides funding for the demolition and reconstruction of obsolete, severely distressed public housing. Ultimately, HOPE VI enhances communities by decentralizing poverty and giving families an opportunity to live in mixed-income neighborhoods with better educational and employment opportunities. "This funding is vital to the development and revitalization of the neighborhoods and communities of southwest Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "The HOPE VI program provides residents with the skills they need to secure employment." "The HOPE VI program has been very successful in providing low-income families with better housing, employment, and educational opportunities," Senator Specter said. "I am very pleased to see western Pennsylvania receive the resources it needs to provide these same opportunities to its residents in need."
