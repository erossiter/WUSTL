SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON POLISH VISA WAIVER PROGRAM
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today after an attempt to pass legislation he introduced in September of this year designating Poland as a program country under the visa waiver program established under Section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  
   "I am pleased that every Republican Senator supported this legislation. However, I am disappointed that we could not unanimously pass this legislation today because of Democratic obstruction. I worked hard with Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to gain the support of all but one of our colleagues. 
   "It's important that we show our appreciation to our Polish friends for being a staunch twenty-first century ally to the United States and for the contributions they have made to the cultural and historical fabric of our country. This legislation will make it easier for friends and families of Polish Americans to travel to the United States." 
   The Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State administer the visa waiver program, which allows citizens from 27 countries, including France and Germany, to visit the United States as tourists without visas. There are nearly nine million Americans of Polish ancestry currently living in the United States, nearly 825,000 in Pennsylvania alone. This program would allow the families of Polish Americans to travel to the United States to attend weddings, funerals and other special occasions, without the delay of waiting for a visa.
