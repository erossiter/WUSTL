SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS LITTLE SISTERS OF POOR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today addressed a large crowd at the Little Sisters of the Poor Reception held at the Hilton Hotel in Pittsburgh.  
   The Little Sisters of the Poor celebrated their 165th year of helping those in need while raising money for their new facility that provides shelter to elderly low-income citizens of Pittsburgh. Senator Santorum spoke about the importance of the Little Sisters of the Poor service and mission and the great impact they have on the Pittsburgh community. 
   "The Little Sisters of the Poor are doing tremendous work in Pittsburgh," Santorum said. "Our city is blessed to have such a faithful and dedicated organization that provides much needed services to our most vulnerable citizens. The Little Sisters of the Poor have illustrated a compassionate love for the needy by giving aid and showing mercy for those less fortunate. It is important that our senior citizens live in an environment in which they are comfortable and feel safe. The Little Sisters of the Poor have been providing these services for years and I am encouraged to know that their important work will continue to serve the elderly in Pittsburgh." 
   The Little Sisters established their mission in Pittsburgh in 1872, providing a home for the poor and elderly. Today, the Little Sisters of the Poor home in Pittsburgh has between 60 and 70 residents. Recently, the Little Sisters of the Poor announced an ambitious $26 million capital campaign to fund construction of a new facility and the renovation of its existing building in Brighton Heights on the North Side. On June 29, 2002 the Little Sisters broke ground and began construction of the new facility. This effort will enable the Little Sisters of the Poor to significantly enhance their ability to provide services for the region's impoverished elderly.
