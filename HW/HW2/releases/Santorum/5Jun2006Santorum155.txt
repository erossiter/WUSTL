SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES LEGISLATION TO COMBAT INTERNET PREDATORS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today joined Mary Beth Buchanan, United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, to announce his introduction of the Project Safe Childhood Authorization Act. 
   In February, the Department of Justice launched Project Safe Childhood, an initiative to "combat the proliferation of technology-facilitated sexual exploitation crimes against children." On May 17, 2006, the Department of Justice released a document that outlines the need for this project, an overview of the program and guides for how law enforcement, parents, teachers, and communities can come together to implement this program effectively. 
   "I am encouraged by these developments but concerned that this program does not have the legislative authorization or funding it needs to accomplish its goal of protecting our children," said Senator Santorum. "As a father of six, I am keenly aware of the dangers to our children and intend to work to help the Department of Justice fully implement and expand this initiative - including new resources, better coordination, and increased punishment to ensure our children are protected from these predators." 
   The bill will authorize and expand Project Safe Childhood, add new elements requested by DOJ to strengthen the Project, increase penalties for registered sex offenders, increase penalties for child sex trafficking and sexual abuse, increase penalties for child pornography, create Children's Safety Online Awareness Campaigns, and authorize grants for online child safety programs.
