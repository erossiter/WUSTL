SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON BUSH'S NOMINATION OF REP. GOSS TO HEAD CIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement following President Bush's nomination of Rep.  
 Porter Goss (R-FL) to become the new director of the CIA: 
   "As a former U.S. Army Intelligence officer, CIA employee, and current Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Porter Goss of Florida has years of relevant intelligence experience-as well as an understanding of the importance of congressional oversight-that should serve him well in this position if confirmed by the Senate. These credentials will no doubt prove essential in harnessing the talents of the intelligence community to better prosecute the War on Terrorism. "Our need for a coordinated and comprehensive system of defense in this country is imperative. I am pleased that President Bush has nominated such a qualified candidate as Congressman Goss to take on the difficult challenge of improving not only our level of human intelligence, but also the ability of our intelligence community to provide our policy makers with better intelligence products."
