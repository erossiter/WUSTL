SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES $2.7 MILLION TO EXTEND HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO MORE LOW-INCOME, UNINSURED PENNSYLVANIANS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced that $2.7 million has been awarded to several Pennsylvania health centers from the Department of Health and Human Services' Consolidated Health Center Program within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  
   "This funding will help ensure that community health centers continue to provide high-quality health care across the Commonwealth, and will help strengthen and expand the critical safety-net available to Pennsylvanians," said Senator Santorum. "Community health centers play a vital role in providing a range of high-quality healthcare services to Pennsylvanians, particularly in our rural areas." 
   Community health centers benefit more than 10 million of the nation's low-income, uninsured and under-insured people by providing effective and efficient primary and preventive healthcare services. Almost 40 percent of the patients treated at community health centers have no insurance coverage, and others have inadequate coverage. 
   Funding has been awarded to the following health centers: 
   * $900,000 for Quality Community Health Care in Philadelphia. 
   * $650,000 for Esperanza Health Center in Philadelphia. 
   * $650,000 for Squirrel Hill Health Center in Pittsburgh. 
   * $570,000 for Sayre Health Center in Philadelphia.
