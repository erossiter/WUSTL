SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented on the monthly employment situation report released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
   "Strong March employment numbers show that Republican pro-growth tax policies continue to fuel robust economic growth. The economy has experienced 31 straight months of job growth, and more Americans are working than ever before. Since August 2003, the economy has created nearly 5.2 million jobs, including 211,000 new jobs in March. The March unemployment rate is down to a low 4.7% - lower than the averages of the last four decades. Other economic indicators including Gross Domestic Product, business investment, consumer confidence, household wealth and tax revenues are all surging. To continue the growth, Republicans are working to enact the tax reconciliation bill to keep the current tax policies in place and prevent a massive tax increase that would harm the economy."
