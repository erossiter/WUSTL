SEN. SANTORUM PRAISES SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF JUDGES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued a statement following the Senate Judiciary Committee's approval of the nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen:  
   "I am pleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee reported the nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen out of committee. Both of these women are highly qualified and have clearly earned the support of a bipartisan majority of Senators. 
   "Justices Owen and Brown also have earned broad support from their respective states. Justice Owen was re-elected with 84% of the vote in 2000 and had the endorsement of every newspaper in Texas. Justice Brown was retained with 76 percent of the vote in her last election, showing the wide support for her role as a justice in California. 
   "During the 108th Congress, Democratic Senators refused to allow the Senate to conduct an up-or-down vote on the nominations of Justices Owen and Brown. I am hopeful, that when the nominations of Justices Owen and Brown are brought to the Senate floor, Democrats will choose to end their destructive judicial filibusters and allow a fair up-or-down vote, restoring more than 200 years of Senate tradition for simple-majority votes for the approval of the President's nominees."
