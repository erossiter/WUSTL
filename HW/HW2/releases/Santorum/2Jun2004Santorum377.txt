SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER HAIL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY JOB TRAINING
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee, hail Department of Labor Secretary Chao's announcement of a $2.43 million grant to the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse for job training in the biotech industry. The Secretary made the announcement in Pittsburgh today. The job training will take place at the Community College of Allegheny County. 
   "The biotech industry is an integral component of the economic growth and development of southwest Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that the Administration has provided funding to ensure that Pennsylvanians have the necessary skills to compete for employment in this high-growth job sector." 
   "I am pleased the Department of Labor has provided this important funding for job training to enable residents in the Pittsburgh area to obtain jobs in the biotech industry," Senator Specter stated. "The biotech industry is rapidly growing and advancing, offering tremendous opportunities for people seeking employment." 
   This funding, part of President Bush's High-Growth Job Training Initiative, is designed to ensure that worker training and career development resources in the public workforce system are targeted by helping workers gain the skills and competencies they need to obtain jobs and build successful careers in these industries. 
   The basis for the initiative are partnerships that include the public workforce system, business and industry, education and training providers, and economic development agencies working collaboratively to develop solutions to the workforce challenges facing high-growth industries and to develop maximum access for American workers to gain the competencies they need to get good jobs in these industries.
