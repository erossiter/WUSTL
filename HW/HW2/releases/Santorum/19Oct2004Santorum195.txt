SEN. SANTORUM REMINDS PENNSYLVANIANS OF APPROACHING DEADLINE FOR FILING DISASTER ASSISTANCE
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today regarding the approaching deadline for filing Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) claims:  
   "The results of the severe storms and flooding that Pennsylvania has recently suffered at the hands of tropical depressions Ivan and Frances have been devastating in many areas of the state. It is important that those in need are aware of the assistance that is available. I'd like to remind Pennsylvanians of the upcoming deadline, Thursday, October 21, to file Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) claims. 
   "Disaster Unemployment Assistance helps individuals who are not eligible for benefits under the regular unemployment insurance program. Pennsylvanians living or working in counties under the disaster declaration may be eligible for 26 weeks of assistance if they are out of work because of September's flooding. Farmers and self-employed individuals may be eligible as well." 
   To apply for Disaster Unemployment Assistance, call 1-877-345-3382 Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The speech and hearing-impaired can call the TTY number at 1-888-344-4046. Be sure to have your Social Security number and earnings from your most recent tax year ready. 
   The October 21 deadline applies to residents living in the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Centre, Clearfield, Crawford, Cumberland, Dauphin, Indiana, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lycoming, Northampton, Perry, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Washington, Westmoreland and Wyoming. 
   The deadline to apply for disaster unemployment assistance is separate from the deadline to apply with FEMA. The deadline to apply for federal and state disaster assistance is November 18.
