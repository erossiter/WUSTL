SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR BEDFORD COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has approved Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants for Bedford County.  
   "I am pleased that Bedford County has received funding to allow the county to complete these important projects which will improve the wastewater treatment system and further protect fishing streams in the community," Senator Santorum said. "I appreciate the work of USDA Rural Development for their assistance in securing this funding for Bedford County." 
   "USDA Rural Development makes every effort to help communities fund projects to provide sanitary wastewater conditions for their residents and help protect the environment," said Byron E. Ross, Pennsylvania USDA Rural Development State Director. 
   Hopewell Township received a grant of $649,000 and a loan of $1,761,000 to meet unforeseen increased costs for the construction of a wastewater collection and treatment system serving the rural communities of Tatesville, Cottles Corner and Sunnyside within Hopewell Township in Bedford County. 
   South Woodbury Township received a grant of $326,000 and a loan of $244,000. This funding will be used for construction of sewer lines providing an enhanced level of protection to the high-quality fishing streams in the area as reflected by new permits issued by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
