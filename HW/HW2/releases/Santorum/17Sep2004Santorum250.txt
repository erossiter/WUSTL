SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON PENNSYLVANIA'S EMPLOYMENT DATA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on economic growth and job creation:  
   "President Bush's Jobs and Growth tax relief package, enacted last year, has encouraged consumer confidence, and business and job growth which is working to help keep our economy strong and grow stronger. State-by-state employment data released by the U.S. Department of Labor today reveal that our economy is moving in the right direction - but there is more work to be done. 
   "In August 6,400 new jobs were created in Pennsylvania, bringing the total to more than 43,000 new jobs created since last August. More than half of Pennsylvania's gross payroll job growth over the last year was in industries that typically pay more than the national average. In August we saw job growth in seven of the eight industry sectors. The education, health service, professional, and business sectors combined gained about 2,200 new jobs. 
   "Stable jobs, strong businesses and industries, and consumer confidence all have key roles to play in maintaining America's powerful economy. We must continue to move our economy forward and increase our nation's job expansion with a pro-growth economic agenda that makes tax relief permanent, reduces frivolous lawsuits, and provides American workers with skills to meet the needs of our changing economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
