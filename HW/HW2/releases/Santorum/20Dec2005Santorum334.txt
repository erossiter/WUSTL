SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FINAL PASSAGE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN COMMEMORATION ACT OF 2005
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of Senate Appropriations Committee, announced yesterday's final passage of the Benjamin Franklin Commemoration Act of 2005 by the House of Representatives. 
   The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial Commemoration Act of 2005 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide a grant to The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia to rehabilitate the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial and develop an interpretive exhibit relating to Benjamin Franklin. 
   "I am very pleased that the House has passed this important bill. It is our nation's obligation to honor the legacy of a distinguished scientist, statesman, inventor and diplomat by making certain that our national memorial to Benjamin Franklin remains intact and accessible to the public," said Senator Santorum. "Senator Specter and I have worked very hard on this initiative and I look forward to President Bush signing this bill and seeing The Franklin Institute receive this much needed federal support to help ease the burden of maintaining this national treasure." 
   "I am very pleased that the Congress has approved the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial Commemoration Act to help renovate the Memorial," said Senator Arlen Specter. "This memorial, an attraction for some 1 million visitors annually, is truly a national treasure, yet it has come under significant deterioration. This bill will help ensure that federal funding is made available to preserve and protect our nation's memorial to Benjamin Franklin, America's distinguished scientist, statesman, inventor, and diplomat."
