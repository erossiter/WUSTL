SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   "This funding will provide our first responders with the training they need to provide communities in Pennsylvania with the best protection possible," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that Pennsylvania's local fire departments and emergency personnel are outfitted with the knowledge and skills they need to teach their communities about fire prevention and safety." 
   "These fire prevention and safety programs will help protect our communities and the Pennsylvania firefighters who risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "I commend the Office of Domestic Preparedness for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services."
