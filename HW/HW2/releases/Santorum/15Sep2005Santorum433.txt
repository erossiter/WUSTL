SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP SENIORS MAINTAIN EXPENSES, HOMEOWNERSHIP
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced the Reverse Mortgages to Help America's Seniors Act, legislation to eliminate the current cap on the number of reverse mortgages that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).  
 The legislation will guarantee older Americans reliable access to the FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program. 
   "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 81% of seniors own their own homes, and 73% of seniors own their homes free and clear of all debt," said Senator Santorum. "This represents nearly $1.9 trillion in untapped home equity, an incredible resource that would help our seniors stay in their homes as long as possible and have access services like home healthcare, adult daycare, and assisted living. The Reverse Mortgages to Help America's Seniors Act will ensure that more seniors can free up home equity in order to pay for their long-term care and other needs." 
   Reverse mortgages allow senior homeowners to convert part of their home equity into tax-free income. The homeowner will then receive payment from the lender rather than making monthly payments to the lender as with a regular mortgage. The homeowner may receive the money in one lump sum, fixed monthly payments, a line of credit, or a combination of these. 
   Earlier this year, Congressman Michael Fitzpatrick (R-8-PA) introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. Senator Santorum is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aging and is keenly interested in this issue as Pennsylvania has the second largest senior population in the United States.
