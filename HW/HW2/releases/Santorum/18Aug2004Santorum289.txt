SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE 'COPS' GRANTS FOR PENNSYLVANIA POLICE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) has provided a total of $829,130 for seven Pennsylvania police departments to increase the number of officers on duty.  
   "We depend on our local police departments to protect and serve our neighborhoods," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will enable local departments to increase personnel to help ensure the continued safety and security of communities in Pennsylvania." 
   "Increasing the number of officers on duty is necessary to decrease crime and protect our neighborhoods against potential terrorist attacks," Senator Specter said. "I commend the COPS program for providing our police departments with the essential human resources needed to keep our communities safe." 
   This funding, provided through the Universal Hiring Program (UHP), will be used to help law enforcement agencies pay 75% of the salary and benefits of additional officers who will perform community policing and homeland security activities. 
   Since 1995, COPS has helped over 13,000 law enforcement agencies make their communities safer by funding the hiring of more than 118,000 officers. In addition to helping local law enforcement agencies to expand their ranks, the COPS Program has been a catalyst for innovations in community policing. 
   The following police departments in Pennsylvania have received funding for full-time or part-time officer positions: 
   * $225,000 to Borough of Baldwin for 3 full-time positions. 
   * $225,000 to Township of Upper Makefield for 3 full-time positions.
