SEN. SANTORUM COSPONSORS USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT BROADBAND FUNDING SUMMIT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today participated by video link in a broadband funding summit at Clarion University.  
 The summit, cosponsored by Senator Santorum and USDA Rural Development, Clarion University and the Northwest PA Regional Planning & Development Commission provided businesses and non-profit entities in rural northwestern Pennsylvania with information on how to access broadband and other technology services with the help of USDA Rural Development loans and grants. 
   "Modern technology is an integral part of today's fast-paced and ever growing global economy," said Senator Santorum. "It is important that we provide people living in rural Pennsylvania with the same high-speed Internet access available to those Pennsylvanians living in urban areas. If we have the means to provide access, we should do what we can to ensure that Pennsylvanians are not hindered from participating in the marketplace of ideas and products simply because of their geographical location." 
   "High-speed Internet access plays an important role in the economic development of our rural communities as well as the need to expand high-speed access to rural households," said Gary H. Groves, USDA Rural Development Pennsylvania State Director. "This workshop will help prospective, qualified borrowers with valuable information regarding our funding process," added Groves. 
   Funding for the summit came from a $100,000 fiscal year 2005 grant that Senator Santorum secured for CONNECT/NWPA. The funding went to Clarion University and the Northwestern PA Planning Commission to expand broadband and wireless technology in the region and enhance biotechnology and nanotechnology education options in support of the Clarion BIZ/Biotech Incubator Project at Trinity Point (Clarion County).
