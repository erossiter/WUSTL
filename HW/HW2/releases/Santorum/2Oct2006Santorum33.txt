SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES $5.3 MILLION TO PROMOTE HEALTHY MARRIAGE, RESPONSIBLE FATHERHOOD IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded more than $5.3 million in grants to promote healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood in Pennsylvania.  
   "I am pleased to announce the great news that eleven Pennsylvania organizations will receive significant funding to help in their work to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood," said Senator Santorum. "As the proud father of six children, I understand how important strong marriages and involved parents are to a family; and the statistics are overwhelming. Studies show that children growing up in married, two-parent homes are less likely to become victims of abuse, engage in high risk behaviors, and suffer from emotional problems. Furthermore, children who live in father-absent homes are more likely to use drugs, be victims of abuse, engage in criminal behavior, and experience emotional, educational, health or behavioral problems." 
   Funding has been approved for the following organizations in Pennsylvania: 
   * $1,510,098 for Family Guidance, Inc. in Sewickley, PA for Healthy Marriage Demonstration. 
   * $900,000 for Healthy Start, Inc. in Pittsburgh, PA for Promoting Responsible Fatherhood. 
   * $550,000 for Nueva Esperanza, Inc. in Philadelphia, PA for Healthy Marriage Demonstration. 
   * $550,000 for OIC of America in Philadelphia, PA for Healthy Marriage Demonstration. 
   * $476,016 for the Salvation Army in Philadelphia, PA for Healthy Marriage Demonstration. 
   * $250,000 for Private Industry Council of Westmoreland/Fayette, Inc. in Greensburg, PA for Promoting Responsible Fatherhood. 
   * $250,000 for Resources for Children's Health in Philadelphia, PA for Promoting Responsible Fatherhood. 
   * $228,603 for Community Services for Children, Inc. in Allentown, PA for Healthy Marriage Demonstration. 
   * $225, 154 for Children's Aid Society in Clearfield, PA for Healthy Marriage Demonstration. 
   * $225,000 for Goodwill Industries of Pittsburgh for Promoting Responsible Fatherhood. 
   * $223,808 for Employment Opportunity & Training Center-EOTC in Scranton, PA for Promoting Responsible Fatherhood. 
   Senator Santorum worked hard to ensure that the Deficit Reduction Act (PL 109-171) provided funding for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. The legislation, which became law earlier this year, provides $100 million annually for healthy marriage promotion by providing grants to states and local community and faith-based organizations to carry out marriage promotion activities such as marriage education programs, education for high school students on the value of marriage and relationship skills, divorce reduction programs, and marriage mentoring programs. Additionally, the legislation provides $50 million annually for the promotion of responsible fatherhood through grants to states and local community and faith-based organizations to carry out responsible fatherhood promotion activities, such as developing a media campaign to encourage involvement of parents in the lives of their children, providing information on the benefits of a two parent household, and fostering economic stability of fathers. 
   Senator Santorum has worked in a bipartisan fashion over the last two Congresses on important anti-poverty initiatives. The promotion of healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood is part of the Senate Anti-Poverty Agenda that Senator Santorum helped unveil earlier this year.
