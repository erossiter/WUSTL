SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HONOR FRED ROGERS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced a bill yesterday to award Mr.  
 Fred Rogers a Congressional Gold Medal. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) cosponsored the bill. 
   "I commend the work of Pennsylvanian Fred Rogers, a compassionate and caring television icon," Senator Santorum said. "His children's television show, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, engaged children in living rooms across the nation every day with lessons on growing up, stories, creative and educational activities and visits with local 'neighborhood' friends. Parents could feel comfortable that their children were viewing a program that not only educated their children, but motivated them intellectually and emotionally." 
   A student of child development at the University of Pittsburgh and an ordained Presbyterian minister, Fred Rogers produced various local and national television programs for the enjoyment of America's youth. Most notable among his productions were The Children's Corner and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, programs that showcased Rogers' talent as both producer and actor. Fred Rogers was awarded numerous professional accolades that included four Emmy Awards, "Lifetime Achievement" Awards from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the TV Critics Association, and two George Foster Peabody Awards. In 1999, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. 
   "Beyond his professional accomplishments, Fred Rogers was an ambassador of kindness and compassion to generations of American children," Senator Santorum said. "Above all, he taught children how to be a good neighbor to those in their communities. He will be greatly missed, but his exemplary life of tireless service will not be forgotten."
