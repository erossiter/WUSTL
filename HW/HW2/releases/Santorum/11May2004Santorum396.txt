SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON SYRIA BY BUSH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented today on President Bush's decision to impose sanctions on Syria:  
   "I commend President Bush for his action today to impose sanctions against the Government of Syria. The sanctions imposed by President Bush are justified given Syria's continued support for terrorist groups and organizations; its military presence in Lebanon; its inventory of weapons of mass destruction; and its support for the regime of Saddam Hussein." 
   "I am convinced that the President's actions to prohibit the export of U.S. Munitions List and Commerce Control List items to Syria; to freeze assets of individuals and entities involved in activities contrary to the intent of the law; and to instruct U.S. financial institutions to sever correspondent accounts with the Commercial Bank of Syria will make a difference in changing the behavior of the Government of Syria." 
   "I am pleased that the Bush Administration, following the signing of this legislation into law in December 2003, engaged the Syrians and pushed for changes in their behavior. However, because significant advances have not been made, I support the use of sanctions to change the practices of the Government of Syria. It would be a mistake for other countries to underestimate our determination to sanction terrorist-supporting countries."
