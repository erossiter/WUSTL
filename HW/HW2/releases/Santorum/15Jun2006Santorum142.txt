SEN. SANTORUM CONDEMNS FRENCH HONORING OF CONVICTED MURDERER OF PHILADELPHIA POLICE OFFICER
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced a resolution condemning the decision by the city of St. Denis, France to name a street in honor of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the convicted murderer of Philadelphia Police Officer Danny Faulkner. Rep. Fitzpatrick (R-PA-8) has introduced a similar resolution in the House of Representatives.  
   "I am outraged that the municipal government of St. Denis, France would make such a thoughtless and insensitive decision as to name a street after the murderer of a Philadelphia police officer," said Senator Santorum. "This is a monumental insult to the memory of Danny Faulkner, to his family, and to the courageous men and women who put on a police uniform every day to protect our communities." 
   The resolution condemns the murder of Officer Faulkner and urges the municipal government of St. Denis to take immediate action to change the name of "Rue Mumia Abu-Jamal." If such action is not taken, the resolution urges the French Government to take appropriate action against the city of St. Denis to change the name of the street. Finally, this resolution appropriately commends all police officers for their commitment to public service and public safety. 
   In July 1982, Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of murdering Officer Danny Faulkner and was sentenced to death. Abu-Jamal has had numerous legal appeals, including to the PA State Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, and his conviction has been upheld each time.
