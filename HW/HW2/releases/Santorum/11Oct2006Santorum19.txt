SEN. SANTORUM SPEAKS AT DELAWARE VALLEY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SYMPOSIUM
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today spoke at the Tri-State Preparedness Symposium sponsored by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Regional Counter Terrorism Task Force. The Symposium was part of the Task Force's Urban Area Security Initiative for the Delaware Valley to protect the combined 6 million people who live in the region.  
   The goal of the Tri-State Preparedness Symposium is to develop and improve mutual aid, communications, and overall system and equipment interoperability so that regional emergency responders and emergency service providers will be able to work seamlessly to enhance the safety and security of the public. 
   Participants discussed various ways to detect, prevent, protect, respond and recover from natural and other disasters. 
   "This is a great first step to improving disaster and emergency response in the Delaware Valley. The quality of response in these situations depends on the level of preparation and coordination by local, inter-state and federal governments and agencies," said Senator Santorum. "Meetings like this allow for us to continue building a better plan of action and not just reaction." 
   "It is our hope that this collaborative effort will provide a powerful planning tool for improving our regions capabilities to detect, prevent, protect against, respond to and recover from any kind of emergency," remarked Bucks County's Emergency Management Agency Director John D. Dougherty, Jr., who is the task force chair. 
   Senator Santorum has supported federal funding for first responder programs, port and rail security, firefighter assistance and emergency management performance grants. He has supported homeland security funding across various departments, which has increased from $32.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2002 to $49.9 billion for Fiscal Year 2006.
