SEN. SANTORUM PRESENTS MEDALS TO HONOR MILITARY SERVICE POSTHUMOUSLY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today will present service medals to John Cheppa who is receiving them on behalf of his brother, Michael Cheppa, who is being honored posthumously.  
   "I wish Mr. Cheppa could be with us today so I could personally present him with the service medals he earned in recognition of his service to our country; but Mr. Cheppa paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country, losing his life on the battlefield in Korea," said Senator Santorum. "I am proud to present these medals to his brother, John, as a symbolic gesture of gratitude from a grateful nation for Mr. Cheppa's distinguished and valiant service." 
   Michael Cheppa served in the United States Army during World War II and during the Korean War. He was killed in action in Korea on November 30, 1950. For Michael's service during World War II he is being awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, and Parachutist Medal among other. For his service in Korea, Mr. Cheppa is receiving the Korean War Service Medal; he previously received the Silver Star Medal and Purple Heart Medals. 
   "I want to sincerely thank Senator Santorum he has been working on this for quite a while, and on behalf of myself and my parents, and my family in Centralia, I sincerely appreciate the efforts to get the accurate paperwork and recognition for my brother's service to our country. My brother served with dignity and honor and I am glad Senator Santorum works hard to make sure our veterans are honored with the proper respect they deserve," said John Cheppa.
