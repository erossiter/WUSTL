SEN. SANTORUM PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF PROVISION TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO IMPORTANT CANCER SCREENINGS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced Senate passage of the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act, which includes a provision that improves access to crucial, life-saving colon cancer screening services.  
 The provision, which Sen. Santorum worked to include in the legislation, makes it easier and less costly for Medicare beneficiaries to access preventive colon cancer screening services by eliminating the usual Medicare Part B deductible. 
   "Colon cancer is the number two cancer killer in the United States, yet it is highly detectable, treatable and curable if found in its early stages," said Senator Santorum. "In fact, colon cancer can even be prevented with the appropriate screening. I am very pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate have passed this important provision which will improve access to colon cancer screening and helps beneficiaries gain easier access to this life-saving service." 
   Medicare began covering colon cancer screening tests in 1997. However, studies show that Medicare beneficiaries are not utilizing this benefit. In 2000, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that colon cancer screening has only increased by one percent since Congress passed the benefit in 1997. Statistics show that colon cancer screening rates lag far behind those of other cancers. 
   "Colon cancer is a tragic and complicated disease, and we must take the appropriate steps to prevent and treat this disease through colon cancer screening and early detection that does not burden patients or healthcare providers," continued Senator Santorum. "I urge the House to expeditiously consider the Deficit Reduction Omnibus bill passed by the Senate so that our nation's seniors will have access to life-saving colon cancer screenings."
