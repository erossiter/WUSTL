SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON HIS EFFORTS TO INCREASE AMTRAK FUNDING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today offered comments regarding an amendment he introduced to the Fiscal Year 2007 Congressional Budget Resolution, which would have increased funding by $550 million for Amtrak, bringing total Amtrak funding to $1.45 billion in Fiscal Year 2007. 
   "I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass this amendment today. While I wholeheartedly support efforts to reduce our nation's budget deficit, now is not the time to allow this important part of our nation's economic and transportation infrastructure to fall into bankruptcy. However, I am not discouraged by this small setback - I remain fully committed to Amtrak's future and will continue to lend my complete support to Amtrak as we move through the federal funding process.
   "Amtrak is vitally important to Pennsylvania. Nearly 5 million Pennsylvanians utilize Amtrak each year, and Amtrak employs over 3,000 Pennsylvanians. The 30th Street Station located in Philadelphia is Amtrak's 2nd busiest station nationwide with over 3.7 million riders last year. And as a frequent user of Amtrak, traveling to and from Pennsylvania and Washington, I know firsthand how efficient traveling by railroad can be."
   Throughout his service in the U.S. Senate, Senator Santorum has consistently supported Amtrak. He is the cosponsor of S. 1516, a bill authorizing $11.4 billion for Amtrak over the next 6 years. The Senator has written a total of 11 letters since 1998 to the Clinton Administration, Bush Administration, and his colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee urging them to meet the needs of Amtrak.
