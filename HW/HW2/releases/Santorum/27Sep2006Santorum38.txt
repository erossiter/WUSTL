SEN. SANTORUM PARTICIPATES IN SAVINGS AND OWNERSHIP CAUCUS PANEL ON KIDS ACCOUNTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today joined Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), and Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-RI) to highlight his work to promote ownership, investment and financial literacy for families in need at the Congressional Savings and Ownership Caucus. 
   Senator Santorum co-chairs the Congressional Savings and Ownership Caucus with Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Representatives Jim Cooper (D-TN), Phil English (R-PA), Harold Ford Jr. (D-TN), and Thomas Petri (R-WI). The Congressional Savings and Ownership Caucus was formed in February 2005 in order to bring together key Members of Congress, their staffs, and leading outside experts to discuss - in a non-partisan, forward-looking manner - recent research findings, policy options, and potential legislative opportunities to advance the goal of expanding savings and asset ownership in America.  
   "Legislation that provides incentives for ownership and asset-building is critical as we look for innovative ways to address poverty. Many Americans do not have the assets that provide families with financial security and opportunities for education and homeownership," said Senator Santorum. "Low-income Americans face significant hurdles when trying to save, which is why I have developed a comprehensive Ownership Agenda. The Ownership Agenda includes programs that will empower families in need by creating incentives to save and invest." 
   Senator Santorum highlighted S. 868, the American Savings for Personal Investment, Retirement, and Education ("ASPIRE") Act, which he introduced with Senators DeMint (R-NC) and Schumer (D-NY). The ASPIRE Act will create an opportunity for every child and their family to begin investing in their future by providing a sound financial start for children, particularly those born into poverty. The ASPIRE Act will create opportunities for families and children to become more financially literate by creating a KIDS Account. Each account will be endowed with a one-time $500 contribution, and children in households earning below the national median income will be eligible for a supplemental contribution of up to $500. 
   "Research suggests that people think and behave differently when they are accumulating assets. KIDS Accounts will allow parents to feel more secure about their child's future; people who own assets are, by and large, more optimistic about their ability to succeed. Each child will grow up knowing that there is an account with their name on it, opening up new opportunity and possibility in the future. I look forward to continuing to push this legislation with my colleagues in the future," said Senator Santorum. 
   Senator Santorum's Ownership Agenda addresses America's declining savings rate and seeks to empower families in need through investing in communities, individuals, and kids.
