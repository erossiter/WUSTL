SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES AMERICA'S CLASS ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced the America's Communities Leveraging Assets for Students and Schools (CLASS) Act. This legislation, which is modeled after Pennsylvania's successful Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program, would encourage local businesses to invest in their communities' students and schools by providing tax credits for donations to scholarship or educational improvement organizations. The bill would allow companies to claim a tax credit worth 50 percent of a cash donation of at least $5,000 to non-profit scholarship or educational improvement organizations.  
   "We have seen the success of this program throughout the Commonwealth and I am pleased to have the opportunity to expand this innovative education initiative to the federal level," said Senator Santorum. "Although students and schools across our nation stand to benefit from America's CLASS Act, Pennsylvania is particularly well positioned to take advantage of this measure, as its scholarship and educational improvement organizations are already familiar with the benefits of this policy and have the infrastructure in place to leverage significant, new resources. Encouraging local businesses to support scholarship opportunities and innovative educational programs in their communities will help students across our nation fulfill their potential." 
   The scholarships awarded through America's CLASS Act would help empower parents to choose the school that best meets their child's educational needs. Additionally, this bill would provide significant resources to fund innovative programs in public schools, helping to address needs within our nation's classrooms. By leveraging resources for scholarship and educational improvement organizations, America's CLASS Act would benefit both public and private school families.
