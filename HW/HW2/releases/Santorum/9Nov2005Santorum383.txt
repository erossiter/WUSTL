SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES ABORTION NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced the Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA).  
   "I am proud to sponsor this legislation which is needed to protect the rights of health care providers who refuse to participate in abortions," said Senator Santorum. "Hospitals and other health care providers in several states have been pressured to provide abortions. This important legislation will offer additional protection for health care providers who choose not to participate in abortions." 
   Existing federal law contains conscience clause protections that prohibit discrimination against health care entities that object to performing, providing coverage of, or paying for, abortions. ANDA would clarify that the term "health care entity" includes physicians and other health professionals, hospitals, provider sponsored organizations, HMO's, health insurance plans, and any other kind of health care facility, organization, or plan. 
   Original cosponsors of the bill include: Senators Ben Nelson (D-NE), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Jim DeMint (R-SC), Mike DeWine (R-OH), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Tom Coburn (R-OK), Judd Gregg (R-NH), Sam Brownback (R-KS), John Ensign (R-NV), Mel Martinez (R-FL), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), David Vitter (R-LA), and Richard Burr (R-NC). 
   "As an advocate for building a culture of life, I believe it is important to give health care providers the freedom to choose not be involved in providing abortions. Whether it be a physician or any other health care professional - they must be afforded this right," said Senator Santorum.
