SEN. SANTORUM ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE HEARING ON COAL-TO-LIQUID FUEL TECHNOLOGY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and Chairman of the Senate Energy Working Group, today issued a statement regarding the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on implementing incentives for the development of coal-to-liquid fuel technology, a provision included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   "I am pleased that the Senate Energy Committee is examining the economic and environmental benefits associated with coal-to-liquid technology. I am proud to say that I have been working on this initiative for many years. In 2001, I was able to secure language to enable coal-to-liquid fuel technologies to compete for a Department of Energy program through which a Pennsylvania company was ultimately awarded $100 million. Subsequently, I secured a provision in the Energy Policy Act that established a loan guarantee program to provide significant investments for clean coal research.
   "Pennsylvania has a rich coal heritage and continues to play an instrumental role in supplying our nation with its greatest source of domestic fuel, and I am excited that our state will be able to showcase its many resources and innovations through programs such as the Clean Coal Power Initiative. With gas prices once again reaching all-time highs it is sometimes hard to see the benefit of long-term solutions, but this cutting-edge clean coal technology has the potential to help our nation break from our dangerous and costly dependence on foreign sources of energy. I encourage the Administration to work swiftly to implement the incentives Congress passed into law last summer."
   Today's hearing is the first in a series being held by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee focusing on the implementation of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
