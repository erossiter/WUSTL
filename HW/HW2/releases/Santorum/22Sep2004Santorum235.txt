SEN. SANTORUM PRESENTED THOMAS JEFFERSON AWARD BY FOOD DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today was awarded the 2004 Thomas Jefferson Award by the Food Marketing Institute and International Foodservice Distributors Association.  
   Senator Rick Santorum received the award from Steve Smith, President and CEO of K-VA-T Food Stores and Chairman of the Food Marketing Institute's Public Affairs Committee, and Mark Allen, President and CEO of the International Foodservice Distributors Association. The award is presented annually to Members of Congress who support the free enterprise system when voting in Congress on such issues as taxes, free trade, labor policy, and other economic matters. 
   "I am honored to receive this award," Santorum said. "Thomas Jefferson once said 'A wise and frugal government...shall leave men...free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.' I am proud that my voting record in the United States Senate reflects these ideals. I would like to thank the Food Marketing Institute and the International Foodservice Distributors Association for presenting me with this award." 
   The Food Marketing Institute is an organization that conducts programs in research, education, industry relations and public affairs on behalf on its 2,300 member companies - food retailers and wholesalers - in the United States and around the world. International Foodservice Distributors Association is a trade organization representing foodservice distributors throughout the United States and internationally. The organizations come together each year to select the recipients of the prestigious Thomas Jefferson Award.
