SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, offered comments today following President Bush's national address regarding America's commitment to fighting and winning the War on Terror:  
   "Tonight the President provided the American people with a better understanding of the enemy we face in the War on Terror and why it is crucial that the United States remain committed to seeing the Iraqi people and coalition forces prevail. 
   "On the one year anniversary of the transfer of sovereignty back to the Iraqi people, it is important to note the significant progress that our soldiers have made in advancing freedom in Iraq. Earlier this year, more than 8 million Iraqis defied terrorist threats and voted in the national election, electing a representative government to serve during the transition to a democracy. Although there are difficulties and dangers that remain ahead in the War on Terror, the United States and its allies will not waiver in its commitment to protect our homeland and the fight against terrorism. 
   "I appreciate President Bush's dedication to securing freedom throughout the world and continuing the fight against the evils of terrorism. I am extremely grateful for the brave men and women in uniform who voluntarily place themselves in harm's way while protecting our nation and expanding democracy around the world. I pray for each and every one of our troops and their families and for their safe return home."
