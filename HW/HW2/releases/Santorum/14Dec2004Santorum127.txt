SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF GOV. LEAVITT TO HEAD HHS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement regarding the nomination of Governor Michael Leavitt to be the next Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services: "Michael Leavitt is a well-qualified individual who has proven managerial and leadership skills.  
 He has already demonstrated his ability to work effectively within the executive branch as the 10th Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
   "Prior to his work in Washington, DC, Governor Leavitt served as Utah's 14th Governor. Six times during his administration, independent public policy analysts ranked Utah among the best-managed states in the nation. 
   "Governor Leavitt has been a national leader on homeland security, welfare reform, and environmental management. I trust that my Senate colleagues will join me in giving Governor Leavitt a fair confirmation process in the United States Senate."
