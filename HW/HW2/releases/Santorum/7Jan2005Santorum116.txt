SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY, IMPRESSIVE JOB GAINS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today regarding economic growth and job creation:  
   "The Department of Labor released economic figures today indicating a steady growth in the economy. 157,000 jobs were created during the month of December bringing the total number of jobs created since August 2003 to 2.6 million, resulting in 16 straight months of job gains. As we reflect on the 2004 economic climate, it is evident that the President's economic agenda has been a major success. In 2004, job creation was up in 48 of the 50 states and the unemployment rate was down in 42 of the 50 states. 
   "In the 109th Congress, Republicans have an agenda to create more jobs and opportunities in a growing economy. I will continue to work with President Bush and my colleagues in the United States Senate to push for pro-growth economic policies that create jobs, and I will continue to oppose tax increases that burden working families."
