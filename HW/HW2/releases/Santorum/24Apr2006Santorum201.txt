SEN. SANTORUM SUBMITS LETTER TO PENNSYLVANIA GAMING CONTROL BOARD REGARDING PITTSBURGH GAMING LICENSE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) today announced that he has submitted written comments for the inclusion in the evidentiary record of the public input hearings by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board regarding the pending Pittsburgh gaming license. In the letter Sen. Santorum stated:  
   "I would like to make clear that I am not endorsing or supporting any particular gaming applicant but I am endorsing any gaming plan through which private funding can be secured for a new arena without the use of tax dollars. 
   "As I've stated publicly in the past, I believe the gaming license is a public license and therefore some portion of the revenues derived from the award of the license should be used for public purposes. The opportunity for our region to build a new arena and redevelop a struggling area of Pittsburgh with some of these funds remains a top priority for many civic leaders. 
   "In addition, replacing the outdated Mellon Arena with a new, expanded facility demonstrates continued investment in our community. It will provide another venue for attracting greater conventions and civic events, secure the Pittsburgh Penguins future, and it will create and retain hundreds of jobs above and beyond those predicted for each casino project."
