SEN. SANTORUM HIGHLIGHTS AFRICAN AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT IN NASCAR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today sponsored a Senate resolution recognizing the creation of the NASCAR-Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Consortium.  
   The Consortium will establish a formal plan to increase the number of quality job opportunities available to African American students in key racing and other related automotive business activities, including automotive engineering and technology, automotive safety, sports marketing, and other automotive industry areas through the NASCAR Universal Training Institute and the NASCAR Diversity Internship Program. 
   "I am pleased to sponsor this resolution to recognize the NASCAR-HBCUs Consortium-which will increase awareness, access, and participation of African American students in NASCAR racing and other related automotive industries," said Senator Santorum. 
   NASCAR has agreed to enhance their identification of employment opportunities, including internships, full-time jobs, entry level management positions, part-times jobs for college students, and post-graduate job placement for students pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees at partner HBCU's.
