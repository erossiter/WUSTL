  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today regarding the celebration of the birthday and life of Dr.  
 Martin Luther King, Jr.: 
   "Today we observe the 76th birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a true hero of the civil rights movement in the United States. This is a time for the nation to remember the birth, life and dream of Dr. King. 
   "Dr. King communicated his message of peaceful change to millions throughout the country. With this spirit, he took a stand against racial discrimination and advocated for the respect, equality and freedom of all mankind. 
   "Dr. King sought to end racial inequality; unfortunately, African Americans and other minorities in this country are still battling prejudice and discrimination today. It is my hope that we all take this day to reflect and appreciate the life and work of Dr. King, and continue efforts he made to end racial discrimination in our society."
