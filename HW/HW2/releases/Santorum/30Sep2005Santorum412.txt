SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE PROJECTS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved funding for defense-related projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which must be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by the President.  
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense and I am proud of the people and organizations that help to make our state a top competitor for defense projects that create jobs and strengthen our economy," said Senator Santorum. "If approved by the full Senate, this funding will enable these important defense projects in central Pennsylvania to move forward in the effort to achieve a more secure nation." 
   "A number of Pennsylvania companies are enhancing the way our Armed Forces operate," Senator Specter said. "These projects will go far in supporting the brave men and women who serve our country. I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate Appropriations Committee have recognized the valuable contribution these projects will make to our nation's defense." 
   Projects which have been approved to receive funding in Central Pennsylvania include: 
   * $6 Million for Pennsylvania State University in Centre County for a Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LUUV) Test Bed. The Navy needs unmanned systems to reduce the vulnerability of manned platforms and multiply their effectiveness. The LUUV will provide an off-board, unmanned vehicle with a wider variety of capabilities that will be applicable to both guided submarines and littoral combat ships; 
   * $6 Million for General Dynamics in York County for Mid Range Munition (MRM) (CE) TM3. Funding will continue development of the Army's Mid Range Munition (MRM). The MRM will give the Army's current and future gun systems their first intelligent munition, providing accurate engagements against maneuvering and hidden targets, in all weather conditions. It is effective far beyond the range of today's conventional tank ammunition; 
   * $5 million to JLG in Fulton County, for the All Terrain Lifter Army System (ATLAS) for the procurement of a self-deployable rough terrain, manually operated forklift capable of operating efficiently in nuclear, biological, and chemical environments; 
   * $4 million to the Pennsylvania National Guard for the Northeast Regional Counterdrug Training Center. Established in 1998, the Northeast Counterdrug Training Center (NCTC) provides no-cost counterdrug training and education to law enforcement and drug demand reduction specialists in 18 northeastern states; 
   * $2.1 million to SAP for an Army Medical Department Enterprise Resource Planning project in Cumberland County. The U.S. Army Medical Material Department (AMEDD) is charged with providing medical supplies to the Army worldwide. Funding will upgrade the AMEDD's medical support to combat forces by transitioning operationally critical medical logistics capabilities from the legacy Tactical Army Medical Material Information System (TAMMIS) into a newer Enterprise Resource Planning system. This transition will lead to quicker medical supply replenishment, lighter supply chain burdens, and greater responsiveness in treating wounded soldiers in the field.
