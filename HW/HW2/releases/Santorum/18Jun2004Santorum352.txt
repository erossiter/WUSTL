SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON UPCOMING SENATE VOTE ON FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement on the upcoming Senate vote on a constitutional amendment to defend marriage as the union of a man and a woman:  
   "The U.S. Senate will vote on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution in mid-July that defends marriage as the union between a man and a woman. 
   "Marriage between a man and a woman is vital to the stability and preservation of our society in which a father and a mother raise and nurture children. If we redefine what marriage is, then we send a message to the next generation that children do not need mothers and fathers, and that alternative family forms are just as good as traditional families. 
   "Marriage is a fundamental institution of this country that we have to protect from attack by unelected judges who want to redefine marriage and amend the constitution by legislating from the bench. The process of amending the U.S. Constitution enables the American people to have a voice and offer their critical support for adopting a constitutional amendment to defend and protect the institution of marriage."
