SEN. SANTORUM, POSTMASTER GENERAL DEDICATE HARRISBURG MAIL PROCESSING CENTER
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Postmaster General John "Jack" Potter, today dedicated the Harrisburg Mail Processing Center in honor of the late LeGree S. Daniels.  
   Senator Santorum sent a letter to Postmaster General Potter on March 1, 2006, to request that the United States Postal Service consider renaming the Harrisburg mail processing and distribution center for Mrs. Daniels. 
   "I am pleased to be here today with Postmaster General Potter to honor the life and work of a truly amazing and inspiring woman, LeGree Daniels. I had the honor of knowing Governor Daniels and believe her contributions to our country make her worthy of the prestigious honor of having the Harrisburg post office carry her name," said Senator Santorum. 
   Mrs. Daniels, a resident of Susquehanna Township, served on the Postal Service Board of Governors from 1990 until her death in November 2005. The granddaughter of a former slave, Governor Daniels' long and distinguished career in public service began in 1941 when she was the first African-American appointed to Pennsylvania's Department of Revenue. Mrs. Daniels rose through the ranks in a career spanning five decades and served as Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. President Ronald Reagan named her Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education in 1987. She served twice as Vice Chairman of the National Electoral College and on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy.
