SEN. SANTORUM RECEIVES 'SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE' AWARD FROM U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, has been awarded the "Spirit of Enterprise" award by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in recognition of his continued support of pro-economic growth legislation during the first session of the 109th Congress. 
   "Ensuring that Pennsylvania's economy grows stronger every year is one of my top priorities, and I am honored to receive the 'Spirit of Enterprise' award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce," Senator Santorum stated. "I am proud that during the first session of the 109th Congress, my colleagues and I were able to pass landmark legislation that has greatly strengthened the economy and created jobs, including the Deficit Reduction Act, a comprehensive Energy bill, Transportation Reauthorization legislation, Bankruptcy Reform, and a Pension Reform bill."
   "Senator Santorum is a leader who has fought for legislation to spur job creation, increase productivity and keep our economy growing," said Thomas J. Donohue, Chamber President and CEO. "We're proud to present him with this award on behalf of America's businesses, both large and small."
   The U.S. Chamber is the world's largest business federation, representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector and region. The Chamber awards the "Spirit of Enterprise" based on rankings it gives members of Congress for key business votes outlined in its annual publication, How They Voted. Senator Santorum scored 100 percent with the Chamber last year and has compiled a 90 percent cumulative ranking during his tenure in Congress. Senator Santorum has consistently received the "Spirit of Enterprise" award throughout his congressional career.
