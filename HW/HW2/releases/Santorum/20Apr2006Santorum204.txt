SEN. SANTORUM DENOUNCES SELECTION OF IRAN AS VICE-CHAIR OF U.N. DISARMAMENT COMMISSION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement:
   "I am extremely disappointed that member nations of the United Nations have elected the Islamic Republic of Iran to serve as the Vice-Chair of the U.N. Disarmament Commission. Electing Iran, a country that has demonstrated no sign of abandoning its pursuit of enriching uranium, is ludicrous. Iran is a threat to the United States and the rest of the world, and this vote by a group of U.N. member states is simply non-sensical."
