SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL DRUG INTELLIGENCE CENTER
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today expressed his support for Department of Defense (DoD) funding for the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) in Johnstown.  
   "I firmly believe that the NDIC is an important component in providing for our nation's security," said Senator Santorum. "The people of Johnstown who staff this facility are of the highest professional capabilities. It is important that we maintain these capabilities as we fight the war on Islamic Fascism on many different fronts." 
   The NDIC was not included in the President's budget request. Senator Santorum fully supports efforts to fully fund the NDIC in the final DoD conference report that Congress approves. 
   "I believe that the Administration should include it in its budget in future fiscal years. I will be writing President Bush in the coming days to make this case," said Senator Santorum. "At a time when the nexus between drug traffic and terrorist groups is becoming more acute, we need to make funding for our intelligence capabilities one of our highest priorities." 
   A copy of the Congressional Record statement is attached.
