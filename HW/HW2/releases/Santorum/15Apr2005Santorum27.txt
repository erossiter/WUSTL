SEN. SANTORUM DISCUSSES EXTENSION OF MILC PROGRAM, FARM BILL DURING RECENT CABLE INTERVIEW
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was recently interviewed by Sen.  
 Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, on his cable television program. 
   Senator Santorum spoke about the importance of extending the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) payment program, which unlike other provisions in the bill, expires two years before the end of the current Farm Bill. Senator Santorum expressed his support to providing supplemental price support to small dairy farmers when milk prices are low. The Senator also spoke of the importance of agriculture in Pennsylvania's economy. 
   On February 7, 2005, to remedy the expiration of the MILC payment program, Senator Santorum introduced S. 307, a bill to extend the MILC program for two years. 
   Further information regarding the Senator's role on the Agriculture Committee and the importance of farming to the Pennsylvania economy can be found by clicking on the Agriculture Section of the Senator's website.
