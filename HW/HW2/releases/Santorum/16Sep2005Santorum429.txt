SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF HURRICANE TAX RELIEF BILL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on Senate passage of S. 1696, tax legislation aimed to help Hurricane Katrina victims.  
 The Hurricane Tax Relief Package includes incentives to promote charitable aid for hurricane victims, some of which are part of Sen. Santorum's previously introduced legislation - the CARE (Charity, Aid, Recovery and Empowerment) Act, which aims to boost charitable giving and assist faith-based and community charities to help millions more people in need. 
   "I am pleased that my Senate colleagues passed this tax relief legislation - providing immediate relief for hurricane victims so they may begin to rebuild their lives, access housing, and find employment," said Senator Santorum. "I am especially pleased that certain CARE Act provisions were included in this package. These provisions encourage activities such as food and book donations, corporate charitable contributions, increased vehicle mileage rate for charities' mileage deduction, and mploying displaced people. This is a great start in assisting charitable organizations who are extending a helping hand in this urgent time of need." 
   This week, Senator Santorum chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy of the Senate Finance Committee to hear testimony on "Charities on the Frontline: How the Nonprofit Sector Meets the Needs of America's Communities."
