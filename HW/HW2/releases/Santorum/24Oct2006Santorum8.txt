SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES NEW POLICY REGARDING MILITARY MEDALS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the Department of Defense has made a change to the Department's "Manual of Military Decorations and Awards" and will share the achievements and accomplishments of our outstanding military personnel with Members of Congress and the American public. Senator Santorum has been working closely with the Department of Defense to encourage this change of policy. Earlier this year, Senator Santorum introduced and helped to pass an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill urging the Department of Defense to change the policy.  
   "It is important that Americans are made aware when service members are awarded the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, or Silver Star for their acts of heroism," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that the Department of Defense has made this change and I look forward to congratulating all the future recipients of these wonderful honors."
