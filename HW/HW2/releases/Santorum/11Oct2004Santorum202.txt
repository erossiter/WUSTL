SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF JOBS, ECONOMIC GROWTH BILL
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today regarding the final passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act:  
   "I have been working as a conferee with my colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives to craft the final version of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength Act. I am proud that we were able to come together to put in place specific measures that will be beneficial to manufacturers and small businesses in Pennsylvania and create an opportunity for the United States to be more competitive in the global market. 
   "Today, my colleagues in the Senate passed the final version of the JOBS Act by a vote of 69-17. This legislation will now go to President Bush for his signature. 
   "In March 2004 the European Union imposed a five percent tariff on a number of U.S. products. Without any action, these tariffs are scheduled to increase by one percent each month until they reach 17 percent in March 2005, jeopardizing $4 billion in U.S. exports. However, because of the JOBS Act these tariffs on nearly 100 American-made products will be repealed. 
   "The passage of the JOBS bill boosts the nation's economy and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans; this complements President Bush's tax relief package which laid the foundation for continued economic growth and job creation. 
   "On Friday, the Department of Labor announced that more than 1.8 million jobs have been created since August 2003, with 96,000 payroll jobs created in September 2004 alone. The national unemployment rate has declined from its peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003 to 5.4 percent, which is below the average of each of the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s."
