SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES MILK INCOME LOSS CONTRACT EXTENSION ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Extension Act, which will extend the MILC program until 2007 when Congress plans to consider the next Farm Bill.  
   "The MILC program is a countercyclical commodity support program, which provides a safety net for all dairy producers. The MILC program provides dairy farmers with a compensatory payment whenever the minimum monthly market price of milk falls below a trigger price," said Senator Santorum. 
   In the 106th Congress Senator Santorum introduced S. 2706, the National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act of 2000, designed to eliminate the need for Congress to provide supplemental market loss payments to dairy producers by establishing a sliding scale payment based on the market price of Class III milk. Parts of S. 2706 were borrowed to construct the current MILC program, which passed as part of the 2002 Farm Bill. 
   "The MILC program is vital to the survival of the dairy industry in Pennsylvania. This legislative proposal represents a commonsense approach in the often-heated debate of dairy policy. I look forward to working with my colleagues, the President, and the Secretary of Agriculture to extend the current law," said Senator Santorum. "As a representative of the fourth largest dairy producing state in the nation, I am committed to preserving the viability of Pennsylvania's dairy farmers, and extending this program is just one step in that direction." 
   The MILC program is set to expire in September of 2005; if passed the MILC Extension Act will allow for the federal government to continue funding the MILC program at the current rate for the next two years.
