SEN. SANTORUM URGES ACTION ON ANIMAL FIGHTING BILL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, along with Sen. John Ensign (R-NV) today sent a letter to House Majority Leader John Boehner urging action on the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, which aims to end the practice of animal fighting by creating felony level penalties for animal fighting activities. The Senate approved the Santorum-Ensign bill, S. 382, by unanimous consent in April 2005.  
   "Senator Ensign and I are very hopeful that the House will take floor action on this important legislation," said Senator Santorum. "The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act addresses the very important issues of animal cruelty, widespread violence and criminal conduct associated with organized animal fights, as well as the spread of bird flu through the global trafficking of cockfighting birds." 
   The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act is supported by The Humane Society of the United States, American Veterinary Medical Association, National Chicken Council, National Sheriffs' Association, and more than 400 state and local law enforcement agencies covering every state in the country.
  A copy of the letter is attached.
