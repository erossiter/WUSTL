SEN. SANTORUM CHAIRS AGRICULTURE FIELD HEARING AT PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation, today chaired a field hearing at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg.  
   "I appreciate this opportunity to hold a Senate Agriculture Committee field hearing at the Pennsylvania Farm Show, which is the ideal outlet for this discussion about protecting agriculture from accidental or intentional biological harm. Pennsylvanians realize that as the number one industry in Pennsylvania, agriculture is very important to our state." 
   The witnesses at today's hearing included representatives of national and state governments, academia, and agribusiness. Witnesses provided a summary of the state of readiness within the areas of their expertise and proposed initiatives to further strengthen and interlock agricultural defenses. 
   "As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am interested in learning more about the level of preparedness in the agriculture sector to protect itself against a biological threat," said Senator Santorum. "After hearing from today's witnesses, I look forward to evaluating the information further and considering options to increase bio security in agriculture."
