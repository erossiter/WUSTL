SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NORTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced federal funding for projects in northwestern Pennsylvania contained in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "I applaud my colleagues in the United States Senate for approving the Health and Human Services funding for projects in northwestern Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum said. "The funding will allow the communities in northwestern Pennsylvania to purchase new equipment, construct new health care facilities, conduct research, and provide the most advanced health care modernizations which will aid in the health and wellness of the citizens of northwestern Pennsylvania." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues have approved this important funding for northwestern Pennsylvania," Senator Specter said. "These projects are vital to ensuring quality primary and emergency care, as well as advanced preventive care measures, for the area's residents." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature.
