SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for several fire companies in central Pennsylvania.  
   "Ensuring that Pennsylvania's first responders get the support they need from the federal government is one of the most important things I do as a United States Senator," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will help to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for our firefighters to better protect Pennsylvania families from fire and fire-related hazards." 
   "Our Pennsylvania firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "This grant will help assure their protection as they safeguard our communities. I commend the Department of Homeland Security for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services." 
   These grants represent the first round of funding from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. 
   This program is designed to provide an opportunity for the U.S. Congress and SLGCP to enhance fire service in locations across the country by providing funding for firefighting operations, firefighter safety, EMS delivery, vehicle purchase, and prevention programs.
