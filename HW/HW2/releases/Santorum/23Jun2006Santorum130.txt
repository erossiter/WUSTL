SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES TYLERSVILLE FISH HATCHERY CONVEYANCE ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, announced today that he introduced S.3551, The Tylersville Fish Hatchery Conveyance Act. If passed, the bill transfers control of the Tylersville Fish Hatchery in Clinton County from the Department of the Interior to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) is an original cosponsor in the Senate and Rep. John Peterson (R-PA-5) introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  
   "Over the past two decades, the state commission has demonstrated a genuine interest and care for the Tylersville Fish Hatchery. They have invested nearly $2 million to maintain and improve the hatchery and during Fiscal Years 2004-2005, Pennsylvania was able to produce over 500,000 adult trout, which was nearly one-seventh of the Commonwealth's total adult trout stock," said Senator Santorum. "As a fellow sportsman, I believe that the state and local government is better suited to manage this facility than the federal government, and both the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agree. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the United States Senate to support this legislation." 
   The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has leased the Tylersville Fish Hatchery from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1984 and has maintained and operated the hatchery for production of adult trout in support of Pennsylvania's trout fishing program. The Commonwealth has been effective in recent years in fostering a vibrant trout population through this hatchery. Pennsylvania has many sportsmen who enjoy fishing our numerous streams and rivers, and this hatchery has been a significant contributor to this recreational pastime.
