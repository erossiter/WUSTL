SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA FIRE COMPANIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved funding for fire companies in Pennsylvania.  
   "This funding will provide our first responders with the training they need to provide communities in Pennsylvania with the best protection possible," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that Pennsylvania's local fire departments and emergency personnel are outfitted with the knowledge and skills they need to teach their communities about fire prevention and safety." 
   "These fire prevention and safety programs will help protect our communities and the Pennsylvania firefighters who risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of millions of people," Senator Specter said. "I commend the Office of Domestic Preparedness for recognizing this priority and for its continued support of the nation's fire services." 
   These Fire Prevention and Safety awards are one-year grants for fire departments throughout the United States to assist national, state, regional, or local organizations in addressing fire prevention and safety issues. The grants are administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) and the United States Fire Administration's Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. Congress has approved $748 million in direct assistance for the 2004 program to support firefighters throughout the country.
