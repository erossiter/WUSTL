SEN. SANTORUM URGES PENNSYLVANIANS TO EXPLORE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today made the following statement:  
   "I would like to take this opportunity to remind Pennsylvanians that the deadline to enroll in the Medicare prescription drug program is quickly approaching-May 15th is just two weeks away. I encourage Pennsylvanians who are eligible for Medicare to explore the benefit and consider enrolling in the program. 
   "As recent surveys have indicated, seniors who have enrolled in the program have been very satisfied with the coverage they are receiving. Seniors are choosing plans that meet their individual healthcare needs, gaining not only savings but the peace of mind of knowing that they are protected against high drug costs." 
   In 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act, which Senator Santorum supported, greatly improving the overall care of America's seniors through the Medicare program by emphasizing preventive measures, including affordable Medicare prescription drug coverage. Seniors can enroll in Medicare with the opportunity to choose from several prescription drug plans in their area. Enrollment can be done over the phone, online or at community enrollment events in the weeks ahead. Pennsylvania can contact any of Senator Santorum's offices for additional assistance and information regarding Medicare drug coverage.
