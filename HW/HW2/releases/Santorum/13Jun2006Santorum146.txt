SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES LEGISLATION REQUIRING CHERRY VALLEY NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE STUDY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced legislation requiring the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to conduct a study evaluating a pristine area in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, called Cherry Valley, for its potential designation as a national wildlife refuge.  
   "Recognized as an environmental treasure by local officials and residents, there is widespread support for Cherry Valley's designation as a wildlife refuge," said Senator Santorum. "It is my hope that by requiring a study, during which the Secretary must consult with landowners and other interested parties, we can fully understand the value of the Cherry Valley area, as well as address any concerns landowners may have." 
   Representative Paul Kanjorski (D-PA-11), has introduced similar legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   Known for its unspoiled wetlands and riparian forests, Cherry Valley provides an important habitat for one of the largest-known populations of the threatened bog turtle, as well as a plethora of endangered and rare species. Also, due to its location along the Kittatinny Ridge Migration Corridor, Cherry Valley is centrally located along an important migration route for eagles and the broad-winged hawk.
