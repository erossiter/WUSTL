SEN. SANTORUM HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS EMBRYO ADOPTION, EMBRYONIC STEM-CELL RESEARCH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, held a press conference today with Members of Congress to introduce families of "Snowflake" babies.  
 "Snowflake" babies are formerly frozen embryos that remained after a couple that pursued in vitro fertilization made their embryos available to other families wishing for children. 
   Rep. Dave Weldon (R-FL); Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ); Rep. Jo Ann Davis (R-VA); Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN) and Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN) joined Santorum. Nine "Snowflake" families also joined the Senator and Representatives, including the Johnson family from Reading, Pennsylvania. 
   "Embryo adoption is a compassionate alternative to the destruction of human embryos through fatal scientific research," said Santorum. "These embryos are adopted into loving homes by parents who have wished for children of their own. Through embryo adoption, families are made whole and a child is given a chance at life." 
   The embryos are implanted into their birth mothers' wombs, resulting in full-term pregnancies and the birth of much-desired children. There is currently legislation in the House of Representatives, H.R. 4682, "The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2004," which would rescind the Bush administration policy limiting federal funding to embryonic stem-cell lines created prior to August 9, 2001. If the legislation passes, this policy would allow taxpayer dollars to be used as an incentive to destroy additional embryos for new stem-cell lines. Senator Santorum and these families stand against such research and for the life-affirming alternative embryo adoption.
