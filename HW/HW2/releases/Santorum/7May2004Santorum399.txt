SEN. SANTORUM COSPONSORS, SENATE PASSES RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF MOTHERHOOD
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, is an original cosponsor of a resolution to protect, promote, and celebrate motherhood.  
 The resolution passed the Senate last night. 
   The resolution calls on Americans to observe the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day by considering how society can better respect and support motherhood. 
   "As we celebrate Mother's Day this Sunday, we not only honor our own mothers for all that they do, but we also celebrate the institution of motherhood," said Senator Santorum. "I thank Senator Sam Brownback for introducing this legislation that expresses the importance of motherhood within the family structure, as well as within society." 
   The resolution acknowledges the unique bond that mothers have with their children, and that a healthy relationship between children and their mothers can influence children's self-esteem and resiliency in dealing with life experiences. It also recognizes and encourages the complementary roles and contributions of fathers and mothers, and that mothers along with their husbands set an emotional example for their children's future relationships. 
   "Motherhood is a precious gift," said Karen Santorum, wife of Senator Santorum. "I feel blessed to be the mother of wonderful children who bring joy into my life, and I am privileged to share the gift of motherhood with women all over the world."
