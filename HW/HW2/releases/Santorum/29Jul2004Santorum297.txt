SEN. SANTORUM TOURS UNITED DEFENSE MEETS WITH EMPLOYEES IN FAYETTE COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today traveled to Lemont Furnace, Fayette County to tour United Defense, LP and meet with employees.  
   After touring the facility and seeing the capabilities of the operations, Senator Santorum spoke with employees at United Defense, LP whose work supports the country's Armed Forces by overhauling, rebuilding and remanufacturing existing military systems such as the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. 
   United Defense, LP re-manufactures and upgrades the Army's Bradley vehicles in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The vehicles are disassembled in Lemont Furnace and upgraded with advanced components. In so doing, United Defense, LP provides the Army with a vehicle that is returned with "zero miles" on the platform. After the vehicles are disassembled in Lemont Furnace they are taken to the company's York, Pennsylvania facility where they are rebuilt and ready to return to service with new components and new technology. 
   "We are pleased to have Senator Rick Santorum visit our Fayette County facility. Senator Santorum has played a key role for many years in ensuring that U.S. troops are equipped with great combat vehicles such as the Bradley, the HERCULES recovery vehicle and the Paladin self-propelled howitzer built by United Defense employees. We are proud of the work we do in our Pennsylvania facilities to provide the best combat vehicle systems for our Nation's defense," said Thomas W. Rabaut, President and CEO of United Defense Industries, Inc. 
   "It is important that our men and women in uniform are prepared and provided with the best equipment to conduct our nation's military missions," said Senator Santorum. "I am proud of the work performed by the employees at United Defense and I commend the company for its support for our servicemen and women over the years."
