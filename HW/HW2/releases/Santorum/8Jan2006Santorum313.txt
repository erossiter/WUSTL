SEN. SANTORUM JOINS SECRETARY NICHOLSON IN BUCKS COUNTY TO ANNOUNCE SITE OF NEW VETERANS CEMETERY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today joined Secretary of Veterans Affairs R. James Nicholson, Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA-6th), and former Rep. Jon Fox to announce the selected site of a new national cemetery in southeastern Pennsylvania. 
   Following a comprehensive review conducted by Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration (VA), the Dolington Tract in Upper Makefield, Bucks County was selected as the site of a new national cemetery that will provide a cemetery for the veterans of Philadelphia. 
   "As the home to over 570,000 veterans and their families, southeastern Pennsylvanians deserve an appropriate resting place, which is why I have been a strong supporter of this initiative," said Senator Santorum. "Every veteran deserves the honor of being laid to rest in a national cemetery located close to the homes of their families and friends." 
   The new national cemetery is expected to be completed in 2007.
