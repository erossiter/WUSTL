SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE 'COPS' GRANTS FOR LEHIGH VALLEY HOSPITAL AND HEALTH NETWORK
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the United States Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) has provided $1.7 million in funding for the Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network to aid in community and law enforcement training. 
   "The Lehigh Valley will utilize this important funding to implement the necessary training to ensure safety within the Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network," Santorum stated. 
   "I am pleased that the COPS office has provided this important funding for law enforcement and community leaders in the Lehigh Valley," Senator Specter said. "The training these programs offer will equip police officers and leaders with the resources they need to keep the Lehigh Valley's communities and schools safe." 
   The Lehigh Valley Hospital and Network will receive $300,000 in Regional Community Policing Institutes (RPCI) funding, which helps training centers throughout the country address the regionally specific crime prevention training needs of law enforcement agencies and communities. 
   The hospital was also granted $1.4 million for COPS in Schools Training, which trains police officers in coordination with school administrators. The program is designed to prevent school violence and improve student and school safety.
