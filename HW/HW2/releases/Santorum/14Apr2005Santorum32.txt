SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON DECISION BY U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION TO CONTINUE RELIEF MEASURES AGAINST UNFAIR TRADE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following comments on the decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to maintain relief measures against certain foreign steel imports:  
   "After a comprehensive review, I am pleased that the International Trade Commission has made the recommendation to continue to maintain trade sanctions on nations who dump hot-rolled steel products," said Santorum. 
   ITC's decision will retain antidumping duty orders relating to hot-rolled steel products from Japan; antidumping and countervailing duty orders relating to hot-rolled steel products from Brazil; and the suspension agreement placing volume and price limitations on imports of hot-rolled steel products from Russia. 
   "The Commerce Department recently confirmed that these foreign producers would continue dumping their products into the U.S. market if the duty orders were revoked. Without continuation of these duty orders, history would repeat itself and the flood of unfairly traded steel from these countries would again cause our domestic producers irreparable harm," said Santorum. 
   "Our steel industry is a leader in innovation, using state-of-the-art facilities and investing in new technologies," said Santorum. "Free trade must be fair trade, so that U.S. steel companies can compete with the rest of the world."
