SEN. SANTORUM RECEIVES RECOGNITION FOR PROTECTING PENNSYLVANIA MANUFACTURING JOBS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, recently received the "National Association of Manufacturers Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence" from the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) for his efforts in the United States Senate to protect Pennsylvania's manufacturing jobs.  
   The National Association of Manufacturers recognizes that favorable votes on issues in Washington have a direct impact on jobs and the economy in Pennsylvania. The NAM further acknowledges that Senator Santorum's support for the manufacturing agenda has helped advance the effort to maintain U.S. leadership in the global economy, expand economic growth, and assist the private sector in creating jobs and raising living standards. 
   "Pennsylvania's manufacturers are a crucial component of the economy of our Commonwealth," said Senator Santorum. "One of my top priorities is ensuring that Pennsylvania's economy remains strong and continues to grow, which is why I will continue to support measures that are beneficial to manufacturers in Pennsylvania." 
   Senator Santorum received this national award in recognition of his 100 percent pro-manufacturing voting record. This marks the fifth time Senator Santorum has received this award and his 100 percent voting record on behalf of manufacturers places him in an exclusive group of Congressional leaders.
