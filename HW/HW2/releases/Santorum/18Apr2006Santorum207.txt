SEN. SANTORUM ISSUES STATEMENT ON TEL AVIV TERRORIST BOMBING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding yesterday's deadly terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv: 
   "Yesterday's attacks reaffirmed that we need to continue to remain vigilant in our efforts to eradicate terrorists and terrorist organizations. My thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured in the attack - and my deepest sympathies are with the friends and family of those whose loved ones were killed.
   "The Israeli people are committed to peace and the goal of Israel and Palestinian peoples living together in peace cannot be reached with a government that includes terrorists or that supports terrorist action."
