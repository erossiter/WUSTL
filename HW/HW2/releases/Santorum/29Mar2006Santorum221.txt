SEN. SANTORUM ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF LOBBYING REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding Senate passage of the Lobbying Reform bill: 
   "Although I believe that this legislation does not go far enough, I am pleased that a lobbying reform bill passed the Senate in a bipartisan fashion. I was disappointed yesterday that my colleagues chose to cut off debate that would have allowed other important amendments, such as provisions to deal with travel on corporate jets and earmarks.
   "As I have said consistently throughout this process, my first concern when dealing with lobbying reform is to make Congress more accountable to the people it represents and to provide our constituents with more information and insight about our political process. I believe this bill is a good step in that direction."
