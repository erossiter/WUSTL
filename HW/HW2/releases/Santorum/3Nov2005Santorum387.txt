SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS ADDITIONAL AMTRAK FUNDING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the Senate passed the Amtrak Reauthorization amendment to S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act (DRORA).  
   Senator Santorum cosponsored the amendment, which provides $11.4 billion to address capital needs, equipment upgrades, and to fund Amtrak operations. Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) was also a cosponsor of the amendment. 
   "As someone who frequently relies on Amtrak for transportation, I know firsthand that it truly is our nation's premier passenger rail service and plays a crucial role in our transportation infrastructure," said Senator Santorum. "Amtrak operates nearly 120 daily trains through Pennsylvania, and its hub in Philadelphia is the corporation's second largest and busiest station in the country, serving more than 3.7 million riders each year. This amendment provides necessary funding that will help Philadelphia remain at the center of the commerce activities taking place on the east coast." 
   "I was pleased to support this amendment which will provide federal assistance for rebuilding efforts and assist with Amtrak's capital improvements which I believe will result in business growth and independence for Amtrak," Senator Santorum concluded.
