SEN. SANTORUM AWARDED FOR EFFORTS TO REDUCE BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today received the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his consistent voting record to reduce federal spending, taxes, and debt.  
   "I am honored to receive this award from the National Taxpayers Union," Senator Santorum said. "I am proud that my voting record in the Senate reflects my effort to keep taxes low, allowing Pennsylvanians to keep more of their hard earned money." 
   "Senator Santorum's pro-taxpayer score was one of the best in the entire Senate," said John Berthoud, President of the National Taxpayers Union. "By consistently voting to reduce federal spending, taxes, and debt, Senator Santorum has truly earned the title, 'Taxpayers' Friend.'"
