SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA COMMERCE JUSTICE STATE PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved federal funding for Pennsylvania projects.  
   "This funding will allow important projects to receive the necessary resources to make improvements and advances in law enforcement in Pennsylvania," Santorum stated. "It is important that we do all we can to ensure the safety of every Pennsylvanian." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee have approved the funding for these important projects in Pennsylvania," said Senator Specter. "These programs will raise the quality of life for Pennsylvanians by improving the law enforcement and emergency services provided to the state and local communities." 
   Funding approved by the Committee includes: 
   -$250,000 for the Clarion County Geographic Information System. This system would serve County residents by tracking the location of emergency 9-1-1 calls and provide information to the emergency service providers in a timely manner. 
   -$200,000 to the Township of Derry for equipment upgrades to assist current law enforcement. The Township encompasses Hershey, whose tourist attractions draw millions of visitors each year and places enormous strain on the current police Department. 
   -$200,000 to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Non-Violence, in Philadelphia, for a Mentoring/Career Development and Life Skills program which will enable students to work alongside business and industry mentors. These mentors will work with students to pursue higher education, financial aid, internships, and job opportunities. 
   -$100,000 to the Millerstown Borough Police Department in Perry County, for law enforcement expenses in order to cope with the increased caseload and support community programs. 
   -$100,000 to the Borough of Waynesboro, Franklin County, for equipment upgrades to the Public Safety Management System. 
   -$100,000 to Clinton County's Action Team Against Drugs Impacting Our Youth to assist in their efforts against narcotics production and distribution. 
   The funding is part of the Commerce/Justice/State appropriations bill, which is pending final passage by both chambers of Congress, followed by the President's approval.
