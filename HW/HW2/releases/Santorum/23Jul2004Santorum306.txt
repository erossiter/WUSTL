SENS. SPECTER, SANTORUM ANNOUNCE FINAL PASSAGE OF FUNDING FOR WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA PROJECTS
  Sens. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the U.S. Congress has provided final approval of funding for several defense-related projects in the Western Pennsylvania area for fiscal year 2005.  
   Senator Specter said, "I am pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate have approved this funding for these important projects. These projects, key to our nation's defense, will be invaluable in our continuing war against terror. I am confident that these projects will go far in supporting the men and women who serve our country." 
   "This funding is critical in improving our national defense and equipping our troops with the most up-to-date information, technology and equipment," said Senator Santorum. "These projects will provide Pennsylvania with the opportunity to take the lead in defense-related research and development." 
   The U.S. Congress gave its final approval last night to the FY05 Defense Appropriations Bill. The House and Senate approved the measure in separate votes. The legislation now goes to the President for his signature. Funding was approved for the following projects: 
   * $14 million to Mine Safety Appliances Co. in Westmoreland and Butler counties for the Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI). With the recent change in the Basis of Issue to the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), the Army will be purchasing significantly more helmets. The ACH had an integrated communication system and it is estimated that 1 in 24 helmets require the MICH communication system. 
   * $2.8 million to DRS Technologies in Cambria and Philadelphia counties to increase interoperability requirements for naval battle groups. This funding will assist the Navy in obtaining innovative avionics integration solutions which will reduce the size, weight and volume in legacy and new design platforms. 
   * $3.5 million to ChemImage Corporation in Allegheny County for Chemical Imaging for Food and Water Safety, which will enhance, validate and deploy sensing technology and processes, based on proven Raman Chemical Imaging, for rapid identification of pathogens in water and food supplies. 
   * $2.1 million to Alcoa in Allegheny County for the FMTV Weight/Cost Reduction Initiative, to develop and implement a technology for producing lightweight vehicle structure components and assemblies for the Army Medium Tactical Vehicle Program. This technology has been proven to substantially reduce costs and weights of structures in the automotive and aerospace arenas. 
   * $2.5 million to the National Tissue Engineering Center (NTEC), in Allegheny County, which serves as a collaborative research and entrepreneurship facility dedicated to accelerating the position of the United States as an international leader in tissue engineering. It is responsible for the generation of defense-related regenerative therapies. 
   * $1.5 million for the University of Pittsburgh, Katz Grad School (Panther Lab Works) in Allegheny, Washington, and Greene counties for the IEE Technology Transfer Project, which serves as a unique technology accelerator which will focus on intrusion detection systems, regional command systems, and mass notification systems. 
   * $2 million to the University of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County for Orphan Disease Drug Discovery, to identify and develop small molecules with drug-like attributes for the treatment of so-called "orphan" and "neglected" diseases that affect smaller but still significant numbers of patients in the military and civilian sectors. 
   * $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Allegheny County for PASIS (Perpetually Available and Secure Information Systems Research, Training and Education). The program is developing technologies to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security essential to government communication and intelligence. 
   * $1.75 million for Robotics Foundry in Allegheny County for the Robotics Greenhouse Initiative, which would allow an industry-led consortium of leading corporations and research institutions to direct the future, collaborative development efforts of key enabling mobile robotics technologies and support disciplines such as systems engineering skills and standards for interoperability. 
   * $1.65 million for the University of Pittsburgh / UPMC in Allegheny County for the Military Force Protection and Injury Prevention Program, which will implement an injury control model in coordination with the Army to reduce traumatic knee injuries in troops during both basic combat training and advanced individual training, thus enhancing the overall combat readiness of our military by developing and maintaining physical characteristics required for efficient performance during demanding tasks that challenge the neuromuscular system.
