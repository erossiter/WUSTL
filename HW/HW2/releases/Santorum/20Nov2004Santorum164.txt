SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS APPROVAL OF FISCAL 2005 FUNDING FOR STORM SEWER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT IN PENN HILLS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced the approval of fiscal year 2005 federal funding for a storm sewer improvement project in Penn Hills.  
   The funding is included in the Environmental Protection Agency portion of the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
   "This $200,000 will provide the resources necessary to make improvements to existing water and sewer systems in Penn Hills," said Santorum. "These necessary upgrades will ensure safe and environmentally responsible sewer processes for my fellow residents of Penn Hills." 
   "When former Penn Hills Mayor Bill DeSantis first asked me to help improve the aging water and sewer infrastructure, I committed to assist in any way that I could. I am pleased that for the second consecutive year the Congress has approved this funding," said Santorum. 
   Santorum first wrote a letter on April 15, 2003 to VA/HUD Subcommittee on Appropriations Chairman Kit Bond (R-MO) requesting funding for the water and sewer infrastructure upgrades. Santorum then followed up on April 30, 2004 with a request for fiscal year 2005 funding. To date Santorum has secured $550,000 to help rehabilitate the Penn Hills water and sewer infrastructure.
