SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF CHERTOFF AS SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement following Senate confirmation of Michael Chertoff as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security:  
   "I applaud my colleagues in the Senate for confirming Judge Chertoff as the next Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Judge Chertoff has been a key leader in working cooperatively with federal, state, and local law enforcement officials to help ensure quality standards among America's first responders. He has also been on the front lines of the war on terror. 
   "Judge Chertoff has been a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a federal prosecutor in New York City, and a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. 
   "The Department of Homeland Security was created to ensure a comprehensive, unified effort to protect the American people against the new dangers that threaten our country in the wake of September 11, 2001. Fellow Pennsylvanian, Secretary Tom Ridge, has served honorably as the pioneer Secretary in this department. Secretary Ridge worked tirelessly to improve airline security, enhance the protection of our borders and ports of entry, and safeguard the nation's infrastructure. I have every confidence that Judge Chertoff will continue to serve our nation with integrity."
