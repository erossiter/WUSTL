SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE $11 MILLION FOR PENNSYLVANIA TO REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGED FROM JUNE FLOODING
  Sens. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will provide over $11 million to assist Pennsylvania in repairing or rebuilding damaged infrastructure affected by the June flooding.  
   On June 29, 2006, Senators Santorum and Specter urged President Bush to make the formal major disaster declaration for the Commonwealth, making it eligible for federal funds to help communities recover from the severe storms and flooding that began June 23, 2006. 
   "After touring the flood damaged areas of Pennsylvania earlier this summer, I saw firsthand the severe damage and need for federal funding," said Senator Santorum. "I am pleased that FEMA has provided the means necessary to repair and rebuild these critical pieces of infrastructures." 
   "I am pleased that FEMA has awarded this important federal funding to Pennsylvania," Senator Specter said. "These funds will assist in repairing the severely damaged bridges and roadways resulting from the June flooding" 
   Funding has been approved for several projects throughout the Commonwealth, including: 
   * Susquehanna County has been approved for $1,054,217 to repair a county bridge. 
   * Hartford Township in Susquehanna County has been approved for $331,887 to rebuild a local bridge. 
   * Auburn Township in Susquehanna County has been approved for $278,530 to repair a damaged bridge. 
   * Union Township in Luzerne has been approved for $274,702 to repair a damaged road. 
   * Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has been approved for $192,029 to repair a roadway and shoulder. 
   Through the Public Assistance (PA) Program, FEMA provides state and local governments with supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for disaster-related damages to their facilities, or for the cost of providing debris removal and emergency protective measures during and after a disaster. FEMA provides 75 percent of the costs of most eligible PA projects. For additional information, go to www.paflooding.state.pa.us.
