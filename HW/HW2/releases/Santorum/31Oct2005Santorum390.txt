SEN. SANTORUM URGES SECRETARY RICE, U.N. TO GET TOUGH WITH SYRIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, recently sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice regarding an upcoming meeting with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.  
   In the letter, Senator Santorum urged Secretary Rice to press Secretary-General Annan for the imposition of additional sanctions on Syria. Senator Santorum also urged Secretary Rice to impress upon Secretary-General Annan that travel to Iran or meeting with any leaders of that country could be very dangerous. 
   "Given the message of hate towards a key U.S. ally, meeting with President Ahmadinejad or others in his government at this time would not only be unwise, but potentially extremely dangerous," the letter states. 
   Finally, Senator Santorum requested that Secretary Rice work with President Bush and Congress to ensure passage of S. 333, the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005. Senator Santorum is the original sponsor of this legislation, which will set in place standards that will make it more difficult for the Government of Iran to have access to revenue and foreign investment to support terrorism and the development of weapons of mass destruction. It will also support democratic forces inside of Iran.
