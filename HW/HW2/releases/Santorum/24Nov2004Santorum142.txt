SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced federal funding for projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Agriculture portion of the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  
   "I am pleased that Pennsylvania has received this funding for agriculture projects," Senator Santorum said. "Agriculture is vital to our Commonwealth and it is essential that we continue to develop new technology in this industry so Pennsylvania can remain a competitive leader in agriculture." 
   "These programs will strengthen the state's agricultural industry by developing innovative technologies to improve production and management of Pennsylvania's farms," Senator Specter said. "I applaud my colleagues for funding these agricultural projects that are fundamental to keeping Pennsylvania's economy strong." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   Funding has been approved for the following projects: 
   * $1 million through the Agriculture Research Service for the study of Biomedical Materials in Plants. This funding will allow for the continued research at Thomas Jefferson University and elsewhere of tobacco and other plants as a medium to produce vaccines and other biomedical products for the prevention of many human and animal diseases. This technology has the potential to shift a great deal of tobacco production to a vehicle for preventing, curing, and treating viruses and cancers in place of smoking, chewing, and other current uses. (Philadelphia County) 
   * $659,000 for the Milk and Dairy Safety and Quality Research program at Penn State University. Penn State is recognized as a leader in research concerning the production of safe and wholesome dairy products. This funding will help researchers at the University better understand the microbiology of the Listeria organism and make progress in determining the process and handling parameters that will ensure a safe milk supply. (Centre County) 
   * $575,000 for Eastern Regional Research Center Hides and Leather Research conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture. This Center, located in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, has been developing new methods of tanning cattle hides produced in the U.S. to process them in a cost effective, environmentally sensitive fashion that enhances their value and is competitive in world markets. This is the only USDA facility that conducts research on these agricultural products. (Montgomery County) 
   * $472,000 for Dairy Farming Management and Profitability projects at Penn State University. This funding will benefit projects focusing on the economic and social dimensions of dairy farming, risk analysis, the economic impact of implementing voluntary animal health programs, development management, and the adoption of technology, in an attempt to help farmers increase their profitability. (Centre County) 
   * $355,000 for Penn State University's Improved Dairy On-Farm Management Practices program. Last year, Congress provided funding for work completed in Pennsylvania to research new and improved on-farm management practices. Innovative research directed at the farm level is essential to sustain the nation's dairy industry. This year's funding provides for further research in areas such as manure management techniques, odor abatement, induced lactation, and animal health program management improvements. (Centre County) 
   * $336,000 for Agricultural Entrepreneurial Alternatives for Small Farmers at Penn State University. This program delivers farm- and community-level educational programs and assistance. Farm-level programs focus on developing alternative enterprise opportunities, generating business and marketing plans, and providing market research and feasibility studies. Community-level programs focus on assessing and strengthening the local agricultural business climate and developing regional marketing alliances. (Centre County) 
   * $222,000 for Cheyney University Urban Aquaculture. This funding will implement a research program, which will focus on studying the production, processing, packaging, and distribution of fish in an urban setting. Cheyney University will work with the University of Pennsylvania and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in this endeavor. (Delaware County) 
   * $192,000 for Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at the Rodale Institute. This project studies the cycling of nutrients in soil and crops with a special emphasis on the development of indices for measurement of soil health. The original goal of this research was to understand the cycling of nutrients from animal agricultural production systems through soil and water into crops and back to food for animals or directly to humans in the case of vegetable production. (Berks County) 
   * $50,000 for The National Center of Excellence in Foods and Nutrition Research (NutriCore). This program will implement a national approach to increase levels and results of nutrition research and development. NutriCore is be a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in Indiana with regional hubs in Pennsylvania, California, Texas, Mississippi, and Iowa. The Center would operate under a cooperative research and development agreement with USDA, which would provide direction and oversight. (York County) 
   * $50,000 for Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture's Center for Dairy Excellence. This funding will be used to expand the On-Farm Profit Team Program, which provides education and training on improved dairy farm management. (Dauphin County) 
   * $46,000 for the Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial for fungi research. This funding will help provide for ongoing, long-term field research on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi research and other soil-based investigations. AM fungi benefits crops through increased nutrient uptake, increased resistance to diseases and drought, and improved soil water holding capacity. The Farming Systems Trial is a randomized, split block, replicated trial for conventional and organic farming systems in place at The Institute for side-by-side comparisons since 1981. (Berks County) 
   * $25,000 for the Research Institute for Family Health and Wellness at Marywood University. The establishment of this institute will improve family health in a three-county area - Lackawanna, Luzerne, and Wyoming. Marywood University will focus on nutrition and obesity; fitness; tobacco use; geriatric-related concerns; chronic diseases; and food safety. (Lackawanna County)
