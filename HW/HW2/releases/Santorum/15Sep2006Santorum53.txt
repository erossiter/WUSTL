SEN. SANTORUM HONORS HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, cosponsored a Senate resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic Americans to the strength and culture of the United States. The Senate passed the resolution last evening.  
   "Hispanic Americans have contributed greatly to our country and to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania," said Senator Santorum. "I am proud to support this resolution. I encourage all Americans to take this opportunity to recognize Hispanic Heritage Month by honoring the great contributions Hispanic Americans have made to our country." 
   Hispanic Heritage Month will be celebrated in the United States from September 15, 2006 through October 15, 2006. In 1968, Congress authorized President Lyndon B. Johnson to proclaim a week in September as National Hispanic Heritage Week. The observance was expanded in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to a month-long commemoration. 
   Senator Santorum also cosponsored last year's Senate resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month.
