  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, commented on the Department of Veterans Affairs site selection for a Veterans Clinic in Warren County. 
   "As a nation we observed Veterans Day yesterday, paying tribute to the important and valiant contributions of our veterans," said Santorum. "I am proud that today we can honor our pledge to the men and women who served in the Armed Forces. This new clinic will provide an opportunity for veterans in northwestern Pennsylvania to have access to timely and quality health care." 
   "I am pleased the Department of Veterans Affairs has announced the selection of a site for a Veterans Clinic in Warren County. The men and women of our armed services have made tremendous sacrifices for our Nation and it is vital we that uphold our commitment to care for them. This clinic will be a tremendous resource for the nearly 5,200 veterans in Warren and Elk counties," said Specter. 
   There are approximately 5,200 veterans in Warren and Elk counties, and 1,482 of these veterans receive their primary care from the Erie VA. This new clinic, located at the Farm Colony Professional Building in North Warren, Pennsylvania, will be the primary care site for 2,700 veterans. By opening this new clinic the VA will be able to provide faster, more convenient care.
