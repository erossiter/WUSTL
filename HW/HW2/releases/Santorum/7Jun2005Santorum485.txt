SEN. SANTORUM JOINS CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO CALL FOR BIPARTISAN COOPERATION TO SAVE, STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, joined Rep.  
 Jim Kolbe (R-AZ), Rep. Sam Johnson (R-TX), and former Rep. Jim Slattery (D-KS), for a discussion about the need for bipartisan cooperation to save and strengthen Social Security. Former Reps. Tim Penny (D-MN) and Charlie Stenholm (D-TX), both advisors to For Our Grandchildren, a Social Security reform and education project, hosted the bipartisan event. Also participating in today's discussion were college students representing "Students for Saving Social Security," a grassroots network of students at more than 90 campuses nationwide. 
   "Today's discussion reinforces that we have the opportunity and responsibility to work in a bipartisan fashion to protect current and near retirees, while ensuring sustainable financial security and peace of mind for future generations," Senator Santorum said. "I am hopeful that Congress will work together for a bipartisan solution rather than passing Social Security's troubles on to our children and grandchildren. It is our responsibility to make the changes necessary to Social Security now, while we have the chance to ensure retirement security for all Americans." 
   "Social Security: Coffee and Conversation is an honest effort to move beyond partisan politics and discuss the future of Social Security with those who have such an enormous stake in this dialogue-America's young people, " said former Congressman Tim Penny, who served on the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security and is the advisory board chair of For Our Grandchildren. 
   "Whichever reform options are adopted, the effort needs to begin with honest and open dialogue," said Jonathan Swanson, co-founder of Students for Saving Social Security.
