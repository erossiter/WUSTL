SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CRESCENT PARK DENTAL CLINIC
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announces $100,000 in funding for the Warren County Chamber of Business and Industry for Warren General Hospital to expand the coverage and capabilities of the Crescent Park Dental Clinic.  
 The funding is included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
   "I am pleased that the Crescent Park Dental Clinic will now have the ability to expand its services to extend dental care to more individuals," said Senator Santorum. "This funding is important to continuing the efforts of the Crescent Park Dental Clinic, as it will enable youths throughout Warren and Forest counties to have greater access to quality dental care through expanded hours and increased staffing levels within the clinic." 
   "On behalf of Warren General Hospital, I would like to thank Senator Santorum for his efforts in obtaining this grant of $100,000. The funding is earmarked for the needs of the Crescent Park Dental Clinic. The clinic has had a tremendous impact on providing dental services to those in the community who were previously unable to access care. The Senator's recognition of this need in our community, and working to improve health care for our region, is greatly appreciated," said John P. Papalia, CHE, Chief Executive Officer, Warren General Hospital. 
   The Crescent Park Health Clinic was established in 1993 to meet a critical need in the community to provide primary medical dental services to Warren and Forest County residents, primarily for those who have limited access to care due to lack of financial resources, specifically youths.
