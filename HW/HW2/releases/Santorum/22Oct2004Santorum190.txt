SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON BUSH SIGNING INTO LAW AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement today after President Bush signed into law H.R. 4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004:  
   "I am pleased that President Bush has signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which will boost the nation's economy and create job opportunities for hard-working Americans. This legislation complements President Bush's tax relief package, which laid the foundation for continued economic growth and job creation. 
   "In March 2004 the European Union imposed a five percent tariff on a number of U.S. products. These tariffs are currently 12% and would have continued to increase 1% each month, jeopardizing $4 billion in U.S. exports. However, because of the American Jobs Creation Act these tariffs on nearly 100 American-made products will be repealed. 
   "Through the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, specific measures will be put in place that will be beneficial to manufacturers and small businesses in Pennsylvania and create an opportunity for the United States to be more competitive in the global market. 
   "Economic figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor today reveal that our economy continues to show signs of steady improvement and growth. In Pennsylvania, the most recent unemployment rate of 5.3 percent remains lower than the national average. In September 4,600 new jobs were created in Pennsylvania, bringing the total to more than 47,600 new jobs created since September of last year. 
   "I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
