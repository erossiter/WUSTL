SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE 15 ADDITIONAL COUNTIES ADDED TO PRESIDENT'S DISASTER DECLARATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter, the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, announced today that President Bush has added fifteen additional counties ravaged by Tropical Depression Ivan to the Disaster Declaration. The fifteen additional counties are: Bedford, Bradford, Clarion, Clinton, Columbia, Fulton, Jefferson, Juniata, Mifflin, Monroe, Northumberland, Pike, Snyder, Union and Wayne. 
   Earlier this week President Bush declared a major disaster for twenty-six counties in Pennsylvania, including: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Blair, Bucks, Butler, Cameron, Carbon, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Green, Huntingdon, Indiana, Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Northampton, Perry, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Washington, Westmoreland, and Wyoming Counties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is currently assessing the damage of the remaining six counties that have yet to be made part of the President's declaration. 
   By declaring a major disaster for Pennsylvania, President Bush enables affected residents to be eligible for federal assistance that can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration may also be available to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance. For additional information on assistance that could be provided visit: http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=14088. 
   Residents in these counties can contact 1-800-621-FEMA for assistance.
