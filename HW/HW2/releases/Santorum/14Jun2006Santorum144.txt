SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO DEAL WITH IRANIAN THREAT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 National Defense Authorization Act that deals with the growing threat that the government of Iran poses to the rest of the world.  
   "The need for this amendment is clear," said Senator Santorum. "Iran's nuclear ambitions cannot be ignored any longer. We must, and can, do more to discourage foreign investment in Iran's energy sector, a sector that provides Iran with hard currency. In addition, this amendment re-affirms my belief that the United States must take an active role in promoting democracy in Iran. Our long term goal must be to foster the development of a government in Iran that is not actively supporting terrorism, developing nuclear weapons, repressing its own people and openly seeking to 'wipe Israel off the face of the Earth.'" 
   Senator Santorum's amendment enhances the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act and codifies sanctions, controls and regulations in place against Iran. Additionally, the amendment authorizes the imposition of mandatory sanctions on entities that aid Iran in acquiring or developing weapons of mass destruction. 
   In keeping with Senator Santorum's belief that the United States should be doing more to promote democracy in Iran, the amendment incorporates provisions from S. 333, the Iran Freedom and Support Act, also introduced by Senator Santorum. S. 333 authorizes financial and political assistance to pro-democracy forces inside and outside Iran. Specifically, the amendment authorizes $100 million for pro-democracy efforts in Iran. 
   Lastly, the Santorum amendment includes a provision from S. 1736, the Iranian Nuclear Trade Prohibition Act, which prohibits the import of nuclear fuel assemblies into the U.S. from foreign entities that sell these same components to Iran.
