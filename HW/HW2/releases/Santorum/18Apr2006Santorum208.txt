SEN. SANTORUM, REP. DENT DELIVER $10 MILLION OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR AMERICAN PARKWAY BRIDGE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA 15), today in Allentown, Lehigh County, presented a check for $10 million of federal funding to city and state officials toward the construction of the American Parkway Bridge in Allentown. Sen. Santorum worked with Sen. Specter to include $2 million of funding for the American Parkway Bridge in the Senate Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), a transportation funding authorization bill. 
   "I am pleased to join Congressman Dent to deliver federal funds for the American Parkway Bridge which will connect center city Allentown to the rest of the Lehigh Valley and alleviate traffic congestion on Route 22. Connecting the communities of the Lehigh Valley is fundamental to economic development and regional growth," said Senator Santorum.
   Senator Santorum fought to keep Pennsylvania a donee state under the bill's formula, which means the Commonwealth will receive more from the Highway Trust Fund than it contributes. The previous version of the bill, considered in the 108th Congress, made Pennsylvania a donor state with a rate of return of $.97 for every dollar it paid into the fund. The SAFETEA-LU bill Senator Santorum helped to pass ensures that Pennsylvania will never receive less than $1.13 for every dollar contributed.
