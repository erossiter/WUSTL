SEN. SANTORUM ISSUES STATEMENT ON AMERICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, JOB CREATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement on U.S. economic growth and job creation:  
   "As we celebrate America's independence this weekend, let us rejoice in the good news that since we passed the President's Job and Growth tax relief package last year, America's economy is growing stronger every month. 
   "The U.S. Department of Labor announced that more than one and a half million jobs have been created since August 2003, with 112,000 payroll jobs created in June alone. The national unemployment rate has declined from its peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003 to 5.6 percent. These rates are below the average of each of the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. 
   "In line with the national trend, Pennsylvania has seen a steady decline in unemployment rates since April 2003. To continue this trend, Congress must act now to push a jobs agenda so that every Pennsylvanian in need of a well-paying job can find one. 
   "Stable jobs, strong businesses and industries, and consumer confidence all have a role in maintaining America's powerful economy. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth, cuts bureaucratic red tape for small businesses and creates job opportunities for hard-working Americans."
