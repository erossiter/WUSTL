SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON PASSING OF STATE SEN. THOMPSON
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding the passing of State Sen.  
 Robert Thompson: 
   "My wife Karen and I were deeply saddened to learn of Senator Thompson's passing. Senator Thompson served Chester and Montgomery Counties since 1995, but began his remarkable career in public service more than 30 years ago. I have had the privilege of working with Senator Thompson on many occasions and knew him to be a true leader - dedicated to serving his constituents. Above all else, Senator Thompson was a loving father and grandfather. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time."
