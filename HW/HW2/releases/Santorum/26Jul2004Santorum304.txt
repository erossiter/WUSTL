SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR SEPTA COMMUTER RAIL LINE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, have announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Transit Administration, has approved a $555,646 grant for intermodal improvements at the Croydon and Levittown Train Stations on Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (SEPTA) commuter rail line.  
   These funds will be used for the engineering, design, and renovation of the Croydon and Levittown Stations. Improvements at the Levittown station include high-level platforms, upgrades for persons with disabilities, replacement of the station building, bus shelters, bus loop, pedestrian tunnel rehabilitation, and sump pump replacement. At the Croydon station, plans for improvements are currently in the engineering and design phase. 
   "This funding will provide safety, accessibility and structural improvements which will increase commuter comfort and convenience," said Senator Santorum. "It is important that we continue to improve and expand Philadelphia's mass transportation facilities so that more people are encouraged to use SEPTA services." 
   "Improvements to the SEPTA commuter rail lines are important to Philadelphia's growth and development," Senator Specter said. "I am pleased the Department of Transportation has provided this funding that will improve accessibility, safety, and comfort for riders."
