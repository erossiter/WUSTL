SEN. SANTORUM SUPPORTS EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION SYSTEM AS ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, yesterday declined to support an amendment to the Immigration Reform bill offered by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) that modified the Employment Verification System in the current bill.  
   "I joined several of my colleagues in voting against this amendment which I believe weakens the provisions already contained in the Immigration Reform bill establishing an Employment Verification System," said Senator Santorum. "I have consistently said throughout this debate that I strongly support the establishment of an Employment Verification System; however, I cannot support an amendment that will cause that system to fail. When the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is the Cabinet official in charge of implementing this system, calls this amendment 'unworkable,' we must take his words very seriously." 
   The Immigration Reform bill already includes a provision to establish an Employer Verification System, a system supported by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Grassley amendment was not supported by the Department of Homeland Security, which determined the amendment "would result in problems with workability and implementation of enforcement provisions." 
   "We need a strong and workable employer verification system," said Senator Santorum. "I appreciate the hard work and honest effort to strengthen these provisions, but cannot support a system that would actually prevent an employer from doing what we must require them to do - verify the legal status of their employees. This is a key element in the debate. We must hold employers accountable, and we must provide an effective and practical way for them to determine the status of their employees. The Grassley Amendment does neither."
