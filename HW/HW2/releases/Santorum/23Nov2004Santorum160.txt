   "I applaud my colleagues in the United States Senate for approving the Health and Human Services funding for projects in southeastern Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum said.

   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   Projects to receive funding include: 
   * $1 million for the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network in Philadelphia for renovation, construction, and equipment. The renovations will focus on efficiency and patient-centered use of the building's third floor. The new multi-specialty model will maximize utilization of the facility and improve patient flow. The plan for Phase II is to complete renovations for the first and second floors where they will provide services in obstetrics, and liver and kidney transplantation. 
   * $1 million for Temple University Health System in Philadelphia to complete construction of the Ambulatory Care Center, which will improve access to health care for patients and strengthen community health outreach programs.

   * $1 million for the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia to construct the new Wills Clinic, an ophthalmology clinic, which is designed as a "virtual" clinic in order to achieve the efficiencies of a single central location. This new model makes the sub-specialists more accessible to clinical patients. 
   * $900,000 for Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia to construct a new electrophysiology and cardiac catheterization laboratory.

   * $350,000 for Abington Memorial Hospital in Abington to construct a new 360,000 sq. ft. five-story building. The new facility will provide room for an expanded emergency room, an increase from 15 to 23 operating rooms, 100 additional beds, improved maternity facilities and comprehensive teaching and conference center. 
   * $250,000 for Holy Redeemer Health System in Huntingdon Valley to build a Center for Health Living for the senior population.

   * $250,000 for Nazareth Hospital in Philadelphia to develop stroke treatment and prevention program for African American seniors.
