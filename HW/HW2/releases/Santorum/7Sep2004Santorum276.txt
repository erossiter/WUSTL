SEN. SANTORUM PRESENTS FUNDING FOR POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM IN WESTMORELAND COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was joined by Greg Phillips, District Manager of the Westmoreland Conservation District, as he presented a check for $100,000 to the Westmoreland Conservation District for the implementation of a comprehensive Non-Point Source (NPS) Pollution Prevention Education Program.  
   "Senator Santorum played the key role in helping the Westmoreland Conservation District receive this latest grant by linking the Conservation District's educational program needs with the appropriate federal funding source," said Phillips. "This funding came at a critical time. We wanted to launch a quality program, and thanks to Senator Santorum we are able to do just that." 
   The Westmoreland Conservation District is an agricultural organization that has had a presence in southwestern Pennsylvania for nearly 50 years. Santorum worked to secure $100,000 from the Department of Education through the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill passed earlier this year. 
   The funding will be used by the Westmoreland Conservation District to implement a new education program, as well as provide for a full-time educator to develop and present the Center's programs. This funding will also provide a part-time assistant to support that effort. 
   "This funding is important to southwestern Pennsylvania because it will provide individuals with the information, tools, and motivation they need to incorporate good conservation practices into their daily lives," said Santorum. "Conservation education is important to minimize pollution and create a healthier environment and quality of life in Pennsylvania."
