SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDING TO FIGHT CRIME IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference announced that Congress has approved funding for projects in Pennsylvania.  
 The funding is contained in the Fiscal Year 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. 
   "It is essential that we do everything within our power to ensure the safety of every Pennsylvanian. I am pleased that my colleagues have approved $211,000 that I worked to secure for the Montgomery County Combined Law Enforcement Agency Network (CLEAN)," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will help CLEAN make Norristown a safer place to live, work and raise a family. Montgomery County District Attorney Castor identified this program as a top priority for funding and I hope that it will be used by the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office to more effectively reduce crime in Norristown." 
   The Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2006 CJS bill on November 16, 2005 and by the House of Representatives on November 9, 2005. The bill will now be sent to the President for his signature. 
   "CLEAN has been the single most effective anti-crime, anti-blight program helping to combat the urban problems facing Norristown. In these times of local and county budget constraints, I applaud Senator Santorum for recognizing that a community cannot revitalize without making its residents and business owners feel safe. I was, frankly, concerned that we would not be able to continue our efforts in Norristown. Senator Santorum really came through for us," said Bruce L. Castor, Jr., Montgomery County District Attorney.
