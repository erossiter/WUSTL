SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR HURRICANE RELIEF
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced Senate passage of the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Bill, which includes $11.6 billion in disaster assistance for states like Pennsylvania hit by Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne last month.  
 The bill passed in the Senate unanimously. 
   Included in the disaster package is $6.5 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), $929 million for the Small Business Administration, $1.2 billion for emergency highway and road repairs, and $608 million for agricultural and rural assistance. 
   The FEMA funding will benefit Pennsylvania disaster assistance through the following three programs - Individual Assistance, Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation. Individual Assistance provides funding for home repair and replacement, and rental assistance. Public Assistance provides funding for roads, bridges and other public infrastructure. Through the Hazard Mitigation program, FEMA will set aside a portion of disaster assistance costs to help alleviate the cost of future storms and floods within the Commonwealth.

   Yesterday, Senator Santorum spoke on the Floor of the United States Senate expressing the importance of passing this legislation so that those in need of disaster assistance can begin to rebuild their homes and their lives.
