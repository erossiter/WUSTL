SEN. SANTORUM HONORED FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was recently presented with two awards recognizing his work on behalf of small businesses.  
   Senator Santorum was awarded the Small Business Advocate Award by the Small Business Survival Committee. This award is presented annually to Members of Congress who have demonstrated a commitment to protecting small business and advancing entrepreneurship by consistently voting for key small business legislation. 
   The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's largest small business group, also recently honored Senator Santorum as a Guardian of Small Business. 
   "Santorum is a stalwart champion of small business, having stood strong on a number of key small business votes in the 108th Congress," NFIB President and CEO Jack Faris said. 
   "I am honored to receive recognition from the Small Business Survival Committee and the National Federation of Independent Business," Santorum said. "Small businesses are vital to the prosperity of our economy in Pennsylvania and across the country, and add so much to the character of our nation. It is essential that the government work to provide incentives that stimulate small business growth and work towards creating an environment that allows private enterprise to operate in a free marketplace, unfettered by overreaching government regulation."
