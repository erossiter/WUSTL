SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SECURITY OF WASHINGTON, D.C. SENATE OFFICE
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding the status of his Washington, DC office:  
   "There has been a lot of media attention given to Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton's decision to close his Senate office in Washington, DC due to intelligence information that he and other members of the U.S. Senate have reviewed. 
   "Please let me reassure the people of Pennsylvania that your safety and the safety of my staff are my first and foremost concerns. At this time, I have not received any intelligence information that would indicate a specific or imminent threat to the Capitol or Senate buildings that would lead me to close my office in Washington. 
   "Our nation's Capitol is a beautiful and historic place to visit. Thousands of Pennsylvanians visit the building and its adjacent office buildings every year. The U.S. Capitol Police maintain high security and take appropriate measures, such as screenings at building entrances, to help ensure the safety of all visitors to our nation's Capitol. We want those visiting the Capitol to have a safe and enjoyable experience. 
   "If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington at (202) 224-6324. You may also contact any of my Pennsylvania offices: Altoona, (814) 946-7023; Erie, (814) 454-7114; Harrisburg, (717) 231-7540; Lehigh Valley, (610) 770-0142; Northern Tier, (814) 274-9773; Philadelphia, (215) 864-6900; Pittsburgh, (412) 562-0533; or Scranton, (570) 344-8799."
