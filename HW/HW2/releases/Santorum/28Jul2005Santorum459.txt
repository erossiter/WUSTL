SEN. SANTORUM ENCOURAGES SENATE PASSAGE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN MEMORIAL COMMEMORATION ACT OF 2005
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today greeted Dr.  
 Dennis Wint, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, who testified at a hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks regarding the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial Commemoration Act of 2005. 
   "I appreciate Dr. Wint's willingness to come before the committee to discuss the importance of this legislation," said Senator Santorum. "It is our nation's obligation to honor the legacy of a distinguished scientist, statesman, inventor and diplomat by making certain that our national memorial to Benjamin Franklin remains intact and accessible to the public." 
   The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial Commemoration Act of 2005 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide a grant to The Franklin Institute to rehabilitate the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial and develop an interpretive exhibit relating to Benjamin Franklin. 
   "The time has come to pass this legislation and provide federal support to help The Franklin Institute ease the burden of maintaining this national treasure so that generations of Americans may continue to enjoy this magnificent tribute to his legacy," said Senator Santorum.
