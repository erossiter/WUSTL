SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING TO REPAIR ROADS DAMAGED BY TROPICAL DEPRESSION IVAN IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta announced today that the federal government will provide $494,000 as a down payment for emergency relief funds available to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) in the wake of recent floods.  
   During a visit to Noblestown Road, near Robinson's Run Creek outside Pittsburgh, to assess damage by Tropical Depression Ivan, Rick Capka, Deputy Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, said that funds would be immediately available for repairs to federal-aid roads and highways in the Keystone State. 
   "Today we follow through on the President's commitment to help rebuild areas damaged by Ivan," Capka said during a news conference in Collier Township, west of Pittsburgh. "This is a down payment to help Pennsylvania begin rebuilding ravaged roads from the recent hurricane." 
   "While visiting Carnegie earlier this week, I saw the need for this funding to restore the local roads and highways that were washed out and destroyed by Ivan," said Santorum. "I am pleased to see that the federal government is able to provide funding for Pennsylvania when there are so many folks along the East Coast affected by Ivan. This is only the first installment of federal aid to Pennsylvania, and I am optimistic that more will come." 
   The funds for Pennsylvania come from the Federal Highway Administration's emergency relief fund. This money is available to states to reimburse for damages to federal-use roads during a range of emergencies, including hurricanes. The Bush Administration also is requesting an additional $600 million in highway relief funding to pay for additional damages incurred recently from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.
