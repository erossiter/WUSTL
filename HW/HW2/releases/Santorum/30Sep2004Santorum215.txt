SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON VOTE ON MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT IN HOUSE
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement subsequent to the vote on the Marriage Protection Amendment in the House of Representatives:  
   "I applaud the leadership of the House for bringing the Marriage Protection Amendment to a vote. The House vote of 227 to 186 and the overwhelming state ballot initiative votes show the tremendous popular support of this amendment. Although the Members were not able to achieve the two-thirds majority that is needed to pass an amendment to the Constitution, I am encouraged to know that House Members were able to engage in a thoughtful debate and go on record with their positions to preserve marriage as a union between one man and one woman. I look forward to considering the Marriage Protection Amendment again in the next Congress. 
   "Marriage is vital to the stability and preservation of our society in which a father and a mother raise and nurture children. If we redefine what marriage is, then we send a message to the next generation that children do not need mothers and fathers. 
   "Marriage is a fundamental institution of this country that we have to protect from attack by unelected judges who want to redefine marriage and amend the Constitution by legislating from the bench. The process of amending the United States Constitution enables the American people to have a voice and offer their critical support for adopting a constitutional amendment to defend and protect the institution of marriage."
