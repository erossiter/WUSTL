SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE PROJECTS IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the U.S. Senate has approved funding for defense-related projects in northeastern Pennsylvania. The funding is contained in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill.  
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense and I am proud of the people and organizations that help to make our state a top competitor for defense projects that create jobs and strengthen our economy," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will enable these important defense projects in northeastern Pennsylvania to move forward in the effort to achieve a more secure nation." 
   "A number of Pennsylvania companies are enhancing the way our Armed Forces operate," Senator Specter said. "These projects will go far in supporting the brave men and women who serve our country. I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate have recognized the valuable contribution these projects will make to our nation's defense." 
   Projects which have been approved to receive funding in northeastern Pennsylvania include: 
   * $3.2 million to Osram Sylvania in Bradford County for SLEUTH Tungsten Heavy Alloy Penetrator and Warhead Development. This program will incorporate unique technologies and processes in the development and manufacture of tungsten alloy powders and components, to aid in Army research on controlled fragmentation of airburst warheads as well as significant performance improvements to tungsten heavy alloy kinetic energy penetrators; 
   * $2.1 million to Gentex Corporation in Lackawanna County for Self-Detoxifying Materials in Chemical Biological Protective Clothing. Presently, military personnel are protected from chemical and biological agents through specialized materials incorporated with activated carbon, which provide good protection against chemical agents but do nothing to detoxify the chemicals they absorb or to protect against biological agents other than through minimal mechanical filtration. Recent research has indicated that fabrics which incorporate reactive nanoparticles are capable of destroying many chemical and biological hazards. This funding will provide for a more extensive field assessment and user evaluation of these fabrics; 
   * $1.4 million to Medico Industries Inc., in Lackawanna County, for a Medium Caliber Metal Parts Upgrade program. This program will provide Medico Industries, Inc. with state-of-the-art production rated equipment to establish a capability to manufacture medium caliber metal parts, providing the Department of Defense with a second source supplier for some medium caliber items. Because of the company's proximity to the Picatinny Arsenal, establishing this capability will also enable Medico to assist in metal part process development, which takes place at the Arsenal's Center for Manufacturing Science and Technology; 
   * $1 million to Vital Probes in Lackawanna County for a Bacterial Ghost Vaccine for the Influenza Virus. This funding will provide for research on inexpensive vaccines against current and emerging strains of influenza that do not require needles for administration or refrigeration for storage; 
   * $1 million for Industrial Facilities Modernization of Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Lackawanna County. These improvements will provide for the replacement, upgrade and modernization of obsolete or worn out production equipment and plant infrastructure; 
   * $1 million to Exeter Architectural Products in Wyoming, to fund the upgrade of security and anti-terrorism efforts at Department of Defense schools. These funds will build on previously authorized and appropriated funds for maintenance, repair, and improvement of existing windows and doors to protect against such events as natural disasters, accidental breakage, unauthorized entry, and assault; 
   * $1 million to Osram Sylvania in Bradford County for Process and Product Improvements for Current and Legacy Small and Medium Caliber Armor Piercing Ammunition. The project will focus on enhancing the penetration capability of current and legacy tungsten alloy projectiles via chemistry, mechanical properties and/or applying processing innovations that do not affect form, fit or function of the components. These new or unique tungsten heavy alloy matrices and practical manufacturing processes will take into account the economy of production as a prime consideration.
