SEN. SANTORUM VISITS MON VALLEY HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON COUNTY TO VIEW PROGRESS ON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today toured the Monongahela Valley Hospital in Washington County and discussed the Hospital's plans for an $8 million expansion of their emergency department.  
   Santorum was joined by Louis J. Panza Jr., President and CEO of Mon Valley Hospital; Donna Ramusivich, Senior Vice President overseeing the emergency department expansion project; and Patrick J. Alberts, Chief Operating Officer. 
   "We are deeply appreciative of Senator Santorum's visit and his interest in our health system and his support for the emergency department expansion in particular," said Panza. "The event was beneficial in many ways - Senator Santorum had the opportunity to see first-hand what we're doing at Mon Valley Hospital and we had the opportunity to discuss the project personally with him." 
   The Senator supported the Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill which provided $250,000 to Mon Valley Hospital through the Health Resources and Services Administration. The hospital announced plans to expand its emergency department in August 2003. 
   The project, which is expected to be completed late next year, will double the capacity of the emergency department by increasing the number of treatment from 12 to 24. "I commend Senator Specter and my colleagues for supporting the expansion of the Mon Valley emergency department through the Fiscal Year 2004 funding," said Santorum. "This expansion project will provide patients with private cubicles with glass slide-away doors for increased privacy, comfort, and confidentiality during their stay in the hospital. It is important that the residents of the Mon Valley are provided with quality health care and the most up-to-date health facilities."
