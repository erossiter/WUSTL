SEN. SANTORUM SPONSORS RESOLUTION TO ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO PREPARE FOR THEIR LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, introduced a Senate resolution designating the week of November 5 through 11, 2006 as "Long-Term Care Awareness Week."  
   "Long-Term Care Awareness week will provide a meaningful opportunity for Americans to learn more about planning for long-term care for themselves and their loved-ones and to understand the options that are available to receive the best possible care to meets their needs," said Senator Santorum. "I strongly believe that individuals in need of long-term care should have the opportunity to age with respect and dignity - receiving the services of their choice in the setting of their choice. We know that most Americans are not prepared to meet their own or their loved ones' long-term care needs. It is my hope that families across our nation will take time during this week to plan how they might best prepare to meet their future long-term care needs." 
   In February 2006, Senator Santorum introduced legislation to encourage care giving and long-term care planning for Pennsylvania seniors. If passed by Congress, the Aging with Respect and Dignity Act (S. 2281) would assist caregivers who are providing for their loved ones. S.2281 also encourages financial planning so more Pennsylvanians have options in choosing the best possible long-term care that matches their needs. 
   Pennsylvania has one of the largest senior populations in the nation, and the number of Pennsylvanians age 85 and older is projected to increase by thirty-eight percent between 2000 and 2015. Long-term care can range from basic help with chores and activities in the home, assistance with activities of daily living in an assisted living facility, or highly skilled care in a nursing facility.
