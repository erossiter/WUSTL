SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER REQUEST FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR EIGHT ADDITIONAL COUNTIES
 Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, today wrote President Bush requesting his aid in providing federal assistance to an additional eight Pennsylvania counties ravaged by Tropical Depression Ivan. 
   The letter today supplements a previous letter requesting assistance for thirty-four counties in Pennsylvania. The eight additional counties are: Blair, Bucks, Cameron, Carbon, Greene, Huntingdon, Lehigh, and Somerset. 
   President Bush yesterday declared a major disaster for nineteen counties in Pennsylvania. Counties included in the declaration are: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Indiana, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lycoming, Northampton, Perry, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Washington, Westmoreland and Wyoming. 
   By declaring a major disaster for Pennsylvania, President Bush enables affected residents to be eligible for federal assistance that can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration may also be available to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance.
