SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SEVEN ADDITIONAL COUNTIES ADDED TO PRESIDENT'S DISASTER DECLARATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-PA), the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, announced today that President Bush has added seven additional counties ravaged by Tropical Depression Ivan to the Disaster Declaration. The seven additional counties are: Blair, Bucks, Cameron, Carbon, Green, Huntingdon and Lehigh. 
   Earlier this week, President Bush declared a major disaster for nineteen counties in Pennsylvania, including: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Indiana, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lycoming, Northampton, Perry, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Washington, Westmoreland and Wyoming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is currently assessing the damage of the remaining 21 counties that have yet to made part of the President's declaration. 
   By declaring a major disaster for Pennsylvania, President Bush enables affected residents to be eligible for federal assistance that can include grants to help pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other serious disaster-related expenses. Low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration may also be available to cover residential and business losses not fully compensated by insurance.

   Residents in these counties can contact 1-800-621-FEMA for assistance.
