SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PENNSYLVANIA ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Rick Santorum, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement in reaction to today's U.S. Department of Labor announcement about economic growth in Pennsylvania:  
   "A new unemployment figure released today reveals that Pennsylvanians who are seeking employment are finding jobs in the Commonwealth. 
   "In July, the Pennsylvania unemployment rate decreased to 5.3 percent, down from 5.6 percent in June, demonstrating that under President Bush's economic leadership, the Commonwealth's economy is strong and getting stronger each month. 
   "Nationwide, more than 2.3 million jobs have been created since August 2003. We've seen the national unemployment rate continue to decline from its peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003. In fact, in July the rate decreased to 5.5 percent, the lowest unemployment rate since October 2001. This decline reveals that average, hard-working Americans are finding work. At 5.5 percent, the unemployment rate is below the average of the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. 
   "Pennsylvanians work hard every day to make better lives for their families and make the Commonwealth a vital and competitive contributor to our national economies. I will continue to work to pass legislation that promotes economic growth and creates job opportunities for hard-working Pennsylvanians and Americans across the country."
