SEN. SANTORUM TOURS MIFFLIN COUNTY TO PRESENT FUNDING FOR WASTEWATER TRANSFER STATION IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, traveled to Mifflin County today to present Granville Township Municipal Authority with a check for $200,000, which he secured in the FY 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The funding, included as part of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) appropriations, will be used for upgrades to Granville Township's wastewater transfer station.  
   This transfer station, Pumping Station #1, is located in the Mifflin County Industrial Park. Without the improvements to the pump station the future growth of the Mifflin County Industrial Park would be limited. The industrial park has about sixty acres on which they can continue to develop and expand current facilities, which will create more jobs for Mifflin and surrounding counties. 
   "Without this funding from the EPA, Granville Township citizens would have incurred a sharp rise in sewage treatment fees and the growth of the Mifflin County Industrial Park would have been severely inhibited," said Senator Santorum. "The transfer station will be totally replaced with new pumps, a new control center, new emergency power transferring equipment and an entirely new electrical system." 
   The current sewage pumping station that collects water from the local industrial park and sends it to the treatment plant to be processed is outdated and expensive to maintain. The pumping station was installed about 30 years ago; some parts are no longer manufactured or are too expensive to purchase. 
   "We have been waiting for years for this funding to come through and Senator Santorum made it happen," said Larry Craig, Sewer Water Manager for Granville Township. "The Senator really came through for us, as a result of this funding our immediate needs as well as our future needs have been met."
