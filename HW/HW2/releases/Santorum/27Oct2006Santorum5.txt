SEN. SANTORUM INDUCTED INTO U.S. BORDER CONTROL'S HALL OF FAME
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was recently named to U.S. Border Control's Hall of Fame for the 109th Congress for his excellent voting record and leadership on border and immigration issues.  
   "Senator Santorum has distinguished himself by scoring 92 percent on all the Senate bills and amendments that U.S. Border Control has selected in its voting analysis of legislation critical to reforming America's border and immigration policies," USBC Chairman Edward I. Nelson said. "The people of Pennsylvania are fortunate to have such a Senator working for their best interests." 
   "I agree that we should not grant amnesty to illegal aliens," said Senator Santorum. "We cannot reward those who have broken the law and threaten the health of our nation's social safety net--Social Security--by adding millions of new beneficiaries to an already burdened program. Amnesty devalues the legal immigration process and rewards illegal behavior. Securing our borders is an important first step in protecting our nation's security and reforming our immigration process." 
   U.S. Border Control is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization, established in 1988. U.S. Border Control educates the public on issues related to protecting the sovereignty of the United States. These include the establishment and maintenance of effective border integrity systems, economic policies, national defense practices, and immigration policies focusing on ending illegal immigration by securing the nation's borders and reforming immigration policies.
