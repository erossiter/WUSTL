SENS. SPECTER, SANTORUM ANNOUNCE FINAL PASSAGE OF FUNDING FOR CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA PROJECTS
  Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the U.S. Congress has provided final approval of funding for several defense-related projects in Central Pennsylvania for fiscal year 2005.  
   Senator Specter said, "I am pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate have approved this funding for these important projects. These projects, key to our nation's defense, will be invaluable in our continuing war against terror. I am confident that these projects will go far in supporting the men and women who serve our country." 
   "This funding is critical in improving our national defense and equipping our troops with the most up-to-date information, technology and equipment," said Senator Santorum. "These projects will provide Pennsylvania with the opportunity to take the lead in defense-related research and development." 
   The U.S. Congress gave its final approval last night to the FY05 Defense Appropriations Bill. The House and Senate approved the measure in separate votes. The legislation now goes to the President for his signature. Funding was approved for the following projects: 
   * $8.5 Million for General Dynamics in York, Luzerne and Lackawanna counties for Precision Guided Mortar Munition (PGMM), a laser-guided 120-mm mortar with extended range capability. PGMM will more than double the range of current 120-mm mortars and, for the first time, give them the capability to engage point targets long range with vastly reduced collateral damage and logistical support required. 
   * $3.5 Million for General Dynamics in York County for Mid Range Munition (MRM) Life Cycle Improvements. MRM integrates a technical breakthrough multi-mode seeker and a state-of-the-art multi-purpose warhead into a 120-mm tank cartridge. MRM will give the Army increased range, with the ability to destroy targets in all weather and through sophisticated countermeasures. It is effective far beyond the range of today's conventional tank ammunition and increases survivability of tank crews. 
   * $2.8 million to the Pennsylvania National Guard for the Northeast Regional Counterdrug Training Center. Established in 1998, the Northeast Counterdrug Training Center (NCTC) provides no-cost counterdrug training and education to law enforcement and drug demand reduction specialists in 18 northeastern states. 
   * $1.7 Million for Pennsylvania State University in Centre County for Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LUUV) Test Bed. The LUUV will greatly expand the mission capabilities of the SSGN and other submarine platforms especially near coastline and littoral regions of the world. The LUUV test bed will be used to develop concepts of operation for the SSGN and explore flexible payload options, which efficiently take advantage of the considerable volume offered by the planned retrofit of the SSBN Trident missile tubes.
