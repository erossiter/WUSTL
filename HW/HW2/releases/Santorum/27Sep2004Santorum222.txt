SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE HOUSING REVITALIZATION FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, announced today that the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Healthy Homes and Lead-Based Paint has approved funding for four Pennsylvania organizations to implement housing hazard reductions.  
   "These projects are important to the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians," Santorum said. "I am pleased that resources have been made available to eliminate toxins and dangerous substances in homes and community buildings throughout the Commonwealth." 
   "I am pleased the Department of Housing and Urban Development has approved this important funding for the residents of Pennsylvania," said Senator Specter. "Lead and allergens are invisible hazards that can cause serious harm to adults and children. This funding will be used to help identify and remove existing hazards." 
   The following are among the recipients: 
   * $4,000,000 to the City of Philadelphia to continue the success of the current Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Demonstration Project, which has completed lead hazard control work in 74 homes since February 11, 2004. The hazard control work will be prioritized for families with children who have an elevated blood lead level and will target areas of concentrated poverty and housing deterioration. 
    * $2,951,644 to the City of Pittston to focus on control mechanisms to address lead hazards on impact surfaces and surfaces to be disturbed during rehabilitation of Section 8 housing units in the next 42 months. Additionally, the City will train contractors on hazard mitigation, provide educational programs and test housing units. This program will be targeted to families with young children at risk of lead poisoning in the City of Pittston, the City of Pottsville, and Lackawanna, Monroe, Schuylkill, Susquehanna and Wyoming counties. 
   * $1,000,000 to the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA), to reduce in-home hazards that cause asthma including dust mites, mold spores and insect infestations. In coordination with the community-based American Community Partnership in Philadelphia, the Drexel University School of Public Health and Tenant Support Services, Inc., PHA will address the serious problem of asthma in school-age children, specifically those who currently reside in Housing Choice Voucher facilities. 
   * $910,875 to Healthy Homes Resources in Pittsburgh to focus on identifying, assessing and controlling the in-home hazards that negatively impact the health of asthmatic children such as cockroach, rodent, pet and dust mite allergens, pollen, mold and moisture, environmental tobacco smoke, combustion gases, dust and household chemicals.
