SEN. SANTORUM WELCOMES SCRANTON PRIEST TO WASHINGTON, TO OBSERVE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today recognized the 55th annual National Day of Prayer. Events to honor the National Day of Prayer were held across the country, and Sen. Santorum spoke at a ceremony in our nation's capital about recognizing the importance of prayer in America.  
   "Prayer is and always has been a defining characteristic of the fabric of our nation," said Senator Santorum. "Although, as Americans, we are blessed with the freedom to differ in our personal beliefs, it is right to observe a day when we can come together in peace and celebrate the role that prayer has played in the development of our great nation. Today, I ask that all Americans pray for our country and for the men and women in the United States Armed Forces who fight for our freedom everyday." 
   Senator Santorum also welcomed Father Charles Connor of Scranton to Washington, D.C. Father Connor is the Historian of the Diocese of Scranton and Rector of Saint Peter's Cathedral in Scranton. He traveled to Washington D.C. today to participate in the events honoring the National Day of Prayer. President Bush personally welcomed Father Connor at a ceremony at the White House this morning. 
   The National Day of Prayer was established as an annual event in 1952 by a joint resolution of the United States Congress.
