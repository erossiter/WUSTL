SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON RELEASE OF 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today following the release of the 9/11 Commission report:  
   "I thank the 9/11 Commission for their hard work over these past several months. As the Commission has noted in its Report, there are systemic changes that must be made in order to prevent further terrorist attacks against the U.S. - both domestically and overseas. "I am certain that Congress will devote considerable energy and resources to fully vetting the Commission's analysis and its recommendations. "This Report reaffirms the prudent measures advocated and carried out by the Bush Administration since 9/11, such as the establishment of a Department of Homeland Security, and passage of the PATRIOT Act. "It also includes significant recommendations to better organize the U.S. government and intelligence community to protect the U.S. from further terrorist attacks. Again, these recommendations need to be thoroughly reviewed by both the Administration and Congress, and together, I am confident that we can continue to protect the U.S. and its citizens, and enable the U.S. to continue efforts in the war on terrorism. "I also look forward to reviewing the upcoming report by the intelligence review commission chaired by former Senator Robb and Judge Silberman."
