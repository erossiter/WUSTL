SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE OVER $49 MILLION IN HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a Senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is providing Pennsylvania $49,335,020 in federal funding to enhance homeland security capabilities.  
   "The ability of local and federal agencies to work together seamlessly in the event of a terrorist attack is critically important to saving lives. I applaud the Department of Homeland Security for their continuing efforts to improve coordination and communication at the local level," said Senator Santorum. "This funding will not only allow for greater preparedness - but it will also strengthen Pennsylvania's first responders' capabilities to respond to disaster." 
   "I am pleased the Department of Homeland Security has provided this important funding to enhance homeland security capabilities in Pennsylvania," said Senator Specter. "The events of September 11th and Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated the need for cities and states to be in a constant state of preparedness. This funding seeks to protect the residents of Pennsylvania from future terrorist attacks and also prepare them in the event of a disaster." 
   The total funding of $49,335,020 will be broken down into five funding subcategories: 
   * $12,810,000 for the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) to fund State Homeland Security Strategy implementation activities to build capability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events; 
   * $11,050,000 for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) which focuses on law enforcement and public safety activities to prevent terrorist attacks through such activities as intelligence gathering, information sharing, and target hardening; 
   * $24,390,000 for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) to fund designated high-threat, high-density urban areas against acts of terrorism and catastrophic events; 
   * $464,660 for the Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) to plan and prepare for large-scale medical response for any catastrophic event; 
   * $620,360 for the Citizen Corps Program (CCP) which promotes citizen preparedness and engages citizens in all-hazards prevention, protection, response and recovery.
