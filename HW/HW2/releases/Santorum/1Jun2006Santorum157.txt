SEN. SANTORUM, TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW ANNOUNCE $306 MILLION FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today joined U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund Director Arthur A. Garcia, to announce $306 million in tax credits awarded to Pennsylvania organizations under the 2006 round of the New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC). 
   "I am so pleased that Secretary Snow could join me in Philadelphia today to announce the wonderful news that five organizations headquartered in Pennsylvania have been selected to receive a total of $306 million," said Senator Santorum. "As the Secretary is aware, I was deeply disappointed that in the 2005 round - none of the awardees was based in Pennsylvania, so this is very welcome news indeed. The NMTC Program is a terrific program that creates flexible financing options that encourage investment in and development of low-income communities. I congratulate all five of the Pennsylvania-based organizations and I look forward to seeing the positive effect that this additional funding will have on the Commonwealth."  
   "Job creation and investment in our economy are the cornerstones of President Bush's pro-growth policies. Today's announcement encourages even more jobs and progress in some of the neediest communities across the country," Secretary Snow said. 
   The NMTC Program was established by Congress in December 2000. It provides individual and corporate taxpayers with a credit against federal income taxes for making qualified equity investments in investment vehicles known as Community Development Entities (CDEs). Substantially all of the taxpayer's investment must be used by the CDE to make qualified investments supporting certain business activities in low-income communities. The NMTC Program attracts private-sector capital investment into the nation's urban and rural low-income areas to help finance community development projects, stimulate economic growth and create jobs. 
   The five Pennsylvania awardees are: 
   * $2 million for the Northside Community Development Fund in Pittsburgh. The Northside Fund will use its NTMC allocation to provide debt and equity at below-market rates to fuel the development of new and renovated homes within Pittsburgh's Northside neighborhood. The NMTC allocation will enable the Northside Fund to attract real estate businesses into the distressed, urban community; leverage $28 million for the development of for-sale housing; produce a cost savings of $10,000 for each homebuyer by reducing financing costs; and attract new residents and stabilize the population of an urban community which lost over 12 percent of its population, and experienced a 32 percent increase in housing vacancies between 1990 and 2000. 
   * $60 million for Commonwealth Cornerstone Group (CCG) in Harrisburg. CCG will provide loans and equity capital investments for business expansion, mixed-use development, for-sale housing, and community facilities in low-income communities throughout the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The flexibility offered by the NMTC Program will enable CCG to create funding packages that include reduced origination fees, longer amortization and/or interest-only periods, reduced rate debt and the use of equity and/or equity-like products that would not otherwise be available to meet the needs of the projects, their communities and the investors. 
   * $75 million for PNC Community Partners, Inc. (PNCCPI) in Pittsburgh. PNCCPI will make loans and investments to finance commercial real estate, charter school facilities, early child-care facilities, for-sale housing, and CDFI-type organizations and projects. Loans will be structured with innovative terms and underwriting standards not otherwise available under normal market conditions, such as below market interest rates of up to 400 basis points less than its controlling entity offers, loan to value ratios as high as 90 percent, debt service coverage ratios as low as 1.10 to 1, amortizations schedules greater than 20 years, and interest only periods of up to 7 years. 
   * $75 million for The Reinvestment Fund (TRF) in Philadelphia will utilize the NMTC allocation in three niches: select charter schools in the Mid-Atlantic region, supermarkets in underserved areas of Pennsylvania, and other eligible commercial real estate developments across in its Mid-Atlantic service area. It will provide combination of flexible debt and below market rate equity. Its products will include such features as no origination fees, 100 percent loan to value products for non-profits and 90 percent loan to value products for other borrowers, and leasehold and subordinate collateral positions. 
   * $94 million the Sovereign Community Development Company (SCDC) in Reading will focus its NMTC investments on business, real estate (mixed-use, office, industrial, retail, historic, and community facilities) borrowers, and CDFIs with CDE designations. The allocation will allow SCDC to make investments in the forms of loans with more flexible terms and conditions, including reduced interest rates of 200 to 400 basis points below market; debt coverage ratio floors of as low as 1.10; loan-to-value limits of as high as 90%; no origination fees, and more flexible credit standards such as lower credit scoring thresholds. SCDC has also designed a product to extend the benefits of the NMTC beyond the seven year compliance period.
