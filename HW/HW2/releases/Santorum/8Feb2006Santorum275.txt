SEN. SANTORUM APPLAUDS PROTECTION OF FOOD STAMP PROGRAM
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today praised his Congressional colleagues and President Bush for signing into law the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), which did not include a proposed provision that would have cut food stamps. During consideration of this legislation, Sen. Santorum strongly advocated for shielding nutrition programs from funding cuts to continue to provide a safety net for needy Americans.  
   In December, Senator Santorum joined 14 of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, urging him to protect the food stamp program and reject any proposed cuts. 
   "I am pleased that Congress was able to find savings without making any cuts to the food stamp program," said Senator Santorum. "I was concerned that the proposed cuts by the House of Representatives would impact low-income individuals who benefit from the food stamp program. Having traveled to each and every county in my state and heard firsthand from my constituents about this vital program, I understand that food stamps are essential for some families to put food on the table. It is important that we not neglect those who are less fortunate, who rely on food stamp benefits for basic nourishment."
