SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ON ENERGY PRICES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, commented on today's joint hearing with the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Today's hearing addressed rising energy prices and corporate profits.  
 Executives from major oil companies as well as state attorneys general testified at the hearing. 
   "Today's hearing presented an opportunity to get answers to the questions the American people are asking about burdensome energy prices - particularly gas prices and home-heating costs. I am pleased to see Congress finally begin to ask energy companies questions about the rising energy prices that have affected millions of Pennsylvanians," said Senator Santorum. 
   Senator Santorum sent a letter to Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), Chairman of the Senate Committee of Energy and Natural Resources in September, requesting that he invite a panel of oil company executives to testify before his committee regarding gasoline prices. A copy of the letter is attached. 
   Continuing his efforts to reduce gas prices, last month Senator Santorum introduced the Gasoline Affordability and Security (GAS) Act of 2005. If passed, the GAS Act will establish the first federal, nationwide law against price gouging, providing Americans with the protection they need and deserve. Additionally, this law will create a Federal Trade Commission task force charged with assisting state attorneys general investigating price gouging and developing state price gouging laws. 
   Since being elected to Congress in 1990, Senator Santorum has also been a consistent supporter of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that assists countless low-income and senior citizens meeting their home energy needs.
