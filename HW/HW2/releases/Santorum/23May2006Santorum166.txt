SEN. SANTORUM COSPONSORS STOLEN VALOR ACT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that he is a cosponsor of S. 1998, the Stolen Valor Act, bipartisan legislation that would allow individuals who falsely claim to be recipients of military medals to be fully prosecuted. Under current law, only those who fraudulently wear or manufacture counterfeit medals can be prosecuted.  
   "I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation that will allow imposters to be prosecuted," said Senator Santorum. "Recent news stories have revealed disgraceful, and all too frequent occurrences of individuals falsely portraying themselves as having been awarded a military medal or decoration. This shameful act takes the prestige away from the men and women who selflessly fought to defend our nation's freedoms and rightfully earned our military's highest honors." 
   The Stolen Valor Act would expand the current law against wearing, manufacturing, or selling military decorations or medals without legal authorization to include prosecution against individuals who falsely claim to have been awarded any military service medals or badges. The bill also calls for an increase in the penalties for violations if the offense involves a Distinguished Service Cross, an Air Force Cross, a Navy Cross, a Silver Star, or a Purple Heart.
