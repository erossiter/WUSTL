SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON AMENDMENT TO ENCOURAGE CHARITABLE GIVING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued a statement regarding a proposed amendment to S.Con.Res. 18, the Budget Resolution, to express the sense of the Senate regarding tax relief to encourage charitable giving incentives:  
   "I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment to the Budget Resolution and join me in affirming that the Charitable Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act, which represents a part of the President's faith-based initiative, will spur charitable giving and assist faith-based and community organizations that serve those who are less fortunate. I strongly support these incentives for charitable giving which would benefit charities around the country who continue to struggle, and would provide significant assistance to those in need." 
   In the 108th Congress, the bipartisan CARE Act passed the Senate by a vote of 95-5 and companion legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408-13. From October 2003 until the end of the 108th Congress, Republican leadership attempted nine times to form a conference committee on the House and Senate charitable giving bills, but was unable to move to final action on this compassionate initiative due to the objection of Senate Democratic leaders.
