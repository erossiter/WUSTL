SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES SENATE APPROVAL OF VISA WAIVER PROGRAM AMENDMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the Santorum-Mikulski-Frist amendment has won Senate approval. The amendment will allow "anti-terror" allies, such as Poland, to become pilot program participant countries in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) while ensuring there is no compromise of national security.  
   "I am pleased that my Senate colleagues have voted to approve this important amendment which will bring a close ally and partner in the War on Terror, Poland, into probationary participation in the Visa Waiver Program as they work towards full compliance," said Senator Santorum. 
   The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State administer the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens from 27 countries to visit the United States as tourists without visas. This program would allow the families of Polish Americans to travel to the United States to attend weddings, funerals, and other special occasions without significant cost or the delay of waiting for a visa. 
   "There are nearly nine million Americans of Polish ancestry currently living in the United States and more than 824,000 residents in Pennsylvania. This amendment will make it easier for friends and families of Polish Americans to visit the United States," continued Senator Santorum.
