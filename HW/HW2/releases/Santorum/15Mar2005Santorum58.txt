SEN. SANTORUM HONORED FOR DEDICATION TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, was recently acknowledged by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and the Pennsylvania Public Transportation Association (PPTA) for his record of strong support of public transportation.  
   "The 'T' light rail line in Pittsburgh was my daily means of transportation for many years while I worked downtown, and I understand the importance of maintaining the various forms of public transportation for those who rely on it every day," said Senator Santorum. "I am proud to receive this award on both the national and state level, and I will continue my efforts to serve as an advocate for transportation projects throughout the Commonwealth and support efforts to improve public transportation across the country." 
   "On behalf of the PPTA, we are extremely grateful for the hard work and determination that Senator Santorum has consistently shown in his support of public transportation which is of vital importance to the economy and the residents of Pennsylvania," said Mike Imbrogno, Chairman of the Board for the Pennsylvania Public Transportation Association. 
   "The American Public Transportation Association recognizes Senator Rick Santorum for his tireless advocacy for public transportation," said APTA president William W. Millar. "He has contributed to the growth of public transportation on both the national and local level." 
   As a member of the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Santorum has played an important role in securing funding for various transportation projects throughout Pennsylvania.
