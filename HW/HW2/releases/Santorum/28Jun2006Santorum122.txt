SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON 46 PENNSYLVANIA COUNTIES BEING DECLARED DISASTER EMERGENCY AREAS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today issued the following statement regarding the disaster emergency in 46 Pennsylvania counties.  
   "Earlier today, our Governor declared the following counties a disaster emergency: Adams, Armstrong, Bedford, Berks, Blair, Bradford, Bucks, Carbon, Centre, Chester, Clinton, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Franklin, Fulton, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Juniata, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mifflin, Monroe, Montgomery, Montour, Northampton, Northumberland, Perry, Philadelphia, Pike, Potter, Schuylkill, Snyder, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, Union, Wayne, Wyoming and York counties. Our prayers go out to the many Pennsylvanians that are struggling to keep their lives and their property safe as we witness historic levels of flooding throughout our Commonwealth. I commend the Governor for authorizing state agencies to use available resources and personnel necessary to cope with the magnitude of this emergency. 
   "I applaud local and state emergency responders and volunteers for pitching in to help their fellow Pennsylvanians. For those who need immediate shelter, they should contact the American Red Cross which has opened 11 shelters in the northeast and is providing shelter and meals to at least 100 people. More information can be found at www.redcross.org where you can type in your zip code to find the nearest shelter."
