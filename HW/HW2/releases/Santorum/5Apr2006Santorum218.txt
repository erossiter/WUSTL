SEN. SANTORUM INTRODUCES POLISH VISA WAIVER AMENDMENT
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today introduced an amendment which would designate Poland as a program country under the visa waiver program established under Section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Sen. Santorum introduced similar legislation during both the 108th and the 109th Congress. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) is an original cosponsor of the amendment. 
   "There are nearly nine million Americans of Polish ancestry currently living in the United States and more than 824,000 reside in Pennsylvania, which is why I am proud to once again support this legislation. My amendment will make it easier for friends and families of Polish Americans to travel to the United States. It is my hope that my Senate colleagues will agree to this amendment, and we can strengthen ties with Poland as a staunch twenty-first century ally to the United States," said Senator Santorum.
   The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State administer the visa waiver program, which allows citizens from 27 countries, including France and Germany, to visit the United States as tourists without visas. This program would allow the families of Polish Americans to travel to the United States to attend weddings, funerals, and other special occasions without significant cost or the delay of waiting for a visa.
   Speaking today on the Senate floor, Senator Santorum said, "I would hope that we could approve this amendment and send a very strong signal to our friends in Poland that we stand in solidarity with them."
