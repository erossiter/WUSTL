SEN. SANTORUM SECURES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR RESEARCH PARK IN ALLEGHENY COUNTY; ATTENDS TECH 21 GROUNDBREAKING
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the TECH 21 Research Park in Allegheny County.  
   Senator Santorum supports the development of the TECH 21 Research Park. This year the Senator secured $4.8 million for improvements along Warrendale-Bayne Road from I-79 to State Route 19. This funding will improve access to the TECH 21 Research Park and is included in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). 
   "I am pleased to be here today for the groundbreaking of the TECH 21 Research Park, a site that represents exciting job creation and economic development opportunities for southwestern Pennsylvania. When I was approached about this project, I immediately recognized how important it was to find funding to make TECH 21 a reality," said Senator Santorum. "This project is not just important to the Pittsburgh region but to the entire Commonwealth. The $4.8 million I secured for improvements along Warrendale-Bayne Road from I-79 to State Route 19, will improve access to TECH 21 and make the area more attractive to potential investors." 
   The research park is expected to bring more than 4,000 highly skilled, quality jobs to southwestern Pennsylvania over the next seven years. 
   "We appreciate Senator Santorum's support of this endeavor to develop a research park that is mindful of the environmental treasure in the region as well as building sites and offices to be fully equipped with fiber-optic infrastructure and wireless telecommunications," said Hal Wrigley of TECH 21 Partners, the office park's owner. "We are keeping nearly half of the acreage for conservation areas, forested and landscaped buffer zones, and open spaces."
