SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES DOE FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA'S HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced today that the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has awarded grants to two Pennsylvania Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to promote minority student interest in science and technology careers.  
   "I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Energy has made an effort to reach out to Lincoln and Cheyney Universities by supporting the important contributions their students can make towards our country's nuclear security," Senator Santorum said. "This funding recognizes the necessity of science and technology education in terms of our national security, and it has rightly been awarded to two HBCUs that continue to play a vital role in preparing our future leaders." 
   Established by Congress in 2000, NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science. The goal of NNSA's HBCU program is to increase the number of minority students pursuing science and technology careers and to establish a partnership with the next generation of creative and committed leaders who will help NNSA meet the demands of national security. The grants will also help to attract minority graduates for employment within NNSA. 
   Grants have been awarded for the following: 
   * $500,000 awarded to Cheyney University for the Cheney University Curriculum and Infrastructure Enhancement in STEM (CUCIES); 
   * $500,000 awarded to Lincoln University for their Characterization of Piezoelectric and Other Materials Program.
