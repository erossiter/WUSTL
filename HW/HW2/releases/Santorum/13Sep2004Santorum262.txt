SEN. SANTORUM COMMENTS ON BANKRUPTCY FILING BY U.S. AIRWAYS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, issued the following statement concerning the announcement by US Airways that they have filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy:  
   "US Airways' voluntary Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing is obviously not good news but is also not a surprise. The airline has been forthcoming that labor costs have to be reduced and negotiations have so far been unsuccessful. 
   "US Airways is an important business partner with a robust presence in the Commonwealth, employing more than 14,000 Pennsylvanians, including the major hubs of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. I am comforted that these employees will continue reporting to work every day and will continue to receive compensation. 
   "I am hopeful that US Airways will be able to reemerge as a strong, competitive company and continue to serve their passengers. I will continue to monitor this situation and remain in contact with President and CEO Bruce Lakefield and union representatives as the airline continues to work through their restructuring process."
