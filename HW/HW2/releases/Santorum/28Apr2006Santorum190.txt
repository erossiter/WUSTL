SEN. SANTORUM CONTINUES EFFORTS TO STOP IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today commented on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report stating that Iran has successfully enriched uranium and is in defiance of the United Nations Security Council. 
   "The IAEA report released today provides overwhelming evidence that Iran continues to defy the international community by advancing their nuclear program. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad must be stopped. To date, the Congress has failed to act on the growing threat in Iran.
   "I went to the floor of the United States Senate yesterday to encourage my colleagues to join me in making a strong statement against the government of Iran and their nuclear ambitions, and to support additional funding for the support of democracy in Iran. I introduced an amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act that would provide an additional $25 million to fund pro-democracy efforts in Iran. This amendment is vitally important to our national security. We must support efforts to transition to democracy so that the government of Iran can no longer continue to bully the rest of the world. Iran is a threat to America, our allies, and to the stability of the international community."
   Senator Santorum is also the lead sponsor of S. 333, the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which now has 58 bipartisan cosponsors. The legislation is a way to promote democracy inside Iran, and intends to foster the development of a democratic government in Iran that is not committed to developing nuclear weapons.
