SEN. SANTORUM STRENGTHENS PENSIONS FOR WEST PENN ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM EMPLOYEES, RETIREES
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today praised Senate passage of the Pension Protection Act, which includes a provision that will help secure the pensions of over 15,000 West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS) employees and retirees. Sen. Santorum fought to include this provision that secures and strengthens the pensions for over 13,000 WPAHS employees and approximately 2,500 retirees. WPAHS is the second largest private employer in Pittsburgh.  
   "I am pleased that I was able to successfully secure a provision in the Pension Protection Act that will result in a financially stronger health system, and more secure pensions for the dedicated staff who deliver high quality health care to thousands of Pennsylvanians" said Senator Santorum. 
   "Senator Santorum's leadership on the Finance Committee clearly made the difference in securing this important provision, which will enable WPAHS to continue the positive financial recovery that began six years ago," said David A. Samuel, WPAHS Senior Vice President and CFO. 
   WPAHS issued bonds to finance the purchase of bankrupt Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) hospitals, at which time WPAHS assumed the employees' pensions and therefore saved them from being terminated. Recognizing that WPAHS did the right thing in saving the pensions of approximately 9,000 employees of the hospitals that were purchased, Senator Santorum worked with hospital leaders to secure a provision that gives WPAHS relief from new funding rules until after they can refinance their bonds as part of their continued business recovery plan.
