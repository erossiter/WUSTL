SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES COMPASSION CAPITAL FUNDING FOR PENNSYLVANIA ORGANIZATIONS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, announced that the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded over $1.8 million in funding, through the Compassion Capital Fund, to faith and community-based organizations in Pennsylvania.  
   This funding will be given to sixteen organizations throughout Pennsylvania that work on issues such as at-risk youth, homelessness, and healthy marriages and serving people in rural communities. It will also allow the organizations to increase their effectiveness, enhance their ability to provide social services and create partnerships to better serve those in need. Since the program began in 2002, $148 million has been awarded to more than 3,000 organizations nationwide through the Compassion Capital Fund. 
   The Compassion Capital Fund is currently being operated as a demonstration program using funds under the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The bipartisan CARE Act, S.1780, that I introduced on Wednesday with Senator Lieberman would provide a specific authorization of $150 million for these activities at four agencies, including providing technical assistance and information to community-based organizations that provide social services. 
   "I am committed to helping the efforts of faith and community-based organizations," Senator Santorum stated. "This funding will empower these organizations to perform works of compassion in communities throughout Pennsylvania. It is important that we continue to help those who are less fortunate by offering assistance and guidance in their time of need."
