SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Senate has passed the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which provides funding for several transportation projects in western Pennsylvania.  
   "I am pleased that Congress has approved funding to expand and improve our roadways and mass transit infrastructure in western Pennsylvania," Senator Santorum said. "It is important that Pennsylvania continuously maintain and modernize transportation throughout the Commonwealth in order to ensure the safe travel of its citizens, create more efficient means of transportation, and sustain a robust economy." 
   "It's heartening to see my colleagues recognize the importance of these transportation projects, which are vital to driving local economies in western Pennsylvania," Sen. Specter said. 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill was passed by the Senate on November 20, 2004 and is pending final approval by the House of Representatives, followed by the President's signature. 
   These projects include: 
   * $3 million for the I-79/Parkway West Missing Ramps and Widening Project to construct two missing ramps at the I-79/Parkway West interchange near the Pittsburgh International Airport and widening of a one-mile segment of the Parkway West to accommodate the new ramps. 
   * $2.8 million for Port Authority of Allegheny County for Job Access and Reverse Commute Activities. Previous funding has provided a new transit route in the Mon Valley that serves numerous employment centers, coupled with a community shuttle service that brings individuals to the transit route. Currently, plans are being developed to extend the hours of transit service for those who work nontraditional hours. 
   * $2.5 million for the Alle-Kiski Connector Bridge, which will bring a four?lane bridge from the Parnassus Triangle (Routes 366, 909 and Industrial Boulevard) in New Kensington across the Allegheny River to Springdale. It will connect the Highway Connector to the Frazer Interchange on Route 28. There is no east/west principal artery across the Allegheny River to connect businesses and citizens in the Alle-Kiski Valley to the Allegheny Valley Expressway (Route 28.) 
   * $2.5 million for California University of Pennsylvania Sky Shuttle Project for the construction of an urban maglev shuttle system. This project will provide a "proof of concept" demonstration project for the Urban Maglev Program while satisfying a real world transportation need at the University. The research and development testing of this new technology will demonstrate its feasibility for transit service. The project consists of a 2,200-foot single-track guideway, which will connect the University's sports complex with its new student housing, as well as a 5,300-foot track down a bluff which will demonstrate the technology's capability to navigate steep grades. 
   * $2 million for the Pennsylvania Turnpike for the Southern Beltway, from U.S. 22 to the Mon Fayette Expressway. The environmental phase of this 25-mile gap section will be completed in Spring 2005, and design is scheduled to begin immediately thereafter. The adjacent Southern Beltway section, 5.5 miles, is under construction and will connect the Pittsburgh International Airport with U.S. 22. 
   * $1 million for Pittsburgh High-Speed MAGLEV. Maglev, Inc. is one of the two finalists chosen by the Department of Transportation to continue efforts to develop a Maglev test project, as authorized under the TEA-21 Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program. The first segment will connect Greensburg, PA to Pittsburgh International Airport. The Maglev project in Pittsburgh will model the advantages of this advanced transportation system in the United States. The funding will aid engineering development of an Operations and Maintenance Facility and a refinement of engineering evaluation of alignment and construction alternatives. 
   * $900,000 for Indiana County Airport to continue Phase II of construction of its runway extension project. The Airport's current 4,000-foot runway is inadequate to handle increased traffic demands, and a new 5,500-foot runway with an instrument landing system is needed to allow jet service and possible scheduled commuter service. This expansion will be a catalyst for further economic development in the County and will upgrade Pennsylvania's system of public use airports. 
   * $500,000 for the Westmoreland County Transit Authority to begin the replacement of 16 transit buses, which are part of Westmoreland County Transit's aging bus fleet. 
   * $500,000 to construct the Mon Wharf Landing. The Mon Wharf is located on the northern bank of the Monongahela River. Long-range transportation planning efforts highlight the Mon Wharf as a critically needed link for use by commuters and visitors to the downtown area, Point State Park and Station Square. 
   * $300,000 for the Altoona Metro Transit for the replacement of 11 transit buses, which are part of Altoona Metro Transit's aging bus fleet, and other transit improvements.
