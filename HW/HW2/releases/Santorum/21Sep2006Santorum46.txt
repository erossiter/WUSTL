SEN. SANTORUM ANNOUNCES JOBS FOR DISPLACED PENNSYLVANIANS TO ASSIST WITH FLOOD CLEANUP
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has approved $2,199,970 for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry to help workers dislocated as a result of severe and sustained storms and flooding earlier this summer.  
   "I am pleased to hear the good news that approximately 170 Pennsylvanians who have been displaced by the severe storms and flooding will not only gain employment, but will also be helping their communities recover from the severe storms and flooding that devastated so many homes and left tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians stranded earlier this summer," said Senator Santorum. 
   The project will provide temporary jobs to assist with cleanup and recovery in the aftermath of the severe flooding as well as projects that provide food, clothing, shelter, and other humanitarian assistance for flood victims. Supportive services for project participants may include child care, transportation assistance, safety equipment, and work-related uniforms. 
   The counties receiving funding include: Adams, Armstrong, Indiana, Perry, Sullivan, Tioga, Berks, Carbon, Chester, Franklin, Lackawanna, Lebanon, Monroe, Montour, Schuylkill, and Wayne. The funding comes from the DOL's Workforce Investment Act (WIA) National Emergency Grant Funds. 
   This funding is a result of Senator Santorum's efforts to provide assistance from the federal government to help his constituents repair the damage that resulted from the horrific storms earlier this summer.
