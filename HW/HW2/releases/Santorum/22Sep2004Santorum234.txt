SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE APPROVAL OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN PENNSYLVANIA
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the United States Senate has approved funding for several military construction projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is part of the fiscal year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill.  
   "Pennsylvania plays a strong role in our national defense. The improvements to facilities planned for Pennsylvania depots, equipment sites, and reserve stations will provide a quality working environment for the men and women of our Armed Forces as they continue their efforts to achieve a more secure nation," Senator Santorum said. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate have approved this funding for these important projects, which are key in our war against terror," Senator Specter said. "These projects will strengthen our national defense by ensuring that the men and women of our armed forces have the most advanced facilities and equipment available." 
   Funding was approved by the United States Senate for the following Pennsylvania projects: 
   * $13 million for the design and construction of a new Unit Training Equipment Site at Fort Indiantown Gap. This project will replace antiquated facilities, providing a state-of-the-art distribution and turn in point for equipment for both Guard and Reserve units using the training areas at Fort Indiantown Gap. The current building is a converted target shed not suited to maintaining the complex systems on the M1A1 tank, M109A6 Howitzer and Bradley Fighting Vehicle. 
   * $11.4 million for modifications of missile igloos at the Letterkenny Army Depot. The Depot, a joint military service operation, is the major storage site for tactical missiles and munitions on the East Coast. The Depot has 902 storage igloos that were constructed in the 1940s to store low-tech ammunition. Upgrades to the missile storage igloos will provide the depot with more efficient storage and transportation means for munitions. 
   * $7.7 million for the construction of a physical fitness center at Naval Air Station Willow Grove. This project is necessary to provide an adequate athletic facility to support the physical readiness of active and reserve military personnel assigned to the Station. The existing fitness center is located within a deteriorating, 58-year-old wood frame building, which cannot accommodate personnel in a safe and healthy manner. The existing building is constructed over a dirt crawl space contaminated with asbestos.
