SEN. SANTORUM HONORS VETERANS OF PEARL HARBOR
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, made the following statement today regarding the 63rd Anniversary of Pearl Harbor:  
   "This week we have the opportunity to honor our veterans of Pearl Harbor and World War II. December 7th marks the 63rd Anniversary of that horrific day when our men and women fought bravely in the midst of a surprise attack. 
   "On the morning of December 7, 1941, United States forces were attacked at Pearl Harbor by the aircraft of the Empire of Japan. More than 2,400 Americans were killed in battle that day, and another 1,100 were wounded. We must always remember the heroism and dedication of those who served. 
   "As we reflect on the sacrifices of the men and women who defended this great country at Pearl Harbor, my thoughts and prayers are also with our men and women currently in uniform and the families that are waiting to welcome them home from their mission. I have incredible faith in our fine military personnel who are risking their lives to fight the War on Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   "I have the utmost respect for and give my complete support to all those who bravely place themselves in harm's way to serve and defend our great nation and its interests abroad. It is their work and sacrifice that will make this world safer and more democratic for everyone. 
   "I am very proud to be an American, to honor our veterans today, and to be protected by the greatest military force the world has ever seen."
