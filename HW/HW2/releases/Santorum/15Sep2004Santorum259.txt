SENS. SANTORUM, SPECTER ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF PENNSYLVANIA ENERGY PROJECTS
  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved federal funding for projects in Pennsylvania. The funding is part of the Fiscal Year 2005 Energy Appropriations bill.  
   "These projects are important not only to Pennsylvanians but to our nation as a whole," Santorum stated. "Advances made through these projects are not only consistent with the goal of a healthy and sustainable environment, but allow us to expand our domestic resources and reduce our dependency on foreign energy sources." 
   "I am pleased my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee have approved funding for these important Pennsylvania projects," Senator Specter said. "The research these projects yield will result in cleaner and more efficient energy production, and will increase our productivity and competitiveness in the global market." 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for the following projects, which would be allocated through the Department of Energy (DOE): 
   * $69 million for the National Energy Technology Lab in Allegheny County to fund operations and research.
  * $66.9 million for DOE's Industrial Technologies Program and $4.8 million for Technology Roadmap Program to fund research to develop next generation steelmaking technology, reducing energy consumption in the steel industry and in downstream industries (such as automotive), and reducing environmental impact.
  * $14 million for DOE's Clean Cities Program to fund locally based coalitions that are dedicated to the expansion and success of the alternative transportation fuels market in the United States.
  * $17 million for Advanced Turbine Systems Research by Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation in Allegheny County and others to develop coal based power generation facilities which can utilize large and secure reserves of coal in Pennsylvania and elsewhere in cleaner and more efficient ways. 
  * $4 million for Ion Transport Membrane (ITM) Syngas Project, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., in Lehigh County to fund technologies to produce synthesis gas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) from natural gas in a single step.
