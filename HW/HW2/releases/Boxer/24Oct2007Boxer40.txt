 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer flew to San Diego today to meet with wildfire evacuees, volunteers and National Guard troops at Qualcomm Stadium to see and hear firsthand what the people of Southern California are going through and what more needs to be done.   Boxer said, What I saw today was very emotional and touching.  People from all walks of life are coming together to help one another through this disaster.   Boxer was joined on her visit and tour by San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, FEMA Director David Paulison, Representative Susan Davis, Chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors Ron Roberts, San Diego City Council President Scott Peters, and City Council President Pro Tempore Tony Young.   Everyone is working their hearts out, especially our brave firefighters.  I want to thank the Governor, the President, and all our federal, state and local officials for acting so swiftly.  The only way we can contain these fires is by working together.  We still have tough days ahead, but so far they are doing a good job of taking care of everyone at Qualcomm, and FEMA seems to be getting out ahead of the situation this time, Boxer said.   Boxer continued, In addition to focusing on completely containing these fires, we must begin helping those who lost their homes.  To that end, I have been assured that many Disaster Recovery Centers will open in the San Diego area to provide one stop shopping to those affected by these fires by offering them assistance with rental resources, home loans, small business loans and other pressing needs.   ###
