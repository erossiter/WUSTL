 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to the President:    February 23, 2006      The President    The White House    Washington, DC 20050 Dear Mr. President:  In support of the decision by your Administration to allow Dubai Ports World  a state owned company  to operate U.S. ports, you said that the United Arab Emirates is a country that plays by the rules and has got a good track record.   Mr. President, are you aware of the following facts:    Dubai was a key transfer point for shipments of nuclear components that were sold to Iran, Libya and North Korea by the Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan.  Prior to 9/11, the United Arab Emirates was one of only three nations that recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan.  Two of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were UAE nationals.   The 9/11 hijackers received assistance in financing their activities from two facilitators in the UAE.  The UAE remains a financial center and money transfer hub for terrorists.   Given this record, the Administrations decision to allow a state-owned UAE company to operate U.S. ports should be revisited.          Sincerely,   Barbara Boxer      United States Senator
