 Washington, D.C.  Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, lauded Senate passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) Conference Report and urged President Bush to reconsider his veto threat.     Boxer said, This legislation is long overdueCongress has not passed a WRDA bill in over seven years, leaving many of our countrys water infrastructure needs unmet.  This WRDA bill will provide critical flood protection for California, including authorizing necessary modifications at Folsom Dam to protect hundreds of thousands of people in the Sacramento area.   Boxer continued, I hope that when the President sees the strong bipartisan support expressed by the Congress today, he will reconsider his veto threat.  Communities across our great nation have come forward and asked for these critical projects, which will help meet our water infrastructure needs and protect our communities from the threat of floods and storms.    The WRDA conference report includes authorization for over $1.3 billion in federal funding for 54 flood control and restoration projects in California including:    	$683 million, including $444 million in federal funding to improve, strengthen, and expedite Sacramentos flood control protection at Folsom Dam;   	$106 million to repair and strengthen levees in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers Delta;  	$40 million in federal funding to establish a statewide program for water-related infrastructure and environmental assistance in California;  	$25 million for L.A. River restoration to remove concrete, restore habitat for fish and wildlife, and provide recreational opportunities along the riverbanks;  	$1.6 million for the ongoing comprehensive flood protection program in Petaluma;  	$30 million for Salton Sea restoration, which provides critical habitat for migratory birds and is faced with eroding water quality and diminishing water supplies;  	$87.5 million for environmental restoration on the Napa River Salt Marsh;   The Conference Report passed by a vote of 81-12.  The bill now goes to the President.  If he signs it, it will be law; if he vetoes it, the Congress will hold a vote to override the veto.                     ###
