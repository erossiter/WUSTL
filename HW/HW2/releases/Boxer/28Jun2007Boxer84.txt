 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today issued the following statement on the immigration bill:  The immigration problems we have in America today are not going to magically go away. We need to work to resolve these problems.  I decided to vote yes on cloture today because I felt that if the policies in this bill were carried out properly, the result would be a strengthening of our border security, the rescue of our agriculture industry, and the acknowledgment that hardworking undocumented immigrants should have a path to legality if they follow the tough rules we have set out.   As we move forward, I hope that the Senate will work to immediately pass the non-controversial pieces of this bill such as increased funding for border security, the AgJobs program, and the Dream Act.   We also need to legislate a fair way to deal with the 12 million undocumented workers who have become an important part of Californias economy and the economy of the country. ###
