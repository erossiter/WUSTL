 Washington, D.C. 창 In light of the escalating sectarian violence in Iraq, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld if he has a plan for the worst-case scenario: the possibility of a full-scale civil war in Iraq.    
Senator Boxer sent the following letter to Secretary Rumsfeld:    
February 23, 2006    
The Honorable Donald H. Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense  1000 Defense Pentagon  Washington, DC 20301-1000    
Dear Mr. Secretary:    
Americans are alarmed at the escalating sectarian violence in Iraq in the aftermath of the destruction of the Askariya shrine in Samarra.    
Experts believe that widespread violence between Sunni and Shiite groups not only threatens the establishment of an inclusive Iraqi government but also makes it more likely that the situation could spiral into a full-scale civil war.    
Given this Administration창s past failure to plan for the insurgency in Iraq, it is imperative that we have a plan for the growing possibility of a full-scale civil war.  Of course, while we all hope for the best, we must plan for the worst.    
Do you have a plan for this worst-case scenario 창 our troops getting caught in the crossfire of a civil war 창 and does that plan include redeploying our troops from Iraq to nearby bases?    
Please respond to me as soon as possible.    
With deep concern,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
