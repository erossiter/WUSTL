 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today introduced the Hass Avocado Quality Assurance Act, legislation that would require imported Hass avocados to meet the same maturity standards that Hass avocados grown in California must meet. Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) introduced companion legislation in the House.  Boxer said, Imported avocados should be held to the same quality standards as those produced in California to ensure consistent quality. This bill promotes accountability for all avocado farmers at home and abroad, and American consumers will benefit as a result. Capps said, I want to thank Senator Boxer for her leadership on this issue and I am proud to be introducing similar common sense legislation in the House that will protect the interests of avocado consumers and growers. Our bills will ensure that consumers have access to the highest quality Hass avocados and it will also level the playing field by promoting fair competition among domestic and international Hass avocado growers. This is a win-win situation for avocado consumers and growers and I hope that these bills move quickly through the legislative process. Current USDA import standards mirror those used by the State of Florida, which do not include a minimum maturity requirement for Hass avocados. California regulations require compliance with minimum maturity and size standards. Boxers bill would address this inequity by mandating minimum maturity standards for all imported Hass avocados.  California is the largest avocado producer in the country, producing 84 percent of all avocados grown in the United States, totaling $276 million in value in 2005.  Boxer and Capps will work to include this legislation as part of the Farm Bill.
