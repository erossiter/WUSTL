 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement:    
"Today's decision brings home in clear terms the impact of President Bush's Supreme Court choices. As a result of today's ruling, the health of women who have dangerous pregnancies is now in deep jeopardy. Women who are in need of this banned procedure will be denied it, even if they risk losing their fertility, becoming paralyzed, or sustaining organ damage. The consequences of today's dangerous decision can only be overcome by a shift back to the center on the Supreme Court, or by passage of my Freedom of Choice Act, which I will be reintroducing in the near future."
