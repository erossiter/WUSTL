 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $500,000 in federal funds to help restore the Trinity River ecosystem was approved by the Senate.    
"This funding is a win-win for our communities and the restoration of the Trinity Riverâs habitat," Boxer said.  "Once the man-made structures are cleared, the Trinity Riverâs flow and beauty can finally be revitalized." 
Senator Boxer obtained the funding in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
Carports, barns and other structures built on the banks and flood plains of the Trinity River prevent the restoration of the waterwayâs natural flow and riparian habitat.  Funds will be used to purchase and remove these structures, clearing the way for the riverâs revitalization.  Restoring the river will benefit and wildlife, including endangered species, fisheries and people wanting to use the river banks for recreation.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
