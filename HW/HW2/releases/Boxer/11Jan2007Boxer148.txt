 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), the incoming Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today praised a National Academies of Sciences report that said the White House Office of Management and Budgetâs (OMB) plan to standardize the risk assessment process is âfundamentally flawedâ? and should be withdrawn. 	    
The White House OMB has developed a new way to calculate risk to our people from the most dangerous toxins in our midst.  The Academyâs peer review found that some of OMBâs proposed changes could be especially problematic for infants, children, and other individuals who are especially vulnerable to toxic substances. The NAS characterized key parts of the guidance as âincomplete and confusingâ? and as potentially âmisleading when sensitive populations are of primary concern.â?    
Boxer said, âTime and again, this Administration has chosen to distort or circumvent science at the expense of public health. Rather than give a true assessment as to what level will consitute a risk, they have proposed to change the methodology from a science-based method to a special interest-based method. Today, the National Academy of Sciences issued a clear rebuke to this Administration, and stated clearly that their plan that does not fully consider the health threats to our families and our children should be rejected."
