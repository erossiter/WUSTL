 Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) expressed dismay over the Presidentâs failure to provide a strategy to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq.    
âIn this season of hope and peace, I am truly saddened that the President is asking the American people to expect more sacrifices and tragedies in Iraq without a clear exit strategy.  The two-thirds of Americans who oppose the Iraq war surely deserve to see a light at the end of this long, dark tunnel.    
âI hope the President will reconsider his statements and realize that sending additional U.S. military personnel into Iraq will only increase the level of casualties and violence, and exacerbate Iraqi dependence on U.S. forces.  It is time for U.S. troops to redeploy from Iraq.    
âDuring this holiday season, I ask all Americans to pray for our military men and women who are in harmâs way and to remember those who have given their lives in service to this nation.â?
