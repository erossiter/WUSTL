 I am encouraged that EPA is moving forward with setting a safe drinking water standard for perchlorate.  While I believe the exposure level the agency has set is too high, I also believe that once the EPA takes into account the most sensitive groups â pregnant women and infants â the safe drinking water standard for perchlorate should be close to 1 part per billion.  This is the level that will protect our people and this is the level we should expect from the EPA.
