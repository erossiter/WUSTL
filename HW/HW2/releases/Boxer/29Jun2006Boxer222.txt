 Washington, D.C.â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $450,000 for Mission San Luis Rey in Oceanside as part of the FY2007 Interior Appropriations Bill.    
Boxer had requested these critical funds, which were included under the Save Americaâs Treasures program, so that the Mission can connect to the City of Oceansideâs water pipes, which is critical for health and fire-safety reasons.    								  Boxer said, âWe're making great progress in restoring our Missions and we have to continue to work to preserve these historic California landmarks for future generations.â? 
Boxer was the author of the California Missions Preservation Act, legislation to fund the restoration and repair of California missions and preserve their artwork and artifacts.  The legislation was signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 30, 2004.      
Boxer will fight to ensure that the funds remain in the bill as it moves forward on the Senate floor.
