 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) made the following statement in response to President Bushâs speech this evening on the war in Iraq:    
âAll of the troops in the world canât make up for the lack of a political solution in Iraq.  The only way forward is for the Iraqi people to reach a compromise and for the Iraqi security forces to take responsibility for protecting their own people.  Putting more U.S. troops in the middle of a civil war will only result in the loss of more American lives.â?
