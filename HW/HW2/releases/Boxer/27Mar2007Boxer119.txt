 Boxer said, "For the first time, the Senate has passed binding legislation to begin the redeployment of American troops out of Iraq and to change their mission from a combat mission to a support mission, as recommended by the Iraq Study Group.  The will of the American people, as expressed in the last election, is finally being recognized.  I hope the President will sign this bill and realize that there can no longer be a one man show when it comes to Iraq."
