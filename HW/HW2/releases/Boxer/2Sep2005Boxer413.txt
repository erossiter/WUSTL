 San Francisco, CA â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission:    
  September 2, 2005    
The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20580    
Dear Chairman Majoras:    
I know you share my sympathetic feelings toward those who have suffered such great losses from Hurricane Katrina.  In the wake of this tragedy, however, we must be vigilant to ensure that it is not used as an excuse to take advantage of the American people.    
Therefore, I urge the FTC to closely monitor and scrutinize the oil industry for possible market manipulation and price gouging in the coming weeks.    
As you know, the hurricaneâs disruption to oil supply and refining capabilities in the Gulf of Mexico is contributing to an increase in gasoline prices that were already at record levels.  That market reaction is to be expected.    
However, I am concerned that oil companies may use the hurricane and its aftermath as an opportunity to exacerbate the problem â jacking up prices or shorting supply even further.    
As President Bush has called on companies not to gouge consumers during this tragedy, I urge you to closely monitor the oil and gasoline markets to ensure that oil companies are not taking advantage of the emergency situation.    
I look forward to your immediate reply.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
