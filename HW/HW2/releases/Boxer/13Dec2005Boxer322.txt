 Washington, D.C. - After learning the Federal Emergency Management Agency does not have a specific plan in place to respond to a potentially devastating California earthquake, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today called on Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to develop an emergency response plan designed for a major California earthquake.    
In response to Senator Boxerâs earlier requests to review FEMAâs disaster response plan for California, FEMA referred her to its generic National Response Plan.  In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff, Senator Boxer wrote, âEven if a generic response plan were capable of covering all disasters, the National Response Plan was released in December 2004 â before Katrina.  The plan obviously failed.  FEMA was not able to deal with the aftermath of a hurricane â an event that was anticipated â which calls into serious doubt the ability of FEMA to undertake a successful response to a major earthquake in California.â? 
Senator Boxer initially requested the plan three months ago.  Two months ago, she was joined by Senator Dianne Feinstein (also D-CA) in a letter that called on President Bush to release FEMAâs California earthquake recovery plan.  They also requested that the Senate Government Affairs Committee hold hearings on FEMAâs earthquake preparedness plan.    
Attached please find Senator Boxerâs letter to Secretary Chertoff.  Previous letters are available upon request.
