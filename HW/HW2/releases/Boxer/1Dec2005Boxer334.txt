 Washington, DC 창 U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) sent the following letter today to Senators Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, in response to reports that top oil company executives have revised their November 9 hearing testimony.    
December 1, 2005 
  The Honorable Ted Stevens         Chairman         Senate Commerce Committee       United States Senate      Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Daniel Inouye      Ranking Member      Senate Commerce Committee      United States Senate  Washington, DC 20510    
Dear Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye:    
Oil company executives have now revised their misstatements to the Senate Commerce and Energy Committees on whether they participated in Vice President Cheney창s energy task force in 2001.    
Now that we know the oil executives misled the Committee on this matter, the truthfulness of their entire testimony is in question.  These executives must be brought back before the Committee and placed under oath to explain themselves.    
It would be a dereliction of our duty 창 to our constituents and to the American people 창 if we failed to do so.    
Thank you so much for your consideration.  We look forward to a prompt response.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator    
Maria Cantwell  United States Senator
