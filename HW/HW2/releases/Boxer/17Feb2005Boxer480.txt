 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ Today the United States Senate passed legislation by U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-CA) that would commemorate the late Congressman Robert T. Matsui by naming the United States Courthouse in Sacramento after him. 
Congressman Matsui devoted his life to protecting civil rights and serving the people of Sacramento," Senator Boxer said. "By naming a federal courthouse in his honor, his memory will be kept alive for the people he served." Congressman Matsui was instrumental in obtaining more than $142 million in federal funding for the Courthouse.  The bill now goes to the House.
