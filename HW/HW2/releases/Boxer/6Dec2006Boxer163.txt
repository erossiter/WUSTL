 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement on the Iraq Study Group (ISG) report:    
âTodayâs long-awaited report by the Iraq Study Group tells the truth about the current situation in Iraqâ that the situation is grave and deterioratingâ which is all the more reason that I hope the President takes this report to heart.  Like last month's midterm election, the report is a clear repudiation of the President's "stay the course" policy.    
âThe Iraq Study Group chose from a menu of ideas offered by members of Congress as a way to move us forward, including proposals to redeploy U.S. troops elsewhere in the region and to hold a regional conference to achieve an international consensus on Iraq.    
âI agree with the report that the Iraqi people must take control of their own country, that there should not be a large influx of U.S. troops into Iraq, and that there should be no open ended commitment to keep large numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq.  I am also pleased that the Iraq Study Group believes that most U.S. combat troops could be out of Iraq by early 2008.      
âHowever, I am disappointed that the report failed to endorse a clear timetable and end date for the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq and rejected the idea of creating semi-autonomous regions in Iraq.       
âAbove all, I hope that this report will remind the President that the American people are demanding change in our policy in Iraq.â?
