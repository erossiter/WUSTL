 This report is long overdue and it is now time for the State to choose an alternative to restore the Sea to a healthy state.  I am keenly aware of the importance of restoring the Sea, both to public health and to the abundant wildlife that depend on it.  That is why I was pleased that the Senate included a $26 million dollar authorization for pilot projects in the 2006 Senate-passed WRDA bill making its way through Congress now.  This authorization will help bring federal resources and expertise to assist the state and local governments in restoring the Sea.  I hope the Congress will pass this bill before the end of the year.
