 This year marks the 25th Anniversary of EPAâs Superfund program.  While the program has made progress in cleaning up our countryâs hazardous waste sites, so much important work remains to be done.  Today, over 10 million children in America live within four miles of a Superfund toxic waste site, placing them at a higher risk of developing cancer and other diseases. We owe it to these children and their families to clean up these toxic sites.    
As the ranking member of the Superfund subcommittee, I believe it is crucial that the Superfund program be transparent and clear.  I am asking the EPA to send information to myself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Obama that includes a list of the Superfund sites in order of priority â spelling out the danger for each of the 103 sites where they have already said human exposure is not under control.    
We are asking for complete information about Superfund sites around the country including:    
1). The list of sites in order of health hazard  2). How many children live near the sites  3). What emergency steps must be taken at each site and the cost to take those emergency steps  4).  The cost to clean up all 103 sites    
As this information is crucial to the Superfund program that Susan Bodine would lead as an EPA Assistant Administrator, I am requesting that this information be received before her Senate confirmation moves forward.
