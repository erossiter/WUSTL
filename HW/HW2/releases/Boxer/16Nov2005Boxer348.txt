 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced Senate approval of $4.5 million in federal funds to expand programming, upgrade new technologies and help reconstruct the Morrison Planetarium, which will be part of the new California Academy of Sciences (CAS).    
âWhen it reopens, the new Morrison Planetarium will be able to show visitors the wonders of the night sky, expand educational programming and give our children a front-row seat in witnessing the amazing discoveries being made by our space program,â? Boxer said.  âThis new facility will provide Californians and visitors the opportunity to learn more about the secrets of the universe and the accomplishments of our scientists and astronauts.â? 
Funds to upgrade the Morrison Planetarium, which will reopen in late 2008, were included in the final version of the Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.    
The redesigned facility will utilize state-of-the-art technology, including a new digital projection system that will display the stars, planets, comets and moons of the night sky in real time.  Funding will also be used to expand the planetariumâs programming to better inform the visiting public of the latest scientific discoveries resulting from federally funded research.    
The Morrison Planetarium will be housed in the new Academy of Sciences campus, which is undergoing a complete remodeling.  Other facilities in the new complex will include the Steinhart Aquarium and the newly named Kimball Natural History Museum.    
The FY2006 CJS appropriations bill funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation.  The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
