 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) was named the Ranking Member of the Oceans Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee.  The Panelâs Chairman will be Senator John Sununu (R-NH). 
"I look forward to continuing my work toward protecting our oceans and working with Chairman Sununu to implement the recommendations of the Pew Ocean Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy,"  Boxer said. 
Last year, the independent Pew Ocean Commission and the congressionally-established U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy released reports that showed the worldâs oceans are in severe distress.  Both commissions issued recommendations regarding how the United States should respond to the most serious challenges facing the world's oceans. 
The National Oceans Policy Study has jurisdiction over ocean health, coastal conservation, marine sanctuaries, ocean exploration and oil pollution as it affects oceans.
