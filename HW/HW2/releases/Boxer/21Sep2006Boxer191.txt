 Washington, D.C. 창 U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement regarding EPA창s new standards for particulate matter pollution:     
창Once again, this Administration has shown its true colors by choosing polluters over the people and setting new air standards on toxic dust that fail to protect public health.   This decision, which flies in the face of science, should not stand.  I hope that EPA reconsiders this misguided and dangerous decision.  If not, it should be struck down by the Courts.창?
