 WASHINGTON, DC â The Environmental Protection Agency today released data revealing that the agency cleaned up only 40 Superfund sites during fiscal year 2005.  This continues the Bush Administrationâs abysmal record of cleaning Superfund sites â during the last four years of the Clinton Administration, EPA cleaned up an average of 87 Superfund sites each year.    
The following is the statement of U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, ranking Democrat on the Superfund oversight subcommittee in the Senate: 
âThe Bush Administration has continued its sluggish pace of cleaning up the nationâs most dangerously contaminated toxic waste sites.  The pace of cleanups has declined by more than 50 percent compared to the previous Administration.  This means that more toxic waste sites will continue to menace our communities and poison our environment for longer periods of time.  There continues to be insufficient funding available to address the programâs needs, even according to EPAâs own figures.  This is unacceptable.â?
