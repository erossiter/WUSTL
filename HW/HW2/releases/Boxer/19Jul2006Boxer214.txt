 Washington, D.C. â The Senate Commerce Committee today approved a provision by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that would require the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a report explaining why the National Transportation Safety Boardâs (NTSB) most pressing aviation safety recommendations have not been implemented.      
Boxer said, âThere is no excuse for the Federal Aviation Administration not implementing these recommendations to keep airline passengers safe.  It is my hope that this amendment will encourage the FAA to take action on these recommendations â or at the very least explain to Congress why they are failing to do so.â? 
Boxerâs provision, part of the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization bill passed by the Committee, would require the FAA to complete a report within 90 days of the billâs enactment into law explaining why the aviation recommendations on the National Transportation Safety Board's Most Wanted Transportation Improvements have not been carried out.    
The NTSBâs Most Wanted list includes basic aviation safety guidelines to protect airline passengers, such as:  reducing dangers to aircraft flying in icy conditions, stopping runway incursions and ground collisions of aircraft and requiring restraint systems for children under age two.
