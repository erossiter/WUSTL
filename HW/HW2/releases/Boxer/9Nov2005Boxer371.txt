 Californians sent a loud and clear message yesterday Ã¢ they do not want to be used by a Governor who is trying to rejuvenate his political career.    
There was no need for this special election.  The people would have rather seen that $50 million either saved or spent on education.    
I hope we can move past this divisive election and toward solving many of the challenges California faces.
