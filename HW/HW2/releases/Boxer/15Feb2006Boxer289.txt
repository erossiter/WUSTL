 Today's announcement of the removal of the oxygenate requirement in California's gasoline is the epilogue to a long, sorry story.  This requirement was unnecessary and harmful to California's air and water and should have been done years ago.  The use of the oxygenate MTBE caused untold damage to our drinking water supplies and cost untold millions to our consumers.  The use of the oxygenate ethanol in the summer months when clean burning fuels were available was actually counter to the purpose of the Clean Air Act which required the use of oxygenates in the first place.    
We had to fight tooth and nail against efforts to let manufacturers of MTBE off the hook for the damage their product wrought on communities across the country.  I will continue my efforts to see that justice is done and the water supplies of localities spoiled by MTBE are cleaned up.
