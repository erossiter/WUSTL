 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement in opposition to the Military Commissions Act of 2006:     
âI view this bill as a weak plan that will lead to delay after delay in convicting terrorists, endanger our troops on the field, and surrender one of the bedrock constitutional principles of our justice system â  habeas corpus.    
âWe had a chance to improve this bill with amendments, but this rubber stamp Senate defeated them one after another, leaving us with a flawed plan that will face a serious court challenge, and that makes us less safe.    
âThe Republicans even voted against a bipartisan bill that came out of the Senate Armed Services Committee.â?
