 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ In light of a recent news report that the Army has delayed deployment of a high-tech vehicle that destroys roadside bombs, the number one cause of death for American troops in Iraq, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today called on Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey to rapidly expedite the deployment of new technologies to Iraq.      
Senator Boxer sent the following letter to Secretary Harvey:    
February 15, 2006   The Honorable Francis Harvey    Secretary of the Army    101 Army Pentagon    Washington, D.C. 20301 Dear Secretary Harvey:  On Sunday, February 12, 2006, the Los Angeles Times ran a front page story disclosing that the United States Army is slow-walking the deployment of the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN)a high-tech vehicle that reportedly destroyed 90% of roadside bombs during testing. This is inexcusable at a time when roadside bomb attacks in Iraq are becoming more powerful, sophisticated, and frequent.  It is my understanding that the Marines have forged ahead with the deployment of these life-saving devices, but that the Army believes that further testing is needed. This is simply unacceptable. As you well know, Improvised Explosive Devices, or IEDs, are the leading cause of death for our troops in Iraq and have caused catastrophic injuries for thousands of others.   Unfortunately, I am afraid that this is yet another example of failing to provide adequate protection for our troops, just as the Pentagon has failed to provide adequate body armor and up-armored Humvees.   Please let me know what you are doing to expedite the deployment of the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN) and similar technologies into Iraq.  I look forward to receiving your prompt response. Sincerely, Barbara Boxer    United States Senator
