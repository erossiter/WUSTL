 Washington, D.C.Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to the Secretary of Defense: 
March 29, 2006    The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld    Secretary of Defense     1000 Defense Pentagon    Washington, D.C. 20301-1000      Dear Secretary Rumsfeld:  Enclosed is a letter I received from Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman in response to my letter to you asking for the Administrations plan for our troops should the situation in Iraq deteriorate into a full-scale civil war.   Since that letter, we have learned that deaths from sectarian violence are exceeding deaths from the insurgency. This is very disheartening and again raises the question, what is your plan     for the worst-case scenario  our troops getting caught in the crossfire of a civil war  and does that plan include redeploying our troops from Iraq to nearby bases?  The growing possibility of a full-scale civil war cannot and should not be ignored. Mr. Iyad Allawi, Former Prime Minister of Iraq recently said, If this is not civil war, then God knows what civil war is. I think Iraq is facing, is in the middle of a crisis. Maybe we have not reached the point of no return yet. But we are moving towards this point.  Secretary Rumsfeld, one of your highest responsibilities is to protect our troops. Before we get to the point of no return, I expect an answer from you  to my legitimate request for a plan for our troops in the event of full-scale civil war. 57,000 Americans signed a petition I sent you under separate enclosure asking for this plan, and they deserve an answer too.   I look forward to your immediate response.    Sincerely,        Barbara Boxer      United States Senator
