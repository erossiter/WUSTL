 Washington, DC  â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) last night reintroduced legislation to provide Americaâs first responders with help purchasing interoperable communications so that they can communicate with each other during emergencies.    
âThe need for interoperable communications has been apparent for over a decade now, but especially since the 2001 terrorist attacks,â? Boxer said.  âIt is all the more evident now in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Guaranteeing that first responders will have the communications equipment necessary to respond to a disaster is exactly the kind of preemptive action we should be taking now.â?		 	 Boxerâs bill would authorize $300 million for each of the next five years to help state and local agencies improve existing communications systems or purchase new systems.  This funding would help local agencies purchase equipment for real-time interoperable communication between first responders.   
The 9/11 Commission described the inability to communicate as âa critical elementâ? at the World Trade Center and at the crash sites, where multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded in September 2001.  And yet four years after that attack, first responders still cannot talk to each other.  			 California suffered from a lack of interoperable communications in the fall of 2003, when communities could not communicate with each other to convey what was happening with fires that were sweeping through the state, greatly complicating the response.		  
Boxer first introduced legislation to create and fund an interoperable communications grant program for local first responders in March 2004.
