 Washington, D.C.  Today, during debate on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to increase funding for the Department of Educations highly successful Upward Bound program.  The Boxer amendment, which passed unanimously, would authorize an additional $57 million each year for four yearsa total of $228 millionto fund Upward Bound programs which have a grant score of 70 or above and did not receive funding for Fiscal Year 2007. In California, 5,600 students participate in Upward Bound, which provides support such as tutoring, mentoring and counseling on college entrance and financial aid applications to low-income and first-generation college bound students. For the 2006-2007 school year, $26.5 million in grant funding was awarded to 73 Upward Bound programs in California.  Boxer said, Upward Bound is an investment in Californias future. This valuable program helps countless youth in California and across the nation realize the American Dream. Through much needed federal dollars, institutions of higher learning can continue to expand educational opportunities for low-income students. In California, 11 Upward Bound programs did not receive funding in this years grant selection process. San Bernardino was hit particularly hard, with four Upward Bound programs not receiving funding. Other California communities with Upward Bound programs that did not receive funding include Oakland, San Jose, San Diego, Modesto, Fresno and two in Riverside. Earlier this month, the House passed a similar measure by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) as part of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007.   The Senate is expected to pass reauthorization of the Higher Education Act tomorrow morning.  ###
