 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) made the following statement today in response to the release of an internal EPA proposal that, according to an EPA memo, would undermine the regulation of toxic air pollution:    
âThere is something drastically and alarmingly wrong when EPAâs headquarters puts out a draft rule that the vast majority of EPAâs experts in the field strongly criticize.  The disagreement is not about how many chairs should go around the conference table; itâs about the most toxic air pollutants -- known to cause injury and premature death.  This incident occurred while Mr. William Wehrum was Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, a position he has been nominated for by President Bush.  He should be prepared to defend his actions when he comes before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for his nomination hearing this week.â?
