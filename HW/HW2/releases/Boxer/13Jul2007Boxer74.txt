 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today said that a new report by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) detailing the decline in Americas honeybee population reinforces the need to fund research into Colony Collapse Disorder.   Last month, Senator Boxer introduced the Pollinator Protection Act, legislation which would authorize $89 million in federal funding for research and grant programs at the USDA over five years for work related to maintaining and protecting our bee and native pollinator populations. Experts estimate crops nationwide that depend on a healthy honey and native bee population to be valued near $18 billion.   In recent months, there has been an estimated loss of over 25 percent of the nations honeybee populationa decrease the USDA has termed Colony Collapse Disorder.   Boxer said, I am pleased that USDA has recognized the need for immediate action to address the unexplained decline in our honeybee population. The USDA has taken a significant first step by coming forward with a plan to research Colony Collapse Disorder and mitigate its impact before our crops are at greater risk. The reports findings reinforce the need for significant research into CCD, which is why I will be working to include my legislation in the 2007 Farm Bill.   ###
