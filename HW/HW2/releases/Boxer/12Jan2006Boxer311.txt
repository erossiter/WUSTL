 Washington, D.C.âU.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today offered high praise to Republican Majority for Choice for taking a stand against Judge Samuel Alitoâs nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.    
The text of Senator Boxerâs letter to Republican Majority for Choice follows:    January 12, 2006    
Kellie Rose Ferguson  Executive Director  Republican Majority for Choice  1660 L Street, Suite 609  Washington, DC  20036    
Dear Ms. Ferguson:    
I want to commend Republican Majority for Choice for its courageous statement of opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel Alito.    
Your leadership is critical in showing that reproductive choice in America is not a partisan issue.  If Roe v. Wade is overturned or undermined, it will not hurt a political party or philosophy; it will threaten the dignity, health and lives of women and families throughout our country.    
The stakes in this confirmation could not be higher. With Justice Sandra Day OâConnorâs retirement, we are losing the swing vote - and a powerful voice - in protecting Americans.    
Thank you for standing up at a time when Americans need to hear independent and strong voices in defense of our rights and freedoms. I look forward to working with you to protect reproductive health and freedom in America.    
Sincerely    
Barbara Boxer  U.S. Senator
