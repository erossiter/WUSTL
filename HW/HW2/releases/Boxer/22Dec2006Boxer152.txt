 Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement about EPAâs final rule saying that there will be no requirements for testing drinking water for the toxic chemical perchlorate. This toxin has been found in millions of Americansâ drinking water. EPAâs original 1999 rule ordered testing for perchlorate, and just last year EPA proposed to extend that requirement. However, in the wake of industry opposition, the new final rule says that âbased on public comment and further consideration, EPA has removed the requirement for monitoring perchlorateâ¦.â?     
Senator Boxerâs statement follows:     
âI am distressed that the agency has said there will be no required testing of our drinking water for the dangerous chemical perchlorate. This is another unwelcome holiday gift from EPA to the American public, one of several recent EPA actions undermining health protection. As a result of this new rule, Americans will not have up-to-date information on whether their tap water is contaminated with this toxin. I also remain deeply concerned that EPA has dragged its feet and refused to set a safety standard for perchlorate in our drinking water. Until EPA sets a standard, at the very least we should know if it's in our drinking water. We will not let this kind of action stand. We will closely examine this issue when the new Congress convenes.â?
