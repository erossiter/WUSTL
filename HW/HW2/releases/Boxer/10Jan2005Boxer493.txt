 The announcement by Shell today gives us all reason to be extremely optimistic that the Bakersfield Refinery will stay open.  I want to thank everyone involved who pushed for the continuation of the refinery.  If all goes well, it will be a great victory for the community of Bakersfield and for the consumers of the West Coast.
