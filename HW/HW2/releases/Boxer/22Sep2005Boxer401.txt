 WASHINGTON, DC âU.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate passed her provision to help improve San Joaquinâs poor air quality.    
The funding in the Boxer provision will be used by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to study agricultural emissions and identify scientifically valid and cost-effective options for reducing emissions in the Valley.    
âWe owe it to the people of the San Joaquin Valley to find effective ways to improve the air pollution problem,â? Boxer said.  âI am very pleased that the Senate agreed to fund this effort to help make the air in the Valley safer and cleaner.â? 
The San Joaquin Valley has one of the most serious air pollution problems in the state and the nation.  The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has identified certain agricultural sectors as primary emitters of the regionâs air pollution.  These funds would help find ways to reduce pollution from those sources.    
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Agriculture Appropriations bill in June.  The spending bill now goes to conference.
