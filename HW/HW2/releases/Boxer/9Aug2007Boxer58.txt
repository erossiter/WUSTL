 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the  following letter to President Bush:   August 9,  2007  President George W.  Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW Washington, DC 20500  Dear Mr.  President:   The deadly bridge  collapse in Minneapolis is a tragic wake-up call for us to  address our nations aging infrastructure.   According to the  U.S. Department of Transportation,  more than 73,000 of our nations bridges are rated structurally deficient. It  is clear that Americas infrastructure is in  desperate need of repairs, and we must act now and provide emergency funding to  prevent future tragedies.   Because of this urgent  need, I ask for your support in using unspent Iraqi reconstruction funds for  immediate investment in emergency infrastructure repairs in America.    On July 31, the Special  Inspector General for Iraq  Reconstruction testified that 10 percent of the $21 billion appropriated for the  Iraq Relief and  Reconstruction Fund has not been spent on projects in Iraq.  These funds  $2.1 billion  should be used to begin fixing the most vulnerable  infrastructure in our country.   As Chairman of the  Environment and Public Works Committee, I know that if we team up on this  crucial issue, we can move swiftly and without extended debate. You supported  these funds for Iraqs  infrastructure and Im asking you to support these funds for Americas infrastructure.    I appreciate your  consideration of this important request and look forward to hearing from  you.  Sincerely,      Barbara  Boxer  United States  Senator    ###
