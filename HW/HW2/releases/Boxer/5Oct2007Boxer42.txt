 Washington, D.C.-The U.S. Senate unanimously approved an amendment this week by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that provides up to $5 million for the National Military Family Associations Operation Purple, a summer camp for children of members of the Armed Forces.   Children of military personnel-- especially deployed personnel-- can feel tremendous stress, Boxer said. Operation Purple summer camps allow these kids to just be kids, and they provide the support network for when times are tough.     Boxers amendment would provide the funding to expand Operation Purples ability to accommodate 10,000 children, primarily those of deployed parents, at camps across the country next summer.  Last year, only 4,000 of the 9,000 military children who applied were able to participate.  Since its inception in 2004, Operation Purple has been able to send 10,000 military kids to camp.     Right now, it is estimated that 155,000 kids have a parent deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan - many of these kids have had to cope with multiple deployments and short visits home in between.  Some have even had both of their parents deployed, Boxer said.  I am so glad that the Senate recognized the need for this important amendment.   In addition to the traditional camp activities of horseback riding, swimming, hiking and archery, Operation Purple teaches coping skills and helps build support networks so that children can better handle their parents deployments.   The Senate passed the Department of Defense Appropriations bill including Boxers amendment on Wednesday.  The next step for this bill, which includes $459 billion in spending for the Pentagon, will be a conference between the Senate and the House to reconcile the differences between their two bills.   ###
