 Washington, D.C.â In anticipation of the introduction of energy legislation in the 109th Congress, U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) are leading a bipartisan group of Senators opposing the inclusion of provisions that would open up restricted areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to oil and gas exploration. 
In a letter to Senator Pete Domenici, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senators wrote, "Our concern is that these provisions would improperly centralize jurisdictional authority to the Department of Interior over our nationâs coastal waters, undermine legitimate statesâ rights, and threaten decades of effective and successful cooperation with coastal states under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).  We oppose these provisions and ask for their exclusion from forthcoming energy legislation." 
Senator Boxer said, "Any efforts to include language authorizing new drilling or exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf ignores longstanding protections to our coastlines.  Congress has prevented such activities in the past because of the negative environmental effects of drilling on our sea-life and the subsequent risks posed to our coastal economy." 
Boxer and Dole are joined in opposition to the drilling provisions by Senators Richard Burr, John Kerry, Maria Cantwell, Frank Lautenberg, Lincoln Chafee, Bill Nelson, Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, and Dianne Feinstein.
