 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today sent the following letter to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee urging them to include the AgJobs bill as part of the 2007 Farm Bill Reauthorization.   The letter follows:    July 10, 2007    The Honorable Tom Harkin    The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Chairman            Ranking Member  Senate Agriculture Committee   Senate Agriculture Committee  328-A Russell          328-A Russell   Washington, DC 20510      Washington, DC 20510   Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss:    When the Senate failed yesterday to invoke cloture on S. 1639, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill, an opportunity to move forward a provision of that bill integral to our nations agricultural economy was lost. As you are aware, S. 1639 included the AgJobs bill, which provides the agricultural industry with a stable and reliable workforce, and implements much needed reforms to the H2-A temporary farm worker visa program. While Senate Majority Leader Reid indicated he hopes that the Senate can again consider comprehensive immigration reform this year, the time for action on AgJobs cannot be delayed, and we request that you include AgJobs has part of the 2007 Farm Bill Reauthorization.     The need for immediate labor relief for our nations farmers cannot be overstated. In farm communities across the nation last year, acres of crops in States throughout the nation died in the fields because of the lack of farm labor, causing extensive economic damage to our nations farm economy. Without an immediate solution, the long-term impact on our economy is staggering. The American Farm Bureau predicts that as much as $9 billion in annual agricultural production could be lost within ten years.     The AgJobs bill was forged over years of negotiations between agribusiness, farmers, and labor advocates. The bill enjoys broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House, and is strongly supported by hundreds of agribusinesses and farm groups representing 47 States.     We understand that you will soon mark up the 2007 Farm Bill and we intend to work with you to include AgJobs as part of this bill. Protecting the viability of the nations agricultural economy as well as our ability to rely on a healthy, safe domestic food supply requires the availability of a steady agricultural workforce. Without an immediate solution to the ongoing farm labor shortage, both are in jeopardy.    Sincerely,     Barbara Boxer         Olympia Snowe  United States Senator     United States Senator ###
