 Washington, DC 창 U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced the Senate approved $48 million to deepen the Port of Oakland창s harbor, improving the waterway for commercial shipping use.    
"As the fourth busiest port in the nation, Oakland harbor is one of this country창s most important economic gateways," Boxer said.  "It is essential we deepen the Oakland harbor so that the next generation of commercial ships can reach the Port of Oakland.  This environmentally sound project will also use material left over from dredging to restore wetlands in the San Francisco Bay.  I am very pleased that the Senate has recognized the importance of this project to California and the country." 
Senator Boxer, who has been a leader on the Oakland harbor dredging project since 1998, obtained funding in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
The funding will be used to dredge the Inner and Outer Oakland harbor to a depth of 50 feet, which will allow the largest container ships to navigate the harbor.  This project will expand the country창s shipping capacity and will create approximately 8,800 additional jobs.    
The Oakland harbor project also has environmental benefits. All of the dredged material from the Oakland harbor deepening project will be used to improve the San Francisco Bay, including wetland restoration, habitat enhancement and upland use projects.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
