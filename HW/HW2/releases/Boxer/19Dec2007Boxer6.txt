 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes funding requested by Senator  Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for a key water project in Tulare County.  The Senate approved $11,619,072 in funding to ensure the  stability of the Success Dam on the Tule River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  determined that the current dam could collapse in a high-magnitude earthquake.   This important funding will help  protect the community from flooding in the event the Success Dam becomes  compromised, Senator Boxer said. Due to the current state of the Success Dam, the Success  Reservoir cannot be filled to its normal capacity, causing a reduction in water  supply in an already water-short region. Being able to fill the reservoir to  full capacity would increase water supply available for agriculture irrigation  for the areas farmers.  The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 76 to17. The  House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this week, at  which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
