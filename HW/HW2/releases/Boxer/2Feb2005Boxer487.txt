 The President delivered a very strong speech.  Unfortunately, he fired the first salvo against Social Security that could put millions of Americans in jeopardy. 
The President also put forward a blank check for Iraq and an open ended commitment for our troops. 
At the same time, the President called for deep cuts in domestic spending, which will mean cuts in education, the environment and transportation.
