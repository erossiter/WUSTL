 Washington, D.C. The U.S. Senate tonight passed an amendment by Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) that would repeal the Global Gag Rule on international family planning assistance.  The repeal of the Global Gag Rule policy is long overdue, Boxer said. Thousands of women have died because of this dangerous policy, and I will work as hard as I can to see that it is finally overturned.    The Boxer-Snowe Amendment repeals the Global Gag Rule, which President Bush established by executive order on his first working day in office in 2001. Also known as the Mexico City Policy, the Global Gag Rule denies U.S. international family planning assistance to foreign non-governmental organizations that use their own funds to counsel women on the availability of abortion, advocate for changes to abortion laws, or provide legal abortion services.     The Boxer-Snowe amendment passed by a vote of 53-41. ###
