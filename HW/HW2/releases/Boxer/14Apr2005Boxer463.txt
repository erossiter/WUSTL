 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes funding for the Napa River Salt Marsh Ecosystem Restoration Project.  The bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Senator Boxer is a member.    
âThis Napa River Salt Marsh Restoration Project will restore wetlands, improve water quality and create a habitat for endangered species and birds,â? Boxer said. âI am very pleased that the Environment and Public Works Committee has agreed to recognize the importance of this project and agreed to fund it.â? 
Located 45 miles north of San Francisco along the San Pablo Bay, the Napa River Salt Marsh Restoration Project will be the largest restored wetland on the West Coast. This restoration will improve water quality and provide habitat for endangered species and waterfowl.    
Under Boxerâs proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, the project is authorized for a total of $100.5 million including a federal contribution of $64 million and non-federal (local and state) contributions of $36.5 million. The funding will be used for pre-construction, engineering and design to desalinate and restore the wetlands.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
