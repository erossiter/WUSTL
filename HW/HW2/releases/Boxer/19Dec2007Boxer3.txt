 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes funding requested by Senator  Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for key projects in the San Diego region.  Boxer sought funding for the  following projects included in the omnibus spending  bill: Mission San Luis Rey:  The Senate approved $639,860 in funding to give the Mission the ability to connect to the City of Oceansides water pipes and  provide for three fire hydrants on the property, which are critical for health  and fire-safety reasons. We're making great progress in  restoring our Missions and we have to continue to work to preserve these  historic California landmarks for future generations,  Senator Boxer said. *** Chula  Vista Alternative Fuels Pilot Project: The  Senate approved $738,000 in funding to test the feasibility of incorporating a  20% mixture of hydrogen into fuel for a portion of citys transit fleet. Doing  so should reduce nitrous oxide emissions by half.  *** San  Diegos Domestic Violence Initiatives Gun Violence  Prevention: The Senate approved $223,250 in funding to expand the Gun  Violence Interdiction Initiative, which proactively identifies people who are in  illegal possession of firearms and takes those firearms out of their  hands. *** Logan Heights Family Health Center: The Senate approved $76,643 in  funding to expand the Logan Heights Family Health Center and increase capacity for an  additional 10,000 uninsured and underserved people in San Diego. The center  currently provides primary healthcare and dental services to over 50,000  patients a year. The Senate passed this bill by a vote of 76 to17. The  House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this week, at  which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
