 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate Commerce Committees bipartisan draft FAA Reauthorization Bill includes her request to delay consolidation of the Palm Springs TRACON into the Southern California TRACON.  The provision stops the consolidation until both the FAA and the newly proposed Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board have thoroughly reviewed the FAAs recommendation to consolidate. Boxer said, I am so glad that the Commerce Committee has heard the calls of the air traffic controllers, pilots, and members of Congress, who have raised a number of concerns on the proposal. So Cal TRACON is reported to be among the busiest in the world, with 2.2 million operations annually and growing rapidly. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association reports that the facility is already dangerously short-staffed and operational errors are rising. Boxer has shared the concerns of NATCA and AOPA that the So Cal TRACON would not have adequate staffing and training to safely absorb the additional 220,000 operations from Palm Springs, a complex airspace and surrounded by mountainous terrain. Boxer said, This should send a signal to the FAA to immediately delay a potentially dangerous situation. Todays action by the Commerce Committee means this consolidation should stop in its tracks. To that end, I have today sent a letter to FAA Administrator Blakey alerting her to this provision and telling her that if FAA moves forward with this consolidation, it will be viewed as bad faith by all of the parties involved.
