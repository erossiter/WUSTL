 Washington, D.C.Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) joined Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar (R-IN) in reintroducing the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act. 
The Lugar-Boxer legislation, first introduced in the 108th Congress, would help those most vulnerable to the HIV-AIDS pandemic throughout the world in three key ways: 
First, the bill would authorize the President to provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in the areas of basic care, HIV-AIDS treatment, school food programs, protection of inheritance rights, and education and employment training assistance. 
Second, this bill calls on the President to use U.S. foreign assistance to support programs that eliminate school fees that prevent children from attending school. 
Finally, the bill would require the President to develop and submit to Congress a strategy for coordinating, implementing, and monitoring assistance programs for orphans and vulnerable children, including measurable performance indicators to ensure that our policies are effective. 
It is estimated that 14 million children have lost either one or both parents to HIV-AIDS.  By the year 2010, it is estimated that this number will grow to 25 million.  The pandemic has created an orphans crisis, especially in sub-Sahara Africa where this crisis is most severe. 
Boxer said, "The struggle of those children orphaned by HIV-AIDS is heartbreaking.  After experiencing the trauma of seeing their parents' illness and death, they are left alone, often caring for younger siblings, while suffering from deep poverty, hunger and sicknesses." 
"We cannot stand by and allow this suffering to continue.  This legislation offers real, tangible assistance to these children, and I am proud to be working with Senator Lugar on this compassionate and critical effort."
