 Todayâs Supreme Court cases regarding the scope of the Clean Water Act could determine the fate of protections for clean drinking water, effective flood control, fish nurseries and pristine lakes and rivers.  Our god-given lakes, rivers, and wetlands are some of our nationâs most treasured and significant resources.  These protections must be preserved.    
Today also marks the first significant environmental cases before the new Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. I trust that when Justice Roberts and Justice Alito said that they would uphold precedent, that they would do so and I call on them to continue these vital protections.
