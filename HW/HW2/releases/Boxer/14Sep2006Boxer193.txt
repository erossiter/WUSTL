 Washington, D.C. â Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced the Sacramento River Bend National Recreation Area Act, legislation that would designate 17,000 acres of BLM public land adjacent to the Sacramento River Bend as a National Recreation Area.    
Senator Boxer said, âThis is quintessential California landscape.  By designating this special place as a National Recreation Area, Californians and all Americans will be able to share in the natural wonder of the area and the recreational opportunities it provides.  I thank Senator Feinstein for supporting this legislation and look forward to working with members of the community to get this legislation passed.â?    
âThis legislation will safeguard 17,000 acres of pristine lands along the Sacramento River in Tehama and Shasta Counties," Senator Feinstein said.  "The North State has so much to offer to those who love the outdoors.  Designating these lands as a National Recreation Area will only add to its charm.  Let me thank Senator Boxer for taking the lead on this legislation, and I hope to work with her and with Congressman Herger to move this bill through the House and the Senate.â? 
This proposed designation has broad support locally, including from the Boards of Supervisors of both Tehama and Shasta counties, and the City of Redding.    
Located about 140 miles north of Sacramento near the town of Red Bluff, much of the areaâs stunning landscape is oak woodland, the ecosystem most threatened by development in America.  One of the last wild sections of the Sacramento River, this healthy stretch supports four salmon runs and abundant bird life, including American bald eagles and osprey.    
Senator Boxer also included this acreage as part of the California Wild Heritage Act, which she introduced in March of 2006.
