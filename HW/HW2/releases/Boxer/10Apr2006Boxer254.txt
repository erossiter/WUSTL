 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist: 
April 10, 2006   The Honorable William H. Frist    United States Senate    509 Hart Senate Office Building    Washington, D.C. 20510-4204 Dear Senator Frist: I am writing to express my deep disappointment at the Senates failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation before the April recess and to urge you to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass a compromise bill immediately upon our return. Immigration reform is particularly important to California, which shares a 145 mile border with Mexico.  Hundreds of thousands of people in California, Washington, D.C. and throughout the country have taken to the streets to make their voices heard about immigration reform. Everywhere I go, people of every race, income, and profession want to talk about this issue.  That is why I am so dismayed at how this important debate unfolded in the Senate last week.  How could you go to a press conference to laud the Martinez-Hagel compromise, and then turn around the next day and refuse to proceed to that legislation unless we allowed dozens of amendments that would gut it? A compromise is supposed to be the ending point of negotiations, not the starting point.  There is still time for us to fix our broken immigration system, but only if we work over the recess to develop and defend another compromise solution.  I believe that any compromise should increase our border security, create a path to legality for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants who are currently living in the shadows, and adopt the reforms in the AgJOBS bill. Finally, a new compromise should once again reject the inhumane provisions in H.R. 4437 that would criminalize hardworking undocumented immigrants and make felons of those who provide health care, food, and other humanitarian assistance to them.    Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer
