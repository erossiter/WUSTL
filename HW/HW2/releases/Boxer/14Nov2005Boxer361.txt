 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $200,000 to expand the Semitropic Groundwater Storage Bank in Kern County was approved by the Senate.    
"Kern County remains the central hub of water banking in California," Boxer said.  "This funding will help ensure that this facility can continue performing its vital function of making water available to residents and businesses throughout the Golden State." 
Senator Boxer obtained the funding for Semitropic Groundwater Storage improvements in the final version of the Energy and Water appropriations bill.    
Funds will help expand the facilityâs storage capacity by 650,000 acre-feet and create an emergency water supply of 290,000 acre-feet per year.  The project is expected to result in improved water quality in the California Aqueduct, and to contribute to the CALFED storage goal.    
Located in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, the Semitropic Groundwater Storage project has been operational for over seven years.   The facility, which is one if the nationâs largest water banking programs in the nation, contributes to the dry year water supply for over 20 million people in the Central and Southern California areas.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
