 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has agreed to delay the consolidation of the Palm Springs TRACON into the Southern California TRACON.    Boxers office received a call this morning from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) confirming the delay of the TRACON consolidation, an action Boxer has been seeking for months. The FAA has also confirmed the delay.    Last month, the Senate Commerce Committee passed the FAA Reauthorization Bill which included a Boxer provision to delay the consolidation until both the FAA and the newly proposed Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board have thoroughly reviewed the FAAs recommendation. Boxer also personally spoke with U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and FAA Administrator Marion Blakey to urge a delay of the proposed consolidation.    Boxer said, Although I dont yet have the final details, I am very pleased today that our efforts to delay this consolidation have paid off. I thank the air traffic controllers, pilots, and members of congress who have all worked so hard to delay this potentially dangerous consolidation. In particular, I want to thank the Commerce Committee on which I serve, for passing the FAA Reauthorization that included language calling for this delay.   The So Cal TRACON is reported to be among the busiest in the world, with 2.2 million operations annually and growing rapidly. National Air Traffic Controllers Association reports that the facility is already dangerously short-staffed and operational errors are rising. Boxer has shared the concerns of NATCA and AOPA that the So Cal TRACON would not have adequate staffing and training to safely absorb the additional 220,000 operations from Palm Spring, a complex airspace and surrounded by mountainous terrain.
