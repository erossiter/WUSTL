 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $1,000,000 in funding for the planning and design of grade separations at 27 areas within the City of Riverside where train tracks and roads intersect.  I am pleased that the committee approved this funding to help the City of Riverside address the problem of severely delayed traffic at grade crossings, Boxer said. The construction of new grade separations will help make it easier for cargo to move inland and across America from our ports, as well as make the roads safer for the community.   The $1,000,000 was included in the FY 2008 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Bill. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration. ###
