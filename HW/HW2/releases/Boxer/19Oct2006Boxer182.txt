 Los Angeles, CA â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking him to immediately investigate attempts by an unnamed group to intimidate Hispanic voters in Southern California.    
Boxer also sent a letter to several groups asking them to encourage legally registered voters to cast their votes on November 7.    
Both of Senator Boxerâs letters are pasted below.  
October 19, 2006   The Honorable Alberto R. Gonzales    Attorney General    United States Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.    Washington, D.C. 20530 Dear Attorney General Gonzales: I write to urge you to begin an immediate criminal and civil investigation into the persons and organizations responsible for the recent mailing of fraudulent letters to Hispanic voters in Orange County, California. The despicable purpose of these letters was to intimidate and harass Hispanic voters in Orange County, and I urge you in the strongest terms possible to quickly find and punish the persons who have committed this offense against not only the Hispanic voters of Orange County, California, but also against the heart of our democracy â the right to vote. Recently, a letter was sent to Hispanic voters in Orange Country stating that immigrants could not vote in the upcoming General Election on November 7, 2006. The letter stated that immigrants âvoting in the federal election [commit] a crime that can result in incarceration, and possible deportation for voting without the right to do so.â? The letter goes on to advise that voting in the election could be âdangerous.â? Such threats and intimidation against Hispanic voters are outrageous and reprehensible, and potentially violate several federal laws, including the Voting Rights Act and federal criminal statutes. On July 27, 2006, the President signed the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The President stated â[t]he right of ordinary men and women to determine their own political future lies at the heart of the American experiment,â? and that â[m]y administration will vigorously enforce the provisions of this law â¦â?  I urge you to keep the promises made by the President by quickly bringing the persons who sent these letters to the Hispanic voters of Orange County to justice. Looking forward to your immediate response, as this is an urgent and timely matter.    Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer        United States Senator     cc: Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty    Assistant Attorney General Alice S. Fisher (Criminal Division)    Assistant Attorney General Wan J. Kim (Civil Rights Division)    United States Attorney Debra Wong Yang    California Attorney General Bill Lockyer  
---------------------------------------------------------------  October 19, 2006  Dear friends, I was appalled to learn that an unnamed group tried to intimidate Hispanic voters in Southern California by sending a letter stating that it is a crime for immigrants to vote and they could be deported for voting.  In response to this despicable act, I have written to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to ask for a quick and thorough investigation.  I hope you will let all of your members know that I have taken this action and that I strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to exercise their right to vote this November.   I encourage you to disseminate voting information that is true and accurate. Accurate information can be found at the California Secretary of Stateâs website at http://www.ss.ca.gov. Prejudiced and hateful actions must be fought at every turnâour democracy is the centerpiece of who we are as a nation, and that begins with our right to vote.     Sincerely,  Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
