 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced that the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill passed today by the Senate includes $250,000 for the Mercy Affordable Housing project in San Francisco.    
"The Mercy Housing project provides San Franciscoâs low-income families with safe, affordable housing," said Boxer. "These resources will help Mercy Housing better serve  San Franciscoâs low-income families." 
The $250,000 Economic Development Initiative will help fund Mercy Housingâs Affordable Family Housing and Commercial Space project at 10th and Mission streets in San Francisco.  When completed, the Mercy Housing project will provide 27 units of affordable housing with commercial space.  The commercial portion of the property will provide affordable office space for Mercy Housing and other nonprofit organizations.    
Mercy Housing is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing affordable housing to low-income families, seniors, people with HIV/AIDS, formerly homeless people, and individuals with chronic physical impairments or mental illness.  Earlier this year, Senator Boxer visited Mercy Housing in San Francisco and pledged to fight for additional funding.    
This appropriations bill provides funding for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2006.    
The House approved this appropriations bill in June.  The bill will now go to conference.
