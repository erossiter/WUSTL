 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today made the following statement on President Bushs veto of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA):   Senator Boxer said: President Bushs veto of the Water Resources Development Act breaks his commitment to the people of Louisiana to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina; breaks his commitment to Americas communities to make them economically strong and protect them from flooding; breaks his commitment to make Americas infrastructure a priority; and breaks his commitment to restore our environment, including the Everglades.     We haven't had a WRDA bill in almost seven years, leaving many of California's and our nation's water infrastructure needs unmet. This WRDA bill provides critical flood protection for California, including authorizing necessary modifications at Folsom Dam to protect hundreds of thousands of people in the Sacramento area.  It also authorizes critical environmental restoration projects, including projects at the Los Angeles River and the Salton Sea.   We are already working across party lines in the Congress to override this ill-advised veto.    The WRDA conference report includes over $1.3 billion in authorizations for 54 flood control, ecosystem restoration, navigation, and other water projects in California including:      $444 million to improve, strengthen, and expedite Sacramentos flood control protection at Folsom Dam;      $106 million to repair and strengthen levees in the Bay Delta;     $40 million to establish a statewide program for critical water quality infrastructure in California;     $25 million for L.A. River restoration to restore habitat for fish and wildlife and provide recreational opportunities along the riverbanks;     $1.6 million for the ongoing comprehensive flood protection program in Petaluma;     $30 million for Salton Sea restoration, which is vanishing into the desert causing severe air quality problems in Southern California;     $87.5 million for environmental restoration on the Napa River Salt Marsh;    The Senate passed the WRDA Conference Report last month by a vote of 81-12.  The Congress will now hold a vote to override the veto.      ###
