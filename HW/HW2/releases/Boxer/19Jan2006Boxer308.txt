Dear Mr. President: 
California suffered severe damage during the series of storms which ravaged our state from December 19th through January 2nd, including damage to homes and businesses, transportation problems, power outages at businesses and residences, evacuations and storm related fatalities and injuries.  On January 2nd, 3rd and 12th, Governor Schwarzenegger declared a State of Emergency in 34 counties due to massive flooding, mudslides, high winds, and levee breaching.    
On January 17th, after preliminary damage assessments, Governor Schwarzenegger requested that you declare a major disaster for the State of California under the Stafford Act.  In particular, the Governor requested the following:    
Individual Assistance for Contra Costa, Del Norte, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, Sacramento, Siskiyou, Solano and Sonoma Counties.   Public Assistance for Alpine, Amador, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Trinity, Yolo and Yuba Counties.   Hazard Mitigation statewide. Implementation of the U.S. Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Emergency Loan Program.   Assistance with debris removal.     I urge you to act immediately on his request.    
Thank you for your prompt response.    Sincerely,  Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
