 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes funding requested by Senator  Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for key projects in Orange County.  Boxer sought funding for the  following projects included in the omnibus spending  bill: Orange County Groundwater Reclamation: The Senate  approved $142,992 in funding to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use  by regulating the amount of water delivered based on soil, slope and type of  landscape. This will reduce runoff which transports pollutants through  waterways to beaches and the ocean, improving water quality. *** Santa  Anas Work Experiences and Literacy Program:  The Senate approved $728,107 in funding for the implementation of a  work experience and literacy skills program that would provide job training,  English proficiency classes, job placement assistance and financial literacy  courses. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 76 to17. The  House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this week, at  which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
