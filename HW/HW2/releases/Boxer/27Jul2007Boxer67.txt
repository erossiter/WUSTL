 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that the final Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes an authorization for $30 million in funding for Salton Sea restoration.   Boxer said, The State has come forward with its preferred plan for the restoration of the Salton Sea, and this authorization will help provide the expertise and needed resources to start this important process. If we allow the Sea to continue to deteriorate, we risk not only losing an important ecosystem for migratory birds and wildlife, but also increased air quality problems for the region.    The Salton Sea provides critical habitat for migratory birds and is faced with eroding water quality and diminishing water supplies. Under Boxers proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, $30 million is authorized for the initiation of pilot projects. These projects will help improve water quality, create habitat, enhance recreation, and contribute directly to the Salton Seas full restoration. The bill language also requires the Army Corps of Engineers to review the State Department of Water Resources final plan for restoration.   WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, recreation and other water projects across the country. The Senate and House conferees reached agreement this morning on the final bill. The conference report is expected to be filed in both chambers on Monday.   ###
