 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate approved $125,000 to fund a comprehensive study on replacing Inglewoodâs aging sewage pipes.    
"It is essential that the decaying pipes of Inglewoodâs aging sewer system are replaced," Boxer said.  "By providing a solid blueprint to overhaul the cityâs pipeline, this study will help local officials complete the first step in improving the overall water quality for Inglewoodâs residents." 
Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt F. Dorn said, "I want to thank Senator Boxer for her constant efforts on behalf of the city of Inglewood and the state of California.  Inglewood's transmission pipeline project will benefit from $125,000 in funding obtained as a direct result of Senator Boxerâs hard work.  Thank you for always being there for our residents, businesses and community." 
Senator Boxer obtained federal funds for the study in the final version of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill.  Funding for the study will allow Inglewood to complete the first step of replacing susceptible sewer lines, approximately 160 miles of pipes that are between 50 and 70 years old and prone to rupture.    
The study will produce a viable design of new transmission lines and estimate the projectâs total cost.  Because new pipes will prevent contaminated water from seeping into the water table, the project will result in clean, safe drinking water for area residents.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
