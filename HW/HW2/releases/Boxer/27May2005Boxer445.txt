 Santa Cruz, CA â On Thursday, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer awarded her Conservation Champion Award to OâNeill Sea Odyssey for its work to educate students about the importance of protecting the marine environment. Senator Boxerâs Field Representative, Jennifer Tang, presented the award.    
Founded in 1996 by surfer and wetsuit innovator Jack OâNeill, OâNeill Sea Odyssey gives students hands-on lessons about the marine habitat and the important relationship between the living ocean and the environment. The program is conducted on board a 65-foot catamaran, with follow-up lessons at the shore-side Education Center at the Santa Cruz Harbor. OâNeill Sea Odyssey has served 30,000 students since 1996.    
"I am happy to give OâNeill Sea Odyssey my Conservation Champion Award," said Senator Boxer. "By educating these students early on about the importance of protecting our marine environment, we can help ensure that our oceans are preserved for our children and grandchildren," Boxer said.    
Jack OâNeill, founder of OâNeill Sea Odyssey, said, "We deeply appreciate Senator Boxer's support for our program. The ocean is vital to our existence, and we've got to protect it." 
Senator Boxer established the Conservation Champion award in January 2000 to recognize individuals and organizations working to promote a safe and healthy environment.
