 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today issued the following statement regarding the Presidentâs nomination of Judge John G. Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day OâConnor on the United States Supreme Court:    
"Without prejudging the nominee, I do believe Judge Robertsâ record raises questions about his commitment to the right to privacy, protection of the environment, and other important issues.    
"With so many rights of the American people hanging in the balance, this Supreme Court nomination deserves a thorough and in-depth evaluation.    
"Justice Sandra Day OâConnorâs replacement could take one of two paths: Judge Roberts could go down the same independent, non-ideological road as Justice OâConnor, or he could join with the right-wing block on the Court which has consistently expressed the belief that a womanâs right to choose isnât guaranteed, nor is the federal governmentâs ability to protect workers, the environment, and a family-friendly workplace.    
"I look forward to the in-depth hearings by the Judiciary Committee and a further evaluation of this nominee."
