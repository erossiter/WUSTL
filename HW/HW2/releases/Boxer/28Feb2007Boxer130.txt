 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) sent the following letter to the Chair and Vice Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee today requesting a hearing on the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007, legislation they introduced to ensure that travelers are not unnecessarily trapped on airplanes or deprived of food, water or adequate restrooms:   February 28, 2007   The Honorable Daniel Inouye         Chairman         Commerce Committee         United States Senate       Washington, D.C. 20510  The Honorable Ted Stevens      Vice Chairman      Commerce Committee      United States Senate      Washington, D.C. 20510           Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman:         We are writing to respectfully request that you schedule a hearing on our bill, S. 678, The Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2007, which we drafted in response to the recent incidents where passengers were locked in grounded planes for up to 11 hours without sufficient food, water or restroom facilities.  Our bill takes simple, straightforward steps to protect passengers from being held hostage without proper care and comfort during extended delays. First, we would require airlines to offer passengers the option of safely leaving a plane if it remains on the ground for three hours after the doors close. Second, we would ensure that airlines provide passengers with food, safe drinking water and adequate restroom facilities during delays. Our bill allows an exception to the three hour deplaning rule if the pilot reasonably believes that allowing passengers to deplane would be unsafe due to extreme weather or other emergencies. And if the pilot reasonably believes that departure is imminent, he or she can delay the three hour limit for thirty minutes.  We know the airline industry would prefer Congress to stay on the sidelines. That is exactly what happened in 1999, the last time they faced a similar public outcry. As you will recall, that winter, hundreds of passengers were trapped on flights out of Detroit for up to eight hours, prompting the Congress to hold hearings and consider new laws. The Air Transport Association responded with a voluntary 12-point customer service pledge, including a promise of better customer care during delays. Unfortunately, recent events call into question whether the airlines continue to live up to that pledge, and we think it is important for the Commerce Committee, under your leadership, to once again to consider legislative remedies.  Thank you for your consideration.     Barbara Boxer       United States Senator Olympia Snowe      United States Senator
