 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the California Department of Transportation received four National Scenic Byway Program grants totaling nearly $500,000 for the Volcanic Legacy All-American Road.    
This Volcanic Legacy All-American Road stretches from Crater Lake National Park to Lassen Volcanic National Park.  The grant money will be used to help promote the byway through marketing, interpretation, management and visitor orientation to provide important information for the future development and promotion of the nationally-recognized bywayâs assets.    
Boxer said, âI am thrilled that the rural communities in Northern California have been successful in bringing such a wonderful vision to reality.   This grant money will help promote this national treasure so all Americans can enjoy the natural beauty and recreational assets along this All-American Road.â? 
Siskiyou County Supervisor LaVada Erickson said, âNot only are we immensely proud of the Volcanic Legacy, it has helped to gel the many communities and agencies in an effort to showcase this most unique American route.â? 
The visitor orientation stations will be placed at some of the most noteworthy stops along the Shasta segment of the byway and will help visitors to appreciate the many wonders and attributes that are the Volcanic Legacy.    
President of the Volcanic Legacy Community Partnership Mike Rorke said, âThe completion of these visitor interpretation and orientation stations will enhance the travelerâs ultimate experience along the byway resulting in a satisfaction that only can be improved upon by returning to this great scenic hideaway.â? 
The Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway became an All-American Road in 2002.  Under the U.S. Department of Transportation, the All-American Road designation is the highest, most prized scenic byway designation in the country.
