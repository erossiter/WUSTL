 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today issued the following statement in support of the Senate resolution expressing no confidence in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales:   The Attorney General is the attorney for the people of this country, not the attorney for any political party or political agenda. In my view, Alberto Gonzales has been the attorney for Karl Rove and the political operatives in the White House. During his confirmation in 2005, I expressed strong concern that Alberto Gonzales lacked the judgment and independence to execute the obligations of the office of Attorney General. My concern was founded upon Mr. Gonzales record as White House Counsel and the grave consequences of the policies he helped create. Mr. Gonzales helped create policies to circumvent the Geneva Conventions that have caused damage to Americas standing in the world. Unfortunately, my concerns about Mr. Gonzales as Attorney General were well founded, as demonstrated by his record. He has defended the warrantless wiretapping of American citizens, and supported the stripping of habeas corpus rights from detainees. Also, he was responsible for the firing of 8 United States Attorneys for politically-motivated reasons. Under Mr. Gonzales leadership, the Justice Department is no longer viewed as a standard bearer for the rule of law in this country. Mr. Gonzales has lost my confidence, and the confidence of the American people, and it is time for him to resign.
