 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to President Bush:    
  				  August 29, 2005    
The Honorable George W. Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20500    
Dear Mr. President:    
I wrote to you on August 11, 2005 to urge you to immediately stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and utilize the reserve to provide American consumers and the U.S. economy with some relief from skyrocketing oil prices.      
In light of the tragic events currently taking place in our Gulf Coast Communities, I again write to encourage you to take advantage of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and provide our nation with some relief at this critical time.       
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is currently at its highest inventory ever with approximately 700 million barrels of crude oil and could easily be used to make up for disruptions in our energy supply caused by Hurricane Katrina.    
I urge you once again to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and utilize the reserve to stabilize our market.  This oil can be replaced when the price of oil returns to reasonable levels.    
Thank you for your consideration.    
  Sincerely,    
  Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
