 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today introduced legislation to provide for the Purple Heart to be awarded to all prisoners of war who die in captivity, regardless of the cause of death.    
The âHonor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act,â? which was previously introduced by Representative Bob Filner in the House, would make members of the Armed Forces who die in captivity under any circumstance eligible to receive the Purple Heart.     
Currently, only prisoners of war who die during their imprisonment of wounds inflicted by an instrument of war are eligible for posthumous Purple Heart recognition.  Those who die of starvation, disease, abuse or other causes during captivity are not.    
Boxer said, âThe purpose of the Purple Heart is to honor those who are killed or wounded in action as the result of an act of an enemy of the United States.  It makes no sense that the thousands of Americans who were held and died as prisoners of war would not be treated with the same respect and honor as those who died on the battlefield.â? 
The legislation is retro-active to December 7, 1941, and would therefore include all POWs who have died in captivity since World War II.    
The âHonor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Actâ? has been endorsed by the Tiger Survivors, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Korean War Veterans Association, National League of POW/MIA Families, and a number of other prominent veterans organizations.
