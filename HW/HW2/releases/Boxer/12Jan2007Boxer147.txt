 Washington, DCU.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today called on United States Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Michael Johanns to closely monitor the impending frost that threatens Californias citrus farmers with massive losses and, if the frost is as extensive as predicted, to immediately issue a disaster declaration. Senator Boxers letter follows todays declaration of disaster from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The text of Senator Boxers letter follows: January 12, 2007  The Honorable Michael Johanns     United States Department of Agriculture     1400 Independence Avenue SW     Washington, DC 20520  Dear Secretary Johanns:  Today, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency due to unseasonably cold weather headed for Californias Central Valley. This cold weather event is expected to have a tremendous impact on California agriculture, particularly the States citrus industry. Should the freezing temperatures have the anticipated impact on the States agricultural industry, I urge you to immediately issue a secretarial disaster declaration and provide disaster assistance to help producers recover their losses.  Past experience with such extreme winter-weather events in the Central Valley tells us that the impact of the freeze could be extensive. In 1997, the last time California experienced such low temperatures, $550 million in citrus crop value was lost.  California citrus growers have been working tirelessly throughout the week preparing for the predicted cold weather by picking as much of their fruit as possible and implementing plans designed to save fruit left in the fields. But National Weather Service meteorologists predict that temperatures will be low enough to sustain very significant damage to the un-harvested citrus crop, which is valued at $1 billion.       In order to make the farmers of my State whove been impacted by the freezing temperatures eligible for Federal assistance, I urge you to immediately issue a secretarial disaster declaration if the impact of the freeze is as extensive as predicted. Please be assured I will do all I can to guarantee that the United States Department of Agriculture provides the necessary resources to our impacted citizens.     Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
