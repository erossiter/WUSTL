 Washington, D.C.â The U.S. Senate today approved an amendment by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from utilizing appropriations for wasteful spending on items such as silk plants, art consultants, gourmet coffee and party planners.    
In April, Boxer sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff decrying an Inspector Generalâs report that showed the Transportation Security Administration had wasted  $500,000 on "decorative and miscellaneous items."    
Boxer said, "Our nationâs Homeland Security needs have been underfunded for years, so to find out that one of our agencies was wasting taxpayer dollars on silk plants and art consultants was just appalling.  Homeland Security dollars need to be spent making our nation safer, not making our offices prettier."    
The Boxer amendment was accepted by unanimous consent.
