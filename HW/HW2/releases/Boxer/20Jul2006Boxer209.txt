 Washington, D.C. â In light of a power outage earlier this week at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today urged Federal Aviation Administrator Marion Blakey to investigate what caused the outage and then remedy the problem.    
Following please find Senator Boxerâs letter to Administrator Blakey: 
 July 20, 2006 The Honorable Marion C. Blakey      Administrator      Federal Aviation Administration      800 Independence Avenue, SW      Washington, DC 20591  
Dear Administrator Blakey:  I am writing about the power outage at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale. As I am sure you are aware, the backup generator failed.   Not only were thousands of travelers stranded, but there could have been a serious accident because pilots lost radar contact. Garth Koleszar of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association told the Los Angeles Times, The airplanes were allowed to come into the system unguarded ... my idea of safety is being 100% sure 100% of the time where an aircraft is. We did compromise safety here a bit.  I am sure you agree that it is crucial for the safety of the flying public that the FAA's backup generators work. I respectfully urge you to investigate what went wrong and then fix it  so the backup generators at the FAA facilities are reliable. I would appreciate if you could inform me on the status of your investigation.     Sincerely,         Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
