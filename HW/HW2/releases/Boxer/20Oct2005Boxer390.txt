 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill passed by the Senate includes over $27 million for San Diego area rail projects.    
"These rail projects will help ease traffic congestion in the San Diego area, and promote environmentally sound ways for commuters to get to and from work and their homes," Boxer said. "I am pleased that the Senate voted to fund these important projects." 
The bill includes funding for the following projects:    
Project: Oceanside-Escondido Rail Corridor Amount: $12,210,000  Funds will be used to convert 22 miles of existing freight railroad into a passenger rail service that will serve Oceanside, Vista, San Marcos, and Escondido, as well as unincorporated portions of San Diego County.  The project will add 15 new stations, and is expected to reduce traffic congestion on Highway 78, which runs parallel to the line.    
Project: San Diego Mission Valley East Light Rail Extension Amount: $7.7 million   Funds will be used to help defray construction costs of the 5.8-mile, four-station extension of the Mission Valley line (also called the Green Line) of the San Diego Trolley system.    
Project: Mid-Coast Light Rail Transit Extension Amount: $7,160,000   Funds will be used for a 10.7-mile, two-station extension to the Mid-Coast Corridor light rail transit (LRT) line.  The project will provide an alternative to the congested conditions on Interstate 5 north of downtown San Diego.    
The House approved this appropriations bill in June. The legislation now goes to conference.
