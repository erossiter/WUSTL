 The war in Iraq is the most important issue facing our country and the President has his head in the sand.   The Iraqis have not met a single of the 18 benchmarks we laid out, and yet this President has the audacity to ask for more patience while our troops are getting killed every day policing a civil war.    This President doesnt listen to Congress and he doesnt listen to the American people. The only way this war is going to end is if Congress finds the courage and will to do the right thing and mandate a change in our policy in Iraq. That is going to take 60 votes on the Levin-Reed amendment. I trust the American people will be watching closely.  ###
