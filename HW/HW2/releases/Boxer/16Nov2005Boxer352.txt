 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced Senate approval of $500,000 in federal funding for the city of Salinas and Monterey Countyâs joint gang task force.    
Boxer said, âBy uniting law enforcement professionals with community-based organizations, this innovative task force is providing effective solutions to gang violence in Salinas and Monterey County.  After visiting Salinas last year, I saw the need for this task force firsthand.  I am pleased the Senate agreed to fund this important project.â? 
The $500,000 in funding will support the work of the joint gang task force.  This amount is in addition to the $3,100,000 Senator Boxer obtained for the task force last year.    
The task force, established in 2004, is composed of two squads that bring together a diverse group of experienced law enforcement processionals, including police, probation, prosecution, criminal intelligence and criminal record personnel.  In addition, the group works with local community-based organizations to prevent at-risk youth from joining gangs.    
Last year, Boxer visited Salinas to speak with Monterey County Sheriff Mike Kanalakis, Salinas Mayor Anna Caballero, Salinas Police Chief Daniel Ortega, Monterey County Supervisor Chair Lou Calcagno and other local authorities to learn about gang violence in the area.  After her visit, Boxer heightened her efforts to secure funding for the task force.    
Gang-related violence is a prevalent threat in Salinas and Monterey County.  There are an estimated 5,000 gang members in Monterey County, with over 1,100 gang-related offenses in 2003.    
Senator Boxer obtained the funding through her request in the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006.  The bill will now go to the President for his signature.
