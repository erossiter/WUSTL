 Washington, DC - This Sunday, December 11, marks the 25th anniversary of the Superfund program.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works' Subcommittee on Superfund and Waste Management, issued the following statement.    
âThe federal government created the Superfund program 25 years ago to protect communities, families and children from dangerous toxic waste sites.  Only a few years ago, the Superfund program was cleaning up record numbers of the nationâs most heavily contaminated toxic waste sites. 
âHowever, under the Bush Administration, the pace of cleanups has declined by roughly 50 percent compared to the previous Administration.  This slowdown is unacceptable because it means more dangerous toxic waste sites will continue to menace our communities and poison our environment for longer periods of time. 
âThe Bush Administration must level with imperiled communities and families about the threats posed by the Administrationâs failure to clean up sites, and make polluters pay for clean up.â?
