 Washington,  D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) made the following statement: This is a groundbreaking report on the state of our military mental health system. It's very clear that the Department of Defense currently lacks the resources and personnel to provide our service members with the quality of care they need and deserve. But there are some very clear recommendations in this report, many of which can be accomplished without legislative action, and Sen. Lieberman and I are committed to seeing they are done. We will be looking to quickly meet with Defense Secretary Gates on this, and hope that he will embrace this report and work with us to see some changes implemented immediately. We need to create a culture of support for psychological health, which ultimately will lead to a stronger military.
