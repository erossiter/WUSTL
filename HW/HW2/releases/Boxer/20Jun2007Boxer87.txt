 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today  made the following statement after President Bush vetoed stem cell legislation  for the second time:  This is a very sad day for  America. With one flick of his pen,  this President has again put politics ahead of progress, and denied hope to the  millions of Americans suffering from diseases and conditions for which there is  no cure. No one knows for certain how many  lives we might save with stem cells. But denying hope to those who are  sufferingwhen hope is right there for the takingis disgraceful.   America  should be a leader on stem cell research. Instead, we have scientists leaving  the United  States because their work is stifled and there  is more opportunity in other countries. This veto is another call to action  for the American people.  ###
