 I believe this nomination is aimed at appeasing the most right wing elements of the President's political base, and in so doing the President turns his back on the hopes and dreams, and the rights and freedoms of the majority of the American People.    
Judge Alito may be soft spoken but if many of his opinions had prevailed the hard reality of his views would have hurt our families.    
Judge Alito has a record which includes opinions that would have undermined the rights of the American People, especially the rights of women, minorities and families.    
Had the President simply asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to finish this term on the Court, he could have avoided a bruising battle and united the country, instead of once again dividing it.    
It is especially ironic that at a time when all of America is honoring Rosa Parks that the President would send us a nominee whose decisions could jeopardize the principle of equality for all Americans.
