 Washington, D.C. - In light of record high oil and gas prices in California and across the country, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today called on Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman to implement a 5-step plan to decrease the nationâs reliance on oil.    
Following please find Senator Boxerâs letter to Secretary Bodman:  April 26, 2006    The Honorable Samuel W. Bodman    Secretary    Department of Energy     Washington, DC 20585 Dear Secretary Bodman:   With oil and gasoline prices reaching record high levels, I ask that you implement the following five-step plan for reducing the United Statesâ crippling dependence on oil. I based this plan on analysis from energy and environment experts. Your Department has jurisdiction over some of these recommendations, and I would ask that you exert your leadership with respect to the others. The five steps are:  Better Vehicle Gas Mileage     Raise fuel economy standards for all vehicles Close the fuel economy âSUV Loopholeâ? Broaden the Energy Star program to include vehicles   More Hybrid Vehicles     Extend the tax credit for hybrid vehicle purchases Place more hybrids and other fuel-efficient vehicles in government fleets Enhance incentives for hybrids to be used in taxicab fleets   Alternative Fuels       Make the Hydrogen Highway a reality Maximize the availability and affordability of ethanol and biodiesel Fund the development of agricultural waste ethanol fuel   Better Tires     Establish standards for fuel-efficient replacement tires   Convenient Public Transportation     Adequately fund public transportation Build more intermodal stations and park-and-ride facilities Expand rapid bus transit service     Achieving greater oil independence would result in improved national security, fewer gasoline price spikes, cleaner air, a stronger economy, and reduced highway congestion. The current high energy prices are a reminder that we must do more to reach these goals. Sincerely,   Barbara Boxer    United States Senator
