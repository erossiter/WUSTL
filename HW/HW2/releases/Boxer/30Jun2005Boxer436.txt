 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today reintroduced legislation to protect wireless telephone customers from having their cellular phone numbers listed in a national directory without their consent.    
Approximately 150 million Americans subscribe to wireless telephone service.  The wireless phone industry is planning to list customers in a wireless phone directory starting as early as this year.    
Boxer said, "As a cellular phone user myself, I know that people value the privacy of their cell phone number and rely on their phones to keep in touch with their families, work, and in cases of emergency.  It should be the consumerâs decision to list their number in a directory, and they shouldnât be charged a fee to keep that number unlisted." 
The Specter-Boxer Wireless Privacy Act would protect consumers by providing them with the right not to have their cell-phone number listed in the directory and the right not to be charged a fee for being unlisted.    
Specter said, "The wireless industry is on the verge of introducing a âwireless white pagesâ service, and though this step could have positive benefits, it raises concerns about how consumersâ expectation of privacy will be protected.  This legislation strikes an important balance-enabling those consumers who want to be reached to be accessible, while providing privacy protections that are important to consumers."
