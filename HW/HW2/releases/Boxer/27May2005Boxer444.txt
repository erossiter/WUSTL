 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that she has been named as a Senate conferee on the highway and transit bill conference committee.    
Earlier this year, the House and Senate passed different versions of the transportation bill.  The differences between the two bills must be reconciled in the conference committee before becoming law.  As a conferee, Boxer will play a key role in shaping the final bill.    
"California has so much to gain from the transportation bill," Boxer said.  "From creating jobs to easing congestion, this legislation has wonderful potential for our state.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to ensure that the final bill meets California√¢s needs." 
After the conferees reach an agreement on the transportation bill it proceeds to both the House and Senate for a final vote.   The bill will then be sent to the President for his signature.
