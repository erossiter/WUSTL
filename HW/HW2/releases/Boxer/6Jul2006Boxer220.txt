 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asking him to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve transit and rail security and to work with Congressional leaders to increase funding to be used for this purpose.    
Following please find Senator Boxerâs letter to Secretary Chertoff: 
July 6, 2006   The Honorable Michael Chertoff    Secretary     U.S. Department of Homeland Security    Washington, D.C. 20528 Dear Secretary Chertoff:  Tomorrow is the one-year anniversary of the London transit bombings. As you will recall, at 8:50 am, three bombs exploded on the Underground and about an hour later one exploded on a bus. The terrorist attack resulted in 52 people killed and over 700 injured.   These attacks, just 16 months after the horrific terrorist attack on Madrids rail system where nearly 200 people were killed, were powerful warnings for this country to improve transit security. However, I am concerned that this has not happened. According to a report released in June by the Democratic House Homeland Security Committee, ...nearly a year later, the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration have failed to produce a comprehensive strategy to secure Americas rail and mass transit systems.   This is unacceptable.  According to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), Americans take 33 million trips on transit each day. These are people who are going to work or school or just doing errands. We owe it to these people to ensure that they are being protected.  APTA has stated that there is $6 billion in transit security needs across the country. Last year, Congress appropriated only $150 million for transit and rail security  that is not enough.  If a terrorist attack on transit were to occur in the United States, we could not say that we have not been warned. We were just unprepared.   I urge you to develop a comprehensive strategy, work with Congressional leaders to increase funding for transit and rail security, and update me on any actions that your Department has undertaken in the last year to improve transit and rail security.    Sincerely,   Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
