 Washington, D.C.â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) will cosponsor a resolution with Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) calling on the Bush Administration to report to Congress on a timeframe for achieving its military goals in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq.    
Boxer said, âWhen the President is asked how long we will be in Iraq, he says: âAs long as it takes.â    
âI donât think thatâs a good answer.   I donât think the American people think thatâs a good answer.      
âIt is time that the Administration is forced to step up to the plate with a plan for Iraq.  It is time that we know what our mission is and how we will accomplish it.  It is time that we stop losing the lives of our brave soldiers, who are fighting this war with no end in sight.        âWith no exit strategy we are fueling terrorism as foreign fighters come into Iraq to fight what they view as âinfidel occupiers.â  Our silence on a timetable is making us less safe, and it gives the Iraqi government a message that they do not have to be responsible for the safety of their own country.â?
