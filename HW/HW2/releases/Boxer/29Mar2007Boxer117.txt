 Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that Committee approved a $12 million authorization for the restoration of the Los Angeles River as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007.    
Boxer said, "This project will help transform the LA River from a concrete canal into a beautiful asset for the city of Los Angeles.  This authorization is an important step toward the goal of restoring and revitalizing the LA River to provide flood protection for our communities and recreation areas along the riverbanks for our families." 
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said, "For more than two centuries, this river has been the literal lifeblood of Los Angeles.  We have the chance to create one of the world's richest public spaces along one of our city's most storied natural treasures. By supporting this bill, Congress will help spur a renaissance of bold urban planning that will stimulate the local economy and improve the quality of life for L.A.'s children and families." 
The $12 million authorization is for initial demonstration projects, including removing concrete, restoring ecosystems for wildlife, and providing recreational opportunities along the riverbanks for local residents.    
Senator Boxer also secured the LA River revitalization project authorization study, which authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to work with local entities, including the City of Los Angeles, to develop a plan to revitalize the LA River.    
WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, and other water projects across the country.
