 As we expected, it appears that the Pentagon is moving forward with a premature and irresponsible decision to shutter the C-17 line.  This decision is both fiscally reckless and  potentially harmful to our national security.  The Air Force had identified a need for additional C-17 aircraft, and given the aircrafts√¢ outstanding performance in providing airlift support for both war time and humanitarian missions, I think we should be building more C-17s, not killing this important program.    
Mothballing the line is a waste of taxpayer money, and I am working with my colleagues to see that the C-17 line stays open.
