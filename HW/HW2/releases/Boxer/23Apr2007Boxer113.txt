 "I am so saddened by the loss of my lovely friend Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald.    
"A kind-hearted woman and a loving mother, Juanita was a remarkable person who broke through so many barriers for women and African Americans.  Juanita approached her work with optimism and a can-do attitude√¢from fighting AIDS to the genocide in Darfur, from supporting the production of C-17 aircraft to port security, she was always a fighter.    
"This is a loss for all of California.  We will miss her dearly, and I pledge to continue her work in the Congress."
