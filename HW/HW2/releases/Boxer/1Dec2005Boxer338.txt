 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $200,000 in federal funds to restore San Franciscoâs Old Mint Building to provide a permanent home for the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society as well as the future site of the Museum of the City of San Francisco.    
âThe beautiful Old Mint Building played an important role in San Franciscoâs history and is a fitting home for the Museum of the City of San Francisco,â? said Boxer.  âThe museum will provide San Franciscans and visitors alike a chance to find out more about the history of our wonderful city.â? 
The $200,000 will provide the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society with funding for pre-construction architectural engineering of the Old Mint Building site, located at Fifth and Mission.  When completed, the Old Mint Building will house the Museum of the City of San Francisco.    
In 1994, after the U.S. Treasury announced plans to close the Old Mint building, Senator Boxer succeeded in having the closure delayed and then introduced successful legislation to transfer the building to GSA.    
Funding for the project was included in the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.    
The President signed this bill into law yesterday.
