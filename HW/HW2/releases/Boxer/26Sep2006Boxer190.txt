 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff: 
September 25, 2006   The Honorable Michael Chertoff    Secretary    U.S. Department of Homeland Security    Washington, DC 20528 Dear Secretary Chertoff:  I am writing to express my concerns about the distribution of this years port security grants. As I am sure you are aware, port security grants awarded to California by the Bush Administration have fallen from $33.3 million in Fiscal Year 2005 to $13.3 million in Fiscal Year 2006, a staggering 60 percent reduction.   Despite the fact that Californias ports carry over 47 percent of all goods imported into the United States, we are receiving only eight percent of the total port security grants funding. Therefore, this grant award decision is beyond outrageous, it is dangerous.  The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the number one port complex in the U.S., carrying over 40 percent of all goods imported into the country come through these ports. In FY2005, the ports received almost $24 million in port security grants. This year, the ports received just over $12 million  cutting their funding in half.   This year the Port of Oakland  ranked fourth in the nation for container traffic  received absolutely zero port security grant funding, compared to $2.9 million in FY05. Oakland had requested $6 million for security-related capital projects.   Clearly, a terrorist attack at any of Californias ports could shutdown our nations port system. This would be a devastating loss for our nations economy.      I would like to know why Californias ports are receiving such a drastic reduction in port security funding over a one-year period from the Bush Administration. I look forward to your prompt response.     Sincerely,         Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
