 Washington, D.C. B U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today called on the House Resources Committee Chairman Richard Pombo (R-CA) to withdraw his proposal to let private companies take advantage of mining claims and purchase Americaâs public lands for nominal fees.    
In her letter, Boxer said, âI implore you to withdraw your proposal and to avoid any attempts to pawn off Americaâs public lands for a pittance.  In addition, the language eliminates the federal governmentâs duty to clean up contamination on land conveyed under the proposal.â? 
Pomboâs proposed change, included in the budget reconciliation bill, could mean as many as 20 million acres of public land being sold to companies for private development, according to estimates by officials at the Interior Departmentâs Bureau of Land Management.  The measure would overturn an 11-year moratorium on companies patenting mining claims on public lands, giving them legal rights to the land.  Additionally, the proposal broadly waives the U.S. governmentâs responsibility to clean up pollution on federal land.
