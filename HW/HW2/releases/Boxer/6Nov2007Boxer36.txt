 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent a  letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking that she suspend her  decision to force diplomats to serve in Iraq and instead address concerns  raised by the Foreign Service about the need for additional support, training  and diplomatic security.  Following please find Senator Boxers letter to  Secretary Rice:  November 6,  2007  The Honorable Condoleezza  Rice  Secretary of State U.S.  Department of State 2201 C Street  NW Washington, DC 20520    Dear Secretary Rice: Last week, at an open meeting with members of the  Foreign Service, there was a strong expression of outrage over your decision to  force U.S. diplomats to serve  in Iraq against their will   an assignment that one senior member  of the Foreign Service called, a potential death sentence.   Rather than force diplomats to serve in  Iraq against their will, I urge you  to address the root causes of their concerns. During last Wednesdays meeting, one U.S. diplomat who had served in Basra said that she asked  for treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and didnt get it. Other  Foreign Service Officers have expressed concern about the lack of diplomatic  security in Iraq, a situation that demands  immediate attention given the ongoing investigations into the Blackwater private  security firm. Foreign Service Officers also state that they are not  adequately trained to serve in Iraq. During the Vietnam War,  diplomats received four to six months of training before deployment. Today,  training for an assignment in Iraq lasts just a few weeks. It is  unfair and irresponsible to force diplomats to serve in Iraq  and not provide the necessary training for them to do their  job. Finally, I hope that you will continue to publicly raise  the point that the Foreign Service is underfunded and undermanned. I understand  that there is a shortfall of more than 2,000 Foreign Service positions  throughout the world. Growing the size of the Foreign Service could help make  involuntary directed assignments unnecessary.  The Director General of the Foreign Service has  indicated that those who refuse to go to Iraq could face  dismissal from the Foreign Service. It is unconscionable that the State  Department is considering disciplinary actions against Foreign Service Officers  who refuse to serve in Iraq while at the same time failing  to address the causes of their concerns. I ask that you suspend your decision to force Foreign  Service Officers to serve against their will in Iraq and instead  take steps to address the anger and frustration that boiled over at Wednesdays  meeting.  As I understand that directed assignments could be  considered as soon as November 13, I ask for your prompt response to this  letter.   Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer                United States Senator     ###
