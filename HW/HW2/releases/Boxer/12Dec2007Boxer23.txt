 Washington, D.C.  Today, U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Arlen Specter (R-PA), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the Wireless 411 Privacy Act, legislation to protect wireless telephone customers from having their cellular phone numbers listed in a national directory without their consent.   Boxer said, This bill is good news for consumers because people should have the right to decide who has access to their wireless phone number.  There are more than 250 million wireless subscribers in the United States today. Without the protections provided in this bill, the cell phone numbers of countless Americans could be at risk.  As this legislation moves forward, I will continue to work to protect consumers.   At a time when so many people rely on their wireless telephones as a vital and important means of communication, the Wireless 411 Privacy Act strikes an important balance. Specter said. This legislation permits wireless carriers to offer the benefits of accessibility to those who want it, while providing privacy protections that are important to consumers.   Cell phones have become a vital part of many households.  Brown said. With more than 6.5 million cell phone users in Ohio, we must protect peoples privacy. Cell phone numbers should never be for sale.   Specifically, the bill would prohibit the listing of cell phone numbers in a wireless directory without the subscriber granting permission. The legislation requires cell phone companies to give consumers clear notice on their right not to be listed and prohibits carriers from charging customers for keeping their numbers private.     The Wireless 411 Privacy Act would also prohibit companies other than wireless service providers from assembling and publishing directories of private numbers and require cost-free removal of listed phone numbers for consumers.   Cellular phone customers can register their numbers online at www.donotcall.gov or by calling 1-888-382-1222.     ###
