 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today wrote Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to urge the Administration to abandon a proposal to sell off more than 300,000 acres of the National Forest lands, including 85,000 acres in California.    
Senator Boxerâs letter to Secretary Johanns follows:    
February 14, 2006  The Honorable Mike Johanns     Secretary of Agriculture    1400 Independence Ave., S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Johanns, I am greatly disturbed by the Administrations reckless proposal to sell off more than 300,000 acres of the publics National Forest lands. Most disheartening to me is that this proposal strikes at the heart of Californias natural heritage. More than 85,000 acres28% of all the Forest Service lands on the proposed chopping blockare in my State. Selling off these lands would also forever deny the Federal Government the opportunity to exchange them for other lands that could prove more valuable in the long term to our public lands system and our conservation needs an option we have often exercised in the past. A cursory review of the California lands included in this proposal shows that you are putting for sale roadless areas and wild and scenic rivers hardly mere parcels of land that do not meet our forest service needs, as your agency has described. Selling away our national heritage to pay for this Administrations fiscal irresponsibility is immoral and ignores your duty to be a sound steward of our national lands. I request that the Administration immediately withdraw its proposal.  Sincerely,  Barbara Boxer     United States Senator
