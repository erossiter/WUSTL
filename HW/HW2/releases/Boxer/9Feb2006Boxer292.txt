 We are grateful that our intelligence agencies are working overtime to disrupt terrorist networks.  The assistance of one of our Southeast Asia allies proved critical in this situation, which is why it is so important that we maintain these relationships and continue to confront terrorism as a global problem.    
The irony of the President√¢s speech, however, is that he was speaking to the National Guard, which is overstretched in Iraq, leaving us less prepared here at home if we were again attacked on U.S. soil.    
I call on the President to work with Congress to improve our homeland security, which is drastically underfunded.
