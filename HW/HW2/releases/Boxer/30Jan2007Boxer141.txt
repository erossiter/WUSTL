 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today said she was relieved and pleased that the Continuing Resolution (CR) being considered by Congress to fund programs for the remainder of FY2007 contains restored funds for transportation to the full SAFETEA-LU authorized level of $39.1 billion. California traditionally receives approximately 10 percent of these funds.  Boxer said, I am so relieved that we were able to work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that this critical funding was restored. Without these funds, highway projects and economic growth could have been disrupted.  Boxer initiated efforts to secure full funding for transportation in the CR by sending a letter with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, to the Senate leadership on January 12, 2007. Boxer also led a bipartisan letter to Senate leadership on January 17th, urging Senate leaders to ensure that the CR supports Congress commitment to invest in Americas infrastructure as outlined in SAFETEA-LU.  The CR also includes critical funding for education, including $13.6 billion for Pell Grants, which translates into a $260 increase in the maximum Pell Grant to $4,310. This increase  the first in 4 years  will help over 5.3 million students pay rising college expenses. In California, there over 535,000 Pell Grant recipients that will benefit from this increase. In addition, the CR includes $6.9 billion for Head Start, an increase of $103.7 million to help prevent a drop in Head Start enrollments. At its current funding, Head Start serves approximately 907,000 children across the country, including over 106,600 children in California.
