 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that she received a commitment from George Foresman, Under Secretary for Preparedness at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), that the Department will meet with San Diego officials to ensure that the data that was used by DHS to determine eligibility for Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) grants was correct.    
Boxer first wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff in January to express concern that both San Diego and Sacramento were deemed eligible only for âsustainment funding,â? and left off the list of high-risk cities eligible for UASI grants.    
Boxer said, âI am very pleased that DHS is going to take another look at this.  The San Diego area is adjacent to a heavily-trafficked international border, a busy port, tourist attractions, and major military installations.  It should never have been removed from this list.â? 
The removal of San Diego from the list of cities eligible for UASI grants will not take effect until 2007, so Boxer feels there is adequate time to correct this error.
