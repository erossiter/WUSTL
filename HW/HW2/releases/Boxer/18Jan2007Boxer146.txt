 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today said that there is unprecedented coordination to bring immediate relief to Californias agricultural sector as a result of the recent freeze.  A meeting will take place in Boxers office tomorrow to lay out a coordinated approach to addressing this disaster. Some of those attending include representatives from the offices of Senators Boxer and Feinstein, Representatives Cardoza and Nunes, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Boxer said, From my conversations with the President of California Citrus Mutual, Joel Nelsen, as well as several county supervisors, I know that this disaster is far reaching, with huge losses in much of the navel orange, lemon and tangerine crops, as well as the avocado and strawberry crops. Our only hope is that the summer Valencias will somehow survive, and we wont know that until March.  Boxer continued, We fear the potential loss of 12,000 jobs. The Mayor of Orange Cove, Victor Lopez, used the term total devastation to describe the disaster. He and Supervisor Ishida of Tulare County and Supervisor Case of Fresno County talked about the need for fast federal action to ensure that families dont go hungry or lose their homes. Members of the California delegation are working on a letter today to Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns asking him to immediately make a disaster declaration so that federal aid will be made available.
