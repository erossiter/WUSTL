 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Ranking Member Daniel Inouye (D-HI) have committed to work with her to get the $6.2 million necessary to establish a Comprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego.      
Senator Boxer said, âCalifornia and Texas lead the nation in the number of combat amputees returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, yet our state - unlike Texas - does not have a center to treat troops with these types of injuries.  This funding will allow our combat-wounded service members to receive treatment and recover from their wounds closer to their loved ones.â? 
The Navy had planned to establish a âWest Coast Walter Reedâ? at San Diego, but had not identified the funding necessary to do so.  Boxer received a promise from Stevens and Inouye to do all they could to make the project a reality.     
The San Diego Center will be able to treat approximately 200 patients a year, including 160 non-amputee patients and 40-50 amputee patients.  It will provide treatment for physical injuries, emotional needs, rehabilitation, and will help return service members to active duty or transition to civilian life.     
Currently, active duty service members who return from Iraq and Afghanistan with severe wounds receive long-term care at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, the Brooks Army Medical Center in Texas, or the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland.      
Boxer said, âWhile I lament that even one more service member would be wounded in combat, I look forward to the opening of this Center and to working with the Navy to ensure that our service members receive the best medical care possible.â?
