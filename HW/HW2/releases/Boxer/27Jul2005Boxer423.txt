 Washington, DC 창 U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that she obtained $300,000 to begin restoration of one of California창s Missions.  The funds are in the Interior Appropriations bill.    
"This is just a first step in our effort to restore all of California창s 21 Missions." Boxer said.    
The funds for this project will go toward stabilizing and restoring the San Miguel Mission, which was nearly toppled by the Dec. 22, 2003, earthquake in nearby Paso Robles.  County inspectors closed the building indefinitely as a result of damage incurred by the earthquake and related safety concerns.  The San Miguel Mission is in dire straits since the earthquake.    
Knox Mellon, executive director for the California Missions Foundation said, "This funding is appropriate and well deserved.  My primary thanks goes to Senator Boxer whose absolute commitment and unrelenting pursuit of this funding for the preservation of these historical landmarks was essential." 
California창s 21 Missions are the most visited historic attractions in the state, drawing over 5.5 million tourists a year.  They account for a sizeable contribution to the state economy, and are part of the education of California students.    
The House and Senate now vote on the Conference Report for the Interior Appropriation bill before the legislation goes to the President to be signed into law.
