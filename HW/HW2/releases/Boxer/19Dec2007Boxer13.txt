 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes funding requested by Senator  Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for key projects in the Los Angeles region. Boxer sought funding for the  following projects included in the omnibus spending  bill: Metro Gold Line Extension:  The Senate approved $78,400,000 in funding to extend the Gold  Line light rail transit from Downtown Los Angeles to East Los Angeles.
