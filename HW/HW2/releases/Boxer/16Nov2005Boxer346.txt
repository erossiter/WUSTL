 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced Senate approval of $100,000 in federal funds for enhanced supervision of domestic violence offenders in Solano County, providing additional monitoring of known offenders, victim outreach and coordination with county and local law enforcement agencies.    
âProtecting our families from the threat of domestic violence, and ensuring that appropriate agencies and law enforcement have the support they need to prevent tragedy, is, and has always been, a high priority for me,â? Boxer said.  âI am pleased that the Senate agreed to fund this important program that will help protect our children and families.â? 
Funds for the supervision program were included in the final version of the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.    
The funding will enable the Solano County Probation Department to have more frequent contact with domestic violence offenders and their families than caseloads typically have allowed.  The program will establish relationships between the department, victims and their children and closer monitoring conditions of probation.  In addition, the funds will help develop coordination between appropriate treatment agencies, Child Protective Services, and the Solano County Police Department and local law enforcement.    
The enhanced monitoring program will also provide funds for an additional journey level supervision deputy to be assigned to higher risk family violence offenders (a maximum of 50 probationers), reducing the general family violence caseload to a more manageable level.    
The FY2006 CJS appropriations bill funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice.  The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
