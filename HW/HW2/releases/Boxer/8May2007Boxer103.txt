 Washington, D.C.  The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee today passed a fuel efficiency bill that includes a provision by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to ensure that new cars purchased by the federal government are the most fuel efficient.  The Boxer provision, based on her Fuel-Efficient Fleets Act of 2006, requires each new automobile procured by an Executive agency for the federal fleet to be as fuel efficient as practicable. The provision also requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration to submit a report to Congress evaluating the efforts of the Executive agencies to comply with this directive by December 31, 2009.  Boxer said, When it comes to fuel efficiency, the federal government should be a role model. By requiring that the government add only the most fuel-efficient vehicles to our federal fleet, we are helping reduce our dependence on foreign oil and serving as an example for states and businesses to do the same. Boxers other legislation to make government buildings role models of energy efficiency will be on the Senate floor in the next several weeks. The Commerce Committee fuel efficiency bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
