 After surviving the Holocaust, Simon Wiesenthal dedicated his life to honoring its victims by bringing its perpetrators to justice.    
By fighting against intolerance and genocide everywhere, he worked tirelessly to see that 창Never forget창 would someday mean 창Never again.창    
We in California have a special bond with Simon Wiesenthal because the Simon Wiesenthal Center is based in Los Angeles.  The Wiesenthal Center preserves the memory of the Holocaust and continues the work of Simon Wiesenthal by fostering tolerance and understanding through community involvement, educational outreach, and social action.    
The world has lost one of its great heroes today, but we shall never lose sight of the lesson he taught us: that humanity will rise up against hate and tyranny, and those who commit crimes against humanity will be brought to justice.
