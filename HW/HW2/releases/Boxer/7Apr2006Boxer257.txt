 I am distressed the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is considering a proposal to severely restrict the upcoming salmon fishing season. This proposal was written in a way that reflects the worst case scenario, and should be recalculated to reflect the better health of some of our salmon runs.    
Our fishing communities are not to be blamed for our declining salmon population, so they should not be bearing the brunt of this decision.  The problem today is the Bush Administrationâs  water and energy policies, which do not respect the needs of our fishing communities.     
If a proposal to restrict the upcoming salmon fishing season moves forward, it should include financial assistance to keep our fishing communities whole, else they face terrible losses.  We must also work to change current policies in order to restore our wild salmon population and improve the health of the Klamath Riverâ I will be working my colleagues in the House to introduce legislation to do just that.
