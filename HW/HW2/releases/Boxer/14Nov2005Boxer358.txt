 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $4,562,000 to dredge Humboldt Harbor, deepening its entrance for better commercial use, was approved by the Senate.    
"An improved harbor will give a great economic boost to Humboldt County, which relies on shipping and vital activity in this major port," Boxer said.  "I am pleased that the Senate recognized how important these improvements are for the region and California." 
Senator Boxer obtained funding to deepen Humboldt Harbor in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
Dredging Humboldt Bay, the only deep-water port on Californiaâs north coast, will maintain shipping channels for reliable commercial and recreational marine traffic.  The maintenance project also fulfills a precondition of the Harbor Districtâs revitalization plan, approved in February 2003.  Once fulfilled, the plan is expected to attract more industries to locate on the bay, create thousands of high-wage jobs, and raise property values.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
