 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced the Senate passed her proposal for $401,000 to help improve the San Joaquin Valleyâs poor air quality.    
Boxerâs provision provides federal funds to study agricultural emissions and identify scientifically valid and cost-effective options for reducing emissions in the Valley.    
âEvery day, residents of the San Joaquin Valley are exposed to a serious health threat by breathing the regionâs polluted air,â? Boxer said.  âThis funding will address the air pollution problem, and help find new ways to improve the quality of the Valleyâs air.â? 
The funding for the project was included in the final version of the agriculture appropriations bill for FY06.    
The San Joaquin Valley has one of the most serious air pollution problems in the state and the nation.  The region has yet to meet federal clean air standards, and cases of asthma and other respiratory illnesses are found in increased levels in the Valley.    
Studies show air pollution also contributes to heart attacks and sudden deaths.  The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has identified certain agricultural sectors as major sources of the regionâs air pollution.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
