 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced that the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill passed today by the Senate includes over $96 million for Bay Area rail projects.    
"With these resources, Bay Area communities will see expanded BART and MUNI lines to better serve their needs," Boxer said. "I am pleased the Senate has agreed to fund these important Bay Area transportation projects." 
The bill includes the following funding for Bay Area rail projects:    
BART to SFO Extension: The bill includes over $81 million for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to San Francisco Airport Extension.  The project, which is already operational, provides direct BART service to SFO by adding over 8 miles to the existing 95 mile BART line.  The project also includes a cross-platform transfer between BART and Caltrain service. 
San Francisco MUNI Third Street Light Rail Project: The bill includes $10 million for the second phase of the San Francisco MUNI Third Street Light Rail project.  The funding will help extend the light rail line by 1.7 miles underground into San Francisco√¢s Chinatown district. 
Silicon Valley Rapid Transit Corridor Project: The bill includes $5 million for preliminary engineering to extend the BART heavy rail system from Fremont to Santa Clara.  The 16.3 mile alignment would included seven stations, the construction of a new BART maintenance facility, and the purchase of rail cars to operate the extension.  
This appropriations bill provides funding for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2006. The House approved this appropriations bill in June.  The bill will now go to conference.
