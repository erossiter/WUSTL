 Washington, D.C. â In light of recent news reports that the nationâs antiterrorism database is rife with locations of little to no national security risk, the U.S. Senate today passed an amendment by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from spending preparedness directorate funds on administrative and management employee travel until the Inspector Generalâs recommendations for overhauling the database are implemented or they explain to Congress why they have not been implemented.    
Boxer said, âThe Inspector Generalâs report outlines a case of gross mismanagement within the Department of Homeland Security.  It is absurd that at least 32,000 of the 77,000-plus assets in our National Asset Database are sites of no national significance.  I would love to provide protection for every activity in America, but the reality is that we need to set priorities.  There is no excuse for including sites facing no significant threat at a time when the Department of Homeland Security is downgrading its risk assessment for San Diego, Sacramento and other high-risk locations.â?
