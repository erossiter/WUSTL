 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) will include funding for ecosystem restoration of the Matilija Creek.  The bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Senator Boxer is a member.    
âThis project will help restore the natural beauty of the Matilija Creek for the community as well as the wildlife species that inhabit the creek,â? Boxer said. âI am very pleased that the Environment and Public Works Committee has recognized the importance of this project and agreed to fund it.â? 
Under Boxerâs proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, the project is authorized for a total of $127,812,000 including a federal contribution of $78,973,000 and non-federal (local and state) contributions of $48,839,000.  The funding will remove the Matilija Dam, which no longer provides flood control for downstream communities.  This will restore the creek for fish and wildlife species, including the endangered steelhead, as well as downstream coastal beaches.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
