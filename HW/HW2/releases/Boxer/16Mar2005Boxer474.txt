 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today supported passage of the highway bill through the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on which she serves.  The bill will boost Californiaâs share of return for highway funding to 92% in the final year of the bill.  In 1992, the year Boxer was first elected to the Senate, Californiaâs share was 83.2%. Overall highway funding for California will rise from an average of $2.6 billion per year to an average of $3.3 billion per year â a 27% increase in annual highway funding. 
"This bill is an improvement over current law for Californiaâs infrastructure," said Senator Boxer.  "It is vitally needed for our commuters, our cities and towns, and our businesses that depend on our roads to move their products.  And while it is not as good as the bill we passed in the Senate last year, it is important that we move this bill forward and try to strengthen it on the Senate floor."
