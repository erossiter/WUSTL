 Washington, D.C. 창 U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement in response to the President창s State of the Union address:    
The President talked tonight about the importance of leadership and restoring the public trust.  Unfortunately, his words ring hollow when you consider his actions.    
He said that he supports efforts to strengthen ethical standards in Washington, yet he refuses to disclose his Administration창s contacts with Jack Abramoff.    
He said that special attention needs to be paid to children who lack direction and love, yet he fails to fund No Child Left Behind and afterschool programs.    
He talked about how far we have come in history, and the importance of not turning back, yet he nominated a Judge to the Supreme Court who would take us back to the days when women were deemed criminals for exercising their right to choose.    
This President is simply out of touch with ordinary Americans.    
Where is the fix for the Medicare prescription drug program?  Where is the increase in the minimum wage, which hasn창t been raised in 9 years?  Where is the plan to cut gas prices and stem job losses?    
The President gave short shrift to the mess they made of Katrina.  He failed to address our homeland security needs, and he is still giving a rosy scenario on the situation in Iraq, which is belied by the realities on the ground and a cause of great anxiety across our country.    
I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to address the real needs of American families.
