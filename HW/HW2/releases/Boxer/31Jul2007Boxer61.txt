 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement:    My heart goes out to the Tillman family, who have already been through so much and continue to fight tooth and nail to learn the truth about the tragic death of Pat Tillman.   We still dont know the full story about the way the Pentagon and this Administration managed this tragedy. What we do know, clearly, was that Lt. General Philip Kensinger provided misleading testimony to Army investigators and the Office of the Inspector General  a serious offense under Article 107 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   By making false statements and withholding the facts about Pat Tillmans death, General Kensinger deeply hurt the Tillman family in a way that cannot be rectified. In my view, the Army should reconsider todays announcement and instead move forward with harsher penalties.
