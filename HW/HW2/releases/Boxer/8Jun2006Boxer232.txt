 Abu Musab al-Zarqawi deserved the end that he got and I am grateful to our Armed Forces for his demise.  
Al-Zarqawi brought al Qaeda to Iraq and it is estimated that he is responsible for 10 percent of the most brutal terrorist attacks.  
I support this type of targeted mission for our troops, which can be achieved from the region while Iraqi security forces provide for the day to day security of their own people.
