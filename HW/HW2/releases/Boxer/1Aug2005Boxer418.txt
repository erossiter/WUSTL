 The President's decision to recess appoint John Bolton to the United Nations knowing that he didn√¢t tell the truth on a document which he swore was truthful, and knowing that they have stonewalled the Senate on critical information, is just another example of the arrogance of power displayed by this Administration over and over again.  A majority of Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee did not support this nomination and more than forty senators of both parties stopped this nomination from going forward several times.    
Can't this Administration ever admit that they made a mistake?    
To send such a controversial individual to be our representative to the world will only undermine our efforts to win friends and allies at this critical time.
