 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today responded to a report on gas price gouging issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC);  the report was mandated by an amendment Boxer offered with Senators Byron Dorgan and Debbie Stabenow to the 2005 Energy Bill:    
âThis is business as usual from the FTCâthis report is a lot of work that says nothing, and the oil companies are laughing all the way to the bank.      
âThis report proves that this Administration is owned and operated by big oil.      
âFTC Chairwoman Majoras is going to have to do much better before the Senate Commerce Committee tomorrow, where I intend to challenge her on the FTCâs findings on the Bakersfield Refinery, which fly in the face of reality.â?
