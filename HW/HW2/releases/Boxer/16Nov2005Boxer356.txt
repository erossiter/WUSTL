 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced Senate approval of $600,000 in federal funds to support the San Mateo County Sheriffâs Forensic Lab Improvement Initiative.    
Boxer said, âThe San Mateo County Sheriffâs Forensic Lab supports a wide variety of criminal justice agencies, yet their facilities have not been updated in years.  This funding will help the lab handle an increased caseload and better serve the agencies it works with.â? 
The San Mateo County Sheriffâs Office Forensic Laboratory offers scientific support to criminal justice agencies including local law enforcement, state agencies and federal agencies including the FBI.    
The $600,000 in funding will be used to help the laboratory deal with a higher number of cases, upgrade equipment and meet staffing needs.  Last year alone, 5,190 cases were submitted for processing by the laboratoryâs 18 staff members.    
Boxer obtained this funding through her request in the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006.  The bill will now go to the President for his signature.
