 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes more than $734,000 in funding  requested by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for after school and gang prevention  programs in San  Bernardino County. The bill includes $421,995 to help the San Bernardino  Boys and Girls Club expand its programs and renovate its facilities. The Club  currently serves over 1,500 registered members and is home to key programs that  emphasize character, leadership development, education, career development,  health and life skills, sports and recreation. This long-overdue funding will help  the dedicated people of the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino to continue  and expand their efforts to provide our youth with a brighter future,  Boxer said.  The spending bill also includes $312,550 for the City of  San Bernardinos  G.R.E.A.T gang prevention program, a school-based partnership between the city,  county probation, and the school district to provide gang resistance education  and training (G.R.E.A.T.) and case management to high-risk  youth. The Senate passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of  76 to17. The House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this  week, at which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
