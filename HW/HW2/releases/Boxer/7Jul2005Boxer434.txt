 This horrific terrorist attack reminds us again that our focus must be to apprehend terrorists all around the world and do much more to protect the American people by improving security in our transit systems, at our nuclear power plants, at our landmarks, and at our ports.    
I send my deepest sympathies to our British friends, and I will do all I can to refocus our attention on our united goal after 9/11:  to capture those responsible for these inhumane acts of terrorism.
