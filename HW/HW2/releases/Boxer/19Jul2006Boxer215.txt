 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that a key appropriations subcommittee has approved $200,000 for the construction of the Carl R. Hansen Teen Center at the Stanford Settlement Neighborhood Center in South Natomas, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Sacramento.      
âWe know that teen centers help improve the lives of our young people by giving them a place to go after school and providing them with the tools they need to succeed,â? Boxer said.  âI am pleased that this funding will help with the construction of the new Carl R. Hansen Teen Center for Sacramento area teenagers.â? 
The $200,000, which was included in the FY 2007 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Bill, will go towards construction of the new Carl R. Hansen Teen Center at the Stanford Settlement Neighborhood Center.    
Currently, the center serves approximately 150 teens and offers homework, recreational activities and counseling assistance. The new center will expand services to the communityâs growing number of youth and will serve 7th-12th graders.  The new facility will include: recreation areas, computer lab and study room, and offices for small group counseling.    
The Subcommittee bill will now go before the full Senate Appropriations Committee where it is expected to pass.
