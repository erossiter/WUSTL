 Washington, D.C. â The U.S. Senate today passed legislation by Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-CA) that would protect approximately 300,000 acres of public lands in California.  Congressman Mike Thompson (also D-CA) introduced the House version of the bill.    
The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act will protect select areas in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake Mendocino and Napa counties by designating portions of the public land as "wilderness."   The bill also designates a free flowing portion of the Black Butte river as "wild and scenic."    
"This bill ensures that some of Northern Californiaâs most treasured wild places will remain wild," Boxer said.  "By protecting the natural beauty that is part of Californiaâs identity,  future generations will be able to cherish and enjoy this land." 
Feinstein said,"The King Range is a vast and beautiful tract of land.  It is one of Californiaâs great environmental treasures. Thatâs why Iâm so pleased that the Senate has approved legislation to protect 300,000 acres along Californiaâs northern coast including the King Range. Senator Boxer and Representative Thompson have shown great leadership in moving this bill forward. I look forward to working with Chairman Richard Pombo to try and move this bill through the House soon." 
Thompson, said, "Today the North Coast Wilderness Bill cleared a major hurdle on the track to putting this important legislation on the presidentâs desk.  Without Senator Boxerâs and Senator Feinsteinâs hard work this bill would not have passed the Senate." 
Boxer added, "I would like to send my gratitude to the many wonderful Californians who contributed to this community effort.   I would also like to thank Senator Feinstein and Congressman Mike Thompson for their leadership."
