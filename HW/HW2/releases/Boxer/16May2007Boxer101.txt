 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that the Senate-passed Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes an authorization for $30 million in funding for Salton Sea restoration. Boxer said, This authorization comes at an important time for the Salton Sea. The State of California is finalizing a plan for restoration, and federal funding should be a part of this critical effort. If we allow the Sea to continue to deteriorate, the region could face enormous problems, including major air quality concerns.  The Salton Sea provides critical habitat for migratory birds and is faced with eroding water quality and diminishing water supplies. Under Boxers proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, $30 million is authorized for the initiation of pilot projects. These projects will help improve water quality, create habitat, and contribute directly to the Salton Seas full restoration. WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, and other water projects across the country. The bill now goes to Conference with the House of Representatives, which passed its version of WRDA in April.
