 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate passed Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes authorization for $26 million in funding for the ongoing restoration of the Salton Sea.    							  âI am so pleased that the federal government has been given the go-ahead by the Senate to fund this project. This support is essential to our continuing efforts to restore the Salton Sea,â? said Boxer.  âWith 90 percent of Californiaâs wetlands gone, the Salton Sea is more important than ever as a vital stopover for millions of migrating birds.â? 
The Salton Sea provides critical habitat for migratory birds and is faced with eroding water quality and diminishing water supplies. Under Boxerâs proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, $26 million is authorized for the initiation of pilot projects.  These projects are designed to improve water quality, protect the habitat, and contribute directly to the Salton Seaâs full restoration.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.
