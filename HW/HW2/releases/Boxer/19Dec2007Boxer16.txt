 Washington, D.C.  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the  Fiscal Year 2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes more than $7  million requested by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for key water projects in Humboldt and Del  Norte Counties. Boxer sought funding for the  following projects included in the omnibus spending  bill: Humboldt Bay and Harbor-  $5,098,104 -  Funding to maintain safe commercial and recreational navigation in  Humboldt Harbor and Bay.  Boxer said, The  funding garnered will help to preserve the entrance and shipping channels to  Humboldt Bay. Adequate maintenance dredging  will not only sustain commerce, but also improve navigation safety and  environmental protection in the region. *** Martin Slough Interceptor-  $984,400 -  Funding for the Martin Slough Interceptor Project will improve the existing  wastewater collection and transmission infrastructure between the City of  Eureka and  Humboldt Community Services District. The project will increase the reliability  of the existing wastewater collection system and avoid wastewater overflows in  the project area.  Modifying this wastewater system is  vital for public health and the environment, Boxer  said.  *** Crescent City Harbor - $225,336 -  Funding for maintenance dredging to keep the Federal Channel in Crescent City Harbor. Crescent CityHarbor is the only harbor of refuge  between Coos Bay, Oregon and Fort  Bragg, California.  *** Rural Emergency Healthcare Capital  Improvement Project - $76,643 - Funding is for critical  improvements to Trinity Countys only remaining acute care  hospital, Mountain Community Medical  Services.  The Senate passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of  76 to17. The House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this  week, at which point it will go to the President for his  signature.  ###
