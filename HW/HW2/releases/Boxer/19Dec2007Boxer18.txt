 Washington, D.C.   Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2008 omnibus appropriations  bill, which includes funding requested by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for key  projects in the San Joaquin region.   The Senate approved $133,950 in  funding for the ongoing Central California Ozone Study (CCOS). The study will  provide important data and analysis on air quality and emissions and identify  feasible, cost effective emission controls to meet the 8-hour ozone  standard. Every day, residents of  the San Joaquin Valley are exposed to the  regions polluted air, Boxer said. This funding will address this serious health threat,  and help find new ways to improve the quality of the Valleys  air. The Senate also approved $2,816,208 in funding for  annual maintenance dredging of the federally authorized Stockton Ship Channel as  well as work to maintain existing river bank protection in the California Delta.   The Senate passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of  76 to17. The House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this  week, at which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
