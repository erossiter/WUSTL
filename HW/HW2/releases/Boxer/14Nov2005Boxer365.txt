 Washington, DC B U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $800,000 to remove the Matilija Dam, which is expected to revitalize the natural habitat of Matilija Creek, was approved by the Senate.    
"I have worked with local officials for many years on the removal of the Matilija Dam.  Originally built to provide water storage and flood control for Ventura County residents, it is now full of sediment and useless for these purposes," Boxer said.  "Removal of Matilija Dam will allow local officials to continue with the restoration of Matilija Creek and its diverse ecosystem." 
Senator Boxer obtained federal funding to restore Matilija Creekâs ecosystem in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
Because of the build up of silt in the lake behind Matilija Dam, the barrier no longer provides flood control for downstream communities.  Removing the dam will restore the creekâs flow and allow numerous fish and wildlife species, including the endangered southern steelhead trout, to flourish in the waters again.  The built up silt and sand behind the dam will flow downstream, replenishing coastal beaches to improve them for the public to enjoy.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
