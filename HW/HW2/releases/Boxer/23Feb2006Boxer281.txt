 The Bush Administration's deeply flawed Human Pesticide Testing rule fails to incorporate the ethical standards and public health protections mandated by Congress with bipartisan support. The rule is riddled with loopholes, fails to protect the most vulnerable among us, including pregnant women and children, and should not stand. I strongly support the legal challenges to the Administrationâs rule filed today in federal court.  The citizen groups that filed suit today have a simple request -- that the Bush Administration comply with the law.  I am looking forward to questioning the president's nominee to run EPAâs pesticide program during the confirmation hearing next week on this and other issues.
