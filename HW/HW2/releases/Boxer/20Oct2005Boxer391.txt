 Washington, D.C. B The United States Senate passed an amendment by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) last night that requires the Administration to protect the nation against the potential spread of Avian Flu by implementing procedures for U.S. airports and air carriers to deal with suspected cases of the virus.    
"We know that Avian Flu poses a huge public health threat to our country," Boxer said.  "By establishing clear guidelines for airports and airlines, this legislation will help ensure that our country responds quickly and appropriately to prevent the spread of the deadly Avian Flu virus." 
Boxerâs amendment would require the Transportation Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HSS) and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, to implement procedures for airports and air carriers in case a passenger on a flight from a country that has cases of Avian Flu exhibits symptoms.  These standard operating procedures would help ensure airports and air carriers know how to respond appropriately to minimize the spread of the virus.    
Last month, Senator Boxer wrote a letter to HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt asking him to take action to prevent an Avian Flu epidemic, with an emphasis on California.  Boxer encouraged Secretary Leavitt to ensure that there is enough anti-viral medication stockpiled to respond to an outbreak and to educate the medical community about identification and treatment procedures.  In addition, Boxer suggested Leavitt work with the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure airports are prepared.    
The Avian Flu is the most lethal flu the world has encountered â killing 55 percent of the people that are infected.
