 Washington, D.C. â Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced that a key Appropriations Subcommittee has approved $2 million to help fund the building of a new control tower at Palm Springs International Airport.      
Boxer said, âI am so pleased that the Subcommittee approved this funding to help build a new control tower at Palm Springs International Airport.  This new tower is needed to accommodate the growing traffic at the airport and to ensure the safety of our citizens.â? 
As the only commercial airport in Riverside County, Palm Springs airport must be able to handle the surrounding regionâs rapidly growing population and accompanying increased demand for air travel.  The current control tower, built in 1967, sits in a gulch, so air traffic controllers cannot see the ends of the runway â a serious safety issue.  The tower needs to be moved and its height raised.    
On July 6, Boxer sent a letter to Administrator Blakey asking her to prioritize the building of the new control tower.  Congress allocated $2.3 million in last yearâs appropriations bill for a new tower.    
The House approved this bill in June with $2 million allocated toward a new tower.  The Subcommittee bill will now go before the full Senate Appropriations Committee where it is expected to pass.
