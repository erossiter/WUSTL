 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that the final Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes an authorization for $683 million, including $444 million in federal funding to improve, strengthen, and expedite Sacramentos flood control protection at Folsom Dam.   Boxer said, After years of uncertainty and delay, the Army Corps is on its way to strengthening and upgrading Folsom Dam to better ensure the safety of Sacramento and nearby communities. This authorization of funds will bring the resources necessary to help move this project forward.   Sacramento is situated at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers. This locationand the regions aging flood control infrastructuremake Sacramento extremely vulnerable to catastrophic flooding.    Folsom Dam is a vital component of Sacramentos flood control infrastructure. However, significant upgrades and significant resources are needed to improve Sacramentos protection.    Over the past two years, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation developed the Joint Federal Project, a new proposal with improved engineering features to help control and slow water flow during major storms and provide Sacramento with more than 200 years of flood protection. As part of the plan, the project includes an auxiliary spillway to help manage excess water during major weather events. It can also be completed in considerably less time than previous engineering plans to upgrade up the Dam.  Boxer said, This is only the beginning of my committees efforts to improve Sacramentos flood protection, including enhancing protections along the Sacramento River. As Chairman of EPW, I will work to see that these needs are met. WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration and other water projects across the country. The Senate and House conferees reached agreement this morning on the final bill. The conference report is expected to be filed in both chambers on Monday.                          ###
