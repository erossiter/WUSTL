 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $475,000 to restore the watershed of the San Pablo Bay was approved by the Senate.    
"The San Pablo Bay watershed is an important natural habitat for migratory birds and marine animals," Boxer said.  "This funding will go a long way to ensure that our children and grandchildren can enjoy the natural splendor of the bay.  I am pleased that this important legacy of our beautiful state will be preserved for future generations." 
Senator Boxer obtained the federal funds for the restoration of San Pablo Bayâs wetlands in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
Funding will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to continue restoring 80 square miles of historic wetlands surrounding San Pablo Bay.  The project will benefit wildlife, improving the natural habitat for endangered fish species such as the Chinook salmon, and enhance the bayâs natural beauty for area residents and visitors.    
The end result of the project will lead to better ecological conditions, improved flood protection, less erosion and sedimentation, and natural pollution control in the greater San Pablo Bay area.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
