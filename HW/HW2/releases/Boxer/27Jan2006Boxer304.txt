 Los Angeles, CA â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement after learning that Chevron Corporation reported record high profits while Americans are paying more than $2.30 for a gallon of gasoline:    
âThe American people are very understandingâ they understood when Hurricane Katrina hit and we had disruptions in supply that caused higher gasoline prices.  But there has clearly not been a corresponding feeling of community from the oil companies.    
âI call on the Bush Administration and the Federal Trade Commission to put an end to this price gouging.  Youâd think FTC stood for âFriend to Chevronâ with the way they sit back and let these companies gouge consumers.â?
