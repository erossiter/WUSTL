 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer today sent the following letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff:    
   April 21, 2005    
The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U.S. Department of Homeland Security  Washington, DC 20528    
Dear Mr. Secretary:    
I was appalled to read the Homeland Security Inspector Generalâs report describing the Transportation Security Administrationâs egregious waste of taxpayer dollars for âdecorative and miscellaneous items totaling $500,000, most of which was spent on furnishing the facility with art and silk plants.â?    
As the new Secretary for Homeland Security, I urge you to ensure that transportation security funding is spent on transportation security.    
Three and a half years after the tragic terrorist attack and only one year after the horrific bombings in Madrid, we are not only underfunding our transportation security but diverting precious resources.    
The Coast Guard estimates a need of at least $5.4 billion for port security funding over the next ten years, and the American Public Transportation Association identifies $6 billion for transit security needs, including monitoring systems and canine units.  With TSA not having enough money to meet these needs, it is outrageous that half a million dollars was spent on decorations for a new operations center, including $252,392 for the purchase of artwork, $20,032 to an art consultant and an assistant, and $30,085 for the purchase of silk plants.    
I am sure you agree that this is absolutely unacceptable.  It didnât occur on your watch.  However, I would ask that you assure me that this kind of wasteful spending will not happen again.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senate
