 Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that Committee approved a $26 million authorization for the restoration of the Salton Sea as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007.    
Boxer said, "With 90 percent of California's wetlands gone, the Salton Sea is more important than ever as a vital stopover for millions of migrating birds.  But restoring the Sea is also about protecting the Coachella Valley's air quality. This federal support will bring in the engineering expertise and resources of the Army Corps of Engineers to help bring the Salton Sea back to life." 
The Salton Sea provides critical habitat for migratory birds and is faced with eroding water quality and diminishing water supplies. Under Boxer's proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, $26 million is authorized for the initiation of pilot projects.  These projects are designed to improve water quality, protect the habitat, and contribute directly to the Salton Sea's full restoration.    
WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, and other water projects across the country.
