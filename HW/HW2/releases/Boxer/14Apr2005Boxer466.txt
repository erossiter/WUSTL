 Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) increases the amount of days two large dredges on the Pacific Coast, the Essayons and Yaquina, can operate during the year.   The bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Senator Boxer is a member.    
âLifting the restrictions on these dredges is a huge boost to Humboldt Bayâs restoration and improvement,â? Boxer said.  âI am grateful to the Committee for recognizing the importance of improving the California coastline for better commerce, safety and a cleaner environment.â? 
Humboldt Bay is located approximately 260 miles north of San Francisco on California's north coast.  Under the added provisions, the dredges can continue to operate during winter months.  This means more sediment will be removed from the entrance of the Port of Humboldt - a step necessary to environmental and economic recovery for the region.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
