 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement:    
"While reserving final judgement on an immigration bill that has not yet been introduced, my initial reaction is as follows:    
"This immigration reform proposal appears to have many features I strongly support, such as AgJobs, the DREAM Act, strong border enforcement, and a legal path for those currently living in the shadows.      
"I have always had problems with a guestworker program because I believe it will lead to more illegal immigration and downward pressure on wages.  Therefore, I will be supporting amendments that deal with the guestworker program and other aspects of the bill that need improvement."
