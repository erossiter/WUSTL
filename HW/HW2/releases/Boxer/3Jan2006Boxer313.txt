Dear Governor Schwarzenegger:    
I understand that you have declared a state of emergency for seven northern California counties that have suffered from recent rainstorms that led to several deaths and widespread property damage in these and other parts of our state.    
Once you determine the need for federal disaster assistance in these and other affected counties, I will strongly support your request to the President and work to expedite the release of those funds.    
As you know, in many areas the impact of these storms was unprecedented.  I will work with you to see that everything possible is done to alleviate human suffering and help restore to normal the lives of those affected.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
