 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Transportation Appropriations bill passed by the Senate includes $200,000 to restore San Francisco창s Old Mint Building, providing a permanent home for the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society as well as the future site of the Museum of the City of San Francisco.    
"The Old Mint Building is an important part of San Francisco창s heritage and is a fitting home for San Francisco창s first city history museum," said Boxer.  "The museum will give Bay Area residents and visitors a chance to learn more about this great city창s rich and colorful past." 
The $200,000 will provide the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society with funding for pre-construction architectural engineering of the Old Mint Building site, located at Fifth and Mission.  When completed, the Old Mint Building will house the Museum of the City of San Francisco.    
Earlier this week, Senator Boxer joined Senator Dianne Feinstein (also D-CA) in introducing legislation to authorize a commemorative coin to honor and raise the funds necessary to restore the Old Mint.    
In 1994, after the U.S. Treasury announced plans to close the Old Mint building, Senator Boxer succeeded in having the closure delayed and then introduced successful legislation to transfer the building to the General Services Administration.    
This appropriations bill provides funding for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2006.    
The House approved this appropriations bill in June.  The bill will now go to conference.
