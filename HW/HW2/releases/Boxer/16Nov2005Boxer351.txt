 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced the Senate approved her request for $2,050,000 in federal funds for the University of California at Santa Cruzâs Center for Integrated Marine Technologies, part of the Institute of Marine Sciences.    
âThe Center for Marine Technology is on the cutting edge of marine research,â? Boxer said.  âBy gathering information to help us better understand our oceans, the Center is helping us protect one of our nationâs most precious natural resources.  I am pleased the Senate recognized the importance of this project by agreeing to fund it.â? 
The Center for Integrated Marine Technologies works with partners from around the Monterey Bay area to support coastal marine resources and public health.
