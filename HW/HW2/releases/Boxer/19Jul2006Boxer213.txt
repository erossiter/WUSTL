 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that a key subcommittee has approved $400,000 for the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino.    
âThe Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino provides at risk youth with a safe place to go after school and gives them an alternative to becoming involved in gangs,â? Boxer said.  âI am pleased that this funding will help the club continue to fulfill their mission of helping young people â especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds â realize their full potential.â? 
The $400,000, which was included in the FY 2007 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Bill, will help with repair and renovations of the facility.     
Founded in 1967, the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino currently serves over 1,500 young people.  The Club provides a number of activities for local youth, including basketball, swimming, computer training and more. The Club also houses several important community programs, including the San Bernardino County Head Start, a Counseling Clinic, the Reading for Success Program, the Youth Job Ready Program and Day Camp.      
In April, Boxer introduced Mynishaâs Law, legislation that would help combat gang violence in high-risk areas across the country by creating an interagency task force that would focus on early childhood intervention, at-risk youth intervention, literacy, employment and coordinate with local and regional gang prevention efforts.  At that time, Boxer announced that she would also seek funding for the San Bernardino Boys and Girls Club.        
The Subcommittee bill will now go before the full Senate Appropriations Committee where it is expected to pass.
