 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today introduced legislation to ensure that new cars purchased by the federal government for the federal fleet are the most fuel efficient.  Senator Boxer's legislation would also provide incentives for states to meet federal standards.    
Boxer said, âThis bill helps the federal government take a big step toward decreasing our nationâs demand for oil.  By requiring the government to add only the most fuel-efficient cars to our federal fleet, this bill helps the federal government lead by example.â? 
Boxerâs Fuel-Efficient Fleets Act of 2006 would do the following:    
 Require all new federal fleet passenger vehicles to obtain a minimum miles per gallon (mpg) based on vehicle type: The new fuel efficiency standards would be as follows: 45 mpg for cars, 36 mpg for SUVs, 24 mpg for pickup trucks, 20 mpg for minivans, and 15 mpg for vans.  Establish a phase-in schedule: The bill would require a phased-in implementation of the new standards.   Ensure a reopen provision: The bill would allow the fuel economy standards to be increased, each year, if automotive technology has improved.   Create incentives for state fleets to follow the federal governments lead: The bill would provide $100 million in grants as incentives for states to match or exceed the federal fleet standard for their states fleets. The grants would expire 5 years after enactment.
