 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that she has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit challenging the Environmental Protection Agencyâs rule on human pesticide testing for failing to comply with Congressional mandate to place strict limits on human testing.  Senator Bill Nelson and Representatives Henry Waxman and Hilda Solis joined Boxer in signing the brief.    
The original lawsuit challenging EPAâs human pesticide testing rule was filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council; the Pesticide Action Network, North America; Pineros y Campesinos Unidos Del Noroeste; Physicians for Social Responsibility, San Francisco; Farm Labor Organizing Committee, AFL-CIO; and Migrant Clinicians Network.    
Senator Boxer was the lead sponsor of an amendment that passed the Senate and served as a basis for final language passed into law as part of the 2006 Interior Appropriations that mandated EPA to limit human pesticide testing.  Specifically, the provision directed EPA to promulgate a rule that prohibited pesticide testing on pregnant women, infants or children.  The  provision also stated that the rule must be consistent with the Nuremberg Code and the principles proposed in the 2004 report of the National Academy of Sciences.    
The rule that EPA has finalized in response to the statute fails to meet the standards mandated by Congress.    
Boxer said, âEPA has failed to follow the clear direction of Congress and strictly regulate human pesticide testing. Pregnant women, infants and children should not be used as subjects in human pesticde tests and any tests must comply with widely accepted ethical standards. I hope the courts will reverse this flawed EPA action.â?
