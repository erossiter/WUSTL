 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that the final Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes an authorization for $25 million in federal funding for restoration of the LA River.   Boxer said, This authorization will help us advance the goal of revitalizing the LA River and making it a great asset to the community once again. Once restored, the LA River will provide countless recreational opportunities and economic benefits to the City of Los Angeles.  The $25 million authorization is for initial demonstration projects, including removing concrete, restoring habitat for fish and wildlife, and providing recreational opportunities along the riverbanks for local residents.   Senator Boxer also included a study for the LA River revitalization project. The study authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to work with local entities, including the City of Los Angeles, to develop a long-term plan to revitalize the LA River.   WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration and other water projects across the country. The Senate and House conferees reached agreement this morning on the final bill. The conference report is expected to be filed in both chambers on Monday.               ###
