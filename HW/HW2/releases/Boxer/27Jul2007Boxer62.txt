 Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today said she is very pleased that the 2007 Farm Bill passed by the House of Representatives includes the Pollinator Protection Act, legislation she introduced to help research, protect and maintain Americas bee and native pollinator population.   Senator Boxer said, I am so pleased that the House recognized the importance of addressing this important issue before our crops are put at further risk from this unexplained decline in our honeybee population. Californias almond crop alone is worth $2 billion per year and requires nearly one half all the honey bees in the country. The future of that crop and other important crops such as avocados, apples, berries and soybeans is in jeopardy if there arent enough bees to pollinate them for harvest.   The legislation included in the House bill by Congressman Alcee Hastings (D-FL) would authorize $86.5 million in federal funding for research and grant programs at the USDA over five years for work related to maintaining and protecting our bee and native pollinator populations. Experts estimate crops nationwide that depend on a healthy honey and native bee population to be valued near $18 billion.   In recent months, there has been an estimated loss of over 25 percent of the nations honeybee populationa decrease the USDA has termed Colony Collapse Disorder.   Boxer added, I want to thank Congressman Hastings for his leadership, and I will continue to work on with Senators Harkin and Chambliss to see that this legislation is included in the Senate version of the bill.   Cosponsoring the legislation in the Senate are Senators John Thune, Bob Casey, Hillary Clinton, Bill Nelson, Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, Sherrod Brown, Tim Johnson, and John Kerry.                   ###
