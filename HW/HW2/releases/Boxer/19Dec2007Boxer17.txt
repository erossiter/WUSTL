 Washington, D.C.   Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2008 omnibus appropriations  bill, which includes funding requested by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for  critical anti-gang projects in Monterey County.    Violence has already touched the lives of too  many, Boxer said, That is why it  is so important to support anti-gang projects, including prevention and  intervention efforts, which will go a long way toward helping our families and  law enforcement in Monterey County.   The Senate approved $1,269,000 for the Monterey County  Street and Anti-Gang Project, or Monterey County Joint Gang Task  Force (GTF), which is the result of a countywide collaborative effort whose  mission is to reduce gang violence throughout Monterey County. Participants in  GTF include: the Monterey County Sheriffs Office, Probation Department and  District Attorneys Office; the City of Salinas Police Department and Cities of  Soledad and Seaside. The Senate also approved $430,379 for the  Silver Star Gang Prevention and Intervention Program (SSGPI) which provides and  coordinates services to prevent and reduce juvenile crime in Monterey County. This umbrella organization offers  a full range of services to combat juvenile delinquency, including educational  activities, vocational and job training, and counseling programs for at-risk  youth. The GTF has made a significant positive  impact on gang-related crime, and has become a statewide model of effective gang  suppression coupled with the prevention and intervention efforts of the Monterey  County SSGPI program.  The Senate passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of  76 to17. The House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this  week, at which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
