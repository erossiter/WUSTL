 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $300,000 for the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino.  The Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino provides at risk youth with a safe place to go after school and gives them an alternative to becoming involved in gangs, Boxer said. I am pleased that this funding will help the club continue to fulfill their mission of helping young people  especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds  realize their full potential.   The $300,000 was included in the FY 2008 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Bill. The funding will help cover repairs and renovations to the facility.    Founded in 1967, the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino currently serves over 1,500 young people. The Club provides a number of activities for local youth, including basketball, swimming, computer training and more. The Club also houses several important community programs, including the San Bernardino County Head Start, aCounseling Clinic, the Reading for Success Program, the Youth Job ReadyProgram and Day Camp.    In January, Boxer reintroduced Mynishas Law, legislation to help combat gang violence in high-risk areas across the country by creating an interagency task force that focuses on at-risk youth intervention, literacy, employment and coordination between local and regional gang prevention efforts. Key provisions of Mynishas law were included in Senator Dianne Feinsteins (D-CA) Gang Abatement and Prevention Act, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in June.    Earlier this year, the Senate Appropriations Committee also approved Boxers requests for $250,000 for the San Bernardino Boys and Girls Club in the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, as well as $350,000 for San Bernardinos anti-gang initiative, the GREAT Program, funded in the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Bill. ###
