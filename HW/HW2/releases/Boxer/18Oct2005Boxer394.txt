 Washington, D.C. - Concerned that the Administration may be unprepared for a major California earthquake, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer today was joined by Senator Dianne Feinstein (both D-CA) to renew Boxerâs call for the President to release FEMA's disaster recovery plan for a potential California earthquake.    
Following is the Senatorsâ letter to the President.    
  October 18, 2005    
The President  The White House  Washington, D.C. 20500    
Dear Mr. President:    
Five weeks ago, you received a letter requesting a copy of the federal governmentâs disaster recovery plan to respond to a major earthquake in California.    
Although the White House responded by stating that the letter had been shared âwith the appropriate Administration officials and agencies responsible for formulating policy recommendations in this area,â? the plan has not yet been provided.    We are writing to again request the emergency plan.    
The slow response to this request to obtain a copy of the plan â so that we can share it with Californiaâs emergency response organizations for their comment â makes us wonder if a plan exists and if FEMA is prepared.    
Based on FEMAâs slow response in providing relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina, we want to make sure that a similar tragedy does not happen again if a major earthquake occurs in California.  Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.  We are sure that you know the importance of providing us with this plan, given what has occurred in the Gulf States.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator    
Dianne Feinstein  United States Senator
