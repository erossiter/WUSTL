 Los Angeles, CA -- U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer visited the Martin V. Smith branch of the Greater Oxnard and Port Hueneme Boys and Girls Club this past Saturday to meet with students and present her Excellence in Education Award to Tim Blaylock, Chief Professional Officer for the regionâs Boys and Girls Club centers.    
Boxer said, âI was so pleased to meet these wonderful children to see first-hand the great work of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Oxnard and Port Hueneme. The success of this program and programs like it are critical to the success of American families.  Boys and Girls Clubs make it easier for parents to go to work, because they know that their children are in a safe and nourishing environment.â? 
The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Oxnard and Port Hueneme serves 6,700 students in the region.  The Martin V. Smith branch, which serves approximately 3,000 students, received the Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Grant to establish tutoring centers in ten local schools.  The grant was made possible because Senator Boxer authored afterschool legislation which authorized funding through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program.    
Boxer established her Excellence in Education Award to recognize teachers, parents, businesses and organizations that are working to make positive changes in education.  Oxnard City Councilman Dean Maulhardt joined Boxer as she toured the Boys and Girls Club.
