 California was not hit as hard as many feared and for that we are relieved.  But there are still installations on the closure and realignment list that need to be challenged.    
I will be working with my colleagues in the Congress and state officials to make the strongest possible case that California has the infrastructure needed to keep our country strong.    
Our first calculation of the report indicates that California will have a net loss of about 2,000 jobs.  It is true that this is less than some other states, but every job loss represents a family√¢s income.    
We owe those people the best fight we can muster before the BRAC commission.
