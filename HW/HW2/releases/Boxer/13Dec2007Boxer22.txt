 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) expressed her support of the Energy Bill passed by the Senate tonight by a vote of 86-8. Boxer said, While it should have been a better and stronger bill with tax breaks for renewable energy and a requirement for electric utilities to use more solar, wind and geothermal energy, it is still a good first step toward a cleaner future for America. Boxer outlined four provisions included in the Energy Bill that came out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which she is Chairman:    The green buildings provision for the construction of green government buildings. This provision would also provide grants to states to build green schools;   The provision to retrofit old federal buildings with energy-efficient technologies such as better lighting. This provision would also provide grants to cities and counties to make buildings more energy-efficient;   The provision to establish a demonstration project at the Capitol Hill Power Plant to capture greenhouse gases from burning coal;  - And the provision authorizing construction of a solar wall on the  roof of the Department of Energy headquarters in Washington, DC. Boxer said, As a Senator from California, whose state has been such a leader on energy efficiency, I am pleased to see the federal government finally taking these steps, especially in the face of soaring energy costs and the threat of Global Warming.  ###
