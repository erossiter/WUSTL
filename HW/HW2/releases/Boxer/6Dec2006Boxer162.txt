 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Robert Gates to be Secretary of Defense.  I believe that a change of leadership at the Pentagon will signal a new course of action in Iraq.    
During his nomination hearing yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Dr. Gates spoke the truth about the war in Iraq.  In a very plain spoken way, he leveled with the American people when he admitted that we are not winning in Iraq.  His ability to admit that Iraq is in chaos leads me to believe that he will provide independent advice to the President and speak truth to power.  
Our brave military men and women in uniform have done everything asked of them in Iraq.  The failure of this administration to develop a realistic strategy for Iraq is the reason why we are not winning.  Our military defeated the armed forces of Iraq, captured Saddam Hussein, and helped provide for three elections in Iraq.  They cannot force a national reconciliation in Iraq and they cannot impose a political compromise.  
The stress on our military is causing readiness to suffer and placing our military families under tremendous strain.  Todayâs Iraq Study Group report says that âU.S. military forces, especially our ground forces, have been stretched nearly to the breaking point by the repeated deployments in Iraq, with attendant casualties (almost 3,000 dead and more than 21,000 wounded), greater difficulty in recruiting, and accelerated wear on equipment.â?  This is an  unsustainable situation.   
I look forward to working with Dr. Gates on improving the mental health policies and programs of the Department of Defense.  We must not deploy military personnel with serious mental health conditions, such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and we should ensure that proper treatment is provided for those in need.  
It is time for a change in course in Iraq and a change at the Pentagon is a step in the right direction.
