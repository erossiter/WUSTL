 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today introduced legislation to help establish the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California.      
âCaliforniaâs farmers, growers, and ranchers provide half of Americaâs produce and export goods across the globe, contributing billions of dollars to our economy,â? Senator Boxer said.  âThe National Ag Science Center will teach visitors about the significance of agriculture in our nationâs culture and economy, the importance of science in agriculture, and Californiaâs role as the nationâs preeminent agricultural state.â? 
The National Ag Science Center Act of 2006 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to facilitate the establishment of the Center.  It would also designate $10 million dollars in total grant funding to help fund construction costs.     The Center will help promote Californiaâs place as the nationâs most diverse and productive agricultural state.  The Center will teach visitors about agricultural science, with interactive, high-technology exhibits designed to foster an understanding of the importance of agriculture, and how science plays an essential role in the farm-to-food process.  There will also be a strong focus on highlighting the important relationship between agriculture, conservation, and the environment.	    
Boxer said, âWith over 350 different crops and commodities produced in California, farming and agriculture impact all of our communities.   I am pleased that this Center will help highlight Californiaâs significant contributions to agriculture.â? 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is a cosponsor of the legislation.  Representatives Cardoza, Matsui and Radanovich have introduced a companion bill in the House.
