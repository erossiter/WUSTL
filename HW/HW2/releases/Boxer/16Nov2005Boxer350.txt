 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced Senate approval of $600,000 in federal funds to create additional education programs, particularly for underserved schools and communities in the Bay area, at Chabot Space and Science Center.    
Senator Boxer said, âFor many Bay area students, a school trip to Oaklandâs Chabot Space and Science Center can open eyes, imaginations and minds to the amazing discoveries of the universe.  That is why it is essential we ensure all of our children have access to the programs and exhibits offered by this wonderful educational resource.â? 
Funds for the Chabot Space and Science Center programming, which will complement future exhibits and programs dealing with the human exploration of space, were included in the Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.    
With this funding, officials at the Center hope to provide family workshops and educational exhibits for visiting students, in addition to making translations of planetarium exhibits available in Spanish and Chinese.    
Since opening in August 2000, Chabot Space and Science Center has provided inquiry-based student programs on space sciences, which correlate to state and national science educational standards.  Part of the facilityâs mission includes providing equal access to high quality science and technology programs for lower-income and minority students. Chabot Space and Science Center, the continuation of a 115-year-old observatory, spans 86,000 square feet and is situated on a 13-acre site in the hills of Oakland.    
The FY2006 CJS appropriations bill funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation.  The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
