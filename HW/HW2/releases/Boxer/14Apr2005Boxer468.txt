 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes funding for the Hamilton Airfield Ecosystem Restoration Project.  The bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Senator Boxer is a member.    
âThis project will help restore important San Pablo Bay wetlands as well as improve this vital habitat for the migratory birds and endangered species that reside there,â? Boxer said. âI am very pleased that the Environment and Public Works Committee has acknowledged the importance of this project and approved funding.â? 
Located on the San Pablo Bay in Marin County, the Hamilton Airfield was once an active military airfield.  The Hamilton Airfield restoration project will help restore nearly 1,300  acres of tidal and seasonal wetlands.  A fully mature network of wetlands is expected to develop within the next 50 years.    
Under Boxerâs proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, the project is authorized for a total of $205,226,000, including a federal contribution of $153,840,000 and non-federal (local and state) contributions of $51,386,000.  The funding will be used to reconstruct 6.8 miles of levee and restore 1,470 acres of native vegetation.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
