 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that the Senate-passed Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes an authorization for $25 million in federal funding for restoration of the LA River. Boxer said, With the help of these federal resources, the people of Los Angeles can finally realize their dream of revitalizing the LA River, making it a great asset to the community once again. This authorization is an important step towards bringing back a beautiful river that will provide countless recreational opportunities and economic benefits to the City of Los Angeles. The $25 million authorization is for initial demonstration projects, including removing concrete, restoring habitat for fish and wildlife, and providing recreational opportunities along the riverbanks for local residents.  Senator Boxer also included a study for the LA River revitalization project. The study authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to work with local entities, including the City of Los Angeles, to develop a long-term plan to revitalize the LA River.  WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, and other water projects across the country. The bill now goes to Conference with the House of Representatives, which passed its version of WRDA in April.
