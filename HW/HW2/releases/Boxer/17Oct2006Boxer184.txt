 Washington, D.C. Ã¢ U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to former Secretary of State James Baker, Co-Chair of the Iraq Study Group: 
October 17, 2006   The Honorable James A. Baker III    Co-Chair    Iraq Study Group    1200 17th Street NW    Washington, DC 20036 Dear Secretary Baker:  As co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, you have taken on the tremendous challenge of developing recommendations for a new course of action in Iraq. I am deeply appreciative of your willingness to serve our country once again.   Over the past several weeks, you have repeatedly said that the Iraq Study Group would not provide an independent assessment on the situation in Iraq until after the November midterm elections. Given the critical need to change course on Iraq, I urge the study group to release its recommendations as soon as possible without any consideration to the political calendar. Indeed, imagine if you had a son or daughter in Iraq right now and knew that a change of course would have to wait due to politics while your child is a target in a hellish situation.   Last year, the Senate voted 79-19 in favor of an amendment stating that 2006 should be a period of significant transition in Iraq. Instead, this year has seen the rapid escalation of death, suffering, and sectarian violence that could easily devolve into a full scale civil war. It is clear that the Administration's continued insistence to stay the course with its failed policies is not a viable solution.  Judging by recent interviews you have given in the press, it appears that the Iraq Study Group has made some initial judgments that would be a departure from the Administration's failed policies.   If this is indeed the case, I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to publicly release them so that the Administration can see that the status quo is unacceptable. This could be done through an interim report or through public meetings - both of which were contemplated by the Iraq Study Group in its April letter to Congress.   Thank you for your consideration.    Sincerely,   Barbara Boxer        United States Senator     cc: The Honorable Lee Hamilton, Co-Chair
