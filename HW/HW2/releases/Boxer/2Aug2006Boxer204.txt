   Washington, DC â In response to Californiaâs recent heat wave that caused substantial agricultural losses, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today urged Secretary of Agriculture Michael Johanns to make a Secretarial disaster designation for impacted California counties, which will provide federal assistance available to affected farmers and ranchers.    
Following is Senator Boxerâs letter to Secretary Johanns.  Senator Boxerâs recent letter to Governor Schwarzenegger is also attached. 
August 2, 2006    The Honorable Michael Johanns     United States Department of Agriculture     1400 Independence Avenue SW     Washington, DC 20520      Dear Secretary Johanns:  Yesterday, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sent you a letter requesting a Secretarial disaster declaration for San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Fresno, Kings, Madera, Kern, and Tulare counties in the wake of the recent heat wave that affected agricultural producers in our State. I also urge you to make a Secretarial disaster designation in the impacted counties and provide adequate federal disaster assistance to help agricultural producers in these counties recover the significant economic losses that have resulted from this extreme weather event.      The damage inflicted by the heat wave on the agricultural economy in these eight California counties has been enormously devastating. Approximately two percent of the stateâs total cattle herd, 750,000 chickens and 150,000 turkeys have died as a result of the extreme heat that blanketed Californiaâs Central Valley over the last two weeks. Dairy operations experienced 10 to 25 percent production losses throughout the heat wave. A state dairy cooperative predicts the dairy production losses could result in $1 billion dollars in potential damages.   With the help of USDA disaster assistance, producers in Californiaâs Central Valley can begin taking steps to mitigate the effects of the heat wave, and prevent future economic losses. I urge you to immediately declare a Secretarial disaster declaration in Californiaâs impacted counties.     Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
