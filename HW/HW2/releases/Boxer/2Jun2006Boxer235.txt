 Los Angeles, CA - Senator Boxer sent the attached letter to Ralph Horowitz on June 2, 2006.    
June 2, 2006    
  Mr. Ralph Horowitz  Libaw-Horowitz Investment Co.  11911 San Vincente Blvd., Ste 310  Los Angeles, CA 90049 
					  Dear Mr. Horowitz:    
  I have been moved by the community effort to purchase from you and save the 14-acre community garden in South Central Los Angeles.      
  I understand that efforts to raise the $16.3 million have so far fallen short and that you may be prepared to oust the approximately 350 families who farm the land.    
  I know that this property has a tangled history which began when the City of Los Angeles took the property through eminent domain in the 1980's for a planned trash-to-energy incinerator, which was never built.  After that, the City allowed the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to begin using the land as an urban gardening project.     
  Ultimately, you regained the property through court action for $5 million, slightly more than you had been paid for the property when it was taken for the incinerator.    
  Mr. Horowitz, I sincerely hope that you will agree to negotiate with the community for a price that they can realistically afford.  I am also sure that you could benefit by making part of the ownership transfer a charitable gift to the community.    
  Such action would be a powerful statement of support from you for a most worthwhile project.    
  I would be delighted to speak with you about this wonderful opportunity. Please call me at 559-497-5109.    
Sincerely, 
			  Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
