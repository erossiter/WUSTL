 San Francisco, CA â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to President Bush:    
  August 11, 2005    
The Honorable George W. Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20500    
Dear Mr. President:    
As crude oil and gas prices hit record highs, I am writing to urge you to utilize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help provide American consumers and the U.S. economy with some relief.    
Recent announcements by a number of multinational oil companies that profits are up clearly show that more must be done to curb the unacceptably high price of gasoline.  For example, compared to the same time last year, Exxon Mobilâs second-quarter earnings are up 35 percent.  And, the price of gasoline, which in many parts of my state is reaching $3 a gallon, is unacceptably high.  While oil companies reap the benefits, American families struggle.    
Mr. President, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is almost full with nearly 700 million barrels of crude oil and could easily be used to help bring down energy prices at this difficult time.    
Utilizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would follow precedent set by the Administrations of former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.  In the fall of 2000, the Clinton Administration authorized a swap during the home heating oil crisis of 2000â at that time, crude oil was released from SPR in exchange for additional crude oil in the future.  President George H.W. Bush also authorized an emergency drawdown of SPR in 1991.    
I urge you once again to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and order the release of at least 1 million barrels a day for 30 days with the option to extend an additional 30 days.  This oil can be replaced when the price of oil returns to reasonable levels.    
Thank you for your consideration.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
