 Washington, D.C. â Today the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed legislation by U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-CA) to honor the late Congressman Robert T. Matsui by naming a United States Courthouse in Sacramento in his memory. 
"Congressman Matsui was a dedicated public servant, a protector of civil rights, and a dear friend," said Senator Boxer. "Naming the federal courthouse in Sacramento in Matsuiâs honor is an appropriate memorial to his efforts toward a just and fair society." "Bob Matsui was one of the finest public servants Iâve ever met," said Senator Feinstein. "I will remember him as a trusted colleague and as a good friend. He served the people of Sacramento with distinction and with honor.  And I think it is very appropriate to name the federal courthouse in Sacramento after him. It will honor his devotion to justice and to fair play, and it will keep Bob in our hearts and our memories." 
Congressman Matsui was instrumental in obtaining more than $142 million in federal funding for the Courthouse.
