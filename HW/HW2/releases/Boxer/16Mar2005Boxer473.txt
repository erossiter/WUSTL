 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxerâs (D-CA) efforts to encourage production of ethanol derived from agricultural waste received verbal commitments today from several of her colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
"This bipartisan amendment would encourage making ethanol from agricultural wastes generated in California and other states so we donât have to rely solely on corn-based ethanol from the mid-west," said Senator Boxer. "I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important legislation." 
Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-OK) and Senators Christopher Bond (R-MO) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) said that they would work with Boxer to provide incentives for the use of ethanol made from agricultural waste when ethanol legislation is considered in the full Senate.  Boxerâs proposal would count each gallon of agricultural waste ethanol as 2.5 gallons towards meeting any ethanol mandate. 
Unlike conventional ethanol -- which is derived mainly from corn -- agricultural waste-based ethanol can be locally produced and uses agriculture materials that would otherwise be wasted.  Additionally, agricultural waste-based ethanol reduces landfill disposal and open field burning, thus helping to improve land, air and water quality. 
Boxerâs agricultural waste ethanol amendment would be good for California because it would provide farmers with additional economic security by providing a market for their agricultural waste.  The legislation would benefit farmers across the state, including those who grow rice, wheat, sugar cane, citrus and stone fruits. 
Senator Boxerâs proposal originally passed the Senate in 2003 during the Senateâs consideration of the energy bill.
