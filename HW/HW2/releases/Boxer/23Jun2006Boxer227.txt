 Washington, D.C. â The Senate passed an amendment by U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) last night that would require the President to submit to Congress a determination as to whether all prisoners of war who died in captivity should be eligible for the Purple Heart.    
âThe purpose of the Purple Heart is to honor those who are killed or wounded in action defending our country, yet many of those who gave their lives as prisoners of war are ineligible for that high honor,â? Senator Boxer said.  âI canât think of a more fitting tribute for their sacrifice than to posthumously make them eligible for the Purple Heart.â? 
Currently, only prisoners of war who die during their imprisonment of wounds inflicted by the enemyâsuch as a gunshot wound or intentional poisoningâ are eligible for posthumous Purple Heart recognition.  Those who die of starvation, disease, abuse or other causes during captivity are not eligible at present.      
The Boxer-Snowe amendment, which passed as part of  the Senate Defense Authorization bill, would correct this loophole by requiring the President to review Purple Heart eligibility for the purpose of including all prisoners of war who died in captivity.      
Boxer said, âI sincerely hope the President will take a serious look at this proposal to ensure that our POWs are afforded the recognition they deserve.â? 
Legislation to expand eligibility for the Purple Heart has been endorsed by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Association for Uniformed Services, the Military Officers of American Association, the Korean War Veterans Association, National League of POW-MIA Families, Tiger Survivors, and a number of other prominent veteransâ organizations.
