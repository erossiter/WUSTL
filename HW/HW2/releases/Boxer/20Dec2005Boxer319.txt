 The backdoor attempt to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling is a classic example of Republican abuse of power.    
The Senate must complete action on critical spending bills Ã¢ especially the Defense Appropriations bill, which contains funding for our troops and should by no means be caught in the debate over drilling in a wildlife refuge.    
Why create a wildlife refuge for future generations, only to destroy it?    
If just the SUV loophole was closed, we would have one Arctic National Wildlife Refuge every 7 years and we would still have this magnificent gift from God.
