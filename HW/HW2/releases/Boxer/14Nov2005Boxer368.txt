 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $500,000 to help purchase new equipment for the Arnold Palmer Prostate Center was approved by the Senate.    
"With this new equipment, the Arnold Palmer Prostate Center will be able to provide innovative treatment methods for its cancer patients."  Boxer said.  "I am pleased that the Senate has made it possible for the Center to expand its state-of-the-art cancer care." 
Senator Boxer obtained the federal funding in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
The new equipment will enable the Arnold Palmer Prostate Center, which is located in the Eisenhower Lucy Curci Center, to perform stereotactic radiosurgery â a cancer therapy that cuts the radiation treatment course for patients from months to days.    
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a non-invasive method of treatment that delivers a precise dose of intense radiation to a cancerous tumor.  The beams of radiation, guided by special computer software, reshape continuously, matching the exact size and shape of the tumor for a more effective treatment.    
The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers and independent agencies for FY06.    
The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
