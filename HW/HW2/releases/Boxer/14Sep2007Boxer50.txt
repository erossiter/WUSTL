 Washington, D.C.    U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer today made the following statement: The President took 20 minutes in his speech last night to say one thing -- hes staying the course in Iraq.  The President got us into a war while being clueless about how he would end it.  It is up to Congress to keep pressing to end this war and, if we dont have the votes, to make it a huge issue in the 2008 elections.   ###
