 Washington D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to the Chairmen of Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron:    
During todayâs hearing on energy prices, I compared your substantial executive compensation to the annual income of the average American, who is having to bear the burden of higher gasoline prices.    
Your bonus alone last year was more than 155 times greater than the typical Americanâs yearly salary and more than 300 times greater than the pay of a worker making minimum wage.    
At the hearing, I urged you to join in the American tradition of shared sacrifice and give your bonus to help low-income people pay for higher gasoline and home heating oil prices. Because of the tight time frame of the hearing, I was unable to get an answer to the question I asked: would you be willing to contribute part of your executive compensation and some of your companyâs profits to a charitable fund of this nature?    
In addition, I would appreciate an answer to a question that time did not permit me to ask: if the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is opened up for drilling, will your company drill in this pristine wilderness?    
I look forward to your reply.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator 
  Boxer also sent the following letter to the Presidents of BP America and Shell Oil Company:    
During todayâs hearing on energy prices, I urged you to join in the American tradition of shared sacrifice and give a portion of your companyâs massive profits to help low-income people pay for higher gasoline and home heating oil prices. Would you be willing to contribute part of your companyâs profits to a charitable fund of this nature?    
Additionally, I would appreciate an answer to a question that time did not permit me to ask because of the tight time frame of the hearing: if the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is opened up for drilling, will your company drill in this pristine wilderness?    
I look forward to your reply.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
