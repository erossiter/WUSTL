 Los Angeles, CA â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement regarding landmark legislation in California to impose broad caps on greenhouse-gas emissions and combat global warming:     
âI am so proud of California today, which has once again taken the lead in confronting a critical environmental issue by passing legislation to directly address the threat of global warming.      
âGlobal warming could reshape the world as we know it.  Climate change could dramatically reduce the Sierra Nevadaâs snowpack, trigger a devastating rise in sea level, increase the spread of infectious disease, and harm agriculture.      
âIn California, climate change could increase our already serious air pollution problems, reduce our precious supply of water, hurt our vital wine growing industry, and dramatically increase extreme heat waves.      
âI am a lead cosponsor of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2006, legislation authored by Senator Jim Jeffords which sets a marker for a comprehensive approach to address global warming.  This legislation has important similarities to Californiaâs new bill â they both provide a variety of flexible tools to address climate change.  California's bill has a goal of a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020.  Senator Jeffordsâ bill shares this goal, and then continues with an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.      
âCalifornia is helping to light the way on what needs to be done throughout the country.  However, President Bush has not only failed to act, he is actively trying to stop Californiaâs efforts to control global warming emissions from automobiles.      
âThe risks are too great to turn our back on this serious problem.  The federal government should follow Californiaâs lead in addressing global warming, for the health of our economy and the future of our country.â?
