 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $12 million for Napa River flood protection was approved by the Senate.    
"I have worked consistently with Napa officials on this unique plan to prevent the deadly threat of flooding in the city and restore the areaâs treasured wetlands," Boxer said.  "These funds will help protect homes and businesses along the river and enhance the unique natural beauty and ecosystem of the region." 
Senator Boxer, who has been a longtime leader on this issue, obtained the federal funding for Napa River flood control in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
This environmentally sustainable project, when completed, will protect residents, businesses and homes from future expensive and deadly flood damage, and stimulate the city of Napaâs downtown by promoting economic growth.    
The long-term plan additionally calls for the restoration of marshlands and riparian forest, with a small length of concrete channel to be built in downtown Napa to prevent flooding.  The project eventually will result in the creation of 600 acres of tidal wetlands in the Napa Valley, enhancing the natural habitat for numerous fish and bird species.    
Boxer said, "Floods pose a threat throughout California.  That is why I continue to fight for the funding of these important projects that can prevent disaster." 
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
