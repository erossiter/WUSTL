 Washington, D.C.â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today asked four presidential scholars for their opinion on former White House Counsel John Deanâs statement that President Bush admitted to an âimpeachable offenseâ? when he said he authorized the National Security Agency to spy on Americans without getting a warrant from a judge.    
Boxer said, âI take very seriously Mr. Deanâs comments, as I view him to be an expert on Presidential abuse of power.  I am expecting a full airing of this matter by the Senate in the very near future.â? 
Boxerâs letter is as follows:    
On December 16, along with the rest of America, I learned that President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to spy on Americans without getting a warrant from a judge.  President Bush underscored his support for this action in his press conference today.    
On Sunday, December 18, former White House Counsel John Dean and I participated in a public discussion that covered many issues, including this surveillance.  Mr. Dean, who was President Nixonâs counsel at the time of Watergate, said that President Bush is âthe first President to admit to an impeachable offense.â?  Today, Mr. Dean confirmed his statement.    
This startling assertion by Mr. Dean is especially poignant because he experienced first hand the executive abuse of power and a presidential scandal arising from the surveillance of American citizens.    
Given your constitutional expertise, particularly in the area of presidential impeachment, I am writing to ask for your comments and thoughts on Mr. Deanâs statement.    
Unchecked surveillance of American citizens is troubling to both me and many of my constituents.  I would appreciate your thoughts on this matter as soon as possible.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer    
United States Senator
