 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer today made the following statement:   It is our children who will pay the price for the President's veto today of the Children's Health Insurance Program.  We have a moral responsibility to take care of our children, and the bipartisan CHIP legislation passed by Congress would help ensure that America's most vulnerable children get the health care they need.  I will join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to continue our fight to ensure this bill becomes law.    ###
