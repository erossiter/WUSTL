 It is distressing to me to hear the Secretary of State lay out another broad mission for our soldiers in Iraq â to remake the Middle East.  That is not what Congress voted for in either the resolution authorizing force in Afghanistan or Iraq, and it is not what the American people believed to be our goal.    
The Administrationâs refusal to publicly discuss any timetable or even the specific conditions that must be met by the Iraqis in order to begin bringing our troops home leads me to believe that they envision a never-ending war in Iraq, and that is unacceptable to me and a majority of the American people.
