 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes funding requested by Senator  Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for a key project in Ventura.  The Senate approved $786,216 in funding to remove the  Matilija Dam, which no longer provides flood control for downstream communities.  In addition, this project is designed to restore the Matilija Creek for fish and  wildlife, reestablishing runs of the endangered southern steelhead trout and  allowing sand to flow to coastal beaches. The Matilija Creek is an important  part of California's ecosystem,  Senator Boxer said. This project will help  restore its natural beauty and benefit the wildlife that inhabits the creek.   The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 76 to17. The  House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this week, at  which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
