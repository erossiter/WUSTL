 Washington, DC â The United States Senate passed an amendment tonight by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that would direct the Department of Defense to issue a report to Congress on steps being taken to protect American troops and civilians in the event that civil strife worsens.      
The Boxer amendment, which was passed as part of the Defense Appropriations Bill, states that the Secretary of Defense must submit the report within 30 days of enactment.  The Secretaryâs report, which may be submitted in classified form, would be delivered to the Senate and House Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence and Appropriations.          
Boxer said, âThis Administration planned for the invasion of Iraq, but they havenât done any planning since.  I repeatedly asked the Pentagon for their plan should civil war break out, and all I got in return were non-answers.  We simply have to plan for the safety of U.S. troops and personnel serving in Iraq, who every day live and work in the midst of increasing sectarian violence.  We have to plan for the worst case scenario.â?
