 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) released the following statement after her office hosted a meeting between the staffs of some of Californias elected officials to address the impact of the freeze on Californias agricultural community.  Senator Boxer said, The more I learn, the more worried I am about the impact of this freeze. I am really glad that we are all working together to use every tool at our disposal to be of assistance to our growers and our farmers in this difficult time.  Boxer continued, We are exploring possible legislation for crop disaster assistance and worker assistance to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the communities that have been hit so hard by this crisis. The meeting included representatives from the offices of Senators Boxer and Feinstein, Governor Schwarzenegger, and Representatives Cardoza, Capps, Costa, Radonovich, Nunes, McCarthy and Farr.  The entire California Congressional Delegation sent a letter yesterday afternoon to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns calling for the immediate approval of Governor Schwarzeneggers request for a federal disaster declaration in California.
