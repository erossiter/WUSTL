 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today asked Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta to provide her with an update on the ability of our airports to effectively respond to suspected cases of Avian Flu.      
Boxer included a provision in the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill requiring procedures to be implemented to ensure that airports and air carriers are prepared in case a passenger appears to have Avian Flu symptoms.    
Following please find Senator Boxer√¢s letter to Secretary Mineta: 
June 23, 2006   The Honorable Norman Y. Mineta    Secretary    U.S. Department of Transportation    Washington, D.C. 20590 Dear Mr. Secretary:   With the news that the Avian Flu virus mutated for person-to-person transmission in a family in Indonesia, I am requesting an update on the implementation of my provision regarding Avian Flu included in the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill. My provision required procedures to be implemented to ensure that airports and air carriers are prepared in case a passenger appears to have Avian Flu symptoms. These standard operating procedures would help ensure that airports and air carriers know how to respond appropriately to minimize the spread of the virus.   As Avian Flu has spread to more and more countries, the possibility that an international passenger could arrive in this country infected with the virus has increased. Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told the House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee that Today it takes less than 24 hours to travel to almost anywhere around the world; this is shorter than the incubation period for most communicable diseases ... Because ... of the volume of people traveling internationally, the threat of infectious disease introduction and rapid spread is real.     Our airports and air carriers must be prepared to address this huge public health threat. By establishing clear guidelines for airports and airlines, you will help ensure that our country responds quickly and appropriately to prevent the spread of the deadly Avian Flu virus.  I would appreciate receiving a prompt update on the implementation of new procedures at our airports and with our air carriers.     Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
