 Los Angeles, CA -- U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has awarded her Conservation Champion Award to the 49er District of the Greater Yosemite Council of the Boy Scouts of America for its environmental work.  For the past three years, the Boy Scouts have collected discarded Christmas trees from neighborhoods in Lodi, Woodbridge, Lockeford, and Galt as part of an innovative recycling program to control soil erosion on Delta levees in the Walnut Grove area.  The award was presented on Friday, April 7, by Senator Boxerâs Field Representative, Ameen Khan.  
Senator Boxer said, âI commend the Boy Scouts who participated in the tree recycling effort.  They demonstrated a great commitment to the preservation of local waterways and the safety of local residents.  Their involvement in the tree recycling effort, as well as finding a creative use for green waste should be a model for other communities.â?  
Dale Foster, Executive Director of the Boy Scouts of America from the 49er District of the Greater Yosemite Council said, âOn behalf of everyone involved with the project, we are delighted and honored to receive Senator Boxerâs recognition of our efforts.  The Boy Scouts from the 49er District of the Yosemite Council are proud to play a part in a community project that encourages conservation and preserves the regionâs waterways.â?  
During the past holiday season alone, the Boy Scouts of the 49er District collected more than 60 tons of trees to be recycled and later used to combat soil erosion on the Delta levees.  The trees create an energy absorbing wall that significantly reduces erosion of the levee surface.  This method has been proven to be one of the most effective means of stabilizing the levee shoreline without the use of tons of rocks and other materials.  
Senator Boxer created her Conservation Champion Award in 2000 to highlight the work of Californians who are working to promote a safe and healthy environment.
