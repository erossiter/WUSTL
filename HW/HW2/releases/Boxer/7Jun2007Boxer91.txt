 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today issued the following statement on the immigration bill: I know how hard my colleagues have workedon both sides of the aisleto put this immigration bill together. But I believe that this bill, as it currently stands, is unworkable and unfair. This bill needs to be clarified, simplified, and rectified before I can support it.   If enacted, I believe the bill will lead to the exploitation of workers, including the 12 million undocumented immigrants we all hope to put on the path to legalization. I also believe it will exert downward pressure on wages at a time when we are already losing our middle class.  I have always been troubled by the inclusion of a guestworker program in the bill. The guest worker program is designed, in my opinion, to create a permanent pool of insecure and low-paid workers whom I believe will never leave the country, even though they are supposed to, according to the rules of the program. This will only continue the cycle of illegal immigration.   There are concepts in the bill I strongly support  a path to legalization for the 12 million undocumented immigrants, a secure border, AgJobs, and the DREAM Act.   But this bill needs much more work. I believe we can achieve an immigration bill that will be fair and just to all, and the best chance for that is to vote against cloture and continue working as long as it takes to get it right.
