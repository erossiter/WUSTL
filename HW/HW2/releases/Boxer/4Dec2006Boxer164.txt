 Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), the incoming Chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), today announced that she is naming Erik D. Olson as Deputy Staff Director and General Counsel for the EPW Committee.    
Senator Boxer said, "I am thrilled to have Erik Olson join my EPW Committee staff.  His years of leadership standing up for safer water and a cleaner environment for our children will serve us well as we work to improve America's environment laws." 
Olson comes to the Senate EPW Committee after 15 years with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), where he served most recently as Director of the Advocacy Center and a Senior Attorney.  Olson has worked for more than two decades as a recognized leader of the environmental movement, working with members of Congress and their staff to help overhaul the laws governing pesticides and drinking water, and the effort to protect the public from arsenic. He has focused particularly on protecting children and vulnerable people from toxic chemicals.    
A graduate of Columbia University and University of Virginia's School of Law, Olson has also worked for the National Wildlife Federation, and as an attorney for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of General Counsel.
