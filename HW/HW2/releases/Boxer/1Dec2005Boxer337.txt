 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $80 million in federal funds to build the Eastside extension of the Los Angeles County Transit Metro Authority Gold Line.    
창With these resources, Los Angeles residents will gain better access to public transportation options that ease traffic congestion and reduce air pollution,창? Boxer said.  창I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to fund the Eastside extension of the Gold Line extension.창? 
Funds will be used to construct a six-mile, eight-station extension to connect Union Station in downtown Los Angeles to the intersection of Pomona and Atlantic boulevards in East Los Angeles.    
The extension will also offer faster and more convenient access to many destinations. The communities of Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and East Los Angeles will be connected by rail to Long Beach, Hollywood, the San Fernando Valley, downtown Los Angeles, and Pasadena.    
The funding for the Eastside extension of the Gold Line, which began being constructed last year, was included in the final version of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.  The President signed the bill into law yesterday.
