 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Susan Collins (R-ME) are leading a bipartisan group of women Senators in asking Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OâConnor to consider staying on the Supreme Court to serve as Chief Justice, should there be a vacancy.    
Boxer said, "Justice OâConnor has been a model of moderation and independence throughout her time on the Supreme Court.  She would not only be an outstanding choice to lead our nationâs highest court, but she would make history as the first ever woman Chief Justice.  I hope that Justice OâConnor will consider this very sincere proposal from a bipartisan group of women lawmakers who hold her in the highest esteem." 
Collins said, "Sandra Day OâConnor has been a brilliant Justice who has always brought integrity and common sense to her role on the bench. She has consistently demonstrated the highest standards of legal excellence. Her outstanding service on the Court has made her a role model for women everywhere and she would make an outstanding Chief Justice."
