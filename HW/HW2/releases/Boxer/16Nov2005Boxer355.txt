 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced the Senate has approved her request for $50,000 for a new youth center in the city of Colton, which will provide a facility for the Colton Police Activities League Programs.    
âThe Colton Police Activities League has created a variety of programs to keep Inland Empire area kids involved and out of trouble, but there is currently no youth center to house these wonderful programs,â? Boxer said. âThe city of Coltonâs new youth center will provide a home for these programs and a place for students to go afterschool.â? 
Boxer obtained the $50,000 in funding through her request in the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Bill. The funding will help the city of Colton purchase the new facility.    
The Police Activities League (PAL) creates partnerships between law enforcement, schools and the community to support the local youth population.  The Colton PAL chapter has created programs such as Copâs n Jocks, Youth Directors Council, Explorer, Boxing Club, Parent Project and Teen project.  The league has also established baseball, football and soccer programs that are coached by local police officers.    
The bill will now go to the President for his signature.
