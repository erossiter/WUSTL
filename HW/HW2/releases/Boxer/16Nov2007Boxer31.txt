 Washington, DC  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today cosponsored three bills to increase federal recovery aid to victims of major disasters and require states keep track of criminal arsonists.  We have seen the devastation that wildfires can cause. That is why its imperative that we take steps to better protect our communities and work to ensure that wildfire victims have access to the resources they need to begin rebuilding their lives. Im pleased to join with Senator Feinstein in introducing these bills to improve disaster recovery aid and better track those who start these fires, Senator Boxer said. Senator Boxer today cosponsored:  --The FEMA Mortgage and Rental Assistance Act, legislation to reinstate a FEMA program to help individuals who qualify make their mortgage or rent payments.  --The FEMA Rebuilding Assistance Act, legislation to increase the amount FEMA pays to people whose cost of rebuilding is greater than their insurance coverage from $28,000 to $50,000.  --The Matching Arson Through Criminal History (MATCH) Act, legislation to create a national registry and require convicted arsonists to report where they live, work and go to school.  Senator Boxer added, We will never be able to fully prevent wildfires, but these bills will help make the painful process of recovery a little bit easier for the victims of wildfires and other disasters. ###
