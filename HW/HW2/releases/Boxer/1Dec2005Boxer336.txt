 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $400,000 in federal funds to build a new Inglewood Senior Citizens Center, providing a state-of-the-art facility to serve the areaâs growing senior population.    
âThe new Inglewood Senior Citizens Center will accommodate more of Inglewood's seniors, providing them with additional affordable housing on top of so many essential services,â? Boxer said.  âI am pleased that the Senate recognized the importance of this project.â? 
The funding for the construction of the new Inglewood facility is included in the final version of the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.    
The new facility will replace the current Senior Citizens Center, which was converted from a carpet warehouse in 1975.  When completed, the facility will include 60 units of affordable housing, and replace the current facility.  The larger, 17,500 square-foot center will have expanded facilities for seniors with disabilities, and upgraded equipment for staff and patron needs.  The city is reviewing final architectural plans for the new facility, scheduled for construction in January 2006.    
The current center, which measures 14,000 square feet, has limited access for disabled patrons, no housing units, and is not equipped with adequate facilities to serve the growing senior citizen population.   From its present location in downtown Inglewood, the center serves over 800 seniors daily, preparing and serving meals, and providing activities, medical information and patient-care referrals.  The center also serves another 1,000 seniors a day by providing transportation and delivering meals to their homes.    
The President signed the appropriations bill into law yesterday.
