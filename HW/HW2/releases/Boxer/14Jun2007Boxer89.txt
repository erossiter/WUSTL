 Washington, D.C. The Senate Judiciary Committee today passed the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act, legislation authored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that includes Senator Barbara Boxers (D-CA) Mynishas law.   I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this issue and for working to include Mynishas law in this important legislation, Senator Boxer said. In California, we know all too well the damage that gang violence has done to our communities and our families, particularly our children. I hope that the full Senate will act quickly on this legislation, which will go a long way toward helping prevent and combat gang violence.    Boxer first introduced Mynishas Law in April 2006 after the tragic death of Mynisha Crenshaw, an 11 year old girl killed by a stray bullet while eating dinner with her family in San Bernardino. The gang-related incident drew increased attention to the severe violence that plagues many of our communities and prompted Boxer to introduce the legislation, which helps coordinate federal funds and resources for high intensity gang areas.    Earlier this month, Boxer testified on Mynishas Law as part of the Senate Judiciary Committees hearing on the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
