 Washington, D.C. â After successfully convincing key Bush Administration officials to declare a fishery disaster off the coast of California and Oregon, today Senators Boxer (D-CA), Smith (R-OR) and Wyden (D-OR) introduced legislation to provide financial assistance to salmon fishing communities and businesses.      
Boxer said, âOur coastal communities have already waited too long to get the disaster relief they need as a result of this Administrationâs mismanagement of the Klamath River.  By introducing this legislation on the first day of Congress, we are letting our communities and families know that getting them financial assistance is a top priority this year.â? 
Smith said, âThis funding is long overdue.  These are tough times for fishermen and they need our support.  Along with financial help, we need to continue working toward a basin-wide solution that improves the situation.â? 
Wyden said, âWe can not allow one disastrous salmon season to turn into a long-term tragedy, yet that is what will happen if we don't take immediate action.  Our fishing and coastal communities are counting on Washington, D.C. to survive. We must not let them down.â? 
The Pacific Salmon Emergency Disaster Assistance Act of 2007 would provide $60.4 million to the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.  The Commission will then distribute these amounts among fishing communities, Indian tribes, and small businesses, including fishers, fish processors, and related businesses.    
In April 2006, the Pacific Fishery Management Council restricted salmon fishing along 700 miles of the Oregon and California coastline after the number of returning salmon fell below conservation objective for the third consecutive year.  The severely restricted salmon season is causing economic hardship to the lives of thousands of California and Oregon fishermen, tribes, and their families.    
Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced companion legislation in the House.
