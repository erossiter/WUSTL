 According to our intelligence and law enforcement agencies, terrorists wielding MANPADS provide a clear threat to our commercial aircraft.  Al Qaeda terrorists have targeted commercial aircraft with these weapons in the past and I am concerned that they may do so again in the future. 
I support a comprehensive response to the MANPADS threat.  That is why I have pushed legislative efforts to place countermeasures on commercial aircraft, improve airport perimeter security, fund programs to buy back, secure and destroy MANPADS in the inventories of foreign nations, and encourage multilateral actions to prevent the proliferation of MANPADS throughout the world. 
The cost of installing and operating countermeasures on commercial aircraft is a fraction of what we spend on a Ballistic Missile Defense System that has not been proven to work.  In comparison, countermeasure systems to defend against MANPADS are being used right now on military aircraft.
