 Boxer says Passage of Historic Global Warming Bill âPuts the Wind at Our Backs.â? Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today made the following remarks following the full Committeeâs passage of S. 2191, the Lieberman Warner Climate Security Act:   Senator Boxer said: âThe vote of the Environment and Public Works Committee in favor of the Climate Security Act was a historic moment for our country and for my Committee.  For me, it was the greatest legislative accomplishment of my political career of thirty years.  Finally, America is taking bold steps to avert the catastrophe that awaits our children and grandchildren if we do nothing.  Our bill has two goalsâ¦to fight global warming and to do it in a way that keeps our economy strong. That will be my focus in the coming weeks and months as we move the bill forward to the Senate floor.  This bill is the most far reaching global warming bill in the world and I am grateful to Senators Lieberman and Warner for breaching the partisan divide and unleashing a spirit of cooperation that puts the wind at our backs.â?   ###
