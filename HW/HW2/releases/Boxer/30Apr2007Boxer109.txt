 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) is working with state and federal officials to help the Bay Area quickly recover from the collapse of a portion of the freeway in the MacArthur Maze near the Bay Bridge.     
In an extensive conference call with the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters, and the head of the Federal Highway Administration, Richard Capka, Boxer expressed her gratitude for the DoT's commitment to helping California rebuild this critical overpass.      
Senator Boxer and Secretary Peters committed to survey the damage together this Friday.        
Boxer also called Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger today to thank him for his quick action and emergency declaration.  Boxer and the Governor agreed about the importance of moving quickly to rebuild the freeway, because federal law provides for 100 percent reimbursement of emergency repairs accomplished in the first six months after a disaster occurs.     
Boxer said, "We are facing a critical transportation situation, but I want to assure the people of the Bay Area that their state and federal leaders are working together to immediately tackle this crisis.  I am pleased that Secretary Peters and I will be on site together this Friday to personally survey the damage and get things moving at the federal level as quickly as possible." 
Boxer will also be inviting other members of the California congressional delegation to join their tour on Friday.
