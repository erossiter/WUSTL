Senator Boxer today sent the following letter to Secretary Leavitt:    
September 29, 2005    
Secretary Michael Leavitt  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue, SW  Washington, D.C. 20201    
Dear Secretary Leavitt:    
I am writing to urge you to be proactive to prevent an Avian Flu epidemic, with an emphasis on California.  The Avian Flu is the most lethal flu the world has encountered 창 killing 55 percent of the people that are infected.  As a gateway to Asia, California would likely be one of the first states exposed and should be the focus of our efforts to avert an outbreak.    
First, we need to ensure that there is enough of the anti-viral medication 창 Tamiflu 창  stockpiled to treat victims in California. This would hopefully prevent spreading of the Avian Flu to the rest of the nation.    
Second, the medical community needs to be educated to identify the Avian Flu and know the treatment procedures and necessary quarantine measures.    
Finally, since a person with the Avian Flu may arrive in the United States on a flight from Asia, it is important that airport officials in California are aware of how to deal with the situation 창 who should be contacted and where passengers should be isolated.  This will hopefully prevent the further spreading of the flu.  I call on you to work with Transportation Secretary Mineta and Federal Aviation Administrator Blakey to ensure that the airports are prepared.    
We cannot afford to be caught unaware if and when this deadly flu strikes our country.  I urge you move as quickly as possible.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator
