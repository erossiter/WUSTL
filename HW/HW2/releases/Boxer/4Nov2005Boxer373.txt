 Washington, D.C. - Growing increasingly critical of the Bush Administrationâs failure to respond to her repeated requests for FEMAâs plan to deal with a potentially devastating earthquake in California, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today called on Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to release the response plan or explain why there is not one.    
In a letter to Secretary Chertoff, Senator Boxer criticized the Secretary for saying that it is a "civic virtue" for families to have a disaster plan â despite the fact that Secretary Chertoff's own department does not seem to have a plan to respond to a major California earthquake.    
Senator Boxer wrote, âThe federal government needs to be prepared in the event of a disaster.  A family disaster plan does not do much good if the family is trapped under rubble from an earthquake, or canât get clean water to drink because an earthquake has ruptured the water lines, or canât call for help because cell towers and phone lines are down.â? 
Senator Boxer first requested the plan eight weeks ago.  Two weeks ago, she was joined by Senator Dianne Feinstein (also D-CA) in a letter that called on President Bush to release FEMAâs California earthquake recovery plan.  They also requested that the Senate Government Affairs Committee hold hearings on FEMAâs earthquake preparedness plan.
