   Washington, D.C. 창 U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to Rear Admiral John Mateczun: 
June 6, 2006  Rear Admiral John M. Mateczun    Deputy Surgeon General of the Navy and    Vice Chief, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery    2300 E Street NW    Washington, D.C. 20372-5300 Dear Admiral Mateczun: Senator Daniel Inouye has informed me of the great news that the Navy is establishing a Comprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center (C5) at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, making it the 창West Coast Walter Reed.창? This fulfills the commitment I received from Chairman Ted Stevens and Senator Inouye during consideration of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill to ensure the necessary funding for this important project. I am so pleased that all parties dedicated themselves to helping our brave service members, who are facing unprecedented physical and mental health challenges. Your letter to Senators Stevens and Inouye confirms the establishment of this facility which will provide comprehensive care, not just for the physical injuries our soldiers have sustained, but also for their emotional needs, rehabilitation, and transition back to military service or civilian life. While I lament that even one more service member will be wounded in combat, the reality is that approximately 25 percent of all combat casualties come from the Western United States. This C5 facility will allow our combat-wounded service members to receive treatment and recover from their wounds closer to their loved ones. I thank the Navy for their commitment to this project and look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure that our service members receive the best medical care possible. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.    Sincerely,  Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
