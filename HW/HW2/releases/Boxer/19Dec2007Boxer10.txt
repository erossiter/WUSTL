 Washington, D.C.  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes $1.9 million requested by  Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for the construction of a new control tower at  Palm Springs International Airport.  Boxer said, The  construction of a new control tower is critical to accommodating the growing  traffic at Palm  Springs International Airport and to ensure the  safety of our citizens. As the only commercial airport in Riverside County, Palm  Springs airport must be able to support the surrounding  regions rapidly growing population and increase in air travel. The current  control tower, built in 1967, sits in a gulch, so air traffic controllers cannot  see the ends of the runway  a serious safety issue. The FAA has indicated that the  Palm Springs  tower will be the first tower to be replaced in  2008-2009. The Senate passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of  76 to17. The House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this  week, at which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
