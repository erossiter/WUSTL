 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced Senate approval of $200,000 in federal funds for Tulare Countyâs Rural Crimes Prevention Unit to combat agricultural crime in the San Joaquin Valley.    
âThis funding gives Tulare Countyâs successful Rural Crime Prevention Unit a boost, providing it with the means to continue performing a very important job for our farmers,â? Boxer said.  âI am pleased that the Senate recognized the importance of this program.â? 
Funds for the Tulare County Rural Crime Unit were included in the final version of the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.    
The specialized unit, a result of the Tulare County Districtâs Office, Sheriffâs Department and the Agricultural Commissionerâs Officeâs combined resources, is comprised of Sheriffâs detectives, agricultural inspectors, a district attorney investigator and a deputy district attorney.  These same individuals, utilizing their own area of expertise, investigate and prosecute cases from beginning to end.    
In addition, Tulare Countyâs Rural Crime Unit, which was a pioneering force in rural crime prevention, provides technical expertise, strategic support and an intelligence network for local agricultural crime units in participating counties.    
The FY2006 CJS appropriations bill funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice.  The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
