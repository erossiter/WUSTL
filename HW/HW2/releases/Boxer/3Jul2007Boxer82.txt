 San Francisco, CA  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today joined Representative Mike Thompson and St. Helena elected officials for a tour of the St. Helena Flood Control Project    Boxer said, This project will provide critical flood protection for the community of St. Helena and, at the same time, help restore riverside habitat and improve conditions for fish such as Chinook salmon and steelhead trout.    The St. Helena Flood Control Project is designed to provide 100-year flood protection to the City of St. Helena and restore the rivers natural floodplain. More than 300 local homes experienced flooding during major storms in 1986, 1995, 1997 and 2006.    Boxer, who is Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, worked to include the provision in the Senate-passed 2007 Water Resources Development Act. The provision would authorize the $30 million flood control project after the Corps approves the final project plan.

Working together with Congressman Thompson, I think we can all ensure that this project is finished. ###
