 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $2,250,000 to continue construction of the Orange County Groundwater Replenishment System was approved by the Senate.    
"Californiaâs need for clean drinking water continues to grow.  Funding for the Orange County Groundwater Replenishment System will enable the county to expand its water resources," Boxer said.  "It is essential that this project is completed so residents can have access to a new source of clean drinking water." 
Senator Boxer obtained federal funds for the Orange County water system in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
This funding will help with the construction of a system that can produce 66 million gallons of clean drinking water a day.  The system will purify wastewater currently being released into the ocean and will reduce the environmental strain on freshwater sources such as the Colorado River.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
