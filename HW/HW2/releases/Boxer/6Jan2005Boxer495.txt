 The Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones  1009 Longworth H.O.B.  U.S. House of Representatives  Washington, D.C. 20515 
Dear Representative Tubbs Jones: 
I am in receipt of your letter that spelled out concerns about the election irregularities in Ohio during the November 2004 election. 
The fact that you are from Ohio and that you are a former judge gives great weight and much credibility to the points you cited and to your plea that these issues be addressed by the Congress. 
I was particularly moved by your point that it is virtually impossible to get official House consideration of the whole issue of election reform, including these irregularities. 
I have concluded that objecting to the electoral votes from Ohio is the only immediate way to bring these issues to light by allowing you to have a two-hour debate to let the American people know the facts surrounding Ohioâs election. 
I will therefore join you in your objection to the certification of Ohioâs electoral votes.  Attached is my signature on a copy of your written objection. 
Sincerely,   Barbara BoxerUnited States Senator
