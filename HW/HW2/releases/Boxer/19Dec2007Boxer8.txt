 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes more than $10 million requested  by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to provide 100-year flood protection to the City  of Napa. I have worked closely with  Napa officials  on this plan to prevent the serious threat of flooding and restore the areas  treasured wetlands, Boxer said. These funds will help provide real protection for  homes and businesses along the river and enhance the natural beauty and  ecosystem of the region. This environmentally sustainable project, when  completed, will protect residents, businesses and homes from flood damage and  help stimulate the city of Napas downtown by promoting economic  growth. The long-term plan calls for the restoration of  marshlands and riparian forest, with a small length of concrete channel to be  built in downtown Napa to prevent flooding. The project  eventually will result in the creation of 600 acres of tidal wetlands in the  Napa Valley, enhancing the  natural habitat for numerous fish and bird species.   The Senate passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of  76 to17. The House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this  week, at which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
