 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes funding for a flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration project in Hamilton City.  The bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Senator Boxer is a member.    
âThis project will protect the people of Hamilton City from the threat of floods while also restoring native vegetation,â? Boxer said.  âI am very pleased that the Environment and Public Works Committee has acknowledged the importance of this project and approved funding.â? 
The flooding of Hamilton Cityâs east-side levee has caused the evacuation of its residents five times in the past 20 years.  Recently, the citizens of Hamilton City have raised funds to protect their community from levee-related flooding.    
Under Boxerâs proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, the project is authorized for a total of $50.6 million including a federal contribution of $33 million and non-federal (local and state) contributions of $17.6 million.  The funding will be used to reconstruct 6.8 miles of levee and restore 1,470 acres of native vegetation in Glenn County.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
