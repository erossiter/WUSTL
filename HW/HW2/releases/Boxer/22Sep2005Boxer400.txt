 Washington, D.C. 창 U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced that her amendment to help improve housing assistance to low-income veterans was passed today by the Senate as part of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill.    
"America창s men and women in uniform work tirelessly to protect the freedoms we enjoy everyday," Boxer said.  "Yet when they return from service, many of our nation창s heroes do not have adequate places to live and many go homeless.  It is my hope this study will provide a roadmap to improve access to housing for our veterans." 
Boxer창s amendment requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on housing assistance to low-income veterans to better understand how to improve federal veterans housing programs.  The amendment requires GAO to investigate veterans housing, federal aid to veterans and homelessness among the veteran population.    
It is estimated that 500,000 veterans will become homeless this year.  In 2003, there were 49,250 homeless veterans in California alone.    
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill in May.  The bill now goes to conference.
