 Washington, D.C.Ã¢ The United States Senate tonight passed an amendment by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer that calls on the Congress to appropriate $60 million for jammers to deactivate roadside bombs in Iraq.  The Senate only has $25 million for this purpose, while the House has $60 million. 
"I am hopeful that the final bill will include the full $60 million for these jamming systems that protect our troops against deadly roadside bombs.  Our troops deserve nothing less," Boxer said. 
As of April 2005, 328, or approximately 21% of the soldiers killed in Iraq, have lost their lives to roadside bomb attacks, second only to death by hostile enemy fire.  According to estimates by the House Appropriations Committee, the Department of Defense has only fielded 25 percent of the required number of jammers to protect troops from roadside bomb attacks in Iraq.
