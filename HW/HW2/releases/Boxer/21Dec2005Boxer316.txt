  December 21, 2005    

The Honorable Arlen Specter  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  United States Senate  Washington, DC 20510    
Dear Mr. Chairman:    
I was very pleased that you responded so quickly to the news regarding warrantless surveillance being conducted on American citizens by announcing that the Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the matter.    
I really believe it is important to have those hearings as soon as possible, and I ask you to consider holding them before the hearings on Judge Alito.  Because Justice O창Connor has graciously agreed to stay on the Court until her successor is confirmed, the importance of this matter should take precedence, especially since the President has vowed to continue this warrantless surveillance.    
I believe waiting to have the hearings may well send a signal that this issue is simply not that important to Senators.  In fact, many experts and Senators are saying that this action by the President is an abuse of executive authority.  For example, John Dean, who was White House counsel to President Nixon during Watergate, believes that this President has admitted to an 창impeachable offense.창?    
Clearly, hearings by the Judiciary Committee are essential.  Thank you for your immediate attention to this request.    
Best regards,    
Barbara Boxer    
United States Senator
