 The bottom line is that this White House is on a public relations spin campaign because this war, and the costs of this war, are spinning out of control.  Just like this Administration cherry picked intelligence before the war, they are now cherry picking nuggets of happy news to try to boost their sagging poll numbers.    
Prior to the war, the Administration said that Iraq would be âan affordable endeavor,â? would not require sustained aid, and Iraq could finance its own reconstruction with oil revenues.    
Those statements turned out to be false, like so many other expectations peddled by this White House.    
Congress has appropriated more than $250 billion in taxpayer funds for the war in Iraq, including tens of billions for reconstruction.  Rather than make this a worldwide effort and collect on the billions pledged by foreign donors, and rather than stopping no-bid contracts, this White House just attacks those of us who demand accountability and a change in policy.    
It is going to take more than rose-colored glasses to see our way out of Iraqâ we need a strategy from this White House that acknowledges the hard realities we face and puts the responsibility on the Iraqi people to secure their own country and take control of their future.
