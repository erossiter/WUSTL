 Los Angeles, CA â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement after Boeing Co. announced that it would begin shutting down its C-17 production line:    
"The Air Force has identified additional C-17 aircraft as its number one unfunded priority to the Congress, yet the Administration is moving forward with its premature and irresponsible decision to halt C-17 production.    
"To date, the Administration has failed to indicate that it intends to fund additional C-17s in the FY 2008 budget request.  This decision is both fiscally reckless and potentially harmful to our national security.  Not only will it cost taxpayers billions of dollars, it will also result in the loss of the world-class C-17 workforce and supplier base.    
"Given the aircraftâs impressive record in providing airlift support to our troops serving overseas and in humanitarian missions in America and abroad, I think we should be building more C-17s, not shutting down this important program.    
"I have been working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that the C-17 line stays open.  On July 26, 2006, I joined with Senators from Georgia, Missouri, Connecticut, Texas, and Maine in writing the President to urge him to fulfill the Air Force's request for additional C-17s, and to base decisions regarding C-17 procurement on military requirements, not financial constraints.    
"I urge the President to change his position and announce a plan to purchase additional C-17s before Boeing is left with no choice but to shutter the program.  Mothballing the C-17 line is a waste of taxpayer dollars and is not in the best interest of our nation's security."
