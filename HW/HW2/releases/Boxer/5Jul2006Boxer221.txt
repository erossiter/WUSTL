 North Korea's action escalates an already tense situation in the region and with the United States.    
The Administration must pay far more attention to the North Korea threat, which it ignored for too long because of its obsession with Iraq.  The war in Iraq continues with no exit strategy, even though our armed forces have done everything they could to bring democracy there.    
The world is far less stable due to the failure of the Bush Administration to deal with the North Korea threat with direct talks before this test was conducted.  All options must be on the table to deal with this threat.
