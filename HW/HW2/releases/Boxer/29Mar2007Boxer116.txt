 Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today announced that Committee approved a $139.6 million authorization for the ecosystem restoration of Matilija Creek as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007.    
"The Matilija Creek is an important part of California's ecosystem," Boxer said.  "This project will help restore its beauty and will benefit the wildlife that inhabits the creek.  I am pleased that my colleagues on the EPW committee have joined me to support it." 
Of the $139.6 million the Committee authorized for the Matilija ecosystem restoration project, $86.7 million is an authorization for federal funds, with the remaining funding coming from state and local contributions.  The Matilija ecosystem restoration project would remove the Matilija Dam, which no longer provides flood control for downstream communities.  In addition, this project is designed to restore the Matilija Creek for fish and wildlife, including the endangered steelhead trout, as well as downstream coastal beaches.    
WRDA authorizes flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, and other water projects across the country.
