 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) is pleased to announce that the Senate Commerce Committee adopted her Cell Phone Number Privacy amendment.    
Boxer, along with Senator Arlen Specter, had originally introduced the bill in 2003 and, since then, has been pushing for its adoption in the face of industry opposition.    
Boxer said, âI hope todayâs vote signals a new commitment on the part of Congress to stand up for the privacy rights of the American people.  Consumers should never have their cell phone numbers listed in a directory without their specific authorization.â? 
In addition to barring the listing of cell phone numbers without an individualâs affirmative consent, the proposal also prohibits cell phone companies from charging a consumer a fee to keep his or her number out of a directory.    
The Boxer legislation was adopted as part of a larger bill to protect consumers from having their phone records sold.
