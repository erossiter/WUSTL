 Washington, D.C. â The U.S. Senate is poised to pass the Emergency Supplemental that includes the $60 million requested by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for Army roadside bomb jammers.  In April, the Senate passed Senator Boxerâs amendment calling on Congress to appropriate $60 million for jammers.    
âUnfortunately, U.S. military personnel were sent into Iraq ill-prepared to deal with the threat from roadside bombs, and we have been playing catch up ever since,â? Boxer said. âOur soldiers were sent into combat with only a tiny fraction of the jammers they should have had.â? 
Jammers help neutralize the threat of roadside bombs by interfering with the signal transmitted to the improvised explosive deviceâs fuse.  So far, roadside bombs have accounted for the deaths of 351 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.  They have been the leading cause of deaths there for the last three months.    
The Bush Administration did not request any funds in the emergency supplemental to purchase jammers for the Army despite the Joint Staffâs estimating that roadside explosives have caused 70 percent of U.S. casualties (soldiers killed and wounded) in Iraq.    
Boxer said, âThousands of Americans have been killed and wounded, many by roadside bombs.  We need to give our service men and women the protection they want and need.â?
