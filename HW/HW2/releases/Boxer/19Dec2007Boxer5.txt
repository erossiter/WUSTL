 Washington, DC  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year  2008 omnibus appropriations bill, which includes funding requested by Senator  Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for a key flood control project in the Santa Barbara region.   The Senate approved $275,200 in funding to address levee  needs and to ensure that the levee will protect the northern portion of  Santa Barbara County from Santa Maria River  flooding. This funding is the first step  towards securing greater flood protection for the people of Santa Barbara County, Senator Boxer  said.  The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 76 to17. The  House is expected to approve Senate changes to the bill later this week, at  which point it will go to the President for his  signature.
