 Washington, D.C.â During debate on the Defense Department Appropriations Bill last night, the U.S. Senate accepted an amendment by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that would establish a Defense Task Force on Mental Health to develop a new strategic plan for addressing mental health issues within the United States Armed Forces.    
Boxer said, "We have not dealt with such an extraordinary number of returning war veterans in decades, and our Iraq veterans are facing unique mental health issues as a result of the intense and protracted urban combat they faced in Iraq.  Itâs time to do a comprehensive review of existing mental health services, develop new initiatives, and ensure that our veterans are receiving the best possible care we can provide." 
The Defense Task Force on Mental Health would consist of representatives from each branch of the Armed Forces, a Veterans Affairs representative, a Health and Human Services representative, and professionals from the private sector who have expertise in the area of mental health, ensuring vitally important collaboration among military and civilian health care experts.    
The task force would primarily be charged with assessing and making recommendations to improve the Department of Defenseâs mental health services across-the-board.  Among other issues, the Task Force would examine:    
How prevalent mental health conditions are among members of the Armed Forces; 
How well our existing programs work to prevent, identify, and treat mental health conditions; 
How best to reduce or eliminate barriers to care, including the stigma associated with seeking  help for mental health 	related conditions; 
How smoothly our veterans receiving mental health care transition from the Department of Defense health care system to the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system; 
How accessible long-term care is for members of the Individual Ready Reserve the Selective Reserve, and for discharged, separated, or retired members of the Armed Forces. 
Today, the Wall Street Journal reported that of about 49,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who received care at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility between October 2003 and February 2005,  26 percent screened positive for a mental disorder.    
The Boxer amendment was endorsed by the National Gulf War Resource Center.
