 Washington, D.C. â Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) sent a letter to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey asking her to prioritize the building of a new control tower at Palm Springs International Airport, since the current tower, built in 1967, has serious safety issues.    
Following please find Senator Boxerâs letter to Administrator Blakey: 
July 6, 2006  The Honorable Marion C. Blakey    Administrator    Federal Aviation Administration    800 Independence Avenue, SW    Washington, DC 20591 Dear Administrator Blakey:  I am writing to request that you prioritize the construction of a new control tower for the Palm Springs International Airport.   The Palm Springs Airport is the only commercial airport in Riverside County, which has a rapidly growing population and an increasing demand for air travel. From 2000 to 2005, Riverside Countyâs population grew by 26 percent. This year, first quarter traffic at Palm Springs Airport increased by 11 percent as compared to the same period last year.  Unfortunately, this growing region has an airport with an air-traffic control tower at the end of its life cycle. Built in 1967, the Palm Springs control tower is not only too short but sits in a gulch, and, as a result, air traffic controllers cannot see the ends of the runway from the tower â a serious safety issue. The tower must be relocated and built taller before a tragic accident occurs. According to the Desert Sunâs review of the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Boardâs records, from 1997 to 2003, Palm Springs Airport had one of the highest annual rates of runway incursions â serious near misses â of any airport in California.   Congress has already demonstrated that this tower is important. Last year, a new tower received $2.3 million in appropriations. This year, at the urging of Congresswoman Bono, the House Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development bill included $2 million for a new tower, and I am working to secure funds in the Senate bill as well.  Administrator Blakey, with your background in transportation safety as Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, I know that safety is a crucial issue for you. Therefore, I urge you to prioritize the construction of a new control tower at the Palm Springs International Airport.    Sincerely,          Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
