 Washington, D.C.â Concerned by the Federal Emergency Management Agencyâs âappallingly slow responseâ? to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today sent the following letter to the President asking for a copy of FEMAâs disaster recovery plan for California should the state experience a major earthquake:

The President  The White House  Washington, D.C. 20500 
Dear Mr. President:    
	The Katrina disaster and its aftermath have been shocking.  I am extremely upset about the Federal Emergency Management Agencyâs (FEMA) appallingly slow response to assist the people devastated by the hurricane and flooding, and I want to ensure it does not happen again.    
	In California, the potential for earthquakes is very great.  And, unlike hurricanes, there is no advance warning of when an earthquake might strike.    
	Having witnessed what happened in the Gulf States, I am extremely concerned that FEMA is not prepared should California experience a major earthquake.  I am asking you to please forward to me the FEMA disaster recovery plan that is in place to respond to a serious earthquake in my state.      
	I write to you because I know that you would want to see such a plan yourself, given what has occurred in the Gulf States.    
	Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.  Upon receipt of this plan, I will send it off to Californiaâs emergency response organizations for comment.    
Sincerely,    
Barbara Boxer  United States Senator   # # #
