 Washington, D.C. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon today told U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that it would mean a great deal to the fight against global warming if President Bush would attend a special high-level meeting on the topic at United Nations headquarters in New York on September 24, 2007.    Boxer, who is Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, thanked the Secretary-General for his leadership on the issue of global warming and informed him that bi-partisan progress is being made in Congress, which she hoped would help him as he builds worldwide coalitions dedicated to staving off the worst impacts of global warming.    In a letter to President Bush this afternoon, Boxer wrote: I believe it would send an important message to all of the countries of the world if you could put this meeting on your schedule. The symbolism of your presence would bring strong, new momentum to this critical issue and encourage a worldwide effort to avoid the horrific impacts of unchecked global warming.   Boxer met with the Secretary-General during a special meeting today of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ###
