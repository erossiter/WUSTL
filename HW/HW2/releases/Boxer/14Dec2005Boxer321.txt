 After countless speeches, more than $250 billion dollars spent, and more than 2,150 of our brave soldiers lost, the President has still failed to level with the American people and provide an achievable plan for completing our goals in Iraq.    
Tomorrowâs election is an important benchmark that the President should have used for laying out a plan.    
But, the President fails to understand that our indefinite presence in Iraq fuels the insurgency, strengthens Iraqi radicals, and diminishes the possibility that Iraqâs various religious and ethnic groups will make the political compromises necessary to end what is now a slow boil civil war.
