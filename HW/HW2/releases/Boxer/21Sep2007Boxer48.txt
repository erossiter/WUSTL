 Washington, D.C.Today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act, a comprehensive anti-gang bill authored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that includes Senator Barbara Boxers (D-CA) Mynishas Law.  I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this issue and for working to include Mynishas Law in this important legislation, Senator Boxer said. In California, we know all to well the damge that gang violence has done to our communities and our families, particularly our children. I hope that the House will act quickly on this legislation.    Boxer first introduced Mynishas Law in April 2006 after the tragic death of Mynisha Crenshaw, an 11 year old girl killed by a stray bullet while eating dinner with her family in San Bernardino. The gang-related incident drew increased attention to the severe violence that plagues many of our communities and prompted Boxer to introduce the legislation. Mynishas Law would help combat gang violence in high-risk areas across the country by creating an interagency task force that focuses on at-risk youth intervention, literacy, employment and coordination between local and regional gang prevention efforts.                    ###
