 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced the Senate has approved her request for $150,000 for the Hemet Police Activities League Community Center in downtown Hemet.    
âHemetâs new community center will provide at-risk youth with a safe place to go afterschool and activities to keep them engaged,â? Boxer said.  âI am pleased the Senate agreed to help the Hemet Police Activities League build this important new facility.â? 
The funding will be used for construction of the Hemet Police Activities League Community Center in downtown Hemet.  Currently, this area has a high concentration of juvenile crime.  The Center will help provide alternative activities for Hemetâs at-risk youth.    
The 15,000-square-foot facility will offer a variety of services to Hemet youth, including additional jobs, tutoring, homework assistance, counseling and life-skills workshops, job developments and recreational programs in the community.    
Boxer obtained this funding through her request in the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006.  The bill will now go to the President for his signature.
