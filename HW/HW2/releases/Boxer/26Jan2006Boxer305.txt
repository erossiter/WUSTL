 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement:    
Today, the Bush Administration issued a long-awaited standard for perchlorate, a toxic chemical that has contaminated roughly 400 groundwater, surface water, soil and drinking water sites across the country.    
Experts have recommended a 1 part per billion standard.  The State of California has set a 6 part per billion standard.  Shockingly, EPA set a woefully inadequate standard of 24.5 parts per billion.    
This standard fails to protect pregnant women, children and other vulnerable individuals from this dangerous health hazard.  Perchlorate can damage the mental and physical development of people, and even very low levels of this dangerous chemical block the bodyâs ability to produce hormones that are essential for brain function and development.    
The standard also fails to account for perchlorate exposures from food, such as milk, grains and lettuce, which can contain concentrated amounts of perchlorate.  EPAâs standard also ignores new and mounting evidence that this toxic chemical is more prevalent in food than previously thought.    
With more than 20 million Americans drinking water contaminated with perchlorate, we must take every possible step to protect public health, and this standard falls far short of accomplishing that essential goal.
