 Washington, D.C. - Today, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) encouraging the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to take action to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma.   Recently, hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens led by courageous Buddhist monks risked their lives in demonstrations to demand a return to democracy and respect for human rights in their country. The repressive military government in Burma responded with force and brutally cracked down on the peaceful protesters. The junta continues to arrest and detain Burmese activists.   Next week, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets in Singapore for the 13th ASEAN Summit. The Boxer resolution states that Congress would welcome a decision by ASEAN, consistent with its core documents and its new charter, to review Burmas membership in ASEAN and to consider appropriate disciplinary measures, including suspension, until such time as the Government of Burma has demonstrated an improved respect for and commitment to human rights.   Boxer said, I appreciate the strong comments from ASEAN member nations condemning the juntas violent suppression of peaceful protesters in Burma. It is now time for ASEAN to back its words with actions.   Boxer, who is chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, held a hearing on Burma last month.   ###
