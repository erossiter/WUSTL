 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $250,000 in federal funds for the Mercy Affordable Housing project in San Francisco.    
âSan Franciscoâs low-income families are struggling to stay in the city because of the high cost of housing,â? said Boxer. âMercy Housing will help provide San Franciscoâs low-income families with an affordable, secure place to live.â? 
The $250,000 will help fund Mercy Housingâs Affordable Family Housing and Commercial Space project at 10th and Mission Streets in San Francisco.  When completed, the Mercy Housing project will provide 127 units of affordable housing and commercial space.  The commercial portion of the property will provide affordable office space for Mercy Housing and other nonprofit organizations.    
Mercy Housing is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing affordable housing to low-income families, seniors, people with HIV/AIDS, formerly homeless people, and individuals with chronic physical impairments or mental illness.    
Funding for the project was included in the final version of the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.  The President signed the bill into law yesterday.
