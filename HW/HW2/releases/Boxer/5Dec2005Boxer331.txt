 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) appeared on Fox News Sunday yesterday and raised concerns about the written views of Judge Samuel Alito regarding past Supreme Court decisions on reapportionment in the 1960's, which established the principle of âone person, one vote.â?    
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a direct personal attack on Senator Boxer for her remarks, calling them a âblatant lie.â?    
Senator Boxer today issued the following response to the RNC:    
âGoing after the messenger with such a personal attack does not change the fact that it was Judge Alito who wrote that he had a major disagreement with the Supreme Courtâs reapportionment decisions, which led to the âone person, one voteâ guarantee.  It was Judge Alito, who even said further, that his career was âmotivated in large partâ by his disagreement over this issue.    
âThis personal attack on me only goes to show how far some Republicans will go to blindly advance this nomination, without any consideration of Judge Alitoâs past statements or beliefs, and regardless the negative impact he could have on the rights and freedoms of the American people.    
âThe RNC cares more about negative politics than a careful review of Judge Alitoâs record.â?
