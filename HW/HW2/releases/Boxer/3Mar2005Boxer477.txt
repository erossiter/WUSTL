 Washington, D.C.â The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed an amendment by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that urged Saudi Arabia to permit women to run for office and vote in all future elections. 
Boxer said, "The Saudi government's denial of basic rights to women is not only wrong, it hurts Saudi Arabia's economic development, modernization and prosperity.  It is in Saudi Arabia's best interest to allow women to fully participate in its society, and this includes the right to vote and run for office." 
The first stage of municipal elections in Saudi Arabia were held on February 10 â the first such elections in more than 40 years.  But Saudi Arabia currently prohibits women from voting or running for office, as well as other basic civil rights. 
According to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, women in Saudi Arabia can only be admitted to a hospital for medical treatment upon consent of a male relative.  And, while women formally own 20 percent of Saudi businesses, they must deputize a male relative to represent them in financial transactions.  Women are also prohibited from studying for certain professions such as engineering, journalism, and architecture. 
In addition, the Saudi justice system does not grant women the same legal status as men.  Domestic violence is not regarded as a crime under Saudi law, and spousal abuse is prevalent. 
Boxer said, "A real opportunity was missed by not allowing women to participate in these elections.  The Administration and the world community should heed the words of historian Bernard Lewis, who said that the treatment of women is 'the most important single reason why Europe and then the larger Western world moved so far ahead, not only of the Islamic world, but also of all the other non-Western societies.'" 
The Boxer amendment was included as part of the Foreign Affairs Reauthorization Bill.
