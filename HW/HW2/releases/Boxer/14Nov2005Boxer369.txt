 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $150,000 in federal funds to restore Bolinas Lagoon, improving its natural habitat, was passed by the Senate.    
"Bolinas Lagoon is one of our nationâs most unique and pristine coastal wetlands. These funds will be used to restore what is perhaps the finest marine estuary and habitat on the West Coast," Boxer said.  "I am pleased that the Senate has recognized the importance of preserving the lagoon for the local community and visitors to enjoy." 
Senator Boxer obtained funding for the Bolinas Lagoon restoration in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
Funds will be used to dredge choking levels of sediment from the lagoonâs floor accumulated during past commercial activity, revitalizing the natural habitat for numerous species of fish, marine mammals, and migratory and stationery birds.    
Located 15 miles northwest of the entrance to the San Francisco Bay, Bolinas Lagoon is a 1,100-acre shallow tidal estuary that is the natural habitat for many endangered species of wildlife.  It is also a destination for nature lovers who come annually to enjoy the natural beauty of the 7,700-year-old ecosystem.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
