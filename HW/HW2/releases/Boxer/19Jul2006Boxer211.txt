 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate-passed Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes authorization for $12 million in funding for the restoration of the Los Angeles River.  This important victory makes the LA River project eligible for appropriation funding.       Boxer said, âThis project will help transform the LA River from a concrete eyesore into a beautiful asset for the enjoyment of Los Angeles residents.  This authorization is an important step towards restoring the river to provide flood protection for our communities and recreational areas along the riverbanks for our families.â? 
The $12 million authorization is for initial demonstration projects, including removing concrete, restoring ecosystems for wildlife, and providing recreational opportunities along the riverbanks for local residents.     
Senator Boxer also secured the LA River revitalization project authorization study, which authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to work with local entities, including the City of Los Angeles, to develop a plan to revitalize the LA River.      
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.
