 WASHINGTON, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced $450,000 to offset the costs of repairing the breakwater in Port San Luis harbor was approved by the Senate.    
"The San Simeon earthquake of 2003 damaged the breakwater and severely compromised its effectiveness in protecting the San Luis port from destructive ocean waves and storms," Boxer said.  "I am very pleased that officials will receive funds to pay for the needed repairs." 
Senator Boxer obtained funding for repairing the breakwater, which sustained structural damage from the Dec. 22, 2003, San Simeon earthquake, in the final version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.    
The federally owned breakwater, a 2,400-foot-long rock jetty, screens powerful waves and protects three publicly owned piers, including the California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo Marine Science Center.  Repairs on the structure were completed in August 2005.    
The breakwater also safeguards miles of local beaches that are frequented by area residents and attract tens of thousands of visitors annually.  If left neglected, the breakwaterâs structural integrity would have continued to worsen until it became ineffective in deterring incoming waves.    
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy and independent agencies in FY06.    
The legislation now goes to the President for his signature.
