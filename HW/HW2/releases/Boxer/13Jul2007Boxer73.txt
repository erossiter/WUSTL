 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) today introduced legislation to honor country western legend Buck Owens by designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 118 Minner Avenue in Bakersfield, California, as the Buck Owens Post Office. Owens was one of the pioneers of the so-called Bakersfield Sound, which brought a fresh California tone to country music. In 1950, Buck moved his young family to Bakersfield, California, where he began to make his mark on country music as a performer, a songwriter, and recording artist. His 20 number-one hits are a testament to his place among the greatest artists in country music history. Boxer said, I was fortunate to have met Buck ten years ago when I was invited to Bakersfield to present one of his special red, white, and blue guitars to a promising music student named William Villatoro. I still vividly remember how the young man was deeply moved and inspired by Bucks generous gesture. Although he is no longer with us, Buck leaves behind a wonderful legacy of artistry and love of music. I am proud to introduce this legislation in his honor. Feinstein said, This post office will serve as a fitting tribute to Bucks contributions to country music and to Bakersfield. I am delighted to join my colleague, Senator Boxer, in co-sponsoring this legislation. ###
