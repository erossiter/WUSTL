 Washington, D.C. â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today introduced legislation that would improve security at the nationâs ports by increasing the Department of Homeland Securityâs port security grant funding.    
âSecuring our ports is critical to our national and economic security,â? Boxer said.  âWe need to invest in securing our ports to keep this country safe.  We cannot afford the consequences of doing otherwise." 
Boxerâs U.S. Seaport Multiyear Security Enhancement Act would create a Port Security Grant Program within the Department of Homeland Security that would be funded at $800 million per year for five years.  The legislation would also allow ports to receive multi-year grants to help finance larger projects.  This legislation is a companion bill to the House bill introduced by Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald    
According to the Coast Guard, Americaâs ports need $7.3 billion over the next 10 years to comply with security and upgrade provisions in the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2005.  But the Department of Homeland Securityâs fiscal year 2006 budget request did not include specific funding for port security grants.    
Port security is critical to the nationâs economy.  While much of the nationâs goods are imported through ports, including over 40 percent imported through Californiaâs ports, only a small percentage are physically inspected.    
âI have seen first-hand the challenges Californiaâs ports are confronting.  This funding is crucial to safeguarding many of our ports, including the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,â? Boxer said.
