 Fresno, CA â On Thursday, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer awarded her Conservation Champion Award to Susan Stiltz, a founding member and Projects Director for Tree Fresno. Senator Boxerâs State Director, Tom Bohigian, presented the award.    
Tree Fresno has seen great success since its founding during Fresnoâs Centennial year in 1985.  Susan Stiltz has been an integral part of that success, having served on its Board of Directors, and as Assistant Director, Executive Director and currently as Tree Fresnoâs Project Director.  After playing an important role in the 31,000 trees that have been planted in the past 20 years, Stiltz is retiring at the end of June    
âI am happy to present Susan Stiltz with my Conservation Champion Award,â? said Senator Boxer. âHer active role epitomizes the American tradition of community involvement and every resident and visitor to Fresno will be able to see her accomplishments as they enjoy the thousands of trees she has had a hand in planting.  The trees Susan and Tree Fresno planted have cleaned the air and made Fresno a cooler and more beautiful place.  Her legacy will continue to grace Fresno for decades to come.â?  Boxer said.    
Senator Boxer established the Conservation Champion award in January 2000 to recognize individuals and organizations working to promote a safe and healthy environment.
