 The National Academy of Sciences is releasing its long anticipated study on perchlorate. 
Unfortunately, according to documents released by the Natural Resources Defense Council, serious questions have been raised about the undue influence of the White House and the Defense Department on the NASÃ¢s perchlorate recommendations. 
The Administration routinely downplays the health risks of perchlorate despite the well-documented risks it poses to the physical and mental health of children.  Perchlorate contamination has been found in many communities in California and all across the nation. 
The result is that the NAS has recommended a standard that is twenty times higher than what was recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2002. 
Once again, the Administration has let its friendships with special interests groups stand in the way of protecting the health of the people of this country.
