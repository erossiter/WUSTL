 Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Senate today passed a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and cosponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) that would protect American soldiers from being subject to the jurisdiction of Iraqi criminal courts or punishment under Iraqi law.    
Boxer said, âAmerican soldiers are currently held accountable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions.  With Iraq in chaos, this is no time to even consider forcing our soldiers to be subject to the Iraqi criminal justice system.â? 
Many in the Iraqi government have called for U.S. soldiers to be subjected to the Iraqi criminal justice system.       
Speaking on the floor of the Senate this afternoon, Senator Boxer quoted statements made by the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, who called U.S. troops butchers and said, âI personally think whoever kills an American soldier in defense of his country would have a statue built for him in that country.â? 
Boxer said, âThat comment alone is reason enough for us to pass my amendment, and I am very pleased that the Senate did that.â?  	  The Boxer amendment passed by a vote of 97-0.
