 Washington, D.C.â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement on the nomination of Harriet Miers to be Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court:    
"The President has selected a loyal political ally without a judicial record to sit on the highest court in the land.  This means that the Senate has a huge job to do as we seek to replace Justice Sandra Day OâConnor, the swing vote on the Supreme Court, who has upheld the rights and freedoms of Americans."
