 Washington, DC â In light of Californiaâs recent heat crisis, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has called on Governor Arnold Schwarzenneger (R-CA) to immediately declare a state of emergency, which will make farmers and ranchers impacted by the heat wave eligible for federal assistance.    
Following is Senator Boxerâs letter to Governor Schwarzenneger: 
July 28, 2006  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger     State Capital Building    Sacramento, CA 95814 Dear Governor Schwarzenegger:  In the wake of the ongoing heat crisis in California that has resulted in significant loss of life, Federal aid is needed to help deal with the impacts of this extreme weather event. In order to make areas of our State that have been affected by the heat crisis eligible for Federal assistance, I ask that you immediately declare a state of emergency.  In addition to significantly affecting the lives of Californias citizens, the extreme heat is creating adverse conditions for our States cattle ranchers and dairy farmers. According to some estimates, up to 36,000 cattle, or two percent of the States total herd, have died during this heat crisis, causing significant economic loss and reduced production for the beef and dairy industries.      We must do all we can to protect the health and competitiveness of our agricultural economy. Some dairies are reporting losses in production of up to 25 percent of their average capacity, and cattle ranches are being forced to bear the cost of disposing of their dead cattle.   As you are aware, six California counties have already declared local states of emergency to deal with the large number of dead cattle, but Federal aid is needed to help compensate our farmers and ranchers for their economic losses.   I urge you to immediately declare a state of emergency in the areas affected by the heat crisis. Please be assured that I will do all I can to guarantee that the United States Department of Agriculture provides the necessary resources to our impacted citizens.     Sincerely,    Barbara Boxer        United States Senator
