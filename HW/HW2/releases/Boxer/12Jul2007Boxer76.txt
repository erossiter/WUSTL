 Washington, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $200,000 for construction of the Carl R. Hansen Teen Center at the Stanford Settlement Neighborhood Center in South Natomas, one of Sacramentos most impoverished neighborhoods.   Boxer said, Teen centers help improve the lives of our at-risk youth by giving them a place to go after school and providing them with the support and tools to succeed in life. I am pleased that this funding will help with the construction of the new Carl R. Hansen Teen Center for Sacramento area youth.    Currently, the center serves approximately 150 teens and offers homework assistance, recreational activities and counseling services. The new center will expand services to the communitys growing number of youth. The new 10,000 square foot facility will include recreation areas, a computer lab, study room and offices for small group counseling.    The $200,000 was included in the FY 2008 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Bill. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration. ###
