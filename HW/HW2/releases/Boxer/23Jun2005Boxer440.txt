 Washington, D.C.â Last night, the Senate approved an amendment by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) that calls on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to complete its program of refunds for California by the end of the year.    
The Boxer amendment, which passed by unanimous consent,  notes that California still has not received a penny of refunds from the unjust and unreasonable charges from the energy crisis.  It  states that if FERC has not resolved the refunds issue by the end of the year, FERC must report to Congress explaining what they have done and specify a timetable for the rest of their process.    
Boxer said, "FERC has failed in its responsibility to grant justice to the victims of the massive energy crisis fraud,  and we have been left with no choice but to fight for consumers in the courts and the legislature.  Not only do Enron and Reliant need to be held accountable, but FERC needs to be held accountable as well."  
Boxer added, "I hope this amendment will compel FERC to finally do its jobâ the people of California have been patient enough."
