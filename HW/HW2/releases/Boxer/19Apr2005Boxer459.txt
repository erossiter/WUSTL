 I want to thank Senator George Voinovich of Ohio for his courage and independence regarding the Bolton nomination.  Senator Voinovich broke with his otherwise united party and said the truthâ that this nomination is very troubling. 
My own hope is that the President decides to nominate someone else for this important position of U.N. Ambassador.  But if he does not, I am going to continue to do my job to get the whole truth out about Mr Boltonâs record. 
Intimidating intelligence officials is not only morally wrong, but puts our country in great danger.  Surely there must be many other men and women who could fulfill this post with honor.
