 By passing a moratorium, the Conferees have made it clear that EPA must ensure that some important ethical standards apply when it comes to human testing of pesticides.  EPA can no longer agree to utilize human dosing studies on a case by case basis, ignoring the National Academy of Sciences and the Nuremberg Code.    
Pesticides are by their nature toxic.  The concern is especially great when it comes to the most vulnerable among us.    
I am pleased that the bill language outlaws dosing pregnant women, infants and children and I will be following EPAÃ¢s rulemaking to ensure that they adhere to the clear intent of the Congress.
