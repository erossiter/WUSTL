 The withdrawal of the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court is the consequence of a rushed Presidential decision with virtually no consultation with the Senate.    
This is not a happy day for our country.    
The President should follow the tradition of past presidents창 handling of Supreme Court vacancies and nominate a moderate candidate after full consultation with the key Democratic and Republican members of the Senate.    
For example, before Justices Ginsberg and Breyer were nominated, the White House had extensive consultation with the Judiciary Committee members of both parties. Those nominations went smoothly because of respect for the Constitution.    
This country deserves better than an arrogant Executive Branch that ignores the constitutionally-mandated advice and consent role of the Senate.    
I do not believe that this nomination was withdrawn simply because of the President창s refusal to release White House documents. That is a fig leaf to cover the real problem which was a badly mismanaged and rushed nomination.    
In going forward, the President should graciously accept Justice Sandra Day O창Connor창s commitment to stay on the Court as long as she is needed. He should slow down, consult with the Senate, and nominate a mainstream nominee who will unite this country, not divide it.
