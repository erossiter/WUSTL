 Washington, DC â U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today announced that Senate legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) includes funding for the reauthorization of the Upper Guadalupe River Flood Damage Reduction Project in Santa Clara County.  The bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Senator Boxer is a member.    
âThis project will protect Santa Clara County residents from the threat of floods from the Upper Guadalupe River,â? Boxer said.  âI am very pleased that the Environment and Public Works Committee has recognized the importance of this project and agreed to fund it.â? 
The Upper Guadalupe River flows from the Santa Cruz mountains to San Jose.  In 1995, the Guadalupe River flooded in Santa Clara County, damaging over 300 buildings. This current flood protection project will protect 7,500 homes and businesses against such floods.    
Under Boxerâs proposal, approved today as part of WRDA, the project is authorized for a total of $212.1 million including a federal contribution of $113.3 million and non-federal (local and state) contributions of $98.8 million.  The re-authorization provides the project necessary funding for flood prevention measures.    
WRDA authorizes water supply, flood control, port improvement, and environmental restoration projects across the country.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
