 San Francisco, CA â In a strongly worded letter to the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has requested that the medical license of Dr. Laurence Reich be suspended pending the outcome of legal actions against him.    
Following is the text of Senator Boxerâs letter:    
December 8, 2005 
Linda J. Bergmann, Executive Director  Osteopathic Medical Board of California  2720 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 350  Sacramento, CA 95833    
Dear Ms. Bergmann:    
I recently learned of the extraordinarily disturbing circumstances surrounding the actions of Dr. Laurence Reich, an osteopath who practices in California.    
I believe that immediate action should be taken to suspend Dr. Laurence Reichâs medical license until a full hearing is held and any legal cases against him are completed.    
According to CNN and other media and your Boardâs records, Dr. Reich has a long history of sexual misconduct against patients, which led to a license suspension in 1982 and a 10- year probationary period that ended in 1994.  Further, he was arrested in 2002 on sexual battery charges and pleaded no contest to sexual exploitation by a physician.  In short, this individual has a clear pattern of violating the public trust that has been placed in him, yet he continues to see patients.    
I understand that an Administrative Law Judge will hold a hearing in February 2006 regarding the June, 2000 complaints -- approximately three years after his admission of sexually exploiting a patient and nearly six years after the original complaints that triggered this latest process.    
Due process is an important part of our legal and regulatory system to protect the interests of various professionals who are regulated by government.  In this case, the question that is raised by the history of Dr. Reich is, what about the protection of the publicâs interest?    
This license suspension is long overdue to protect the public.    
Thank you for your attention to this letter. I look forward to your reply.    
Sincerely,    
  Barbara Boxer    
United States Senator
