 I view this study as a warning that EPA is long overdue in setting drinking water and clean up standards for perchlorateâour citizens are put at greater risk the longer they are exposed to this dangerous chemical.  Senator Feinstein and I have asked EPA to immediately issue a health advisory as well as a timeline for how EPA plans to protect our most vulnerable populations.  
EPAâs failure to respond is irresponsible and negligent, especially given the widespread exposure illustrated by this study.
