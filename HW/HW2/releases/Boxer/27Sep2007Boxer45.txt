 Washington, D.C.The U.S. Senate today passed hate crimes legislation that will strengthen the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute hate crimes.     The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act gives the Department of Justice (DoJ) the ability to help state and local governments investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race, ethnic background, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability and gender identity.     It has been almost 10 years since the senseless death of Matthew Shepard, Senator Boxer said.  That tragedy showed us that we still have a long way to go, and that is why this amendment is so important.   Boxer continued, Hate crimes are particularly offensive because they are propelled by bias, ignorance and bigotry; their purpose is not just to inflict harm, but to instill fear in entire communities.  I wish there was not a need for this lawbut if America is to serve as a model for tolerance and justice, we must stamp out hate-motivated violence.     The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act passed by a vote of 60-39 as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act.   ###
