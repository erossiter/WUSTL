   September 8, 2005    
Patrick E. Fry, President and Chief   Executive Officer   Sutter Health   2200 River Plaza Drive   Sacramento, CA 95833  
Dear Pat:    
As you know, I have encouraged Sutter and United Healthcare Workers West to reach settlement on outstanding issues that have threatened a disruption of health care services at several of your facilities in northern California.  									  I understand that Federal Mediator David Weinberg has offered a Recommendation of Settlement between the union and Sutter, which if accepted and ratified, would resolve outstanding issues and the ongoing negotiations.  I am greatly encouraged that the union has agreed to the terms of Mr. Weinbergâs proposal.    
I know that the remaining issues are some of the most difficult, but I hope that you and the affiliates will recognize that a quick resolution is in the best interest of patients and the communities that are potentially affected by any disruption of services.  The alternative to an expeditious resolution is not in the public interest.    
Again, it is my strong hope that Sutter and its affiliates accept this compromise settlement proposal of the federal mediator.    
  Sincerely,    
  Barbara Boxer   United States Senator
