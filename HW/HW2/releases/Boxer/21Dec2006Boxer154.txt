 Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today made the following statement about EPAâs proposal to allow certain sources to increase harmful emissions of air toxics. EPAâs own regional offices warned that this proposal would be âdetrimental to the environment and undermine the intentâ? of the Clean Air Act.  EPAâs response is that ânegative publicityâ? would prevent such effects from happening.  Senator Boxerâs statement follows:     
âThe EPA has given the American people yet another unwanted Christmas gift that will only worsen the health of our families. I am dismayed that EPA today proposed to relax its rules for toxic air pollutants. We need less, not more, cancer-causing air pollution. This proposal will allow thousands more pounds of cancer-causing air pollution to be emitted each year. People living near refineries, hazardous waste incinerators and chemical plants will be forced to breathe more toxic air pollution. I have said that the days of rollbacks without scrutiny are over, and I meant it. We will closely examine this issue when the new Congress convenes.â?
