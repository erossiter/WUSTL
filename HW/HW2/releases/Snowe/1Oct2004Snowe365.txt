SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $140,000 IN EDUCATION FUNDING
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $140,000 in federal funding from the Department of Education's Mentoring Program to School Administrative District 21, which includes schools in Canton, Carthage, and Dixfield. 
   "This funding serves as a critical tool in helping children succeed by providing them with mentoring and motivational services," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The Mentoring Program promotes interaction with children by encouraging support and guidance from a mentor, to improve a child's academic performance and interpersonal relationships. The program seeks to reduce the dropout rates of students and reduce juvenile delinquency and involvement in gangs.
