SEN. SNOWE PRAISES $3.2 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR WETLANDS, WILDLIFE REFUGE PROJECTS IN MAINE
  A long-time supporter of conservation efforts, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was pleased that a total of $3,214,200 in conservation fund was awarded to Maine under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), and for the Lake Umbagog and Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuges preservation projects in Maine.  
   Snowe's senior environmental policy advisor has represented the State of Maine for many years at meetings of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, chaired by Interior Secretary Gale Norton, to ensure the conservation projects that protect the habitats of local bird species, were funded. 
   "I am pleased that these vital conservation projects in Maine are being recognized by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for their work to preserve the habitats of native bird populations. Maine has a long-standing tradition of establishing model private-public partnerships to protect future generations of native species within our pristine wetlands and forestlands," said Snowe. 
   At this week's Commission meeting, Snowe's senior policy advisor Ginny Worrest - representing the Commissioner of Maine's Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife - conveyed the historical commitment of the Senator and Maine to conservation projects in the state, pressing for funding to acquire additional acres of land. 
   The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission voted to fund the following preservation projects in Maine: 
   * $1,000,000 for the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership under the North American Wetlands Conservation Trust (NAWCA). The Partnership is working to conserve a total of 339,000 acres of working forestland, protecting the habitats of native bird species, including the northern pintail, ring-necked ducks, Canadian goose, and the red-winged blackbird. Additionally, eagles, bobcats, lynx, deer, moose, and rare species of freshwater clams and dragonflies will be protected. 
   * $1,000,000 for the Maine Forest Ecosystem Project under NAWCA, including both the West Branch Easement and the Katahdin Forest Easement. The collaboration of the Forest Society of Maine, the Nature Conservancy, the Maine Department of Conservation and other entities seek to add to its 476,291 acres currently protected - of which 50,415 acres are wetlands. The greater ecosystem project includes the protection of migrant songbird habitats for the Olive-sided Flycatcher and the Canada Warbler, along with multiple populations of the Wood Turtle. 
   * $650,000 for the Greater Pleasant Bay Project under NAWCA. Developed by the Maine Wetlands Protection Coalition - a partnership of federal, state and local agencies with statewide conservation organizations, local land trusts and private landowners - to permanently protect 762 acres of wetland to preserve the habitat values for water-dependent black ducks and migratory shorebirds. Additionally, the wetlands provide nesting islands for bald eagles and seabirds, including some species native only to Maine. 
   * $538,200 to add 466 acres to the Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge in Oxford County. The Refuge, which spans over the Maine-New Hampshire border, has long been recognized as one of the most productive breeding areas in the northeastern U.S., particularly for the common loon and the osprey. Large populations of moose and black bears also make the habitats in the area. The funding will support efforts to comprehensively manage residential development projects and increased recreational activities of power-boating and water-skiing from further disrupting native nesting and breeding habitats. 
   * $26,000 to add land to the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge spanning York and Cumberland Counties. Intended for the purchase of 36.6 acres from the Kittery Land Trust, the acquisition is considered critical to protecting breeding habitats, including a nearly all salt marsh, for migrating waterfowl, specifically black ducks, mallards and wood ducks. The preserving of the salt marsh and neighboring dune grass along with several other natural communities form a coastal dune-salt marsh ecosystem in southern Maine.
