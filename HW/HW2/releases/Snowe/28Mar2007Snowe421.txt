SEN. SNOWE MOURNS LOSS OF MAINE SOLDIER JASON SWIGER
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Wednesday morning mourned the loss of Army Sergeant Jason Swiger of South Portland who was killed Sunday during a combat mission in Iraq. Jason was on his third tour of duty in Iraq as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division. After speaking with Sgt. Swiger's mother, Sen. Olympia Snowe released the following statement:  
   "As I told his mother, our condolences and thoughts are with Jason's family on this loss for our state and nation," said Senator Snowe. "It is difficult as such times to explain such a loss to a grieving family and mother. However, Jason Swiger answered the call of duty and his bravery and courage will always be honored by Maine and our country. 
   We are also thinking today of the students and faculty of South Portland High School who just last week remembered the life of Marine Angel Rosa who was also killed in Iraq. Both of these young soldiers exemplified the very best in America and my prayers are also with the students, faculty and staff of this outstanding school as they pause to remember and pay tribute to another fallen hero of the Red Riots."
