SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS ON NOV. 4
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today met with Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael G. Mullen to discuss the future of the Navy, including the overall importance of sustaining robust shipbuilding accounts, the future of the DD(X) program - the Navy's next generation destroyer, and the national security reasons for maintaining two viable shipyards.  
   "I would like to commend Admiral Mullen for reaching out and taking the time to discuss the future of the Navy with me today. We had a very constructive and positive conversation today," said Snowe. "I believe the Navy has been the Department of Defense's bill-payer for far too long - leaving the Navy and therefore our national security vulnerable. I remain committed to working with Admiral Mullen as he takes the helm of the Navy to stabilize the shipbuilding accounts and the shipbuilding industrial base. I believe we share a common vision of a strong Navy that will serve to protect our nation in this uncertain and changing national security environment." 
   Snowe specifically discussed the following issues with Admiral Mullen today: 
   Shipbuilding: 
   * Snowe believes that there should be a reversal of Navy policy to reduce the number of ships in the fleet. She hopes that the Navy will submit a budget plan for 10 ships a year. 
   * Snowe is concerned that the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) - that provides the DoD's vision for the future of the military - will be a budget driven document that could ignore the essential needs of the services. 
   Winner-take-all proposal to reduce number of shipyards in the country from two to one: 
   * Last year's proposal to reduce the number of shipyards building surface combatants from two to one was ill-advised for a number of reasons, not the least of which was pointed by the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina at Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi. 
   * More important than the loss of the physical plant is the loss of the workforce. In Mississippi and Louisiana, shipyards have lost about 8,000 workers which points out that these highly skilled workforces are not easily replaced and the nation must consider the consequences of closing down any more of its shipbuilding industrial capacity. 
   DD(X): 
   * Snowe believes the DD(X) program must not only be retained but should be expanded. Last year the DoD reduced the number from 12 to five. Snowe would like to see those seven ships put back into the budget.
