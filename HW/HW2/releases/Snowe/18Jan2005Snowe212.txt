SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $375,000 IN TRAINING FUNDS FOR VETERANS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has awarded the State of Maine Department of Labor in Augusta $375,000 for veterans training.  
   "We owe veterans a great debt for their service to our country," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "It is our duty to help them readjust to civilian life and find employment in a difficult job market. These funds will allow Maine veterans to receive the training they need in order to successfully make this transition." 
   The grant was awarded under the Veterans' Workforce Investment Program (VWIP). The funds it provides are used for providing employment and training services to eligible veterans in the attempt to place veterans into gainful employment. The programs can provide for, but are not limited to, training, retraining, job placement assistance, and support services, including testing and counseling.
