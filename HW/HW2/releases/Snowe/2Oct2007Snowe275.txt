SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT
  As an original cosponsor of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevent Act, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) praised the unanimous passage of the House version of the bill by the Senate last night. The legislation, introduced by Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), is named after Joshua Omvig, an Iraq war veteran who served in the Army Reserve and commited suicide in December of 2005, following an 11-month deployment.  
   "Unquestionably, our nation must do all that we can to detect, diagnose, and treat our veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as quickly as possible, " said Senator Snowe. " I applaud my colleagues for their overwhelming support of this legislation, which will bolster the VA's ability to help our veterans move beyond the psychological trauma of war and lead healthy, productive lives." 
   The risks of suicide among returning veterans has been an increasing national concern, which was highlighted by a June 2007 study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health that found that those who had been in the military were 2.13 times more likely than the general population to die of suicide over time. This bill, which has passed the House, will now be considered in conference committee prior to final passage. 
   This legislation would do the following: 
   * Form a VA Suicide Prevention Campaign to increase awareness of mental illness and the risk factors for suicide, and reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care. 
   * Ensure 24-hour access to mental health care for veterans who are deemed at risk for suicide, including those in rural or geographically remote locations. 
   * Provide suicide prevention education and training for all VA staff, contractors, and medical personnel who interact with veterans. 
   * Create a Family Education Program to assist family members and veterans in understanding the readjustment process, signs and symptoms of mental illness, and risk factors for suicide. 
   * Implement a Veterans Peer Support Program as an adjunct to mental health services that includes social support and suicide prevention.
