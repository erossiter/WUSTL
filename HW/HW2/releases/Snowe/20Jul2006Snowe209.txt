SEN. SNOWE HAILS INCLUSION OF PROVISION BRINGING INDEPENDENT REVIEW TO ARMY CORPS. OF ENGINEERS IN WATER RESOURCES LEGISLATION
  Today, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment by Sens. Russ Feingold (D-MN) and John McCain (R-AZ) and cosponsored by Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) to the Water Resources Development Act establishing an independent review of all Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) projects. Currently, oversight and reviews of these projects are conducted internally by the Corps. In 2002, a National Academy of Sciences report recommended that a formalized process to independently review costly Corps projects should be created. 
   "Today, the Senate has acted to establish a workable system to address a very real problem: poorly planned and designed projects that put people at risk, unnecessarily damage the environment and waste taxpayer dollars," said Snowe. "After Hurricane Katrina, several reports found faulty Corps design for the New Orleans levees and called for a system of independent review. This amendment does just that. I am pleased to have cosponsored this provision."
   The amendment would require an independent review panel for Corps projects that cost more than $40 million or are thought to have a potentially significant environmental impact. Costs associated with independent review are capped. It also would establish an outside safety assurance review for critical flood damage reduction projects to better provide for the public safety.
