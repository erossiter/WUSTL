SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $16,000 FOR MAINE LOCAL FISHERIES
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Maine Local Fisheries Knowledge (LFK) Pilot Project has received a grant of $15,920 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  
   The funds will help develop a local heritage center at the Peabody Memorial Library in Jonesport. The center will provide equipment to record oral history interviews, preserve photographs and documents, make cultural heritage presentations, and provide computer services. 
   "It is critical that we preserve the local knowledge and heritage of this still active fishing community," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "These funds will assist the Peabody Memorial Library in its quest to preserve the cultural history of Jonesport." 
   NOAA Fisheries is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. As a steward, NOAA Fisheries Service conserves, protects, and manages living marine resources in a way that ensures their continuation as functioning components of marine ecosystems, affords economic opportunities, and enhances the quality of life for the American public.
