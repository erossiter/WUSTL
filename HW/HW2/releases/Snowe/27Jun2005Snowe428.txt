SENATE APPROVES SEN. SNOWE'S JUNK FAX PREVENTION ACT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today hailed Senate passage of the Junk Fax Prevention Act, which would protect consumers and businesses from receiving unwanted commercial advertisements by facsimile, while preserving a key communications tool for doing business.  
 Snowe is an original cosponsor of this bill introduced by Sen. Gordon Smith (R-OR). 
   "Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and create the majority of new American jobs," said Snowe. "Junk faxes create an additional economic restraint that hampers their growth and prosperity. It is my firm belief that those who engage in "blast faxes" can and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, as their behavior imposes unreasonable expenses upon residential and business facsimile subscribers." 
   The bill approved today: 
   * Establishes an exception to the general prohibition against the sending of unsolicited faxes without express consent for parties with an "established business relationship." 
   * Establishes a requirement that persons sending unsolicited faxes pursuant to an "established business relationship" also provide consumers with a cost-free mechanism to opt-out of further faxes, and that notice of this mechanism be provided on each such fax in a clear and conspicuous manner. 
   * Permits the FCC to limit the duration of an "established relationship" consistent with reasonable consumer expectations and appropriate justification by the FCC. 
   * Requires the FCC to report annually regarding enforcement actions taken against senders of unsolicited fax advertisements.
