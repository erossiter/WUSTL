SEN. SNOWE: INITIAL FINDINGS OF SBA INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ON 9-11 LOANS 'TROUBLING'
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued the following statement in response to a Small Business Administration (SBA) Inspector General report that did not discover abuses in the Supplemental Terrorist Activity Relief (STAR) program, which was passed by Congress in January, 2002 to provide assistance to those Americans whose lives and businesses were economically damaged by the September 11th attacks:  
   "As the Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I believe any allegations that the implementation of the SBA's STAR loan program may have been seriously flawed must be fully and exhaustively probed. That is why I asked the SBA's Inspector General to conduct an investigation to determine the facts to ensure that this does not happen again. 
   "According to the Inspector General's report, most lender files did not contain sufficient information to demonstrate that borrowers were adversely affected by the September 11th terrorist attacks and their aftermath. As a result, eligibility could not be determined for 85 percent of STAR loans reviewed. 
   "These findings are troubling. My Committee is thoroughly reviewing this report in conjunction with our own independent congressional investigation to determine what happened. If abuses did occur many questions must be answered, including how and why was this allowed to take place."
