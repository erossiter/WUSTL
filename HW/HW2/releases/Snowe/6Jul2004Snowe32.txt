SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $900,000 IN JUSTICE GRANTS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $908,483 in federal funding to various justice programs throughout Maine.  
 The grants are awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice.
   "This federal funding is critical to ensuring that state and local law enforcement authorities have the necessary resources to fully protect our communities," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Additionally, these federal awards will provide critical financial assistance to victims of crimes."
   The federal funding was allocated as follows:
   * $499,728 to the Penobscot Indian Nation for Alcohol and Substance Abuse programs. The funding will assist in developing new strategies that prevent, interdict, and treat alcohol and drug use by tribal members.
   * $232,197 to the Maine Department of Public Safety for the Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative. The nation-wide program seeks to reduce gun crime by networking existing local programs that target gun crime and providing those programs with additional resources, as coordinated by the U.S. Attorney in each of the 94 federal judicial districts.
   * $100,000 to the Maine Department of Corrections for Local Delinquency Prevent Programs. The program seeks to support delinquency prevention programs and activities for youth who are likely to have contact with the juvenile justice system through recreation, tutoring, mentoring, and leadership development.
   * $76,558 to the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point for the Children's Justice Act Partnerships for Indian Communities Grant Program. The funding will improve the investigation, prosecution and overall handling of child abuse cases.
