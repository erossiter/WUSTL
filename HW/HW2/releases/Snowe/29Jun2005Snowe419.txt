SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE OVER $200,000 IN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that Maine has been awarded $204,111 in homeland security grants by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP).  
   "In today's post 9/11 world, the threat of terrorism is a very real one," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Maine is not immune to these threats and therefore we must remain vigilant and prepared. Adequate funding provided by the federal government is the first step in a series of many that we must take to prevent possible attacks. Therefore we applaud the recent grant allocation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security." 
   This grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) under the FY 2005 Buffer Zone Protection Program (BZPP), which SLGCP administers with the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) 
   BZPP funding serves to enhance protection efforts around Critical Infrastructure and Key Resource (CI/KR) sites and deter threats or incidents of terrorism aimed at those facilities. Buffer Zone Plans (BZPs) developed through this program are intended to help local law enforcement and first responders develop effective preventive measures that make it more difficult for terrorists to plan or launch attacks from the immediate vicinity of high priority infrastructure targets. Funding from the FY 2005 BZPP is reserved for the acquisition and use of allowable materials, equipment, and resources identified in the BZP and the resulting Vulnerability Reduction Purchase Plan.
