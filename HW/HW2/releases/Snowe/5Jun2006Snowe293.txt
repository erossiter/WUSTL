SENATE PASSES COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today supported Senate passage of the Immigration Reform bill, bipartisan legislation that enhances border security and puts in place an orderly and fair guest worker program. The bill also contains provisions that would prevent new border crossing regulations from stifling travel between the U.S. and Canada and address unfair elements of current immigration law that hurt Maine businesses. The Senate passed the Immigration Reform bill by a vote of 62 to 36.  
   "There is no question that our current immigration system is broken and the status quo is not acceptable," said Snowe. "In the aftermath of 9-11, securing our porous borders has become a national imperative with an estimated 1.5 million undocumented individuals entering the country every year. The compromise this legislation represents is not perfect, but it allows the Senate to pass vital border security measures that include a doubling of the number of border agents by 2012 and the deployment of modern technology to monitor the border. At the same time, the bill strikes a balance in addressing the issue of the estimated 12 million illegal aliens and their 3 million children already in the country, while helping to ensure once and for all that we do not return to this problem of illegal immigration we are experiencing today. Additionally, many improvements can and should be made to this bill in conference." 
   "This bill also recognizes the unique concerns of states and communities along our northern border," said Snowe. "In Maine, border families and communities are understandably wary of new regulations that could restrict the travel that is part of their daily lives, and businesses in Maine have long been at a disadvantage in securing the seasonal workers who are a critical part of our tourism industry. Provisions I cosponsored to address both of these issues were included in the bill the Senate passed today." 
   Snowe joined an effort led by Senators Norm Coleman (R-MN) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to limit the burden imposed by rules currently being developed by the Department of State and Homeland Security on U.S. citizens crossing the border between the U.S. and Canada. The amendment Snowe cosponsored and that was included in the Immigration Reform bill would extend the implementation deadline from January 1, 2008 to June 1, 2009 in order to give the Secretary of Homeland Security time to ensure that new, low-cost identification documents are ready to be implemented. The fee for these documents would be limited to $34 and waived for children under age 18.
   "We must prevent terrorists and criminals from entering our country, but we should do so without inadvertently causing undue stress on border communities and their residents," said Snowe. "The bill the Senate passed today will reduce the impact of new regulations on border communities, and delay them in order to allow the Homeland Security Department more time to assess these impacts. We must respect the close relationship between the United States and Canada."
   In April of 2005, the State Department announced that Americans would need passports to re-enter the United States from Canada, Mexico, Panama and Bermuda by 2008, and that Canadians would also have to present a passport to enter the United States. Snowe was concerned about the prohibitive costs for families to purchase passports, the complications of obtaining passports for children under the age of 14 who require both parents to sign passport applications, and emergency situations that will inevitably arise. She sent a letter voicing these concerns to U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Robert C. Bonner soon after the State Department's decision was announced.
   The amendment which Snowe is cosponsoring would do the following:
   * Delay implementation by 18 months.
   * Limit the cost of passport cards to $34 for adults and free for children. 
   * Exempt groups of six or more children traveling to Canada from ID requirement. 
   * Make passport cards valid ID documents for cruises in Caribbean, Mexico, and Canada.
   * Require a pilot program to test whether citizenship information could be included in a REAL-ID driver's license.
   * Require a plan to process, on a limited basis, people who arrive at the border with inadequate documentation.
   ? Require public promotion of the program before implementation.
   To address another immigration issue crucial to Maine, Snowe, Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, continued her partnership with Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to confront an H2B visa crisis that is directly hurting small businesses around the country, particularly in states with seasonally dependent economies. Snowe cosponsored an amendment offered by Mikulski that is designed to be a short-term solution to the H2B visa shortage. The amendment would not raise the cap on workers under the H2B program, but it would exempt returning workers that have previously worked legally with an H2B visa and create a more fair geographic allocation of visas. This is vital to Maine which relies on workers later in the fiscal year than employers in southern states.
   "Businesses throughout Maine must be able to hire the workers they so desperately need if our seasonally-dependent economy is to accommodate the thousands of visitors that come to our state each year," said Snowe. "The current system works to the detriment of Maine businesses, often preventing them from hiring the workers they need, when they need them." 
   Last year, the cap for Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 was reached in March, 2004, severely impacting year-round American jobs and small business owners whose livelihoods depend on a successful summer season. This year the cap for FY 2005 was reached in January. Snowe cosponsored the "Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act" by Senators Mikulski and Judd Gregg (R-NH). The legislation that passed the Senate today mirrors this legislation. 
   In Maine, approximately 87,000 jobs are directly tied to the success of tourism, which generates $13.9 billion for Maine's economy and $556 million in state tax revenue. The H2B visa program allows businesses with seasonal needs to hire foreign workers to supplement their permanent and seasonal US workforce. These H2B workers fulfill a variety of short-term seasonal needs for employers when there are not enough US workers available. H2B employers need workers who are landscapers, lifeguards, seafood processors, ski instructors, horse trainers, resort workers, and carnival workers.
