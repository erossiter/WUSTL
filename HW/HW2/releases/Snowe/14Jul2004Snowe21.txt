SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN 'CITIZENSHIP: WASHINGTON FOCUS 2004' PROGRAM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with Maine students partaking in the 2004 "Citizenship: Washington Focus" program this week.  
 Accompanied by chaperones Ray Corey of Farmington and Darlene Nelson of New Sharon, the group of 18 students from various high schools across Maine discussed their questions about the U.S. government and the democratic process.
   "I enjoyed meeting with the diverse group of Maine students today who have taken an active role in understanding our nation's democratic process by visiting Washington. They articulated their thoughtful views and concerns - particularly with respect to politics, government and international affairs - with mature conviction, serving as a reminder that our younger generations are ready, willing, and able to assume their rightful role as tomorrow's leaders," Snowe stated.
   "Citizenship: Washington Focus" is a 4-H leadership program for high school youth. The program is aimed at enriching young people's lives by broadening their appreciation and respect for themselves and others in the world. Participants attend workshops, committees, field trips and social events, giving them hands-on opportunities to learn and grow.
