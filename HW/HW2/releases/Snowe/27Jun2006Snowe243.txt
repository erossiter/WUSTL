SEN. SNOWE PRAISES CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and the Coast Guard, lauded congressional passage today of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2006. Snowe emphasized the bill's support of the Deepwater Program, the Coast Guard's recapitalization program, to increase the number of ships and aircraft the Coast Guard has at its disposal to carry out its missions. Snowe was a member of the House-Senate conference committee which reconciled the House and Senate's versions of the bills. The legislation now awaits the President's signature.
   The Conference Report authorizes $8.7 billion for Fiscal Year 2006. The authorization bill allow the Coast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions such as search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection, as well as fund the necessary missions related to ports, waterways, and coastal security. 
   "With this Conference Report, the Congress has acted to shore up the Coast Guard at a time when it has been stretched too thin to meet its various responsibilities," said Snowe. "The Coast Guard has the unenviable job of performing its traditional search and rescue and fisheries enforcement missions, while also protecting our nation's borders from terrorist infiltration - all with an aging and undersized fleet. I believe that this conference report has included essential funding that the Coast Guard has so desperately needed for too long."
   The final version of the Coast Guard authorization bill contains compromise language on the controversial Cape Wind offshore wind energy project. The Cape Wind project is a proposed wind farm that would be built off the coast of Cape Cod. The provision that was initially included in the Conference report would have given the Governor of Massachusetts final veto authority over any off-shore wind farms. Senator Snowe opposed that provision. The agreement reached would give the Coast Guard the ability to evaluate whether an off-shore wind farm poses a threat to safe navigation.
   "The Coast Guard authorization bill was delayed for too long by the concerns and reluctance of one State's Governor over the construction of an off-shore wind farm that should never have been included in the bill in the first place," Snowe said. "The resolution reached last week in the Senate was reasonable and essential. The authorization of the Coast Guard's budget is far too important to be delayed by individual interests."
   The Conference Report includes numerous measures that would allow the Coast Guard to enforce provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, an essential element in securing the nation's ports, waterways, and transportation networks. Additionally, it would address maritime safety issues by allowing the Coast Guard to continue training both the commercial fishing industry and the recreational boating public in issues regarding safety at sea.
   As a reflection of its support of the Coast Guard recapitalizing its fleet of cutters and aircraft, the Conference Report authorizes $1.3 billion for the Coast Guard's Deepwater Program. Snowe has long fought to accelerate the Deepwater Program and is pleased that this funding has been included.
   "It is beyond question that the Deepwater Program is an essential component of allowing the Coast Guard to protect our borders. I am pleased that we included this funding and vow to continue the fight to ensure that the Coast Guard is able to protect our nation," said Snowe.
   In response to the final report of the United States Commission on Ocean Policy, the Conference Report includes provisions that would allow the Coast Guard to work with other federal, state, and local agencies in developing plans to assist vessels in distress, thus eliminating the potential for loss of life and environmental damage. It also directs the Coast Guard to develop steps that will allow it to better detect and interdict foreign vessels that are violating fishing regulations.
   The Conference Report also includes the following highlights:
   * Authorizes a supplemental $300 million for Coast Guard operations and maintenance associated with Katrina, as well as for the increased costs of fuel.
   * Authorizes a supplemental $200 million for capital improvements for Coast Guard facilities in Fiscal Year 2006, including air and vessel assets, and for equipment that needs to be replaced, including aids to navigation to ensure safe transits through shipping lanes.
   * Officially commends the Coast Guard for its exemplary response to Hurricane Katrina and calls for the Coast Guard to play a major role in any future national emergency or natural disaster.
   * Authorizes the Coast Guard to use its maritime safety and security teams for missions other than security missions, such as response to natural disasters like Katrina.
   * Extends the use of annual leave for Coast Guard members involved in the response effort to Hurricane Katrina.
   * Requires the Coast Guard to report to Congress on Katrina's impact on Coast Guard operations and facilities and on navigable waterways, facilities located in such waterways, and on the environment.
   * Raises the liability limits for responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act.
   * Grandfathers Maine Fishing tenders which transport lobsters within the State of Maine, if they are foreign built. In the future all vessels will have to be U.S. made to comply with the Jones act. This will allow foreign boats to continue to operate so the important service they provide will not be interrupted, but will make sure that in the future U.S. vessels are used.
