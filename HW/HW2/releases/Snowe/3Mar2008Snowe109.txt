MAINE SET TO LOSE $36 MILLION IN MEDICAID FUNDING FOR FY-2009
  The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee found today that the cost of implementing the Bush Administration's new Medicaid regulations would be $36 million for the state of Maine. Across the country, the estimated cost to states would be $50 million over five years. This total is significantly higher than the Administration's estimate of $15 billion over five years. 
   "At a time when or economy is slowing, jobs are leaving and states, including Maine, are facing significant budget deficits, this is not the time for the Administration to be cutting Medicaid," said Senator Snowe, a senior member of the Finance Committee. "At the end of the day, I am hopeful that the President - as a former Governor - can appreciate the enormous challenge these rules pose to the states and will not stand in the way of any attempt to delay their implementation."
