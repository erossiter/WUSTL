SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES OUTSTANDING MAINE EDUCATORS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met recently with Steven DeAngelis, a physics teacher at Maranacook Community High School in Readfield and Meghan Southworth, a math teacher at Troy A. Howard Middle School in Belfast. Both received the 2005 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching- the highest honor for teaching in these fields. The two teachers are among only 100 7th-12th grade teachers nationwide who received the celebrated award.  
   "I would like to extend my congratulations to Steve and Meghan for receiving this prestigious honor," said Snowe. "It was a joy to meet with both of them and discuss the incredible work they have been doing in the field of math and science education. Steve and Meghan are outstanding teachers who are truly making a difference in the lives of young people in Maine." 
   Established by Congress in 1983, the annual presidential awards program identifies highly qualified mathematics and science teachers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Territories, and the U.S. Department of Defense Schools. This year's recipients, who were recommended for the award by a panel of leading mathematicians, scientists, and educators, are 7th-12th grade teachers. 
   The program is designed to recognize and reward outstanding teachers who serve as role models for their colleagues while encouraging talented individuals to enter and remain in the teaching field. Each Awardee receives a $10,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the independent federal agency that administers the awards program on behalf of the White House, and an all-expenses paid trip to Washington, D.C. for a week of celebratory events and professional development activities.
