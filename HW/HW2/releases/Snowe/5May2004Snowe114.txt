SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with representatives from the Maine Hospital Association in her Washington office.  
 Discussing issues pressing to Maine's health care service providers, Sen. Snowe highlighted her health care priorities for the remaining legislative calendar. Specifically, Sen. Snowe detailed growing momentum to passing her recently introduced bipartisan prescription drug reimportation legislation, which would allow access to safe, affordable drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries. Sen. Snowe also discussed her efforts to combat the uninsured epidemic - affecting 43 million Americans. Sen. Snowe is a member on the "Senate Task Force on the Uninsured". 
   "The critical role that local hospitals and community centers play in providing quality, comprehensive health care to our citizens cannot be understated. I continue to work with the Maine Hospital Association and health professionals throughout the state to further provide affordable medical services while expanding access to those vital services for all Mainers," said Snowe.
