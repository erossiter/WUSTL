SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $2 MILLION FOR WETLAND CONSERVATION
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) on Thursday, March 15, announced that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant program has awarded $1.8 million to two projects in Maine.  
   "This funding will greatly benefit the restoration of miles of Maine's beautiful wetlands," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The funding is allocated as follows: 
   * $803,200 will be awarded to the Holt Forest area near the Lower Kennebec River. The federal grant funding will be used to acquire a conservation easement on a 320 acre parcel on the Back River in Arrowsic. 
   * $1 million will be awarded to the Penobscot River Restoration Trust. The grant will provide additional support for an ambitious large-scale river restoration plan to reestablish an estimated 1,000 miles of riverine wetland habitat for sea-run fish. 
   The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant aims to provide funding to coastal states to acquire, manage, restore, and manage coastal wetlands. Since its inception in 1990, the program has awarded over $32 million targeted at over 40,000 acres of threatened wetlands.
