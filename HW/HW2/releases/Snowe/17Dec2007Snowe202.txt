MAINE SPECIALTY CROPS BENEFIT FROM SENATE PASSED FARM BILL
  For the first time, specialty crops like blueberries and potatoes have been given legitimate consideration in a Farm Bill passed by the United States Senate last Friday. The $286 billion measure added substantial investments to a sector of agriculture that is vital to Maine specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables.  
   "Despite accounting for nearly 50% of all agricultural production in the U.S., specialty crops had never been given this kind of status in a Farm Bill," Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) said. "When you consider that Maine's agricultural production is composed almost entirely of specialty crops, giving them this overdue designation is a tremendous boost for the state." 
   Not only are block grants authorized for specialty crop growers, but an expansion of organic farming (popular in Maine) and the Seniors Farmers Market Program - which provides fresh produce directly from the producer to local seniors, and has been incredibly successful in Maine - are beneficiaries of this section of the bill as well. In total, $2.1 billion has been set aside for specialty crop-focused block grants, research grants, and pest/disease management.
