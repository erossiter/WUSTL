Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement marking the 65th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor .  
 "As American troops fight around the world in the global war on terrorism, we are poignantly reminded of the shocking and devastating attack on our fleet in Pearl Harbor . News of the destruction at Pearl Harbor stunned the entire nation, and with the realization that 2,341 Americans had lost their lives came the understanding that America had been changed forever. 
 "Though the American people mourned for those men and women whose lives were lost, it was evident that the spirit of this mighty nation was far from broken. The Millions of Americans who comprised what has become known as the "Greatest Generation," answered our country's call to duty, and proudly defended our lasting commitment to freedom. To them, and to the brave men and women who came before them and followed in their footsteps, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid. To those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor , we now and forever shall cherish and revere their memory. 
 "We must always remember the sacrifices made in defense of the United States of America , and the courage that was summoned to ensure the blessing of liberty.".
