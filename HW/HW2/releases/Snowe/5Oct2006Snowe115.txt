SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $100,665 IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration has awarded $100,665 in funding to the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education (DEI) in Beals. The funding will be used to support the establishment of two demonstration soft-shell clam farms to address the severe impact of red tides on Maine's soft-shell calm industry.  
   "Investments from the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration provide substantial opportunities for rural Maine communities to boost economic growth," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This funding will help Maine's soft-shell clam industry by promoting research and education on the impact of red tides." 
   U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration investments are focused on locally-developed, regionally-based economic development initiatives that achieve the highest return on the taxpayers' investment and that directly contribute to economic growth.
