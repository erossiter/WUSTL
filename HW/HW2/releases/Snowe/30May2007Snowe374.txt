SENATE REAUTHORIZES CRITICAL COMMUNITY GRANT PROGRAM
  More than $1 billion will be set aside annually for the next five years for local and state law enforcement personnel in legislation that passed the Senate Thursday afternoon. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) co-sponsored the legislation reauthorizing the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program though 2012 that provided Maine communities with grants totaling more than $1.7 million this year alone.  
   "Those who work tirelessly to prevent crime in our communities should have the strong support of the federal government," said Senator Snowe. "It is absolutely vital that we fund crime enforcement activities and do everything we can to make our communities safer. I have long supported the JAG program since it allows recipient counties, cities, and towns to be more effective at preventing and controlling crime and therefore increases their ability to keep communities across the nation safe." 
   The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program allows states, tribes, and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. Grant funds can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice for any one or more of the following purpose areas:1) law enforcement programs; 2) prosecution and court programs; 3) prevention and education programs; 4) corrections and community corrections programs; 5) drug treatment programs; and 6) planning, evaluation, and technology programs. 
   The U.S. Department of Justice administers the program sending 60 percent of the funds to state agencies and the remaining 40 percent to local governments. Maine communities received JAG grants totaling $1,172,583 in 2006 and another $1,716.012 in 2007.
