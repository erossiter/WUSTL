  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that the Micmac Service Unit in Presque Isle will receive an $81,792 grant from the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service program as part of the Tribal Demonstration Projects for Diabetes Health Services program. This grant will be used for the prevention and treatment of diabetes for American Indian and Alaskan Native communities in northern Maine. 
   "By receiving this generous funding, the Micmac Service Unit will continue serving the healthcare needs of the American Indian community in Presque Isle," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Diabetes affects millions across the country and studies have shown that American Indians are at a greater risk of having type two diabetes. Each and every American deserves quality diabetes care and informative prevention programs and the Indian Health Service program ensures that these unique and cherished communities receive no less."
