SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF AMT PATCH
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today applauded Congress' passage of alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief, which according to Treasury Department data, will protect 21 million taxpayers from an average, unexpected tax increase of $2,000 for tax year 2007. Without enactment of this legislation, the AMT would have affected an estimated 85,000 Mainers, an increase of more than 550 percent from the previous year.  
   "While not a permanent solution to the AMT problem, this legislation is critical to shield 21 million taxpayers from this stealth tax come April 15th," said Senator Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee. "While overdue, Congress' action to approve AMT relief will ensure that middle-class families will not face a significant tax increase at a time when they are working each and every day to make mortgage payments, put food on the table, and clothe their children. Today's vote is a quantifiable victory for America's taxpayers."
  Enacted in 1969, the AMT was designed to ensure that a small group of high-income individuals would pay a minimum amount of tax. Under the AMT, individuals pay the greater of tax calculated under the AMT and under the traditional income tax system. Because AMT exemption amounts were never permanently indexed for inflation, the levy is expected to grow from 4 million taxpayers in 2006 to ensnaring 25 million taxpayers in 2007.
