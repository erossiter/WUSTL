SEN. SNOWE COMMEMORATES SIXTH ANNIVERSARY
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement on the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001:  
   "Today, we pause to remember those who perished in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and we are mindful of those families and loved ones whose lives have been irreparably changed by the tragic events of six years ago. They are on this date, most especially, in our thoughts and our prayers. We reflect on an atrocity which befell not only our nation, but also on those from our state of Maine whose loss remains heavy on our hearts. 
   "We are also reminded of the resurgent spirit of the American people which is characterized by unfailing courage, profound sacrifice, and tireless resolve and exemplified for all time by the heroism and bravery of firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, and our servicemen and women in uniform. The example of seemingly ordinary Americans performing extraordinary deeds in the service of others is etched forever in our memories as we honor their tremendous legacy across this great country and in our nation's capital. On this anniversary, we memorialize the bedrock principles of our people and the unsurpassed character of our country which time and again have sustained us in moments of enormous peril and challenged us to persevere, endure, and ultimately unite shoulder to shoulder as Americans."
