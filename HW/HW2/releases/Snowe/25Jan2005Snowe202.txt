  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said today that she is pleased that the Senate confirmed Carlos Gutierrez to serve as Secretary of Commerce.  
 The Senate confirmed Mr. Gutierrez by voice vote today. 
   "Carlos Gutierrez is an exemplary example of a person who has lived the American dream. As a corporate leader, he proved himself as a skilled and innovative executive who understands what it takes to create jobs and build a business," said Snowe. "I'm pleased that the Senate voted to confirm Mr. Gutierrez, especially at a time of monumental challenges for our economy, including unfair trade practices and currency manipulation that have deepened our nation's $535 billion, record-high trade deficit, threatening U.S. manufacturing jobs. I know with Mr. Gutierrez at the helm of the Department of Commerce, our nation will be well prepared to meet the myriad challenges before it. I congratulate Mr. Gutierrez and look forward to working with him." 
   As a member of the Commerce Committee, Snowe voted to confirm Mr. Gutierrez.
