SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS URGE MAINERS TO REPORT PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM PATRIOTS' DAY STORM
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today urged Mainers to immediately report property damage incurred from the patriots' day storm to local and state emergency management officials to help the Small Business Administration (SBA) begin its disaster assessment of thirteen Maine counties. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins welcomed President Bush's announcement yesterday that six Maine counties would receive public disaster assistance, but reinforce their commitment to helping Mainers become eligible for SBA disaster funds.  
   "While the President's disaster declaration for six Maine counties is a step in the right direction, it is critical that residents report property damage in order to expand this declaration and open up Small Business Administration funding for individual assistance," said the Senators in a joint statement. "Our state is known for its resiliency in times of crisis, however it is crucial that our home and business owners report damage immediately so the rebuilding and repair process can begin." 
   Emergency Management Officials will compile damage assessments in order to share the information with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA). These assessments are needed in order to expand the current FEMA declaration and to enable the SBA to issue an agency disaster declaration, which will include critical assistance for individuals and small businesses. 
   Once the disaster is declared businesses, homeowners, renters and non-profits are eligible to apply for long term low interest loans provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The US SBA, the Nation's bank in times of disaster, provides long-term low interest loans to homeowners and renters to repair or replace their disaster damaged real estate or personal property. The agency also underwrites loans to businesses of any size, as well as nonprofit organizations for repair or replacement to disaster-damaged property. Businesses are also eligible for loans to cover expenses incurred during the time the businesses was unable to operate and lost revenues due to the storm. 
   In addition to reporting losses to their town or county emergency management office, businesses should call their insurance company, contact their lender, take pictures, and keep receipts of all expenditures.
