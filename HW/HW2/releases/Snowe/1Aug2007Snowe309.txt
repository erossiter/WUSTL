SEN. SNOWE URGES REAUTHORIZATION OF STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) took to the Senate floor tonight to urge her colleagues to reauthorize the federal program that provides health insurance coverage to more than 6 million children across America including more than 14,000 in Maine. Set to expire in September, the legislation before the Senate would reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program for an additional five years and would invest $35 billion to cover 3.2 million children currently not covered by the program. 
   "Time and again we talk about the value of setting partisan politics aside and working together to produce solutions for the problems confronting the American people," Senator Snowe said in her floor speech. "If there was ever a time to turn our words into action, that time is now. The legislation facing us now, while neither perfect nor ideal, represents a strong consensus and response to a growing epidemic in our nation today which is a lack of health insurance among working Americans of limited means.  
   "The anguish of those who work hard to make ends meet, yet still cannot afford to pay for health coverage for their children is truly devastating. Parents without access to affordable health insurance for their children live with constant anxiety. They face decisions no parent should ever want to confront. That is why this SCHIP program has been such a saving grace for so many families. It has been the one remarkable program which has led to a substantial reduction in the number of uninsured." 
   The compromise bill contains a number of priorities included in S.1224, the "Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act," legislation Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Senator Snowe introduced in April. 
   These provisions include: 
   * Increasing income eligibility to families at 300 percent of poverty. This represents the right policy because it creates a broader safety-net that offers assistance to a greater number of families. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, fewer than half (47 percent) of parents in families earning less than $40,000 a year are offered health insurance through their employer-a 9 percent drop since 1997. 
   * Allowing states the option to cover pregnant women. While states can currently pursue a state plan amendment to offer pre-natal, labor, and delivery services, postpartum care is not reimbursable. Studies show that women who do not receive postpartum care are at a greater risk for a variety of health complications that make it difficult for a mother to properly care for her infant. In June, Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, Senator Lugar and Senator Bingaman and 15 additional Senators sent a letter to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley asking for inclusion of this policy. 
   * Expanding health quality reporting. The bill contains a new quality initiative within the Department of Health and Human Services charged with developing and implementing quality measures and improving state reporting of quality data. In addition, the bill includes the Lincoln/Snowe amendment on quality reporting on reducing the number of children born pre-maturely 
   * Combating childhood obesity. The bill includes a Snowe amendment authorizing a $25 million demonstration project and instituting measures to fight childhood obesity. Over 15 percent of children in our country are obese. This has dire consequences for their long-term health and will put a strain on health care resources in the future. 
   SCHIP will expire on September 30th. The CBO predicts that nearly one million S-CHIP-covered children will become uninsured over the next five years without additional funds above baseline.
