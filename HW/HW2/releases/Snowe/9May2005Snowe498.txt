SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES BRIGADIER GENERAL LIBBY
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today congratulated Brigadier General John Libby for earning the two-star major general rank.  
 Libby, Maine's top-ranked military officer, oversees two-thousand soldiers in the Maine Army National Guard and eleven-hundred in the Maine Air National Guard. Brigadier General Libby also serves as Maine's Commissioner of the Department of Defense, Veterans, and Emergency Management. 
   "I can think of no one more deserving of a two-star rank as General Libby," said Snowe. "His advancement as a result of service to our State and our Nation is a reflection of his loyalty, dedication and outstanding qualifications. I offer my deepest congratulations and appreciation to General Libby and wish him the best of luck." 
   Brigadier General John Libby served as a one-star general since 1996 with Congress recently approving his advancement to become a two-star general. He will receive his second star at a ceremony tomorrow at the State House Hall of Flags in Augusta.
