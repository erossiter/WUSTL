SEN. SNOWE PROVISIONS TO INCREASE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS INCLUDED IN BUSH SIGNED ENERGY BILL
  President Bush today signed into law an energy bill that will increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAF?) standards for the fist time since 1975. Under the provisions authored by U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), all cars, trucks and SUVs would have to reach a CAF? standard average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020.  
   The basis for the final language was the "10-in-10" legislation authored by Senator Snowe, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, who worked to get the bill out of the committee earlier in the year. "For more than six years, I have been working with members of both parties to try and take the first steps that can lead us to energy independence," Senator Snowe said. "This may well be the single most significant step the United States has taken toward limiting our dependence on foreign oil and better protecting our environment."
   The Energy Bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly last week with broad bi-partisan support. Senator Snowe, the Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, played a key role in negotiating an agreement to include a Small Business Energy Efficiency Title in the energy bill signed by the President today. The "Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007" (S. 1657), which she introduced with Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) in June, would create a priority under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program for energy efficiency proposals, and make SBA loans available to energy efficiency projects.
  "I firmly believe that small businesses have a pivotal role to play in finding a solution to global climate change," Senator Snowe added. "These provisions will not only help protect the environment, but will also significantly lower the energy costs for cash-strapped small businesses."
