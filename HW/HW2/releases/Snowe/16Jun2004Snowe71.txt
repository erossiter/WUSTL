SEN. SNOWE HONORED WITH DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD FOR EFFORTS TO FEED CHILDREN, LOW-INCOME FAMILIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was honored this week by the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) with its Distinguished Service Award in recognition of her ongoing efforts to help children and low-income families fight hunger. 
   "This award is a special honor coming from the Food Research and Action Center, an organization that has been a leader in a many-fronted campaign against hunger. I am proud to have worked with FRAC to give children and low-income families every opportunity we can to ensure those families have the resources they need to put food on the table. I look forward to working with FRAC in the future in their unrelenting battle against hunger," read a statement from Snowe at the ceremony.
   This year, Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, authored an amendment to add $6 billion in new childcare funding to the Welfare Reauthorization bill. Snowe's amendment passed overwhelmingly, though the Welfare bill failed to pass the Senate.
   Additionally, Snowe spearheaded the fight in the Senate to make the child tax credit refundable for lower income families. "Accessible, quality childcare is a key ingredient in the effort to move families from public assistance to financial independence - and that is the very same path from hunger to food security. With new tax relief, these families with children will be better able to afford nutritious meals. I believe that is a cause worth fighting for," Snowe said.
   Since 1970, FRAC has been a leading non-profit foundation dedicated to improving public policy to eradicate hunger and under-nutrition in the U.S. U.S. Congressman George Miller (D-CA) was also recognized at the ceremony.
