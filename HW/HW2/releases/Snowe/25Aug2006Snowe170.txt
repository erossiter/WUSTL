  In response to President Bush's meeting with the families of five soldiers killed during military action in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement:  
   "I am grateful the President was able to meet with the loved ones of some of Maine 's fallen heroes today. He believes, as I do, that it is the responsibility of every American to honor the memory of soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of their country, and mourn their loss with their family and friends. I have had the honor of visiting with the loved ones of many of Maine 's sons and daughters killed in action since 2001. Their courage, and the courage of Maine 's soldiers who have fought bravely in the service of the United States , is an inspiration to us all," Senator Snowe said. 
   In a June 16th letter to the President, Senator Snowe requested he contact the widows and families of Maine soldiers killed in action.
