  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that Somerset County will receive $112,500 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Emergency Conservation Program.  
 This funding is provided to assist farmers in Somerset County with damages incurred from flooding.
   "Agriculture is a vital part of Maine's heritage and an important part of our economy," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "These USDA funds will help farmers in Somerset recover from damage caused by flooding, and will allow them to continue producing valuable crops."
