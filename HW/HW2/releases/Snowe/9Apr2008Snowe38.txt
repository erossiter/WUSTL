SEN. SNOWE RESPONDS TO FEMA EMERGENCY DECLARATION REJECTION
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement in response to FEMA's denial of a request made by Governor Baldacci on March 28th to declare an emergency declaration for the State of Maine for major snowfall in March: 
   "As Aroostook County remains ravaged by this winter, I am disappointed with FEMA's decision not to support Maine's request for disaster assistance. The record snowfall throughout the week of March 19-22 has had disastrous effects on the infrastructure of Aroostook County and the historic proportions of this winter certainly warrant supplementary federal assistance to facilitate an economy on the brink of a catastrophe. As this brutal winter storm devastated northern Maine, roofs collapsed under heavy snow, roads were blanketed in black ice, and many homes were swallowed by massive drifts. Without this critical assistance, the communities of Aroostook County must bear the brunt of repairing these damaged roads, homes, and public buildings.
   Senator Snowe wrote a letter to President Bush supporting the State of Maine's request on April 3rd and will work with the Governor Baldacci if the State seeks an appeal with additional data in support of the request.
