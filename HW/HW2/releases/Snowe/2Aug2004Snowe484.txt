SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $6 MILLION FOR NEW VETERANS HOME IN MACHIAS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $6,169,090 in federal funding for the construction of a new 30-bed care facility at Machias - Maine's sixth State Veterans Home.  
 The federal grant is awarded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
   "Fulfilling our nation's commitment to its veterans, we are pleased that the VA has invested federal resources for this additional home in Machias, the sixth in Maine. Giving back to those men and women who have selflessly served this country at home and abroad is our nation's continuing duty," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement.
   The federal award represents 65 percent of the anticipated cost of installation of the veterans home. Machias will be the sixth veterans home, adding to the existing facilities in Augusta, Bangor, Caribou, Scarborough and South Paris.
