SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $69,000 IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program has awarded a $69,000 grant to the MaineStream Finance Company, which works to promote community development for the low-income populations in the State of Maine. The grant will be used to fund educational programs for homebuyers and post-purchase counseling services in the Knox, Penobscot, Piscataquis, and Waldo Counties. 
  "The USDA Rural Development program helps Maine communities improve essential services and boost economic growth," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This funding will benefit Maine residents by enhancing rural programs and increasing public safety throughout the state." 
  The USDA Rural Development program provides financial loans and grants to help improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America. The funds are used for community programs, which seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
