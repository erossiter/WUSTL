SEN. SNOWE SIGNS ONTO SENATE RESOLUTION HONORING GOLD STAR MOTHERS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today cosponsored a Senate Joint Resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Gold Star Mothers Day.  
 The membership of Gold Star Mothers, Inc. is composed of mothers who lost a son or daughter while in service to our country. This year, Gold Star Mothers day falls on September 25th. 
   "The mothers whose children have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country deserve the recognition and support commensurate with the magnitude of their service. That is why I am cosponsoring this resolution honoring Gold Star Mothers Day. I urge everyone to take the time to pay their respects on September 25th to these mothers who have lost a child in combat," said Snowe. 
   The American Gold Star Mothers is a federally-chartered organization and a member of the National Veterans Affairs Voluntary Service Advisory Committee. The 150 chapters of Gold Star Mothers throughout the United States give many hours of work and personal service in hospitals for the veterans, and to the veterans and their families.
