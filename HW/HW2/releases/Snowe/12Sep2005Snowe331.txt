CONGRESS PASSES $51.8 BILLION EMERGENCY HURRICANE RELIEF BILL
  Today, both Houses of the U.S. Congress passed $51.8 billion in emergency hurricane relief funding today for the continuing relief efforts for the entire affected Gulf Region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today said that this congressional action must not stop with this second emergency funding bill and vowed her continued work to support the efforts to rebuild and restore the entire region in concert with her colleagues in Congress. 
   "Today by passing a $51.8 billion emergency hurricane relief bill, the people of the Gulf will continue to have the resources they need to recover from Hurricane Katrina - our nation's single greatest natural disaster. We will not stop here. As Majority Leader Frist has said, we will continue to take a comprehensive approach to rebuild the entire region," said Snowe. "It will require the full resources of the United States to bring order and prosperity to the affected areas, and the Senate must take the lead in providing whatever assistance is necessary." 
   This legislation contains $50 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), $1.4 billion for the Department of Defense, and $400 million for the Army Corps of Engineers.
