SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE RURAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE GRANT
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Community Development Initiative has approved a grant of $174,000 to the Down East Resource Conservation and Development Council, Inc. in Cherryfield. 
   "The USDA Rural Development program continues to provide remarkable opportunities for Maine's communities," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This grant will help build a partnership with our state's youth so that we can invest in the people who will ultimately be trusted with the future of our state."
   The Rural Development funds will be used to develop an integrated countrywide Youth Leadership Program to preserve and enhance an authentic and distinctive sense of place to support and empower individuals and community. Rural Development achieves its mission by helping rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Rural Development works to make sure that rural citizens can participate fully in the global economy.
