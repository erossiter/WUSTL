SEN. SNOWE SIGNS ON TO LETTER REQUESTING INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED RAPE CASE IN IRAQ
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe signed onto a letter today expressing strong concern regarding the alleged rape of Jamie Leigh Jones by U.S. contractors in Iraq and the reported failure of the US government to investigate the situation. The letter is being circulated by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA).  
   "The account provided by Ms. Jones is shocking and disturbing. Her case deserves a full and complete investigation by the agencies involved. If there is evidence of wrongdoing, then anyone involved should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
   Text of the letter sent to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Attorney General Michael Mukasey:
   Dear Madam Secretary, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Attorney General:
   I am writing to express my strong concern about the alleged rape of Jamie Leigh Jones by U.S. contractors in Iraq and the reported failure of the US government to investigate the situation. 
   As you know, recent media reports indicate that Ms. Jones, an American working for Kellogg, Brown and Root in Iraq, was drugged, gang raped, held against her will and then denied food and water. Moreover, after she sought help, important evidence was lost. Incredibly, it has been nearly two years since Ms. Jones alleged that she was brutally raped, and new reports indicate that the U.S. government has not properly investigated this matter. 
   I urge you to conduct an appropriate investigation into the claims of Ms. Jones promptly. If your agencies have started investigations I hope you will provide an update on the case and decide the proper course of action without delay.
