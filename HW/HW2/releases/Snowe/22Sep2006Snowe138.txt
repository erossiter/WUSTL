SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM NATIONAL YOUNG LEADERS CONFERENCE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with high school students participating in the National Young Leaders Conference in Washington, DC. Andrea Ouellette of Scarborough, Mary Ridley of Portland, and Rendon Sabina of Newcastle participated in the six-day program.  
   "I was honored to meet Andrea, Mary, and Rendon during their stay in the Nation's Capital," said Senator Snowe. "I always enjoy meeting students who take pride and pleasure in learning about public policy outside of a classroom setting." 
   The National Young Leaders Conference is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council. Students spend the week meeting with members of Congress, participating in interactive activities, and debating current issues. The program is designed to educate and inspire future leaders who desire an opportunity to learn outside of the classroom.
