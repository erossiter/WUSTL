SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON BUDGET'S IMPACT ON VETERANS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today commented on the impact of President Bush's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 budget on veterans' health care. The President's budget proposes offsetting some of the increase in the VA's budget by instituting new enrollment fees and increasing co-payments for some veterans. The budget also contains a 2.6 percent cost of living adjustment effective January 1, 2007 to recipients of disability compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, and clothing allowance.  
   "When so many of our brave servicemen and women are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the VA's most critical priority is addressing the immediate and pressing needs of our veterans," said Snowe. "While I am pleased that the President's budget increased funding for the VA to cope with a rising number of veterans in need of medical care, I remain adamantly opposed to allowing this additional fiscal strain to be borne by those who have served. We should never compromise our commitment to those who have given so much to our country, and I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to provide a level of funding for Veterans health care that reflects our gratitude and meets veterans' needs." 
   The 2007 budget for Veteran's Affairs provides $80.6 billion, including $2.8 billion in estimated collections, a portion of which would come from new proposed user fee increases imposed on some veterans (priority level 7 and 8). The first user fee proposal would establish an annual enrollment fee of $250, and the second would increase pharmacy co-payments from $8 to $15 for a 30-day supply of drugs. Senator Snowe has long opposed such user fees, and Congress has defeated similar proposals in the past.
