SEN. SNOWE LEADS DISCUSSIONS WITH PENTAGON ON ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT RESERVE CENTER AT BRUNSWICK
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) this morning called Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Mr. Thomas Hall, regarding the establishment of a Joint Reserve Center at Brunswick Naval Air Station (BNAS).Sen. Snowe express her support of the Center that has been proposed by General John Libby, the State's Adjutant General.  
   "This morning, I spoke with Assistant Secretary of Defense Thomas Hall to discuss establishing a Joint Reserve Center at BNAS. I believe that a Reserve Center at Brunswick would not only be good for the facility and the surrounding community, but for the safety and protection of the region and, indeed, the nation. A joint reserve center at Brunswick Naval Air Station will ensure that reserve units from the different branches of the military have the flexibility to come together for improved coordination and training that is so necessary in this post 9-11 world," said Snowe. 
   "The genesis of this Center is General Libby's - and I believe it demonstrates the irreplaceable current and future role of BNAS. I believe Secretary Hall was receptive to the idea and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future," said Snowe. 
   During this morning's call, Snowe and Hall discussed the unique strategic location and capabilities offered by BNAS. Brunswick NAS has played a role in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, both as a home to deployed squadrons as well as host to outbound and inbound aircraft and personnel; acts as the premier site for maritime patrol training and operations; and supports NATO, the Naval Reserve and nearby Naval activities, such as SUPSHIPS Bath and Bath Iron Works. 
   Next week, Secretary Hall's staff will brief Maine's congressional delegation staff on the Joint Reserve Centers.
