SEN. SNOWE SPEAKS WITH BRAC COMMISSION CHAIRMAN, COMMISIONER
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) has spoken with BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi and BRAC Commissioner Samuel Skinner.  
 Snowe explained that the case will be made that the Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD) reached their recommendations to close Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, realign Brunswick Naval Air Station and close the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center in Limestone by deviating substantially from the force structure plan and the BRAC selection criteria provided in accordance with the 2005 BRAC legislation, which DoD is bound by law to follow. Snowe also expressed her willingness to work with the commissioners and their staffs to educate them on how DoD strayed from the BRAC guidelines. 
   "I made it clear to Chairman Principi and Commissioner Skinner that the Navy and the DoD produced flawed BRAC recommendations, and we will prove our case to them beyond a shadow of a doubt," said Snowe. "The Maine delegation and community groups will work diligently to highlight both the shortcomings in the Department's analysis and methodology and the specific instances where the DoD failed to follow the BRAC criteria. We will fight these decisions on the basis of the facts and the law - and I believe we have both on our side."
