CONGRESS APPROVES SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS REQUEST FOR RED TIDE FUNDING
  Today, Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan M. Collins (R-Maine) announced $5 million to assist New England shell fishermen who were affected by last year's red tide outbreak.  
   "The inclusion of $5 million in the emergency spending bill will help New England's fishing and coastal communities recover from last year's devastating red tide outbreak," said Snowe. "Anyone who visited Maine last summer saw first hand the effect it had on the state and region's economy. This funding will bring critical relief to impacted businesses and families across Maine and New England."
   Senator Collins said "I am pleased that we are able to provide this assistance to shell fishermen in Maine, and the rest of New England, who were severely impacted by last summer's outbreak of red tide which hit at the peak of their season. This devastating outbreak closed shell fishing grounds for several weeks causing severe financial hardship for fishermen who were unable to work."
   The red tide assistance is included in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental spending bill. 
   On March 27, 2006, Senators Snowe, Collins, Kennedy, and Kerry wrote Chairman Richard Shelby and Senator Barbara Mikulski of the Appropriations subcommittee which has responsibility for funding the National Marine Fisheries Service to ask that they include funding in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental spending bill to assist shell fishermen who experienced economic losses as a result of the 2005 red tide outbreak in New England.
