ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL VOWS STATES WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION COSTS
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) spoke with Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt regarding reimbursing Maine and other states for the millions of dollars they have spent on prescriptions for low-income and disabled Medicare beneficiaries who should have been covered under the new Medicare drug benefit. Secretary Leavitt assured Snowe that the private drug plans that provide coverage to Medicare beneficiaries have committed to repaying states, and that he has the legal authority necessary to ensure that they do so. Earlier today, Snowe introduced bipartisan, emergency legislation to reimburse affected states.  
   "I applaud Secretary Leavitt for his commitment to ensure that Maine and other states are reimbursed for prescription drug costs they should not have had to pay," said Snowe. "He assured me that the various prescription drug plans will repay the states, and that he has the legal authority to make sure those companies follow through. The bottom line is that Maine must be compensated for the $5 million it has spent to ensure that our most vulnerable citizens receive the life-saving medicine they need. As I told Secretary Leavitt, this will be accomplished one way or the other - Congress must take action if the plans do not deliver in a timely manner. If necessary, the Senate must pass legislation I introduced today which would make sure the federal government lives up to its new responsibility and reimburses states for these costs." 
   Since the new drug benefit went into effect on January 1st, many low-income seniors have been unable to get their prescription drugs due to errors made by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). A CMS computer system essential to enrolling seniors in the new Medicare drug benefit has inaccurate and incomplete information about those eligible for the benefit in Maine and other states. CMS has also had difficulty in assuring drug plans complied with their terms, including providing an initial "transition" refill of all of a patient's existing medications. 
   The Medicare State Reimbursement Act will require the federal government to reimburse States with interest. It also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recover any overpayments made by states to private prescription drug plans and return that money to the Medicare Trust Fund. Currently, 25 states have moved to pick up the cost of these prescriptions, with Maine spending approximately $300,000 per day. 
   Senators Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) and 23 other Senators are original co-sponsors of this legislation. 
   Two weeks ago, Senators Snowe and Bill Nelson (D-FL) introduced a bipartisan plan to fix other problems with the implementation of the new Medicare drug benefit. This bill would give seniors more time to sign up for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, provide more flexibility for beneficiaries to change plans, and add crucial protections for those enrolled in a plan. 
   Following is a summary of provisions in the Medicare State Reimbursement Act: 
   * Requires the Federal Government to reimburse the states for the cost of prescriptions for low-income seniors and people with disabilities ("dual eligibles") who were eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but were improperly denied Federal coverage. 
   * Will reimburse states through an equivalent reduction in funds owed by each state under the "claw back" provision of the new Medicare law. 
   * Reimbursement will be at a rate equal to 100 percent of all State costs plus an interest rate equal to the market rate on 3-month Treasury Securities plus 0.1 percent. 
   * Directs the Secretary of HHS to recover overpayments by states from private prescription drug plans and return that money to the Medicare Trust Fund
