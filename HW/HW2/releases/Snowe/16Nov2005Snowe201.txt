SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMPROMISE TAX RECONCILIATION PACKAGE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, issued the following statement today on the Committee's consideration of the Budget Reconciliation tax package:  
   I appreciate the Herculean efforts of Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley who has worked tirelessly for consensus in crafting a package that is ultimately fiscally responsible and addresses only those most pressing tax provisions. I believe that the modifications that he has made to the initial mark reach a delicate and appropriate balance. 
   In keeping with the principles I've held for my 27 years in Congress, I believe we have a fundamental obligation to ensure the levels, durations, and composition of tax cuts and tax reduction extensions are appropriate within the context of the challenges and priorities we face as a nation. We're now in a very different world than even just a few months ago when we voted on the budget. I believe the tax package that we have before us today is a reflection of this new and changed reality. This approach provides continued, critical relief to working Americans, who are facing increasing financial pressure from rising health care costs and energy prices. 
   Below is an outline of Chairman Grassley's revised package: 
   * Would renew for one year 14 tax provisions expiring at the end of 2005. A fifteenth provision expiring in 2005, the above-the line deduction for tuition and related expenses, would be extended through 2009. 
   * Would include $11.7 billion in revenue raisers over five years to offset its cost. It would retain all of the offsets in the original mark, as well as add a provision authored by Snowe that would disallow 75 percent of an integrated oil company's last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting layer for 2005. The provision would apply only to oil companies with revenues in excess of $1 billion. 
   * Would extend three provisions that do not expire this year: enhanced section 179 expensing, which sunsets at the end of 2007, would be renewed through 2009. The saver's tax credit, which expires at the end of 2006, would be extended through 2009. The New Markets Tax Credit, which expires at the end of 2007 and was added as part of the Chairman's revised mark, would be renewed through 2008. Snowe has introduced free-standing legislation to extend enhanced Section 179 expensing and the New Markets Tax Credit, provisions that help small businesses. 
   * Would retain $7 billion in tax cuts over five years to spur rebuilding of the Gulf Coast and recovery from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. 
   * Would add 19 charitable giving provisions to the underlying bill. Tax cuts in this section of the bill would, among other things, allow non-itemizers to claim a tax deduction for charitable contributions and permit tax-free distributions from IRAs for charitable purposes. 
   * Would add to the underlying bill $929 million over five years in miscellaneous tax cuts one of which would restructure New York Liberty Zone incentives passed in the wake of September 11. 
   The package specified above would have a net cost of $59.9 billion over five years. This would be composed of: $64.1 billion in tax cuts allocated to extending expiring provisions; $7 billion in tax cuts to spur hurricane recovery; $929 million in miscellaneous provisions; a net increase of $383 million for a variety of charitable giving provisions; and $11.7 billion in revenue offsets.
