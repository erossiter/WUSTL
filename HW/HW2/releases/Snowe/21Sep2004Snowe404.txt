SEN. SNOWE OFFERS STREAMLINED SBA EXTENSION BILL TO REVITALIZE LOAN, ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
  In an effort to safeguard the vital lending and business development programs offered by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and restart the agency's reauthorization process, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today introduced a streamlined, simplified, multi-year reauthorization bill designed to improve SBA programs and help the small business sector maintain and build on its recent growth.  
   "As the economy continues to recover and grow, it is essential that Congress send a message that affirms long-term stability in the programs the SBA provides to the small business community," Snowe said. "The SBA estimates that in the current fiscal year its loan and venture capital programs have provided small businesses with $19.7 billion in financing, and helped create or retain 716,144 jobs. That is a tremendous result from very modestly-funded programs. Congress simply cannot afford to leave these hallmark programs in limbo as we rapidly approach the close of the 108th Congress." 
   Snowe's bill, the "Small Business Reauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of 2004," contains a number of newly-modified provisions that were included in S.1375, the "Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003," a full scale, three-year SBA reauthorization that the Senate passed unanimously and referred to the House almost one year ago. As its centerpiece, the new measure enhances lending assistance for small manufacturers and builds on provisions to preserve support for the agency's long-running lending and venture capital programs, including the 7(a) and 504 Guaranteed Loan Programs and Surety Bond Programs. 
   Snowe said she is confident that the bill introduced today "will accelerate efforts to work with the other body," and help resolve outstanding issues blocking the House from passing an SBA reauthorization bill. She confirmed that the Committee has already begun work with the House Committee on Small Business and its Chairman, Donald Manzullo (R-IL), to expedite action on a final reauthorization bill. "I look forward to the House introducing companion legislation soon and to working with Chairman Manzullo to enact this important legislation for small business," Snowe added. 
   "I believe we must get a final bill passed and ready for the President to sign immediately," Snowe added. "Too much is at stake for small firms, and the economy as a whole, to let this legislation languish." 
   The SBA estimates that reauthorizing the agency will result in the creation or retention of an estimated 3.3 million jobs over the next 5 years. During that same period, the SBA and its programs are predicted to support over 1 million jobs through prime contracts and subcontracts. 
   Major provisions of Snowe's "Small Business Reauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of 2004" 
   * Increased Debenture Size for 504 Program - Increases the maximum size of a 504 guarantee to $1.5 million in the general 504 guaranteed loan program (it is now $1 million); to $2 million (now $1.3 million) if the project achieves one of nine public policy goals, such as being in a rural area; and to $4 million (it is now $1 million) if it is for a manufacturing project. This change will significantly increase access to capital for small businesses. 
   * Combination Financing for 7(a) loans - Extends the authorization for 7(a) borrowers to receive combination or "piggyback" financing, as the SBA has permitted for years. The authority would otherwise expire September 30, 2004. 
   * Loan Guarantee Fees for 7(a) loans - Extends the fees that currently apply to 7(a) borrowers and lenders. The current fees are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2004, and higher fees (between 40 percent and 100 percent higher) for borrowers and lenders would go into effect if they expire. 
   * Express Loan Provisions - Makes permanent the SBA's ability to offer Express loans of up to $2 million; it would otherwise expire on September 30, 2004. 
   * Deferred Participation Standards - Since April 2004, regardless of a loan's size, lenders have been required to pass on to the SBA all of a certain 0.50 percent up-front fee that is already paid by borrowers (prior to that lenders could retain half of the fee for loans of $150,000 or less). This provision would make permanent the current treatment; it would otherwise expire on September 30, 2004. 
   * Increase in Guarantee Amount, and Institution of Associated Fee - Makes permanent the current maximum size of a 7(a) guarantee, $1.5 million, a provision that would otherwise expire September 30, 2004. This allows loans of up to $2 million to have a 75 percent guarantee, similar to small loans. These larger guarantees also have a larger fee that helps reduce the program's subsidy rate. 
   * Job Requirements for 504 Program - Changes the job-creation requirements that apply to 504 loans, to require lenders to create one job per $50,000 for regular 504 loans, $75,000 for certain specific types of 504 loans, and $100,000 for loans for manufacturing projects. 
   * Report regarding national database of small manufacturers - Requires that the SBA study the feasibility of creating a national database of small manufacturers, and, depending on that study, possibly create such a database. 
   * Surety Bond Guarantee - Clarifies that a small business may get a SBA-guaranteed surety bond of up to $2 million, even if the total contract size exceeds $2 million. 
   * International Trade Loan - In order to participate in the SBA's International Trade Loan Program, a small business must receive a finding of harm from the SBA, certifying that the business has suffered because of international competition. This provision would allow a small business to participate in the program by utilizing a prior finding of harm it has already received from the International Trade Commission or the Secretary of Commerce, rather than having to re-apply to the SBA to receive a duplicate finding. This would save small businesses time and expense. 
   * SBIC Program - Grants the SBA the authority to define "equity capital" for the purposes of the Small Business Investment Company Program.
