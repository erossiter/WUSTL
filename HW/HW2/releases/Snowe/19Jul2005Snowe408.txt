SEN. SNOWE MOURNS LOSS OF JAMES ERWIN
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement today on the passing of James Erwin:  
   "Jock and I were profoundly saddened to hear of Jim Erwin's passing. He was an honorable man and a public servant of the highest caliber - and we were both fortunate to come to know him during our own formative political years. In fact, Jock fondly recalls that the first political campaign he worked on was Jim's gubernatorial race in 1970, when Jock served as his driver - and I well remember holding a coffee for Jim's candidacy. We saw firsthand how deeply he cared about the people of Maine and building an even brighter future for our state."
