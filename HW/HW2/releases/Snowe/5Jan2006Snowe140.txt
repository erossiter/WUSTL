SEN. SNOWE VOTES AGAINST BUDGET SPENDING REDUCTION BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today voted against the $40 billion Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Budget Reconciliation Spending Reduction bill.  
 The legislation passed by a vote of 51 to 50 with Vice President Cheney casting the deciding vote. 
   Snowe issued the following statement today: 
   "This spending reconciliation conference report is a cynical piece of legislation that punishes our most vulnerable citizens. This package goes beyond reasonable reforms by altering Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) with adverse ramifications for the states, drastically cutting student aid, and dramatically increasing Medicaid co-payments. We could have produced a consensus package that would have addressed the deficit in a responsible manner - similar to what I helped craft in the Senate Finance Committee. Unfortunately, however, it seems to protect everyone but those needing the greatest protection."
