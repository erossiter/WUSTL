SENS. SNOWE, PRYOR INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ENSURE INDEPENDENCE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF ADVOCACY
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Mark L. Pryor (D-Ark.) today introduced the Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008, which would ensure the independence of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy and provide targeted small business regulatory reforms. This legislation is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the SBA Office of Advocacy and National Ombudsman. 
   "The disproportionate burden that Federal regulations often place on our small businesses cannot be overemphasized. At a time when the economy is in distress, we should be doing everything possible to remove barriers to growth," said Senator Snowe, Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. "Research published by the Office of Advocacy indicates that small businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each year complying with government rules and regulations. Clearly this time could be better used to improve products and services, as well as create new jobs."
   "Excessive regulatory enforcement stifles the innovative ways in which small businesses contribute to our economy," said Senator Pryor. "This critical piece of legislation will ensure that small businesses are able to focus on growth and productivity instead of rules and red tape."
   The Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 will ensure that the SBA's Office of Advocacy continues to be a truly independent 'regulatory watchdog' that protects our nation's small firms from burdensome government regulations free from any political interference. Additionally, the bill would require that Federal agencies take the Office of Advocacy's views into account before they issue regulations that impede small business growth.
   The Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 would:
   * Require the Federal budget to include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy drawn from the General Fund of the Treasury. Designed to preserve the Office of Advocacy's independence, this provision would free the Chief Counsel for Advocacy from having to seek the SBA Administrator's approval to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.
   * Improve the Regulatory Flexibility Act by requiring Federal agencies to consider and specifically respond to comments provided by the Office of Advocacy. Enacted in 1980, the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that Federal agencies analyze the impact of proposed regulations when there is likely to be a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This critical change would ensure that agencies give the proper deference to the Office of Advocacy and to the comments and concerns of small businesses.
   * Clarify that Federal agencies are required to provide pertinent information to the SBA Ombudsman upon request.
