SEN. SNOWE CONDEMNS PROVOCATIVE ACT AS ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE REGION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today in reaction to North Korea's reported nuclear test Sunday.  
   "The report of a nuclear test conducted by North Korea is deeply disturbing, and threatens to destabilize the region of Northeast Asia. The international community has appropriately condemned this provocative act and the United Nations Security Council should institute stronger sanctions that clearly demonstrate the UN's resolve to prevent further North Korean nuclear proliferation." 
   "This test further underscores North Korea's disregard for the will of the international community and Security Counsel Resolution 1695, which called for North Korea to restrain from any provocative action intended to aggravate tensions within the region. As a primary partner of six party negotiations aimed at resolving non-proliferation concerns through diplomatic efforts, the United States should rightly continue to work with China, Russia, Japan, and South Korean to achieve verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, as agreed to by the six parties, including North Korea, on September 19th, 2005."
