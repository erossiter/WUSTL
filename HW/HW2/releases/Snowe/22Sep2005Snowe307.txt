SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MEMBERS OF PORTSMOUTH LOCAL 4
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) received a model of a Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine from Portsmouth Local 4 members Phil Geraci, Terry Eleftherion, Kirk Miller, and Matt Biggs.  
 The four met with Snowe in her Washington, D.C. office to thank her for her work to save Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. 
   "I appreciate this wonderful gift, but the real credit should go to the local groups who rallied support for our shipyard day in and day out," said Snowe. "Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is the only shipyard in the country - public or private - that puts submarines to sea ahead of schedule while saving millions of dollars on every availability. The men and women who work at the yard are responsible for this record of excellence, and they are the reason the nation's gold standard of industrial shipyard efficiency will continue to shine for many, many years to come."
