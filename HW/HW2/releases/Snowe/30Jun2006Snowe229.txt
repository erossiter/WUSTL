SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), along with three Senate colleagues, submitted an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in support of a class action lawsuit filed by a group of female employees who are suing their employer for refusing to include contraception coverage in its employees' health care plan. This case is on appeal from a Federal District Court in Nebraska, which ruled that the company's failure to include contraception in its health care plan violated federal laws banning sex discrimination in employment.  
   "I have long supported contraception coverage in health care insurance plans," said Snowe. "As an advocate of women's rights and the author of Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act (EPICC), I am proud to support the plaintiffs by submitting this brief. I believe the trial court was correct in ruling that failing to cover contraception under an employer-sponsored health insurance plan runs afoul of the intent of Congress's long-standing employment discrimination laws, and I urge the Court of Appeals to uphold that ruling."
   The class action suit, Standridge, et al, v. Union Pacific R.R. Co, was filed in March of 2003. It alleges a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which bars employers from discriminating "on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs." The suit, originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska, was decided in favor of the plaintiffs in July 2005, and is now on appeal to the Eighth Circuit. Senator Snowe is joined on the brief by Senators Harry Reid (D-Nevada), Barbara Mikulski (D-Maryland), and Patty Murray (D-Washington).
