SEN. SNOWE HAILS PLANNED EXPANSION OF SUPRTEK FACILITY IN EAST MACHIAS
  A long-time supporter of the Navy Human Resources Benefits Call Center located in Machias, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today hailed the proposed expansion of the Call Center operations operated by Superlative Technologies, Inc. ("SuprTek") into neighboring East Machias. Snowe, who secured Navy support and $3 million in the fiscal year 2001 Defense Appropriations bill for creation of the Naval call facility, highlighted the exemplary achievements of SuprTek since beginning operations in January 2002 which led to the proposed expansion of the facility and capabilities. 
   "I applaud the proposed expansion of SuprTek's Call Center operations - in cooperation with the Navy - into the neighboring community of East Machias, thus expanding human resources services and benefits counseling to Navy personnel around the world. The extraordinary success of SuprTek is highlighted by the Navy's increasing support for the Call Center - expanding its mission from handling inquiries of 40,000 Navy civilian employees in the Northeast to 186,000 inquiries worldwide," said Snowe. "The Call Center continues to exceed the Navy's expectations and I will further work with SuprTek, Navy officials, and state and local representatives to approve this critical expansion plan."
   Operating the Navy's Call Center in Machias, SuprTek has proposed the renovation and location of a 7,000 square foot prefabricated building on the site of the former Maineland Motel in East Machias. At the expanded facility, SuprTek will hire and train approximately 7 additional Claims Service Representatives (CSRs) and an administrative support person. SuprTek currently maintains a total payroll of 20 CSRs and 3 supervisors - up from the original 9 CSRs - at the Call Center. The Call Center manages approximately 186,000 customers worldwide.
   "With this planned expansion, SuprTek reaffirms its commitment to the communities of Washington County, providing new employment opportunities and spurring economic investment in the recovering Down East region," continued Snowe.
   In July 2001, SuprTek was awarded a 3 year contract by the U.S. Navy Human Resources Call Center to be a pilot program to handle approximately 500 calls a month. Recently, the Navy announced the award of an 18 month contract to SuprTek for continuation of the program beyond October 1, 2004. With an average wait time of 2.7 seconds and 99.38 percent of all calls are answered within 120 seconds, the Call Center currently provides assistance for Navy civilian employees worldwide to answer questions regarding the Navy's health benefits, insurance program and retirement investments.
   SuprTek is an 8(a) small business who contracts with the federal government on various technology and service-related projects. SuprTek was awarded the Navy contract through open competition bidding. Snowe, who is chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business, is working with SuprTek and other Maine small businesses to increase opportunities to secure competitive federal contracts.
