SEN. SNOWE'S INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR INTELLIGENCE PROVISION INCLUDED IN FY 2006 INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, announced today that she successfully secured a provision in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Intelligence Authorization bill to create a strong and independent Inspector General of Intelligence (IGI) for the entire Intelligence Community (IC).  
   This provision is based on legislation Snowe authored last year, the "Intelligence Community Accountability Act of 2004," (S. 2515) and was cosponsored by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-NE) and Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Snowe fought to have it included in the sweeping intelligence reform legislation that was signed into law by the President in December 2004. A weakened version of Snowe's IGI ended up in the final version of the legislation that ultimately became law. The FY 2006 Intelligence Authorization bill now awaits full consideration by the Senate. 
   "As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I was disappointed that a strong Inspector General for Intelligence ultimately was not included into the Intelligence Reform bill last year. Having been a part of the Senate investigation into our intelligence failure in Iraq, I believed having an IG outside any one agency and responsible for the entire Intelligence Community would have greatly enhanced the overall performance of our intelligence agencies by bringing improved oversight and accountability," said Snowe. "I am pleased, working again with Chairman Roberts, that we have included this provision in the FY 2006 Intelligence Authorization bill." 
   The FY 2006 Intelligence Authorization bill would create an independent Inspector General for the entire Intelligence Community-all fifteen agencies. 
   The FY 2006 Intelligence Authorization bill stipulates that the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community would: 
   * Have the ability to initiate and conduct independent investigations, audits and inspections relating to the programs and operations of the IC, and the relationships between the elements of the IC within the National Intelligence Program and the other elements of the intelligence community ensuring that the office's jurisdiction is not confined to the National Intelligence Program; 
   * Have the ability to recommend policies and the implementation of those policies, enabling the IG to making sweeping recommendations to the entire IC; provide a means for keeping the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) fully and currently informed of problems and deficiencies, as well the progress of any recommended corrective actions; 
   * Shall be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and report directly to the DNI; 
   * May only be removed from office by the President; 
   * May only be prohibited from initiating, carrying out, or completing an investigation, inspection, or audit by the DNI, and only if the DNI determines that it is vital to national security; 
   * Shall have direct and prompt access to the DNI or any employee or any employee of a contractor of any element of the IC and failure to cooperate shall be grounds for appropriate administrative action, including loss of employment; 
   * Shall have access to all records, reports, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or other material, and the level of classification shall not provide a sufficient rationale for denying the IG access to those materials; 
   * Is authorized to receive and investigate complaints from any person and, once such a complaint has been received, the IG may not disclose the identity of the individual filing the complaint without that person's consent; 
   * Shall have the authority to administer to or take an oath, affirmation, or affidavit from any person and such an oath will have the same force and effect as an officer having a seal; 
   * Is authorized subpoena power; 
   * Shall expeditiously resolve which IG shall conduct an investigation in the event of a matter of jurisdiction of the another IC agency; however the IG of the IC shall make the final decision on the resolution of such jurisdiction; 
   * May conduct a separate investigation, inspection, or audit of any matter if the IG of the IC determines that the initial investigation conducted by an IG other than the IG of the IC was deficient; 
   * Shall be provided with a staff large enough to carry out the functions of the IG effectively; 
   * Shall create a career cadre to provide appropriate continuity; 
   * May request information or assistance from any department, agency, or other element of the United States government and upon request of the IG of the IC shall furnish such information or assistance; 
   * Shall ensure that each IG of an element within the IC complies fully with a request for information or assistance from the IG of the IC; 
   * May, upon reasonable notice, conduct an investigation, inspection, audit of any element in the IC and may enter into any place occupied by any agency giving the IG access to real-time operations; 
   * Shall submit to the DNI a classified and unclassified semiannual report summarizing its activities; 
   * Shall immediately notify the congressional intelligence committees if the IG, after exhausting all possible alternatives, is unable to obtain documents in the course of an investigation; 
   * Shall include in the National Intelligence Program budget a separate account for the office of IG of the IC; 
   * Shall not have any duty, responsibility, or function regarding another element of the IC be construed to modify of effect the duties of any other IG; 
   * And, must notify Congress if an investigation of any Senate-confirmed community official is initiated.
