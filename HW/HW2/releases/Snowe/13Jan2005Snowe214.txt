SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $250,000 IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a Community Facility Guaranteed Loan of $250,000 for the Northern Maine General Hospital.  
 The funds will be used for the development of a 4-bed living-assistance home in Mapleton, Maine. The homelike residence will house two to four mentally challenged individuals and will create four full-time jobs. 
   "Continually increasing the standard of care provided to needy Mainers is of upmost importance," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "We are excited that the USDA was able to provide this loan and support the development of the Mapleton home." 
   The USDA Rural Development mission provides Community Facility Guaranteed Loans to develop essential community facilities in rural areas and towns of up to 20,000 in population. The loans are used for community programs that seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
