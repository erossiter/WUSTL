SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS REPORT ON PREWAR INTELLIGENCE ABOUT POSTWAR IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, voted to adopt the third section of Phase 2 of the Committee's investigation into the use by policymakers of Iraq pre-war intelligence. Sen. Olympia Snowe released the following statement today:  
   "Almost three years ago, the Intelligence Committee unanimously released the first phase of its investigation into one of the most catastrophic intelligence failures in our nation's history. Last September, the committee completed the first two sections of the second phase of the committee's investigation, which examined what information from Iraqi National Congress (INC) affiliated exiles was used by U.S. policy makers in official intelligence estimates and compared prewar intelligence of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear capabilities with what U.S. weapons inspectors found. Today, the committee released the third section of this comprehensive review. 
   "This fair and objective report rightly reflects the transparency and accountability that must be brought to bear on our pre-war intelligence, and provides critical lessons for the future. Significantly, it concluded that the intelligence community forecasted many of the realties we see on the ground today - predicting that establishing a democracy would be a long and difficult challenge, and that U.S. service men and women could confront sectarian conflict and instability." 
   The committee report is exclusively derived from two National Intelligence Council declassified documents, Regional Consequences of Regime Change in Iraq and Principal Challenges in Post-Saddam Iraq.
