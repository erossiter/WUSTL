SEN. SNOWE CALLS ON PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO FULLY EQUIP ARMY NATIONAL GUARD
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asking them to provide funding to fully equip the Army National Guard with combat equipment.  
 The letter was spearheaded by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL). 
   "The Army National Guard is a vital component of our nation's defense," said Snowe. "It is absolutely essential that they are adequately equipped and prepared to deal with any domestic emergency that confronts our country. Due to increased deployment overseas, the National Guard's equipment has been under great strain- negatively impacting their ability to respond to emergencies at home. We have an obligation to provide them with every resource to accomplish their mission. I hope the President and Secretary Rumsfeld heed our call and provide the Army National Guard with the resources they need to defend our nation."
