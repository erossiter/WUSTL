SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE OVER $3 MILLION IN EDUCATION FUNDING
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded $3,105,893 to the University of Maine at Farmington (UMF) and School Administrative District (SAD) #55, which covers the towns of Baldwin, Cornish, Hiram, Parsonsfield, and Porter.  
 The funding will be used to support a new education center at UMF and a Safe Schools/Healthy Students program in SAD #55. 
   "A good education is one of the most essential components of the lives of both children and adults. This recent wave of funding from the Department of Education will support both a healthy students program for youth as well as continuing education programs for adult educators," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. 
   Funding awarded to UMF is for the sum of $248,000 to be disbursed over a period of two years. It will be used to support a new education center at the school. The center will be used to provide professional education to pre-service teachers as well as continuing education programs for practicing professionals. Grant funds will provide the equipment for nine "smart" classrooms to support courses that utilize and demonstrate the effective integration of technology to enrich teaching and learning. 
   The grant awarded to SAD #55 is in the amount of $952,631 and will be given for three successive years. The goal of the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program is to implement an integrated, comprehensive community-wide plan designed to create safe and drug-free schools and promote prosocial skills and healthy childhood development in youth.
