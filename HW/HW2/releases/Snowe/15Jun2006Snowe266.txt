SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS LEGISLATION REQUIRING REGULAR BUDGETING FOR IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN OPERATIONS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) cosponsored an amendment by Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Defense Authorization bill that would require all spending for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan be included in the regular, annual budget writing process. Over the past several years, full funding for these military operations have not been included in the annual budget with money appropriated through emergency supplemental appropriations bills. The amendment passed by a vote of 98 to 0.  
   "At this stage of the game, we should be able to estimate what the yearly costs are of our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Snowe. "And that is precisely the underlying premise of this critical amendment by Sen. McCain. When we fund our military operations through emergency spending bills and not through our annual budget process, we are essentially hiding the cost of the war from the American people. For too long, this practice has circumvented essential Congressional oversight. Today, the Senate has taken a big step toward reversing this course by overwhelmingly passing this legislation."
   The amendment directs the President to submit as a part of his budget request:
   A request for funds for the fiscal year for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq; 
   An estimate of all funds expected to be required in that fiscal year such operations; and 
   A detailed justification of the funds requested.
