SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $500,000 FOR WASHBURN; NITRATE REMOVAL FOR TOWN WATER SYSTEM
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that the Town of Washburn has been awarded a $500,000 grant to construct a new water treatment facility.  
 Recent water testing indicated that nitrate levels have reached unacceptable levels and that a nitrate removal system is immediately necessary.
   "This was an emergency situation for the Town of Washburn and the 1,600 people who rely on the community water system for drinking and cooking," said the Senators in a joint statement. "This funding will allow the town to immediately address and resolve the health concerns posed by the current water system. Once the new treatment facility is in operation, new tests can then take place to reassure residents that their drinking water is safe."
   The Maine Department of Human Services had issued a warning notice to Washburn area residents about the nitrate levels in the community water system.
   The federal grant for a new water treatment facility comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. The Town of Washburn also received local, state, and federal emergency management dollars for the project.
