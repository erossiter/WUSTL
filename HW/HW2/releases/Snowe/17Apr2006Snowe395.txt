SEN. SNOWE WELCOMES 152ND BACK TO MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today welcomed the Maine Army National Guard's 152nd Maintenance Company back to Maine. Sen. Snowe met with members of the 152nd when she traveled to Iraq last month. The 152nd has been stationed in Iraq for the past 12 months, where its primary mission was conducting security and force protection operations for Camp Liberty in Baghdad. Sen.Snowe released the following statement:  
   "Today Mainers across our state welcome the 152nd home to Maine. All of us are proud of them and everything they have done for America, and we are thankful to finally have them back. 
   "While we cannot truly comprehend the dangers they faced or the strength they were able to summon as they faced the unknown each and every day, we do know that they brought honor upon themselves by serving in vital missions - of that there is no question. It was an honor to be able to visit with so many of them while I was in Baghdad last month. I could not have been more profoundly impressed by their courage and professionalism in successfully taking on such a daunting and unexpected challenge. 
   "The families and loved ones of these brave soldiers also know the meaning of sacrifice. They have endured through the lonely days, the "double duty" with family and children, and the nights of praying for the safe return of loved ones. We marvel at their dignity and strength - and we recognize that military families have been integral to our mission overseas.".
