MAINE-NEW HAMPSHIRE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS ANNOUNCE USS HARTFORD DMP AT PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD
  The Maine-New Hampshire congressional delegations announced today that the Navy will grant the USS Hartford (SSN 768) Depot Modernization Period (DMP) to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  
   "The Navy's decision to conduct the USS Hartford's DMP at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is a clear reflection of the yard's outstanding record of performance. This facility is far and away the most efficient nuclear shipyard in the nation, returning $26 million over the last three years and saving 60 weeks of operational time by returning these boats to the fleet early. We are confident that USS Hartford will benefit from PNS' highly skilled workforce during its time in Portsmouth," the delegations said in a joint statement. 
   Last fall, the ME-NH delegations sent a letter to Admiral Vernon Clark, Chief of Naval Operations, requesting that the USS Hartford DMP be assigned to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
