SENS. SNOWE, LINCOLN INTRODUCE MEASURE CRITICAL TO MANAGING VETERANS CLAIMS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) on Monday, March 26, 2007, introduced an amendment to the FY 2008 Budget Resolution that will help the VA better manage and reduce its current backlog of pending disability and compensation claims. The legislation, which passed unanimously in the Senate, will provide an additional $70.3 million in funding to train and hire claims processors and help our nation's Veterans receive their benefits and compensation in a more timely and cost efficient manner.  
   "Every year, hundreds of thousands of America's finest look to the Veterans Benefits Administration to process the claims due to them as a result of their unselfish and steadfast service to our nation," said Senator Snowe. "This critical legislation will give the VBA the funding it needs to reduce the current backlog of claims and ensure all processing personnel make more accurate decisions. I am proud of my Senate colleagues for ensuring that our Veterans receive the benefits they so rightly earned and deserve." 
   In December, Senators Snowe and Lincoln co-authored a letter signed by thirty three of their colleagues to President Bush requesting that his FY2008 Budget submission include adequate funding for additional staff and resources to help address the pending claims at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).
