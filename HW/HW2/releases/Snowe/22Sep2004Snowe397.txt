SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF AIR CARGO SECURITY INITIATIVES
  A longtime proponent of improved air cargo security, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, applauded the inclusion of an amendment she sponsored to the 'Aviation Security Advancement Act' that would double the percentage of air cargo inspected on passenger aircrafts by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Snowe's amendment, which was unanimously adopted, was included in the legislation that was approved by the Committee today.  
   "I applaud my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee for unanimously recognizing the critical need for greater screening of cargo on passenger aircrafts. In this post 9/11 era, we successfully screen all checked baggage in the hull of the plane. But, by congressional estimates, less than 5 percent of all cargo is screened prior to being loaded on passenger flights. We must close these existing holes in our homeland security net," said Snowe. "I am pleased that Senator Rockefeller has included my air cargo security provision within the comprehensive, bipartisan 'Aviation Security Advancement Act', representing a first but pivotal step in mitigating future threats to our nation's passenger planes." 
   The 'Aviation Security Advancement Act' (S.2393) would authorize $2.5 billion to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through fiscal year (FY) 2007 for improvements to the current aviation security system, including increases in efficiency of the national air transportation system within security staffing, cargo security, baggage screening, and airport perimeter security. The "Aviation Security Advancement Act" was introduced by Senator John Rockefeller (D-WV) and cosponsored by Snowe. 
   "The Aviation Security Advancement Act empowers the Transportation Security Administration to address several areas of continuing concern within our nation's air security system. I firmly believe that this legislation gives the TSA the tools it needs to carry out its critical mission in defending the homeland," said Snowe. 
   Specifically, the legislation would: 
   * Standardize the federal screener workforce, to address staffing needs and promote efficient and effective screening at individual airports. After 90 days of enactment, the Secretary of DHS would be required to develop standards for determining the appropriate aviation security staffing needs for all commercial airports in the U.S. Under the standards, the average security-related delay experience by airline passengers must not exceed 10 minutes. 
   * Allocate $600 million over three years for air cargo security, to establish an enhanced security program and to promote the use of improved technology for cargo screening. Additionally, this provision would require background checks for indirect air carriers and cargo ground handling agents against all federal watch-lists and require hardened cockpit doors that are consistent with what is currently required on passenger planes on all cargo aircraft. 
   * Allocate $700 million over three years to develop a streamlined system for baggage screening, to replace the bulky EDS machines or hand-held trace detection equipment currently used in most airports. Under the bill, DHS must establish a schedule for "in-line" baggage screening with explosive detection system equipment, including funding allocated for research and development of future generations of detection systems.
