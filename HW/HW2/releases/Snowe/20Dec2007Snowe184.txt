SEN. SNOWE REACTION TO EPA DECISION LIMITING STATES ABILITY TO SET EMISSION STANDARDS
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in response to the Environmental Protection Agency's ruling on Wednesday denying 17 states the right to set their own standards for carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles:  
   "I am deeply disappointed that the Administration failed to follow the statute outlined in the Clean Air Act that allows California to adopt distinct environmental laws. This is a setback for Maine and as well as our national environmental stewardship. Although I am confident that the court system will ultimately overturn this decision, I am troubled that this Administration has unnecessarily delayed enactment of a strong curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions."
