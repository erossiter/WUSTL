  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) congratulated Dr. Wayne Honeycutt and Dr. John Halloran, the recipients of a Federal Laboratory Consortium, Mid-Atlantic region Award, for their development of the "Potato Systems Planner" program. Dr. Honeycutt and Dr. Halloran, of the USDA Agricultural Research Service; New England Plant, Soil, and Water Laboratory in Orono, Maine, created the program to aid growers in selecting crop rotations and making management decisions based on first-hand research information.  
   "I extend my deepest congratulations to Dr. Honeycutt and Dr. Halloran for their award winning program "Potato Systems Planner," said Senator Snowe. "Their innovative insight into the potato growing industry will help increase productivity and efficiency and undoubtedly benefit farmers in Maine and across the country." 
   The "Potato Systems Planner" program provides general and detailed information on the impact of 15 crop rotations on diseases, economics, yields, soil microorganisms, and nitrogen cycling. The program is contained in a CD-ROM format and has been distributed to over 1000 growers and scientists from 22 states and over a dozen countries. 
   The Federal Laboratory Consortium Mid-Atlantic Region Award is granted to a federal laboratory within the FLC MAR Region in recognition of extraordinary efforts, which exceed legislated requirements, in the furtherance of national and regional technology transfer activities.
