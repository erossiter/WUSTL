SEN. SNOWE REACTION TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH ON ONGOING WAR IN IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement in response to President Bush's speech this morning on the ongoing efforts in Iraq:  
   "Today, the President laid out his vision for Iraq to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission. It is therefore incumbent on the President to establish an exit strategy of definitive benchmarks that will result in the transition to Iraqi independence and a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops, consistent with the Senate Resolution passed just weeks ago. 
   "Ultimately, the pathway to success in Iraq is for the Iraqis to take ownership of their future. The elections on December 15th will serve to firmly place the Iraqi people on a path toward political, economic and military stability that will ultimately allow our soldiers to come home. 
   "We must remember the huge sacrifices our brave troops and their families have made to liberate Iraq from Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. These honorable men and women continue to perform at the highest level despite lengthy deployments, and I look forward to the day when we will welcome them home."
