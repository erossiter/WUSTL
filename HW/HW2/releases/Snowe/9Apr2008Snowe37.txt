A fellow Greek American, Nick was a remarkable man and all of us who knew him can tell you about his many talents, warm personality and generous nature. Through his love of public service, Nick leaves behind a long-lasting legacy that is felt throughout Bangor and the entire state. The tremendous impact and contributions Nick and his entire family have made to their community will never be forgotten. Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Helen, their two sons and the entire Brountas family for their enormous loss."
