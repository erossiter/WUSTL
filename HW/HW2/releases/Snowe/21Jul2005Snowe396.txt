SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $87,267 IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration (EDA) has awarded the Penobscot Indian Nation $35,267 and the Southern Maine Economic Development District in Portland $52,000 for partnership planning investment.  
 Both grants will be used to support regional long-term economic development planning efforts. 
   "Long-term economic planning is necessary for communities to attract business and ensure that they remain economically vibrant. The Penobscot Indian Nation and Southern Maine Economic Development District will benefit significantly from the EDA grants that support their long range development plans," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was established to work with states and localities to generate new jobs, retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas and regions of the United States. The purpose of its program investments is to provide economically distressed communities with a source of funding for planning, infrastructure development, and business financing that will induce private investment in the types of business activities that contribute to long-term economic stability and growth. EDA's investments are strategically targeted to increase local competitiveness and strengthen the local and regional economic base.
