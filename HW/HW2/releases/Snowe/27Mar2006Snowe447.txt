  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a $400,000 Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) Technical Assistance grant to the AIDS Housing Corporation (AHC) in Boston. Founded in 1991, AHC has been the leader in technical assistance services for the New England region. Over the past 15 years, the AHC's services have facilitated the development of 40 housing programs and more than 1,200 units of housing throughout New England, including the Frannie Peabody Center in Portland.  
   "We commend the efforts of the AIDS Housing Corporation in creating housing opportunities for low income and homeless persons living with HIV/AIDS, and we welcome this additional funding, which will facilitate further such technical assistance services in New England," said Senators Snowe and Collins. 
   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds private housing developments to assist in housing opportunities for low income residents. HUD provides rental assistance to approximately 1.5 million low-income households. It also funds community revitalization projects to meet local needs and expand opportunities for Americans.
