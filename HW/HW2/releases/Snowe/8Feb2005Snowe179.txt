SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUDGET'S IMPACT ON SHIPBUILDING AT BATH IRONWORKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement on the possible impact of President Bush's FY06 budget on the Navy's shipbuilding budget and Bath Iron Works:  
   "I continue to vehemently oppose any cuts in the Navy's shipbuilding budget, especially during a time of increased demands on our armed forces as they prosecute the Global War on Terror. Given the present national security environment, the Navy cannot reduce the number of destroyers built over the next six years without putting in jeopardy its primary mission of global power projection. 
   "Building just five destroyers over the next five years - which the President's Fiscal Year 2006 budget calls for - is inadequate and shortsighted. We simply must find the resources to bring DDX production up to acceptable levels and to ensure a steady workload at Bath Iron Works. I plan to take my concerns to my colleagues, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg, and make clear to them the critical need to maintain DDX production at BIW. As Congress considers the President's budget for our Armed Forces, we must work to find common ground with preserving our national security as our primary concern."
