SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH DELTA CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ON JAN. 19
  In her Washington office on Friday, January 19, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) met with Delta Airline's Chief Executive Officer Jerry Grinstein to discuss the merger offer between Delta and US Airways, focusing on the potential impact on Maine and other rural states. Sen. Olympia Snowe is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees the nation's airline industry.  
   "Today, I had the opportunity to sit down with Delta's CEO, Gerry Grinstein, to determine what impact the proposed US Airways-Delta Airlines merger would have on the future of the industry and on rural air service throughout Maine and America," said Snowe. "As the Commerce Committee considers this merger at a hearing next week, my goal will be to ensure that air service in Maine is not only maintained, but expanded. As the people of Maine know, our state and the traveling public should not be put at an unfair disadvantage simply because of airline consolidation." 
   Next week, Snowe will meet with USAirways CEO Doug Parker and on Wednesday, January 24th, the Commerce Committee will hold a hearing where both CEOs will appear to answer questions regarding the proposed merger.
