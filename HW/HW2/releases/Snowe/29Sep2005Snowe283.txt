SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $1.1 BILLION FOR NAVY'S NEXT GENERATION DESTROYER PROGRAM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has included $1.1 billion for the Navy's next generation destroyer program the DD(X) and $50 million for advanced procurement in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Defense Appropriations bill.  
 This legislation now awaits full consideration by the Senate. 
   "The future of our national security is based on a robust and modern Navy. And today, the Senate Appropriations Committee took a step towards that goal by fully funding our next generation destroyers and providing money toward the advanced procurement of future ships. It was the joint effort of Maine's and Mississippi's Senators that we have come this far and it will be together that we will ensure that the level of funding in the Senate Appropriations bill for the DD(X) program is maintained. With a cohesive and dedicated group of advocates in the Senate, I believe that any cuts to this essential naval program will face stiff opposition. I continue to believe that we must give the Navy 21st Century weapons to fight 21st century wars. To give in to shortsighted attempts to save money would cripple the security of our nation," said Snowe.
