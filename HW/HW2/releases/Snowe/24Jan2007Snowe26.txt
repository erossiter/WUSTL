SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES EXPANDED COMMERCE SUBCOMMITTEE JURISDICTION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced on Wednesday, Jan. 24, that the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee in which she will serve as the lead Republican has been greatly expanded to include oversight over the critical issue of Global Climate Change.  
   The Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard maintains its previous jurisdiction over the nation's fish policy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) will serve as the Chair. 
   "I am pleased to announce that this Subcommittee that plays such a critical role over our nation's fisheries and the Coast Guard has been expanded to include global climate change," said Snowe. "It is beyond dispute that global warming exists and its impact is increasing. With increased ocean acidification from carbon dioxide emissions that is affecting the entire marine food chain, we need to understand the ramifications of climate change on this vital food supply. Now is the time for the Congress to tackle an issue that has such vast economic and environmental implications. I look forward to working alongside my colleague Senator Cantwell to move forward on agenda that will help Maine and America."
