SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION TO DISCUSS CRITICAL ISSUES FACING STATE, LOCALITIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met recently with representatives of the Maine Municipal Association to discuss critical issues facing communities throughout Maine. Sen. Snowe listened to the concerns of the representatives and discussed ways the federal government can aid state and local communities.  
   "I am pleased that members of the Maine Municipal Association came to Washington, D.C. to speak with me about such critical subjects as education, energy assistance, tax reform, and water services," said Snowe. "Every year I enjoy meeting with this distinguished group of Mainers because they are on the front lines responding to their communities' needs. Indeed, the issues that they deal with on a daily basis are of critical importance to all communities in the State of Maine. I look forward to working with them and receiving their continued input as the 109th Congress progresses so I can work on the federal level to support their efforts." 
   The Maine Municipal Association is a voluntary membership organization of the State's cities, towns, plantations and organized townships to provide a unified voice for Maine's municipalities to promote and strengthen local government.
