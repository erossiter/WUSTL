SEN. SNOWE SPEAKS OUT ON MEADWESTVACO SALE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today expressed optimism regarding the sale of the MeadWestvaco paper mill in Rumford to Cerberus Capital Management L.P. In meetings with MeadWestvaco, members of Snowe's staff were assured that all employees of the papers business would join the new company, and that all labor agreements will remain in place. 
   "Many families in Rumford look to the paper mill for their livelihood, and the local economy is highly dependent on the mill," said Snowe. "Given the concern of the people of Rumford may have about the transition to new ownership, I am pleased that MeadWestvaco and Cerberus seem committed to a smooth handover and to retaining the more than 1000 jobs at the mill in Rumford."
   MeadWestvaco will sell its entire papers business, including its paper mill in Rumford. The current management team will continue to lead the company.
