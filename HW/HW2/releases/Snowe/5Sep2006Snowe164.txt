SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES CITY OF LEWISTON ON BEING NAMED A FINALIST FOR 2006 AWARD FOR MUNICIPAL EXCELLENCE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today congratulated the city of Lewiston for their selection as a finalist for the 2006 Award for Municipal Excellence by the National League of Cities (NLC) and CH2m Hill. The city of Lewiston's nomination recognizes the outstanding programs and initiatives of the Lewiston Youth Advisory Council (LYAC) and the dramatic improvement in the quality of life for its residence.  
   "The city of Lewiston has a rich history of success and community action. The formation of the Youth Advisory Council five years ago laid the ground work for the city's recognition as a national leader in community excellence, and gave the city's residents an opportunity to better their hometown," Senator Snowe said. "The LYAC has improved the face of an already beautiful city, and their example is an inspiration for communities throughout Maine and the United States." 
   Nominated programs were judged on the following criteria: successful public-private partnership ventures; productive citizen and community collaborations; effective management of municipal resources (public or private); innovative government policies; project implementation with tangible results; and/or the ability to replicate the project in other cities. The winners of the 2006 Awards for Municipal Excellence will be announced at the National League of Cities' Congress of Cities and Exposition in Reno, Nevada, December 5-9, 2006.
