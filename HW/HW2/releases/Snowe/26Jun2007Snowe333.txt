SEN. SNOWE PRAISES FEMA ON SELECTING MAJOR GENERAL BILL LIBBY TO NATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on its selection of Major General John William "Bill" Libby as the State Government member to the National Advisory Council. FEMA Administrator David Paulison recently announced the proposed memberships for the national advisory council, which will help advise FEMA on all aspects of preparedness and emergency management in an effort to ensure close coordination with its partners across the country.  
   "This is great news for Major General Bill Libby and our entire state," said Senator Snowe. "I am so pleased that Administrator Paulison and FEMA have selected such a remarkable Mainer to the Council. Bill will be a tremendous asset to this advisory board and will help our state contribute to our country's homeland security plan." 
   The Council is being instituted to ensure effective and ongoing coordination of the federal preparedness, protection, response, recovery and mitigation for natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters. Specifically, the Council will focus attention in the development and revision of the national preparedness goal, the national preparedness system, the National Incident Management System, the National Response Plan, and other related plans and strategies.
