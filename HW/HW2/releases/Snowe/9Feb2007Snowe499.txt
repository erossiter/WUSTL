SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL CASEY AS ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in response to the confirmation of General William Casey as the 36th Army Chief of Staff this morning by the Senate by a vote of 83 to 14:  
   "As the 36th Chief of Staff for the United States Army, General Casey will face historic challenges that will require exceptional skills and experience to overcome," Snowe said. "Having met General Casey during my visit to Iraq in March, I believe he is the right man for this very difficult job. As a decorated field commander and distinguished officer, his service has spanned more than three decades, and I believe General Casey's most recent assignment as field commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, has given him a unique perspective on the needs our brave servicemen and women. His experience on the ground in Iraq makes General Casey uniquely qualified to oversee the recruiting, organization, training, and equipping that the U.S. Army requires."
