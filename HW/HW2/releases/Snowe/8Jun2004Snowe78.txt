SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF U.N. RESOLUTION ON IRAQI SOVEREIGNTY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement after the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously 15 to 0 in support of the Romania-United Kingdom-US resolution guaranteeing the international legitimacy of Iraq: 
   "Today, the United States and Great Britain successfully won international backing for a United Nation's resolution that guarantees that Iraq will be able to take control of its own destiny. As we fast approach the June 30 deadline for the transfer of sovereignty to the people of Iraq, it is indeed essential that the international community come together to bring stability to a nation that has suffered for far too long.
   "This unanimously passed resolution guarantees the international legitimacy of the new Iraqi government and rightly preserves our military's ability to take any necessary action to support and protect our troops as they continue to provide the necessary stability for the Iraqi people to continue on their path toward independent elections. Indeed with only weeks until the transition of power, the Iraqi people must take responsibility for their own security and future. I believe this resolution is an historic step toward that goal.
   "While today's actions are indeed encouraging, I continue to believe that it is long past time for other members of the global community that benefit from a stable Iraq to put their own troops on the front lines.
   "I would like to commend the efforts of President Bush and Prime Minister Blair in leading the charge to secure unanimous passage today, and our allies who supported our efforts."
