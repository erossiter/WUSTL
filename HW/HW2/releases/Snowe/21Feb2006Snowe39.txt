SEN. SNOWE REACTS TO BANK OF AMERICA CLOSINGS
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement in response to Bank of America's announcement that it will close call centers in Fort Kent, Farmington, Portland, and Presque Isle:  
   "Today's announcement by Bank of America leaves our state with conflicting emotions. To the workers, their families and the communities impacted by these closures, I pledge my ongoing support to help them through this most trying time. At the same time, Bank of America's decision to retain its facility and the 1,700 workers in Belfast is certainly welcome news and a relief for a community that has been faced with significant uncertainty. 
   "I appreciate that Anne Finucane, Northeast President of Bank of America, met with me personally to discuss the future of these facilities. She informed me that Bank of America is actively seeking a buyer for the facilities in Fort Kent, Presque Isle, Farmington, and Portland. I will do all I can to work with the Governor and the other members of the delegation to help that process. Together, we will also make every effort to assist the affected employees and communities. 
   "I will continue to work with Bank of America to enhance their partnership with our state. That they continue to have a significant presence in our state is ultimately a testament to the men and women of Maine's unparalleled workforce.".
