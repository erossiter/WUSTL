SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FUNDS FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that two grants totaling $355,779 have been awarded to Maine's Office of Attorney General and its Department of Public Safety by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  
   "Lack of funding emerges as a consistent problem for State entities trying to implement critical programs," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The recent grants awarded to Maine by the U.S. Department of Justice will greatly aid two significant programs that continue to provide important services to Mainers. This funding will help reduce the usage of drugs in Maine as well as provide funds to ensure victims of crime are recognized and protected." 
   The following programs will receive funding: 
   * $186,000 to the Attorney General's Office for Victims of Crime for Victims Crime Act (VOCA) Victim Compensation. The grant provides financial assistance to Federal and State victims of crime. 
   * $169,779 to the Department of Public Safety Bureau of Justice Assistance for a Residential Substance Abuse Treatment for State Prisoners Program (RSAT). The program assists states and local governments in developing and implementing substance abuse treatment programs in state and local correctional and detention facilities. 
   The United States Department of Justice aims to ensure fair and impartial administration, enforce the law, defend the interests, and promote justice for all Americans. They ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic and provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime.
