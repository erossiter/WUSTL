SEN. SNOWE HAILS COURT DECISION TO REJECT BUSH ADMINISTRATION CAP AND TRADE MERCURY EMISSIONS PLAN
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, issued the following statement praising the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia's decision to reject a Bush Administration cap and trade proposal to regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as part of the Clean Air Mercury Rule: 
   "Maine's environment should not be for sale to the lowest bidder. Today's decision underscores the lunacy of having a standard that allows plants to purchase their way out of compliance. The issue of mercury poisoning is beyond dollars and cents and we must have nationally uniform mercury standards. The simple truth is the EPA's approach failed to reflect the severity of the situation and would have inevitably failed to protect either the health of our children, or Maine's natural resources and the economies that depend on them. I look forward to reviewing a revised rule from EPA that implements the best science and ensures that all areas of America are protected from mercury pollution."
   Senator Snowe was the forefront of the effort to overturn the EPA's proposal, authoring a Senate Resolution of Disapproval in September of 2005 with Senator Leahy. The Resolution failed narrowly in a vote of 47-51 on September 13th, 2005.
