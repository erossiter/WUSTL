SEN. SNOWE DISAPPOINTED WITH NEW EPA MERCURY EMISSIONS RULE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today expressed her disappointment with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mercury emissions rule expected to be officially released tomorrow.  
 This new rule was leaked to the media today. 
   "EPA's new rule on Mercury emissions is woefully inadequate and profoundly disappointing," said Snowe. "The cap and trade system the new rule puts forward may reduce overall emissions, but not to acceptable levels until 2018. In the meantime, it will not address - and could even exacerbate - the formation of mercury hotspots. Unless every coal-fired power plant is required to reduce its emissions, dangerously high concentrations of mercury in Maine and other parts of the country will persist. We have the technology to reduce mercury emissions across the board, but we continue to put women, children and our environment at risk by failing to use it." 
   Snowe also noted that a report released today by the Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA), the National Education Association (NEA), and the Arc of the United States identifies mercury pollution as one of the greatest threats facing developing fetuses, infants and young children. The brochure, designed for parents, explains where mercury comes from, provides food consumption advice, offers ways to help stop mercury air pollution at its source, and helps parents identify clues to learning disabilities. The brochure is available online at www.ldaamerica.org and www.thearc.org.
