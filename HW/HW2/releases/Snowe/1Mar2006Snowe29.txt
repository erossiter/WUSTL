SEN. SNOWE WELCOMES JETBLUE TO MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today welcomed JetBlue Airways to Maine. The airline will offer the only low-fare, nonstop flights between New York and Portland, ME beginning May 23, with four daily nonstop flights.  
   "Maine's flying public will be well-served by JetBlue's new operations in Portland," said Snowe. "This is also outstanding news and a tremendous boost for the Jetport, which can now offer a low-cost option with a proven track record of success to customers traveling between Portland and New York. I wish JetBlue success in its expansion into Maine, and I look forward to its presence for years to come."
