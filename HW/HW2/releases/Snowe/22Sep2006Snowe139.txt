SEN. SNOWE PRAISES PASSAGE OF COST OF LIVING INCREASE FOR VETERANS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised the passage of the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2006. Sen. Snowe is a cosponsor of the legislation passed by unanimous consent Friday that will raise the rate of veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled adult children, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children as of December 1, 2006. The Cost of Living Increase was increased by 4.1% in 2006.  
   "I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave Americans who served in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. Every American owes an unplayable debt to our veterans who have, through their bravery and sacrifice, defended this nation and our way of life," said Senator Snowe. "Ensuring compensation for our veterans keeps up with the cost of living is the responsibility of both the Congress and the nation."
