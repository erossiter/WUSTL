SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH ROCKER, ACTIVIST BONO OF U2
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met with U2 lead singer Bono at a luncheon hosted by Sen.  
 John Sununu (R-NH). Bono discussed with senators in attendance his charitable foundation efforts, and used the opportunity to get to know the senators, preparing the groundwork for future discussions. 
   "I greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with Bono, who is such an accomplished musician, dedicated activist, and wonderful person," said Snowe. "I have long supported many of the principles and initiatives Bono is committed to working toward, especially international HIV/AIDS funding and development assistance. I wish him the very best on U2's current tour, and I commend his ongoing efforts to raise awareness of some of the most important problems facing the developing world." 
   Bono has been an activist in international issues, mainly focused in Africa, for many years and is arguably the most high-profile celebrity activist today. He has worked with such officials as former Senator Jesse Helms, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and many others. Bono is co-founder of the organization DATA, which stands for "Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa. DATA aims to raise awareness about, and spark response to the crises swamping Africa: unpayable Debts, uncontrolled spread of AIDS, and unfair trade rules which keep Africans poor.
