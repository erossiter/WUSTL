SEN. SNOWE SHARES BUSH'S CONCERN OVER TIGHTER BORDER CONTROLS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement regarding President Bush's statements yesterday that he was concerned that the implementation of tighter border controls might pose problems for border communities:  
   "It is heartening that President Bush shares my concern about the impact of tighter border controls," said Snowe. "Clearly, awareness of this issue exists at the highest levels of government, and I am hopeful we will be able to work together to ensure that border communities in Maine are not unfairly burdened by these new travel guidelines. I think the President understands how crucial it is that we proceed carefully, and I am confident he is sensitive to the concerns of residents living near the border."
