SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $112,698 IN E-RATE FUNDING TO IMPROVE MODERN TECHNOLOGY FOR MAINE SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICTS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that various Maine schools, libraries and Administrative Districts will share $112,698.98 in funding discounts under the E-Rate program, which she and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) authored as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  
   "E-Rate funding gives schools and libraries across the nation access to the most up to date technologies available," said Snowe. "This program has proven effective at keeping students on the cutting edge of technological innovation and preparing them for the increasingly digital job market of the 21st century." 
   The Maine Schools, libraries and Administrative Districts receiving an E-rate funding commitment letter are: 
   Camden Community School $77,004.21 
   Augusta School District $28,308.24 
   Great Salt Bay Community School $4,947.41 
   Hartland Public Library $384 
   South Bristol Elementary School $864 
   Woodland Public Library $1,191.12 
   The E-Rate program provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. This funding represents the discounts schools will receive for specific telecommunications services. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries. 
   The E-rate's first funding priority is for telecommunications services and Internet access, and the second funding priority is for internal connections and wiring at schools and libraries - beginning with the neediest applicants first - until the $2.1 billion fund is exhausted.
