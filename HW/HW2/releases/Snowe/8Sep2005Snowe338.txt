SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES ARMY CONTRACT FOR ALMOST $7 MILLION AWARDED TO SACO FACTORY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today announced that a contract for $6,596,850 has been awarded to Saco Defense, a gun making factory located in Saco.  
 The factory will produce 398 M2 machine guns for the Army. 
   "Saco Defense is a world-renowned gun factory and it is only fitting that they were awarded this contract," said Snowe. "We must make sure that our troops are well-armed and prepared with adequate ammunitions and I am proud that Maine can contribute to this effort." 
   Saco Defense is one of the world's leading producers of small and medium caliber machine guns, cannon barrels and complementary equipment. It is the sole producer of the MK-19 40mm automatic grenade launcher for the U.S. armed forces, and is in the final stages of development of a next-generation automatic grenade launcher called Striker. Saco Defense products are in the inventories of more than 40 countries; they complement the high-rate-of-fire Gatling-type weapons produced by General Dynamics Armament Systems.
