SEN. SNOWE WELCOMES HOME 94TH MILITARY POLICE COMPANY
  After two tour extensions and reported mechanical problems with a transport plane, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today welcomed home the men and women of the 94th Military Police Company. The Company arrived at Fort Drum, NY from the Middle East at approximately 11:30 a.m. EST after being deployed over two-and-a-half years out of the past four years in combat theaters.
   "Finally, on this beautiful summer morning, the servicemen and women of the 94th have safely returned to the U.S. after nearly three years of dedicated service overseas. The 94th have proudly represented the United States in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and now will partake in the extended rest that they rightly deserve," said Snowe. "I join with all Mainers and the nation in extending our sincerest gratitude and 'welcome home' to these valiant men and women."
   The 94th Military Policy Company served two-and-a-half out of the past four years deployed in combat theaters in Bosnia and the Middle East. Just 18 months prior to their assignment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 94th completed a 9 month tour in Bosnia. The unit deployed to Iraq in April 2003 and, in September 2003, was extended as part of the 12 month "Boots on the Ground" policy. The most recent extension came in mid-April 2004 when DoD announced they would be extended the 94th's deployment in Iraq for yet up to another 120 days.
   On June 7, Snowe and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) held a meeting in Washington with the families of the 94th after the families attended a meeting with Defense Department officials arranged by the Senators.
