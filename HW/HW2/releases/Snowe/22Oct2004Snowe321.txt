SEN. SNOWE URGES HHS TO REVIEW MAINE'S UNIQUE FLU VACCINE NEEDS AS EMERGENCY DOSES ARE SENT TO STATES ACROSS COUNTRY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today urged the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to recognize the unique needs of individual states, particularly Maine, and to ensure that those available doses of flu vaccine are targeted to those at greatest risk. Snowe sent a letter to HHS Secretary Thompson today commending the Department's efforts to respond to the shortage, while recommending some possible solutions to help the State of Maine that has been hit particularly hard by the vaccine shortage.  
   "I commend you and the Department for your work to establish and communicate new recommendations on flu vaccination, and your assurance to the public that HHS will pursue solutions to this shortage. It is essential to see our limited vaccine resources best utilized to address the needs of those most at-risk," Snowe wrote in a letter to Secretary Thompson today. 
   On October 5th, the Chiron Corporation announced that they would be unable to supply influenza vaccine for the 2004-2005 flu season resulting in the loss of approximately half of the U.S. supply of influenza vaccine. The Chiron Corporation and Aventis Pasteur are the only two flu vaccine manufacturers with licenses in the United States. Maine has been particularly impacted as 123,000 of the 150,000 doses the State Government ordered came from Chiron. 
   "It has been brought to my attention that health care providers seeking or offering supplies of vaccine have been referred to local health departments. Such departments are largely absent in Maine and some other states and, even when they exist, state-wide vaccine shortages may prevent the effective allocation of supply to comply with the CDC's new recommendations. This jeopardizes the effective distribution of the doses of vaccine that have already been shipped. I urge the CDC to help providers to more quickly and effectively report their vaccine needs or excess inventory. By creating a central repository for information either by phone or website, vaccine not needed for low-risk individuals could be matched with those providers needing additional vaccine for those at high risk for flu complications," continued Snowe. 
   "I must also emphasize how crucial it is for the CDC to consider each state's unique needs in allocating new shipments of vaccine. With approximately 60,000 additional doses now allocated to Maine by the CDC, our state government will have only approximately 93,000 of the 150,000 doses originally ordered. Our hospitals, clinics and other providers have little product as well, having also ordered vaccine primarily from the Chiron Corporation. The combined shortfall is approximately 150,000 doses - without which Maine cannot implement the CDC vaccination guidelines," wrote Snowe. 
   Snowe noted that Maine's state government order was almost exclusively for high risk individuals who are in the CDC Interim Vaccine Recommendation groups, as is the case for the orders of many health care providers as well. 
   "The unique population characteristics of Maine make a simple allocation to states of only half their original Chiron order an inappropriate means of distributing this essential vaccine. For example, Maine has the seventh greatest proportion of residents 65 years of age and older. Such a disproportionately large senior population requires some adjustment of the allocation, just as the number of individuals in each of the risk groups should also be taken into account," said Snowe in the letter. 
   Snowe also believes that if more firms produced vaccine, the impact of a single plant problem would be much less. "I appreciate the efforts of the FDA to evaluate the possible use of vaccine from ID Biomedical of Canada. This firm has projected that it could supply 10 to 15 million doses of flu vaccine next year. I urge FDA to promptly evaluate the application of ID Biomedical as well as those of other potential producers in order to expeditiously begin the process of expanding and diversifying our vaccine supply before next year, so that our vaccine supply will be improved. This is particularly important as it appears uncertain whether the license of the Chiron Corporation will be reinstated in time to produce vaccine for the next flu season," said Snowe. 
   "I believe it is critical that the 33 million doses of the Aventis Pasteur vaccine that have been already distributed not be misused. Instead they should be targeted to those specified by the CDC Interim Vaccine Recommendations. I commend the work of the CDC in communicating these recommendations, and urge continued efforts to allocate vaccine to serve those at greatest risk," continue Snowe. 
   According to the CDC, the following priority groups for vaccination are: 
   * All children aged 6-23 months; 
  * Adults aged 65 years and older; 
  * Persons aged 2-64 years with underlying chronic medical conditions; 
  * All women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; 
  * Residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities; 
  * Children aged 6 months-18 years on chronic aspirin therapy; 
  * Health-care workers involved in direct patient care; and 
  * Out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged 6 months. 
   Influenza results in approximately 36,000 American deaths per year. The United States has made great progress in improving vaccinations, approximately doubling the vaccination rates in high risk groups in the 1990's. 
   Snowe has cosponsored legislation with Senator Jack Reid (D-RI) to give the nation's health agencies the tools they need to protect the public health from the danger of influenza, and to maximize the value of our reduced vaccine stocks. The bill provides for the purchase of vaccine for use in high-risk populations from those who serve low-risk populations. It also provides the expedited approval and purchase of additional stocks of vaccine that have already been approved by regulatory authorities in Europe, Canada and Japan.
