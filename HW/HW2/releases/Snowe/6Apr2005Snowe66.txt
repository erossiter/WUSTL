SEN. SNOWE HAILS WOMEN'S HEALTH VICTORY
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today hailed Senate passage of legislation that would overturn the "global gag rule", a policy originally imposed by executive order which withholds funds from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that engage in a wide range of activities, including providing advice, counseling, or information regarding abortion. Sen. Snowe strongly supports this legislation, which passed by a vote of 52 to 46 and was offered by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in the form of an amendment to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act.  
   "We cannot allow the abortion debate to undermine our humanitarian efforts," said Snowe. "Voluntary family planning can prevent maternal and child deaths, unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, restricting funds to organizations that provide a wide range of safe and effective family-planning services has the perverse effect of bringing about more abortions, not fewer." 
   The global gag rule (also dubbed the "Mexico City policy" after the city in which it was announced) prohibits NGOs that receive federal funds from providing women with family planning services even if an NGO uses its own money to provide those services. The Bush administration expanded the global gag rule to cover the entire State Department budget, currently more than $8 billion. A wide variety of State Department programs could be vulnerable to this policy. 
   "The global gag rule infringes on a woman's right to personal, private medical care," continued Snowe. "This is not a question of performing or promoting abortion overseas - since at least 1973, it has been illegal to spend taxpayer dollars on such activities, and no violation of has ever been reported - this is a question of making sensible medical care available to women."
