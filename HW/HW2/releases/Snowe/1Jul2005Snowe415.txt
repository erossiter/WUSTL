SEN. SNOWE WORKS TO KEEP MBNA JOBS IN MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today met with Bank of America President for the Northeast Anne Finucane to urge the company to preserve all of the 3,000 MBNA positions currently in Maine.  
 Bank of America announced today that it has purchased MBNA and plans to eliminate 6,000 of the combined companies' 200,000 employees nationwide. Bank of America currently has employees in Maine, but they do not perform the same functions as MBNA employees in the state. Ms. Finucane told Snowe that Bank of America recognizes that the MBNA employees in Maine are highly skilled, dedicated workers who contribute greatly to their company's success. 
   "I discussed with Ms. Finucane the critical importance of retaining these workers, and I will continue to be in contact with her and Bank of America as this process moves forward," said Snowe. "These jobs are crucial to Maine, helping support families, businesses, and our economy - I will do all I can to ensure they remain in Maine." 
   MBNA has approximately 3,000 employees in Maine. 2,000 of these are located in Belfast, while 1,000 more are located in Fort Kent, Presque Isle, Farmington, Portland, Orono, and Brunswick.
