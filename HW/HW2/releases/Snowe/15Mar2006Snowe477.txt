SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO BRING FISCAL DISCIPLINE BACK TO BUDGET PROCESS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today cosponsored an amendment with Sens. Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Budget to reinstate "pay-as-you-go" budget rules requiring that any additional tax reductions or mandatory spending increases be subject to a 60 vote point of order unless fully offset or "paid for," rather than deficit financed.  
   "Today, I voted to reinstate essential pay-as-you-go rules in order to bring fiscal discipline back to the budget process. This amendment is a common-sense approach to reigning in the deficit. I have long believed that we must examine both sides of the federal ledger - both revenues and spending - to bring balance to our spending blueprint. This amendment is sound policy, consistent with my principles, to raise the bar so we can address the long-term economic well-being of our nation by putting our fiscal house in order in a fair and equitable manner," said Snowe. 
   The Conrad amendment failed by a vote of.50 to 50.
