SEN. SNOWE URGES SUPPORT FOR COAST GUARD, FISHERMEN IN GULF REGION, COASTAL HABITAT
  After a meeting this morning with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and other Senate Committee Chairs, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries and the Coast Guard, proposed a variety of measures within the scope of her subcommittee to support the Coast Guard's ongoing efforts, facilitate coastal habitat restoration, and provide federal aid to fishermen whose livelihoods have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Snowe will work with Senators from the Gulf states to tailor her proposals to most effectively address needs in the affected areas.  
   "The brave and resourceful servicemen and women of the Coast Guard have carried out successful operations despite the destruction of their stations in Gulfport and Pascagoula, and they will continue their work until it is done," said Snowe. "We must give them the support they need to complete their mission now and in the future - and that includes providing ships and other assets through the Deepwater Program." 
   Snowe proposed several measures supporting the Coast Guard, including full funding for Deepwater ($1.1B), which will allow the Coast Guard to continue to provide an unprecedented level of service to the nation. Thus far as a result of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard has rescued over 32,000 people utilizing Deepwater assets (aircraft/cutters/small boats). Before this disaster struck, the House Appropriations Committee threatened to cut in half the Deepwater allocation for the next FY to $500 million, which would devastate the program. 
   Snowe also expressed concern for fishermen hit hard by hurricane Katrina and indicated she would seek a fisheries failure declaration from the Secretary of Commerce, which would release funds to states with affected fisheries, and $200 million in appropriations for this fund. 
   "The first step in helping fishermen in the Gulf region is estimating the storm's effect on stocks and assessing damage to vessels shoreside infrastructure," said Snowe. "Rebuilding the fishing industry will be a long process, but I am committed to working with my colleagues to ensure that the appropriate resources reach fishermen hit hard by Hurricane Katrina." 
   Snowe also noted the critical role of coastal habitats in mitigating floods and the need for aggressive coastal habitat restoration. The Coastal Zone Enhancement Act, introduced by Snowe, contains new and expanded grant authorization language for community and local projects to improve coastal habitats. 
   "Estuaries, marshes and wetlands serve as vital buffers against flooding, and must be protected and restored around the nation," said Snowe. "The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina underscores the vulnerability of flood-prone areas unprotected by healthy coastal habitat." 
   Following are some of Snowe's proposals: 
   COAST GUARD 
   * Full funding for the Deepwater Program ($1.1 billion). 
   * Additional funds to procure those homes of Coast Guard personnel destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. It is estimated that 70% of Coast Guard personnel stationed in the Gulf Shores region have lost their homes. 
   * Additional funds to support the additional operational hours and required maintenance of those assets deployed in support of relief operations related to Katrina. 
   * Additional funds to allow the rebuilding of those units/stations/air facilities damaged as a result of Katrina. Early estimates range from $300-$350 million. 
   FISHERIES 
   * A Fisheries Failure Declaration from the Secretary of Commerce and $200 million in appropriations for this fund. 
   COASTAL HABITATS AND ECOSYSTEMS 
   * Pass S. 360, the Coastal Zone Enhancement Act. 
   * Pass the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection (CELP) Act (S. 1215), of which Snowe is a cosponsor. This bill authorizes matching federal funds for obtaining important coastal habitats and protecting them from development. 
   * Support efforts to return a portion of offshore energy development royalties to coastal states, as long as that funding is used for coastal habitat restoration and projection.
