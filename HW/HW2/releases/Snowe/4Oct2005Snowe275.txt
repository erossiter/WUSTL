SEN. SNOWE REACTS TO NOMINATION OF MIERS TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement in response to the nomination of Harriet Miers by President Bush to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:  
   "With the President nominating Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, the Senate once again takes up its 'consent' role as expressed under the 'advice and consent' clause of the Constitution. 
   "I commend the President for embracing the spirit of diversity by nominating a woman to replace Justice O'Connor, the first woman to occupy a seat on the nation's highest Court of the land. I also applaud his efforts to reach out to Senators from both sides of the political aisle leading up to this nomination. 
   "The Senate Judiciary Committee must be allowed to thoroughly, thoughtfully, and independently evaluate her qualifications, and under Chairman Specter's leadership I am confident that will occur. 
   "As a United States Senator, I take my role in the process of approving a Supreme Court nominee very seriously and will extensively review Harriet Miers' record and the Judiciary Committee's hearings and proceedings. I believe that any Supreme Court nominee should bring a balanced approach to cases, possess a strong intellect and suitable judicial temperament, and follow a disciplined judicial methodology in reaching decisions. 
   "I will be in close contact with my colleagues, especially with our group of fourteen senators who developed the compromise to forestall a filibuster on recent judicial nominees as the Senate begins consideration of this nomination."
