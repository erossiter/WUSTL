SEN. SNOWE, FORMER GOV. MCKERNAN ISSUE STATEMENT ON PASSING OF DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT PICKER
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe and former Governor John R. McKernan, Jr. today issued the following statement on the passing of long-time Maine businessman, educator, civic leader and philanthropist, Harvey Picker: 
  "We were very saddened to learn of the passing of this extraordinary individual. Harvey was beloved by his adopted home of Camden, and Maine was truly the beneficiary of the breadth of his talents, philanthropy, and irrepressible spirit as he continued to make a difference for our quality of life in Maine during some of the most difficult challenges the state has faced."
   "In particular, then-Governor McKernan appointed Mr. Picker to both the Maine Health Care Finance Commission in 1989 and the Blue-Ribbon Commission to Overhaul the Workers' Compensation Insurance System.
   "With his service on the Maine Health Care Finance Commission and the Commission to Overhaul Workers Compensation, Harvey made invaluable contributions to the state he loved. He was a remarkable man and he will be dearly missed by all of us who were fortunate to know this wonderful person. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his two daughters, Bobbi and Gale, and Harvey's entire family."
