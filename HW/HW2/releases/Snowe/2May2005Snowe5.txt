SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS EXPRESS CONCERN FOR OX-YOKE DISPLACED WORKERS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins today announced the formation of a new Piscataquis County Transition Team to assist workers who are expected to be laid off from the Ox-Yoke Originals factory in Milo.  
 The gun care and shooting accessories company announced yesterday that it is shutting down operations in Milo, resulting in a loss of jobs for 25 full time employees and a number of part time workers, according to the Piscataquis County Economic Development Corporation. 
   "It always concerns us when workers lose their jobs through no fault of their own. This closing not only affects the employees of Ox-Yoke and their families, but the entire Milo community. We will do everything possible to assist the workers during this uncertain time." 
   The Piscataquis County Transition Team will be modeled after other successful efforts the Senators have spearheaded in communities across Maine in order to help displaced workers access available programs for job retraining, education, job search and relocation, and re-employment services, as well as other community-based services. The Senators will also support any effort by the company to obtain federal emergency funds to provide workers with Trade Adjustment Assistance.
