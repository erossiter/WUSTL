SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Olympia J Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement on the passing of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Reagan, who was the 40th President of the United States, died today at the age of 93. 
   "Today, like millions of other Americans as well as leaders and people throughout the world, Jock and I were deeply saddened to learn of President Reagan's passing. We were both fortunate to serve in the United States Congress during President Reagan's tenure, and at a time of great consequence. As President, he brought his passionate belief in the ideals of America to bear in advancing our nation and projecting the hope of freedom as a force for good in the world.
   "President Reagan's legacy will forever be his vision which was instrumental in bringing about an ultimate end to the Cold War, as well as his drive to foster liberty and democracy where previously only tyranny had thrived. And in a time and period of self-doubt in our nation, Ronald Reagan's irrepressible spirit and his conception of America as a 'shining city on the hill' engendered a sense of renewal in America. Indeed, his optimism in our nation and her people was as genuine as the man himself. Simply put, Ronald Reagan was a great American and an exceptional, beloved President who honored the office and considered it a privilege to serve. He will be missed not only here at home, but wherever freedom loving people may live.
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to his extraordinary wife Nancy and his children, Ron Reagan, Jr., Patti Davis, and Michael Reagan. All of America shares in their sense of loss on this solemn day."
