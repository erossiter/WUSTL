SEN. SNOWE SAYS MANDATORY GEAR MODIFICATIONS WILL UNREASONABLY IMPACT MAINE FISHERMEN
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, released the following statement today after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced a two week change in fishing regulations for 841-square-nautical miles off the southeast coast of Maine. The Dynamic Area Management (DAM) zone will be effective from Oct. 20 to Nov. 3 and was put into effect after whales were sighted in that region.  
   "While I understand that lobstermen must move or modify their gear when endangered whales are present, it is completely unreasonable that the sighting of three whales ten days ago translates to a requirement for nearly instantaneous gear changes in an 841 square mile area. Because of this decision, many of the 1100 licensed lobstermen in Zone A stand to lose two of what historically have been the most productive weeks of the fishery. I have asked NMFS to conduct as many additional aerial surveys as possible to ensure that these regulations are lifted the moment the whales leave the area. If this decision stands, our fishermen will be forced once again to bear the cost of this inflexible policy that imposes rigid, blanket regulations that leave no room for common sense or accountability to our local affected communities." 
   The whales were sighted on October 5th, triggering the DAM zone under regulations that are part of the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan. This is the first time such regulatory measures have been proposed for this area of the Gulf of Maine.
