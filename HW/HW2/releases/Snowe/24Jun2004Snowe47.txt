SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES MAINE FUNDING IN FY 2005 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today said many of Maine's highest priorities are met in the National Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year (FY) 2005, which passed the Senate late last night by a unanimous vote of 97 to 0. Snowe said she is especially pleased that the funding will help ensure stable workloads for Bath Iron Works and continuing projects for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery for the coming year, while supporting a range of Maine companies and institutions that contract with the Department of Defense. 
   Snowe has been a leader in fighting for shipbuilding funds, and worked with Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) to support funding requests important to Maine contractors and priorities. The over $5 billion included in the legislation will support construction of three DDG-51 Arleigh-Burke class destroyers.
   "This legislation is good for Maine, while maintaining a strong commitment for our nation's defense, with authorization for the significant shipbuilding investments the Navy and nation need for the 21st century, particularly at a time when we continue to prosecute the global war on terror," said Snowe, who as chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower from 1998-2001 investigated and uncovered the gap in shipbuilding procurement.
   "As former chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I have been long concerned about the downward trend in naval shipbuilding that is moving us inexorably toward a Navy of 250 ships or less. We cannot afford to risk this essential component of our worldwide defense force," Snowe said. "After all, 80 percent of the world's population lives along the coastal plains, and it is the Navy that has the capability to project power in regional coastal flashpoints - a capability that is imperative if we are to maintain military superiority, and defend America's national interest." Snowe has been insistent that the legislation include funding for three surface combatants annually - a goal reflected in the legislation.
   Senator Snowe said the funding support provided for Maine projects speaks to the outstanding reputation earned by contractors, workers, and researchers in the state on defense issues.
   Highlights of the Senate-passed Defense Authorization bill on priorities for Maine requested and supported by Senator Snowe include authorization for:
   Bath Iron Works
   * $3.5 billion in funding for construction of three DDG-51 Arleigh-Burke class destroyers of the type built by Bath Iron Works.
   * $1.5 billion in funding for research, development, test and evaluation of the Land Attack Destroyer Program, or DD-X, the next-generation surface combatant ship. Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipyard will both be involved in the design of this new family of ships.
   * $352.1 million in funding for development of focused mission modules that will be used for the Littoral Combat Ship, a smaller Navy combatant being developed for warfare and patrol of coastal waters. Bath Iron Works is among three competitors in the design competition for the new class of vessels.
   Brunswick Naval Air Station
   * $26.8 million for procurement of anti-surface warfare improvement program kits for P-3 aircraft, used by the squadrons stationed at Brunswick Naval Air Station for their Naval missions.
   Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
   * $5 million for the High Performance Brush Program. These prototype metal fiber brushes have demonstrated the capability to significantly enhance performance and reduce maintenance costs of a variety of submarine shipboard motors and generators. Additionally, operational submarine fleet commanders strongly support this program.
   General Dynamics Armament Systems, Saco
   * $10 million for the Mk47 Mod 0 Striker for Special Operations Command. Integrating the latest sensing, targeting and computer programming technology, the MK47 is a simple, reliable, highly portable 40mm machine gun usable by the combat soldier in small, mobile tactical units. The Special Operations Command included MK47/ Striker40 as the number five priority on its FY2005 Unfinanced Requirements List.
   * $8.5 million for the XM307 25 mm advanced crew served weapons, which is the next generation replacement for current heavy and grenade machine guns.
   * $6 million in funding authority for the Kiowa Warrior, OH-58D Safety Enhancement Program, a weapons system used for modification of the Army's reconnaissance helicopter system to increase range, maneuverability, and mission performance. The funding is anticipated to enhance the safety and reliability of the weapons system, and General Dynamics Armament Systems in Saco is expected to be a competitor for the funding.
   * $4 million for the XM312.50 caliber advanced crew served weapons, which is the next generation replacement for the M2 .50 caliber machine gun. The funding is for a low-rate initial production and related improvement and integration costs for XM312 .50 caliber Machine guns.
   United Technologies/Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Division, North Berwick
   * A total of $60 million in funding for F-16 and F-15 aircraft engine upgrades, enabling purchase of F100-PW-229 engines to convert Air National Guard Block 42 F-16 aircraft. The upgrades enhance performance, speed, thrust and maneuverability, bringing older aircraft to standards virtually identical to the newer Block 52-F-16 aircraft, at a savings of more than 15 percent over the cost of a new aircraft. Funding also supports upgrade and conversion of existing F-15 aircraft engines used by the nation's Air National Guard fleet for increased combat power and versatility. These aircraft, the foundation of the nation's air-to-air fleet, are increasingly being used for homeland security purposes. Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Division in North Berwick manufactures engine parts integral to these upgrades.
   University of Maine, Orono
   * $3 million in funding authorization for the Center of Excellence on Advanced Structures and Composites, to conduct applied research on new materials, systems, and methods for Army forward operating base construction applications.
   * $1 million in funding for the Structural Reliability of Fiber Re-enforced Polymers, a research project being conducted by the University of Maine in concert with Applied Thermal Sciences Inc. In Orono. The project is aimed at developing a specialized structural reliability analysis process to optimize use of polymers in future ship construction.
   Fiber Materials, Inc., Biddeford
   * $7 million in funding authorization for development of advanced composite materials used to reduce the weight of missile structures used in a variety of advanced interceptor airframes. Fiber Materials in Biddeford competes for the funding.
