SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES VOLUNTEER BLOOD DONOR MONTH
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today encouraged all able Mainers to donate blood this month.  
 January has been recognized as National Volunteer Blood Donor Month by every president of the United States since 1970 in recognition of the vital lifesaving efforts performed daily by citizens who donate blood for patients in need.
   "While we should certainly applaud the contributions made by Americans to saving the lives of their fellow citizens," said Snowe, "we must also recognize that the American Red Cross is having trouble recruiting enough donors to keep up with demand. I encourage every eligible resident of Maine to donate blood and help stem the nationwide shortage."
   Recent winter storms and a high rate of colds and flu have seriously impacted Maine's blood reserves. Blood donations in Maine are approximately 400 pints below expected levels for the month of January. Consequently, donors of all blood types are needed at this time.
   It is only through the efforts of donors that the American Red Cross can provide for people whose lives depend upon blood transfusions. However, it is becoming more and more difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of blood donors to meet the ever increasing need for blood due to more sophisticated medical procedures and an aging population. 
   All eligible donors, as well as people who have never given blood before, are urged to call 1-800-GIVE-LIFE or visit www.newenglandblood.org for more information or to schedule an appointment to donate.
