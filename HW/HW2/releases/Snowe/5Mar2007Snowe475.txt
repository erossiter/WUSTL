SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM NATIONAL YOUNG LEADERS CONFERENCE ON MARCH 5
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Monday, March 5, met with high school students participating in the National Young Leaders Conference. Kseniya Levina of Portland and Megan Samson of Lisbon Falls took part in the six-day program.  
   "The NYLC program has a rich history of offering students first-hand political experience in the nation's capitol," said Senator Snowe. "I enjoyed meeting with Kseniya and Levina during their week-long adventure in Washington and hope they will continue to utilize their leadership skills when returning home to Maine." 
   The National Young Leaders Conference is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council. Students spend the week meeting with members of Congress, participating in interactive activities, and debating current issues. The program is designed to educate and inspire future leaders who desire an opportunity to learn outside of the program.
