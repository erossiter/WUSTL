SEN. SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL WITH SENS. SMITH, BINGAMAN TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION ON MEDICAID
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, joined Sens. Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) in cosponsoring the Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the Medically Underserved Act of 2005 to provide a comprehensive review of the program. 
   "Today, I am pleased to join with my colleagues Senators Gordon Smith and Jeff Bingaman in introducing legislation that would undertake a long overdue comprehensive review of the Medicaid program and make recommendations to strengthen the program," said Snowe. "With increased pressure on the Medicaid program, the federal government cannot abandon its responsibility to the states for helping to provide and expand access to health care for the low-income and uninsured Americans. We must continue to provide sufficient federal funding for Medicaid and we must proceed cautiously before making any significant changes in the program. The Medicaid Commission established by this bill would allow us to have a thorough and complete examination of the program before we undertake any alterations to a program that has proven so successful."
   The Medicaid Commission would be charged with a number of duties, including reviewing and making recommendations with respect to the long-term goals, populations served, financial sustainability (federal and state responsibility), interaction with Medicare and the uninsured, and the quality of care provided. 
   Snowe points to the overwhelming financial burden that states nationwide are experiencing due to Medicaid. In Maine, for example, Medicaid now consumes 26 percent of state healthcare spending. According to the National Governor's Association, total Medicaid costs are growing at a rate of 12 percent per year. Total Medicaid expenditures now exceed that of Medicare due primarily to factors beyond states' control, especially the costs of long-term care: nationally, Medicaid now accounts for 50 percent of all state long-term care spending and covers 70 percent of those in nursing homes. According to the Governor's most recent survey, Medicaid spending nationwide now averages 22 percent of overall state budgets. 
   Snowe is also concerned by the potential impact the new Medicare prescription drug program will have on Medicaid since it will shift federal expenditures for drug benefits currently provided by Medicaid to the "dual eligible" population - those who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare - from the Medicaid program to Medicare. However, this will not lift most of the financial responsibility and burden of their prescription drug costs from the states. 
   "Many questions exist about the ultimate impact of the Medicare drug program on state budgets and Medicaid programs. One of the primary duties of the Medicaid Commission would be to review and make recommendations on the interaction of Medicaid with Medicare and other Federal health programs," continued Snowe.
   The Medicaid Commission established by this bill would be required to review the Federal matching payments and requirements under Medicaid and make recommendations on how to make such payments more equitable with respect to the states and the populations they serve and more responsive to changes in states' economic conditions.
   "The tremendous complex responsibilities, financing, and interrelationships of Medicaid and Medicare demonstrate why a Medicaid Commission is absolutely necessary for the future survival of the Medicaid program. This legislation will help sustain and improve this critical health care safety net," said Snowe.
   The bill's Medicaid Commission would be comprised of 23 members that reflect all the stakeholders and components in the Medicaid program. Those members include the following:
   * One Member appointed by the President
   * Two House members (current or former) appointed by the Speaker and Minority Leader
   * Two Senators (current or former) appointed by the Majority and Minority Leader 
   * Two Governors designated by NGA
   * Two Legislators designated by NCSL
   * Two state Medicaid director designated by NASMD
   * One Local elected official appointed by Comptroller General 
   * Four consumer advocates appointed by congressional leadership 
   * Four providers appointed by congressional leadership
   * Two program experts appointed by Comptroller General
   The Commission has just one a year to hold public hearings, conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, and the public.
   This legislation has endorsements from the National Association of Community Health Centers, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Association of Counties, American Hospital Association, National Association of Children's Hospitals, National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, American Health Care Association, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, AIDS Institute, American Association of Family Physicians, among others.
   The Medicaid program, the health insurance program jointly funded by the federal government and the states, provides essential medical services to low-income and uninsured children and their families, pregnant women, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and sometimes others. Last year nearly 55 million Americans were enrolled in the Medicaid program.
