   "Today's announcement by MBNA to close its Rockland facility is indeed terrible news for the entire Rockland community. While senior MBNA executives have assured me that those affected workers will have the opportunity to work at their Belfast facility, I am nonetheless disappointed by their decision. To the workers and their families, I pledge my unconditional support in working to assist them in any way through these difficult times."
