SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE TASK FORCE TO ASSIST PISCATAQUIS COUNTY
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins today announced the formation of a new Piscataquis County Transition Task Force to assist workers who have been recently laid off.  
 The first meeting of the Transition Task Force will take place Wednesday, April 13th at the Penquis CAP office in Dover-Foxcroft. Community leaders from across Piscataquis County have been invited. 
   "The communities in Piscataquis County have been greatly impacted by a rash of layoffs and closings in recent years," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Through no fault of their own, many people have lost their jobs and this has caused needless grief and suffering within families and communities. We pledge to do everything possible to assist those residents that have been negatively impacted. It is our hope that the formation of this task force is just one of many critical steps toward providing relief and necessary services to those that need it most." 
   The Piscataquis County Transition Task Force will perform work similar to that done by the Penobscot Task Force and put together a booklet that will serve the needs of the men and women who have been laid off as well as define what the needs of the area are with regards to re-employment options and services. It will be modeled after other successful efforts the Senators have spearheaded in communities across Maine in order to help displaced workers access available programs for job retraining, education, job search and relocation, and re-employment services, as well as other community-based services.
