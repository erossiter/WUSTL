SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1.3 MILLION IN E-RATE FUNDING TO IMPROVE MODERN TECHNOLOGY FOR MAINE SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICTS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that various Maine schools, libraries and Administrative Districts will share in $1,300,000 in funding discounts under the E-Rate program, which she and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) authored as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Today's announcement is part of the sixth year of E-Rate funding for schools and libraries in Maine and nationally during the coming months; since the program began in 1998, Maine has received more than $27 million.  
   "I am so pleased to announce this funding today. Senator Rockefeller and I worked into the waning hours of the 108th Congress to encourage our colleagues to put politics aside and secure this funding. This funding will allow schools and libraries across the nation, and in Maine specifically, to stay connected to the internet and provide current technologies to students that otherwise might have had to go without, " said Snowe. 
   "Maine schools and libraries are improving their telecommunications options and access to the Internet with this support. I am very pleased that these schools and libraries will join hundreds funded in previous rounds of funding. Since the E-Rate program began, it has helped bring exciting new technologies to more than one million classrooms and libraries nationwide," said Snowe, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which wrote the telecommunications reform law. "The Snowe-Rockefeller E-Rate program will ensure these funding award winners have the opportunity to join communities around the nation in linking America's schools and libraries to the technologies and skills that will be needed to prepare students for the global job market of the 21st century." 
   The E-Rate program provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. This funding represents the discounts schools will receive for specific telecommunications services. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries. 
   The E-rate's first funding priority is for telecommunications services and Internet access, and the second funding priority is for internal connections and wiring at schools and libraries - beginning with the neediest applicants first - until the $2.1 billion fund is exhausted. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller gained the inclusion of their E-rate provision in the telecommunications reform bill by a single vote in the Senate Commerce Committee; successfully fought back an effort on the Senate floor to remove the provision from the bill; and defended the E-rate during the two and one-half year implementation process at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) while ensuring it was implemented in a manner consistent with the language of the law and intent of the authors. 
   "Since we established this program, the impact on Maine schools and communities has been immense," Snowe said. "Students attending the schools, or utilizing libraries, receiving funding today will have greater access to research, a better understanding of technology, and will ultimately be better prepared for their future."
