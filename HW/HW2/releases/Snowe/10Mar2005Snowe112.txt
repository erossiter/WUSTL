SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR PRIDE MANUFACTURING WORKERS IN GUILFORD
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that displaced Pride Manufacturing workers in Guilford, Maine have been granted Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).  
   "The economic hardship faced by workers and their families when a company is forced to close is always difficult," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "In order to be able to rejoin the workforce in a timely manner, it is imperative that the laid-off workers of Pride Manufacturing receive support and additional training. The services provided by TAA and ATAA will be instrumental in getting these workers back on their feet." 
   The workers at Pride Manufacturing produced wood products, including shapes, knobs, and gallery rail spindles. Sales and employment have decreased compared to last year due to an increase in similar imported goods so the company has been forced to close its doors. 
   Because the TAA and ATAA petitions were approved by the Department of Labor, the displaced workers of Pride Manufacturing will have access to such benefits as training, education, job search and relocation allowances, and re-employment services including counseling, interview training, and resume assistance. Health care tax credits and unemployment benefits extensions are also established for a company that has received TAA certification. 
   Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is a program for older workers displaced by trade. It is granted if a significant number of workers at the firm are age 50 or over and possess skills that are not easily transferable.
