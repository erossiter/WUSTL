SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS INEQUITIES IN IMMIGRATION LAW THAT HAVE HURT MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, today announced she is cosponsoring legislation to confront an H2B visa problem that directly hurts small businesses around the country, particularly in seasonally dependent states like Maine. This bill is an extension of legislation enacted last spring that created an exemption for returning workers who have previously worked legally with an H2B visa. If Congress does not act, this temporary fix will expire September 30, 2006.  
   "Our seasonally-dependent economy requires that businesses throughout Maine be able to hire the workers they need to accommodate the thousands of visitors who come to our state each year," said Snowe. "This is not a partisan immigration issue - it is an issue of economic fairness for small businesses across the country. This extension is not a long-term solution, but it is absolutely necessary to prevent the labor shortages which will inevitably occur in Maine this summer if we do not act."
   The H2B visa program allows businesses with seasonal needs to hire foreign workers to supplement their permanent and seasonal US workforce. These H2B workers fulfill a variety of short-term seasonal needs for employers when there are not enough US workers available. H2B employers need workers who are landscapers, lifeguards, seafood processors, ski instructors, horse trainers, resort workers, and carnival workers.
   In 2004, the H2B visa cap for Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 was reached in March, 2004, severely impacting year-round American jobs and small business owners whose livelihoods depend on a successful summer season. The cap for FY 2005 was reached even earlier, in January 2005. 
   In Maine, approximately 87,000 jobs are directly tied to the success of tourism, which generates $13.9 billion for Maine's economy and $556 million in state tax revenue.
