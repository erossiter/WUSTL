SEN. SNOWE REACTS TO NAVY'S DECISION TO TERMINATE LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP CONTRACT
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement after Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead announced this morning the termination of the fourth littoral combat ship (LCS 4) contract.  
   "I'm certainly disappointed in the outcome," Sen. Snowe said. "I have been assured by Secretary of the Navy Winter of the Navy's continuing commitment to this extraordinarily versatile ship and to the LCS program. Moving forward, I'm optimistic about BIW's future participation in the continuing LCS program where BIW will continue to demonstrate how we have the premier shipbuilders in the world." 
   The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is a small, fast surface combatant that is to be equipped with modular mission packages, including unmanned vehicles (UVs). Two industry teams, led by Lockheed Martin Corp. and General Dynamics-BIW, have been participating in the LCS program. Each team was originally contracted to construct two ships. Significant cost overruns ensued during initial construction of the first ships which lead to subsequent discussions with both teams to renegotiate their respective contracts. Because the Navy and GD-BIW were unable to reach an agreement, the Navy terminated the contract for the second GD-BIW ship. General Dynamics continues to build LCS 2, constructing the ship in Alabama with the management and design team functions being completed by BIW. The Navy eventually plans to build a total of 55 LCS ships and BIW will play a role in future projects.
