SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $35,000 FEDERAL GRANT FOR ANSON-MADISON-STARKS AMBULANCE SERVICE
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today announced that the Anson-Madison-Starks Ambulance Service has received a federal grant in the amount of $35,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program. These funds will be used to purchase a new ambulance to replace the department's current ambulance, which is eight years old with very high mileage. 
   "The communities of Anson, Madison, and Starks rely on the ambulance service to respond in the event of an emergency," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This funding will help the department purchase a new, life-saving vehicle that can more efficiently and safely serve the residents of rural Somerset County."
