   "It is vital that the state address the needs of people experiencing homelessness in order to help them make the shift to living on their own and pursuing gainful employment. This will not only be beneficial to the individuals receiving aid, but to the health of the community overall." 
   HUD's Continuum of Care (CoC) approach helps communities across America address the problems of homelessness in a coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic fashion. A CoC is a community's plan to organize and deliver housing and services that meet the specific needs of homeless individuals and families as they move toward stable housing and maximum self-sufficiency. 
   The services that were awarded in this HUD CoC include: the Supportive Housing Program which assists homeless providers to acquire, build, renovate and operate facilities that serve homeless families and individuals; the Shelter Plus Care Program which provides rental assistance to disabled homeless persons; and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy Program which provides rental assistance to homeless persons living in single room occupancy projects.
