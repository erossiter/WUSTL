SEN. SNOWE TO MEET WITH U.S. AIRWAYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ON JAN. 24
  In her Washington office on Wednesday, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) met with US Airway's Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker to discuss the merger offer between US Airways and Delta, focusing on the potential, long-term impact on Maine and other rural states. Sen. Olympia Snowe met with Delta Airline's Chief Executive Officer Gerald Grinstein last week. Tomorrow at the Senate Commerce Committee hearing, both Chief Executive Officers will answer questions regarding the proposed merger.  
   "Over the past week, I have met with the CEOs from US Airways and Delta Airlines to voice my concerns about the proposed merger and its impact on flight service in Maine," said Senator Snowe. "A robust transportation network is critical to the development of rural states like Maine and tomorrow I will join my Commerce Committee colleagues in questioning both CEOs to ensure aviation service in our state and our nation thrives." 
   Snowe is a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees the nation's airline industry.
