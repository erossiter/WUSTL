   The funding is distributed as follows: 
   * $50,000 grant to the Washington Hancock Community Agency. The funds will be used to expand the Experiential Tourism Incubator Without Walls Project. The project provides businesses with training and networking opportunities to create full-time jobs.

   The USDA Rural Development program provides financial loans and grants to help improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America .
