SEN. SNOWE URGES RELEASE OF PORTION OF STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE TO COMBAT HIGH GAS PRICES
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement calling for the release of a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to combat the spike in gas and oil prices that has been caused by the closure of the British Petroleum pipeline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska two days ago:  
   With the tight global supply of oil made even tighter by BP's shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, skyrocketing demand and an increasingly insecure world, there is no question that our nation is experiencing an energy crisis. Accordingly, I believe the President should release a commensurate portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counteract this latest disruption in supply that is affecting our entire nation. This is an appropriate short-term response to combat a dangerous spike in oil and gas prices that could well impact our economic growth - disproportionately affecting our most vulnerable citizens. 
  The shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay operation represents a significant decrease in supply - roughly 8 percent of America's crude oil production. This latest disruption, coupled with world events, has pushed the price of oil close to the inflation adjusted record high of $85 dollars a barrel. And it is without question that these high energy costs have an effect on our economy and must be swiftly addressed.
  The economic ripple effect of high gasoline and energy prices is most acutely felt by our country's rural communities and poorest families. Traveling throughout Maine, I have heard from countless Mainers who are struggling to cope with these current prices that could reach $3.30 a gallon. As a nation we must act - and we can act by releasing a proportionate amount of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help Americans through these difficult times.
