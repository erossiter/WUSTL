SEN. SNOWE HAILS SENATE PANEL'S APPROVAL OF BILL TO IMPROVE COASTAL MAPPING
  Sen. Olympia Snowe, Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries and the Coast Guard and a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation today hailed committee approval of the "Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act" (S. 364), legislation Snowe cosponsored.  
 This bill was introduced by Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) earlier this year. 
   "In numerous cases throughout the country, including in the Gulf of Maine, knowledge of the ocean floor plays a critical part in sustainably managing our marine resources," said Snowe. "This bill will create a coordinated approach to our nation's ocean mapping, bringing together all parties involved in ocean mapping to collaborate and pool their resources and infrastructure." 
   The legislation approved today: 
   * Directs NOAA to work with other federal agencies to develop a coordinated and comprehensive Federal ocean and coastal mapping plan that will serve a number of purposes, including enhancing ecosystem-based approaches to marine resource management and advancing ocean and coastal science. 
   * Establishes an Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping to work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) program. 
   * Authorizes the establishment of Hydrographic Centers of Excellence at academic institutions to carry out basic research, develop new technologies, and conduct mapping. 
   * Requires the Administrator of NOAA and the Interagency Committee to submit implementation plans and progress reports to Congress. 
   * Establishes funding levels of $20, $26, $32, and $38 million for fiscal years 2006-2009, respectively, and $45 million for fiscal years 2010-2013. 
   The legislation now proceeds to the full Senate for its consideration.
