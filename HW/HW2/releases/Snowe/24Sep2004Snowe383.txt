SEN. SNOWE ENSURES SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE TO REMAIN OPEN IN RUMFORD
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that she has secured the assurance from SSA's New England Regional Commissioner, Manuel Vaz, that there are "no plans to close the Rumford, ME Social Security office."  
 Snowe, who took action after learning of the possible closure of the SSA office in Rumford, issued the following statement: 
   "I am pleased that the Social Security Administration is committed to retaining its Rumford office, which serves as countless constituents in the surrounding communities. The services of the SSA in assisting Mainers with understanding the complexities of their social security benefits is vital to countless individuals who rely on the entitlement to live," said Snowe. "I will continue to work with Commissioner Vaz to further ensure that there are no disruptions of services as the Rumford office seeks to increase its staff." 
   Snowe was informed that due to attrition rates, the Rumford office of the SSA has decreased to 3 full-time staff members to handle the vast requests for services by Mainers. However, efforts to increase staffing are ongoing. Additionally, to alleviate excessive workloads and prevent backlog in the interium, some casework has been temporarily transferred to the SSA's Auburn office.
