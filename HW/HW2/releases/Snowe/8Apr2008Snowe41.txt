SEN. SNOWE CALLS ON FTC TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY TO PREVENT MANIPULATION OF ENERGY MARKET
  At today's hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exercise its authority to prohibit manipulation of petroleum markets that was granted to it under the Energy Bill that was signed in December of last year. Senator Snowe also announced that Senators Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) have joined her in sending a letter to the FTC urging them to utilize this new authority. 
   "Record energy prices and industry profits are coming at a time when supply and demand suggest that prices should be significantly lower," Senator Snowe said. "In December, the President signed into law legislation that mandated that the FTC has jurisdiction into manipulation of prices. At this time, the FTC has not issued regulations on this additional mandate. It is essential the FTC work expeditiously on this new authority and it is unacceptable that this new law should be unused by the Commission when energy prices are skyrocketing by 16 percent just over 4 months!"
   Under the Energy Bill (Section 811) signed into law in December, the FTC was granted specific authority to impose civil penalties for market manipulation. This section makes it unlawful for "any person, directly or indirectly to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the FTC may prescribe." This certainly expands the FTC to consider manipulation within the futures markets. The legislation signed into law allows the FTC to issue regulations and pursue this manipulative behavior, but none have been issued at this time.
