SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS SUPPORT FOR 'ROMEO JULIET' PRODUCTION AT MONMOUTH THEATER
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Theater at Monmouth is one of 36 theater companies to have been selected to participate in the National Endowment for the Arts' Shakespeare for a New Generation program for the 2006-2007 school year. This is their third year receiving this grant and participating in this program. With the matching grant that it was awarded, the company will tour Romeo and Juliet, providing performances and educational activities for high school students throughout Maine.  
   "We are incredibly excited that our local Monmouth Theater has received such a prestigious award and the overwhelming support of the National Endowment for the Arts," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The program that Monmouth will present to youth throughout the state of Maine will expose them to a cultural experience that they otherwise might have missed out on. It is clear that, given its tradition of high quality artistic programming, the theater at Monmouth is perfectly suited to carrying out the goals of this educational series." 
   Since 2003, the National Endowment for the Arts has awarded 82 Shakespeare in American Communities grants to professional theater companies, providing hundreds of towns and 18 military bases- across all 50 states- live performances of Shakespeare. More than one million high school students have attended these productions, which have introduced many of them to live theater. In addition, the Arts Endowment has developed and distributed a multimedia Shakespeare educational kit free of charge to 35,000 middle and high school teachers. They estimate that nearly twelve million students have benefited from their Shakespeare materials.
