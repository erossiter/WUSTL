SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON COURT'S SOFTWOOD LUMBER SPLIT DECISION
  The London Court of International Arbitration ruled today that Canada violated the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) by failing to implement required export quotas on Canadian lumber during a "surge" in such shipments in early 2007. The arbitral panel also decided against the United States by finding that British Columbia and Alberta had not failed to pay sufficient surge export taxes on their lumber during that period.  
   U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement regarding the court's decision:
   "While I am pleased that the panel recognized that Canada had failed to honor its commitments to implement export restraints during the months it was flooding the U.S. market with cheap lumber, I am disappointed with their decision to allow the provinces responsible for the greatest portion of the problem to evade export taxes by ignoring expected sales to the United States, counter to the intent of the parties. With Canada also violating its obligations not to introduce new subsidies and to fully collect the primary export taxes required by the agreement, this decision only confirms the need for tougher enforcement action against Canada."
