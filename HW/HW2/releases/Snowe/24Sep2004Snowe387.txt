SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $140,000 IN RAIL TRAIL ACQUISTION
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $138,074 in Land and Water Conservation funding to acquire 11.3 miles of abandoned railroad.  
 The railroad stretches from the town of Newport to the town of Dover-Foxcroft. The grant is awarded by the Bureau of Parks and Lands under the National Park Service.
   "The acquisition of this abandoned land and its transformation will allow for all Mainers to enjoy our state's priceless assets," said the Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Public recreation is vital to Maine's tourism and is a great service to local residents." 
   The Land & Water Conservation Fund assists in the development of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities. The program is intended to create and maintain a nationwide legacy of stimulating non-federal investments in the protection and maintenance of recreation resources across the United States.
