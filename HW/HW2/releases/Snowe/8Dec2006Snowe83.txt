SEN. SNOWE: LEGISLATION CRITICAL TO MAINE, NATIONAL FISHERIES PASSED IN SENATE TODAY
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Senate Fisheries and the Coast Guard Subcommittee Chair, today called Senate passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Act conference report a significant step toward providing stability and security for Maine and the nation's fish and fishing communities. The Magnunson-Stevens Act conference report is now awaiting final passage in the House of Representatives. Senator Sen. Olympia Snowe is a cosponsor of the legislation originally passed by the Senate on June 19th of this year and has been working in the last days of the 109th Congress for passage of this legislation critical to the state of Maine. 
 "Whether we are talking about a 300 year-old fishing village in Downeast Maine, or remote fishing outposts in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, we must be bound by a commitment to a thoughtful balance between sustaining both fish and fishermen," Snowe said. "The Magnunson-Stevens Act strikes that thoughtful balance and is essential to the economies and marine environments of coastal communities in Maine and throughout the nation. I am especially proud that in the final days of the 109th Congress we were able to reach a bipartisan solution that benefits Maine and the nation."  
 The bipartisan bill, which reauthorizes the MSA from Fiscal Year 2007 through Fiscal Year 2013, will, for the first time prohibit overfishing in future fisheries management plans. It also contains provisions that would help improve international fishery management and conservation compliance, with an emphasis on strengthening controls on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. The MSA reauthorization bill retains key provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) that was passed in 1996, while making adjustments to the legislation designed to improve national compliance with the Act. 
 The Magnuson -Stevens Act (MSA), originally enacted in 1976, was most recently amended through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) of 1996, and establishes a national framework for conserving and managing marine fisheries within a 200-mile wide zone contiguous to the United States through eight Regional Fishery Management Councils. 
 "We must establish a common framework that achieves the goals of sustaining fish and the fishing industry while still providing our Regional Councils with the flexibility and tools they need to address their unique local challenges," said Snowe. "Our fisheries law must accommodate scientific uncertainty, recognize that fisheries ecosystems are highly complex, and ensure that our management system can adapt to ever-changing marine environments. This legislation is not a perfect solution, but I believe we have struck an appropriate balance between preserving the marine resources of our coastal communities with these fisheries management tools." 
 Snowe successfully added several provisions to the bill that are critical to Maine and New England in the legislation: 
 * Provisions that ensure that, at the end of any quota development process in New England, two-thirds of eligible fishermen would be required to approve the plan before it could be implemented. 
 * The bill directs fisheries managers to utilize economic and social data and assessment methods based on the best information available, analyze the cumulative impacts of management measures, and explore possible mitigation measures for minimizing the impacts of management plans, all of which are critical for ensuring management accountability to fishing communities. 
 * Language directing managers to consider steaming time, or the time it takes fishermen from different states to transit to distant fishing grounds, in their management plans, so that fishermen may not lose their fishing days-at-sea. 
 * In addition, this legislation contains language requiring the Secretary of Commerce to complete a comprehensive study of the economic and social impacts of regulations contained in Framework 42, the updates to Amendment 13. These rules, implemented in November 2006, require additional cuts in groundfishing effort in New England, and this study will ensure that the full range of impacts and mitigation measures are identified and addressed by regulators. 
 * Provisions requiring the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to make clearer rules for streamlining the criteria and approval of Experimental Fishing Permits (EFPs), or special permits to allow fishermen to test new gears or methods not otherwise allowed under fishing rules. New England groundfishermen have been applying for EFPs for several years; however, NMFS has been unable to approve most of these requests under their current management system, because of procedural and administrative technicalities. 
 * The bill authorizes a cooperative research study of herring in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem to help answer questions about stock size and distribution, which are necessary to effectively manage herring and other fisheries that depend upon herring. 
 * The legislation addresses stressed groundfish stocks, like cod. Right now, certain state-licensed fishermen in New England are harvesting cod, one of the most depleted species in the federally-managed groundfish complex. Language contained in this legislation would require NMFS to determine if state fishing is inconsistent with Amendment 13, and if so, to take action to correct it. 
 * Another provision allows for a waiver of the U.S. processing requirement for fisheries that can show historic practice of processing in other countries that have comparable food safety standards, which would allow Maine herring fishermen to continue using Canadian processors. To help new domestic processors get off the ground in places like Maine where a processing void exists for some fisheries, Snowe included a provision that directs the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Small Business Administration and other federal assistance agencies to facilitate U.S. investment in processing. 
 Other highlights of the underlying bill include: 
 Preserves and Strengthens the Regional Fishery Management Councils 
 * Establishes a Council training program open to existing Council members and required for new members designed to prepare them for complying with legal, scientific, economic, and conflict of interest requirements applicable to the fishery management process. 
 * Strengthens and clarifies the MSA's conflict of interest and recusal requirements. 
 * Ensures that Council members disclose any financial arrangements with any other individuals who may have a financial interest in activity over which the Council has jurisdiction, as well as disclose any other sources of compensation the Council member may receive. 
 Mandates the Use of Allowable Catch Levels to Prevent Overfishing and Preserve Sustainable Harvest 
 * Mandates that every fishery management plan contain an annual catch limit that prevents overfishing in the fishery. 
 * Directs the Councils to set annual catch limits that are not to exceed the recommendations of the Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSCs) or other appropriate scientific body. 
 * Requires the Councils to include measures in a fishery management plan that ensure accountability with catch limits. 
 Establishes National Guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs 
 * Establishes national guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) for the harvesting of fish. The LAPPs include Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs), and are expanded to allow for allocation of harvesting privileges to fishing communities or regional fishery associations. 
 * Does not provide for the establishment of a separate Processor Quota, but processors would be eligible to hold LAPPs to harvest fish, pursuant to current law, and any decision to allocate privileges to processors would be made in the Council's normal allocation decision making process. 
 * Provides for a seven-year administrative review of each program's compliance with the goals of the program and the MSA. 
 Improves the Uniformity of Decision Making for Fishery Management Plans and Aligns them with the NEPA Process 
 * Authorizes the establishment of a Coordinating Committee comprised of Council Chairs, Vice Chairs, and Executive Directors as a forum to discuss issues relevant to all Councils. 
 * Directs the Secretary, with public participation and in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Regional Fishery Management Council, to develop one, uniform fishery management-specific environmental review process that conforms National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, analysis, and public input schedules to the timelines appropriate for fishery management decisions under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The intent is to establish one consistent, timely, and predictable regulatory process for fishery management decisions. 
 Improves Data Collection for Better Management 
 * Authorizes a national cooperative research and management program, which would be implemented on a regional basis to be developed and conducted through partnerships between federal and state managers, commercial and recreational fishing industry participants, and scientists. 
 * Priority support would be given for efforts to improve stock assessments, assess bycatch, identify or conserve habitat areas, and collect socioeconomic data. 
 * Provides a mechanism for improving data relating to recreational fisheries by establishing a new national program for the registration of marine recreational fishermen who fish in federal waters or for anadromous species. 
 * Establishes a program dedicated to the development of technologies and methods to improve the ability of fishery participants to reduce bycatch and associated mortality. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Councils and other interests, to create a regionally based Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program to develop technological devices and engineering techniques for minimizing bycatch, bycatch mortality, and post-release mortality. The provision includes an outreach mandate to encourage the adoption of new technologies, and also encourages the adoption of bycatch reduction incentives in fishery management plans, such as bycatch quotas. 
 The bill strengthens the role of science in Council decision making through a number of provisions. 
 * Specifies that the role of the Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSCs) is to provide their Councils with ongoing scientific advice needed for management decisions, including acceptable biological catch or optimum yield, annual catch limits, or other mortality limits. 
 * The SSCs are expected to advise the Councils on a variety of other issues, including stock status and health, bycatch, habitat status, and socio-economic impacts. 
 * Requires that SSC appointees be federal, state, academic, or independent experts with strong scientific or technical credentials and experience and authorizes stipends for non-government SSC members. 
 Strengthens U.S. Leadership in International Conservation and Management 
 * IUU fishing, as well as expanding fleets and high bycatch levels, are threats to sustainable fisheries worldwide. The bill includes provisions to strengthen the ability of international fishery management organizations and the United States to ensure appropriate enforcement and compliance with conservation and management measures in high seas fisheries. 
 * Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to establish an international compliance and monitoring program provide reports to Congress on progress in reducing IUU fishing, promoting international cooperation, and strengthening the ability of regional fishery management organizations to combat IUU and other harmful fishing practices. 
 * Requires the Secretary of Commerce to define IUU, but specifies that the definition must include violations of quotas or other rules established under a regional or international agreement, as well as overfishing or use of certain damaging gear in high seas areas with no international or regional conservation and management measures. 
 * Allows for the use of measures authorized under the High Seas Driftnet Act to force compliance in cases where regional or international fishery management organizations are unable to stop IUU fishing or excessive bycatch. 
 Reauthorizes and Strengthens Two International Fishery Treaties 
 Contains implementing legislation for (1) the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention, a treaty to establish the first regional management regime for highly migratory species in the Central and Western Pacific, and (2) the Pacific Whiting Treaty, to establish an international and scientific and management regime for Pacific whiting, which are before the Senate for advice and consent. 
 International fisheries stewardship: 
 Snowe added language governing international fisheries directing the Secretary of Commerce to designate a new, Senate-confirmed, senior position within National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to perform the duties of the Secretary with respect to international fisheries agreements, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the International Whaling Commission. This provision will improve consistency and continuity in the administration and leadership of U.S. activities in these international conservation fora. 
 Funding 
 The bill authorizes $ 338 million in FY2007 for implementation of activities under the MSA, which would increase annually to $397 million in 2013. To address the growing need for additional funding for fisheries technology, science, and related information, the bill includes a new provision that would establish a new Fisheries Conservation and Management Fund. This Fund is intended to respond to the call by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for dedicated funding for ocean-related needs, but establishes a fishery management-specific fund, patterned on the Wallop-Breaux Trust Fund "user pays, user benefits" model. 
 Allocations from the fund would be determined in consultation with the Councils, and would be for specific activities not funded under current law, including technology upgrades, cooperative research, gear buybacks and development, and sustainable seafood marketing and handling activities. Funds to be deposited in the fund would include: funds from certain penalties and seizures; any quota set-asides designated by a Council; general revenues; or donated funds.
