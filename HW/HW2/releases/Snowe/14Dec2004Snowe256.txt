SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES EPA ADMINISTRATOR LEAVITT
  This morning, President Bush announced that Mike Leavitt, the current Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has been nominated to be the new Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).  
 He will succeed Tommy Thompson, who recently announced his resignation. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Committee on Finance which oversees Medicare, issued the following statement: 
   "I have known Governor Leavitt since he served as Governor of Utah while my husband, Jock, was Governor of Maine, and he is an excellent choice to lead HHS," said Snowe. "President Bush has selected a capable and intelligent leader to oversee the implementation of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit and safeguard our nation's food supply." 
   Speaking with Governor Leavitt today, Senator Snowe congratulated him on his nomination and indicated her support for future efforts regarding prescription drug importation and allowing the HHS Secretary to negotiate prices with manufacturers of prescription drugs to ensure that beneficiaries would pay the lowest possible price for their prescription drug plans.
