SEN. SNOWE MOURNS PASSING OF HELEN LONGLEY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement today on the death yesterday of Helen W. Longley, wife of former Maine Gov.  
 James Longley. 
   "Jock and I are deeply saddened by Helen's passing and we extend our most heartfelt sympathies to her children Jim, Stephen, Kathryn, Nancy, Susan, and the entire Longley family. 
   "We were truly privileged to know Helen - she was a remarkable person, and her devotion to Maine and our communities with organizations such as Central Maine Medical Center was surpassed only by her love for her family. She was an exceptional First Lady of Maine whose kindness endeared her to all of Maine, and will forever be remembered. Jock and I will always recall Helen as a wonderful woman who staunchly supported her husband and her son, Jim, in their service to Maine and the nation, and we will miss her."
