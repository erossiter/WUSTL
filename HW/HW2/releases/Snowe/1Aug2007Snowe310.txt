SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS PLEDGE CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR DOMTAR EMPLOYEES
  In wake of today's announcement that Domtar Corporation will close one paper machine at its Woodland mill in Baileyville, U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today pledged their continued support for the 150 workers who will lose their jobs. Senators Snowe and Collins are currently working with the U.S. Department of Labor to ensure that Domtar's petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance is quickly reviewed.  
   "This is unfortunate news for Washington County and the many employees who will be adversely impacted by this shutdown," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We will do everything in our power to ensure that these employees get the critical assistance they need to stay on their feet while continuing to support the existing Domtar workers." 
   The purpose of the TAA program is to aid workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages decrease as a result of increased imports. If the TAA petition is approved, displaced Domtar workers will be eligible for employment training in another job or career, income support, job search allowance, and relocation services for individuals who obtain jobs outside of their normal commuting area. 
   In addition, Senators Snowe and Collins are working with the State of Maine Department of Labor to expedite a request for a National Emergency Grant (NEG) that will allow Maine to better assist the affected workers.
