SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO REBUILD AND RENOVATE MAINE'S SCHOOLS
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today announced funding from the Rebuild America's Schools Coalition.  
 The funds, allocated under the Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) program, provide $1,861,000 in 2004 and $1,574,000 in 2005 for renovating school buildings, purchasing equipment, developing curricula, and/or training school personnel in Maine Schools.
   "This funding is critical for providing much needed financial support for school renovation and repair programs in the state of Maine," said Snowe. "Students deserve the best schools and schooling possible and I am happy that this tax credit will aid the state in its attempt to continually raise the bar on school standards."
   Rebuild America's Schools is a national organization working to secure federal support for state and local programs to build and modernize America's schools. The QZAB program provides federal tax credits to finances bonds used to repair and renovate public schools across the country. QZABs also encourage schools and businesses to cooperate in innovative ways that expand students' learning opportunities and help schools prepare students with the kinds of skills employers, and our nation, need to compete in the global economy.
   A two year extension of the QZAB program was enacted in the 108th Congress. The extension provides a $400 million authorization in QZAB bonds per year for the program for 2004 and 2005. The Internal Revenue Service has issued state allocations for both 2004 and 2005.
