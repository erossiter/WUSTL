SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MAINE AWARDED $700,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PROGRAM
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced today that $700,000 has been awarded to Maine by the Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program. This funding will support social service agencies in cities and counties across Maine to help feed and shelter the state's hungry and homeless.  
   "There is an unprecedented need to provide relief and aid to the working poor who depend on Maine's local shelters for the most basic necessities," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "These shelters need our continued support so that they can continue to help this vulnerable community."
   The EFS Program, entering its twenty-fifth year, is administered by a national board of volunteer agencies and chaired by FEMA. Member agencies of the National Board include: American Red Cross; Catholic Charities, USA; United Jewish Communities; National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.; The Salvation Army and United Way of America.
   The EFS Program has been in existence since 1983 and was authorized under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. With the FY 2008 allocation, more than $3.105 billion in federal aid will have been disbursed through the EFS Program since its inception to communities nationwide, and has accounted for millions of additional meals and nights of shelter to the hungry and homeless most in need across the nation.
