SEN. SNOWE, COLLINS ISSUE STATEMENTS ON LIHEAP FUNDING
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins issued the following statements today on Senate action late last night to strip those provisions in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Appropriations bill for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP):  
   Senator Snowe said: "The removal of essential LIHEAP funding from the Defense Appropriations bill is bad news for the millions of Americans living in cold weather states like Maine. Today is the second day of winter and families are in dire need of immediate assistance from high home heating prices. But the fight for LIHEAP is not yet over and I believe that the political will is there to provide additional funds for this vital program." 
   Senator Collins said: "LIHEAP is critical to so many families in Maine and throughout the nation. Ensuring that this home heating assistance is available to those who need it most is a spending priority. It was a disappointment that we were not able to include additional LIHEAP funding as part of the final Defense spending bill, but this fight is not over. We are continuing discussions with the Senate leadership about the importance of additional funding for LIHEAP as soon as possible."
