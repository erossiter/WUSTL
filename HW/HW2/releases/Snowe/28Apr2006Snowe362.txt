SEN. SNOWE PUSHES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe joined Sen. Smith (R-OR) in introducing the Advanced Energy Act, fuel cell tax credit legislation that would extend the tax credits for stationary and portable fuel cells and solar technology. These credits will help to create an energy infrastructure that is clean and efficient and also lead the nation towards energy independence.  
   "During these times of skyrocketing fuel prices, we must find new and innovative ways to satisfy our nation's energy demand," said Snowe. "Offering tax credits to encourage the development of alternative energy such as fuel cells and solar technology makes both economic and environmental sense. It will decrease our nation's dangerous dependence on foreign oil while at the same time offering clean and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels." 
   The fuel cell tax credit was first proposed by Senators Snowe and Lieberman (D-CT) and is now part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, it was ultimately set at only two years. The current bill extends the credit to 2015 to provide incentives for the commercialization of these technologies and would include fuel cells, concentrated solar power, photovoltaics and solar water heating.
