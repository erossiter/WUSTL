SEN. SNOWE PRAISES BUSH'S NOMINATION OF COMMISSIONER MARTIN TO BE FCC CHAIRMAN
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) praised President Bush for nominating FCC Commissioner Kevin Martin to be the next FCC Chairman, replacing Michael Powell.  
   "Kevin Martin has distinguished himself since he began serving as an FCC Commissioner in 2001," said Snowe. "He brings a wealth of experience in telecommunications to the job, and I am confident he will continue his exemplary service in his new role as FCC Chairman. I am particularly pleased that Kevin has demonstrated a strong commitment to policies that will accelerate the deployment of broadband technology, including building infrastructure in rural areas, including much of Maine, which rely upon these technological advances to remain economically competitive." 
   Because Martin is currently on the Commission, his elevation to Chairman will not be subject to Senate confirmation.
