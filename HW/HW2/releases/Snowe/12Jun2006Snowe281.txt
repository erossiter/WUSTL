SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF TERRORIST AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement this morning on the death of terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq yesterday: 
   The death of brutal terrorist and murderer Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a significant blow against despotism and tyranny in Iraq. Once and for all, the man responsible for a violent reign of terror against the innocent has finally come to his end. This major development occurred because of the determination and courage of our American military forces, the men and women of our intelligence community, and those Iraqis committed to securing their own future who provided our troops with the necessary information to take this decisive action. 
   Many challenges remain for Iraq as it will continue to struggle against a dangerous insurgency and sectarian conflict. Zarqawi's death coupled with the approval of the last remaining cabinet ministers should serve as a catalyst to further solidify a national allegiance to the new unity government, allowing the Iraqi people to seize control of their own security and, therefore, their own destiny, so our brave troops remain not a moment longer than necessary.
