SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $470,000 IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH FUNDING
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $470,000 in federal funding to study abrupt climate change at the University of Maine in Orono.  
 The grant is awarded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the Department of Commerce.
   "According to a 2001 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the climate does not respond to change gradually, but in sudden jumps. The report said that abrupt climate changes of the magnitude seen in the past would have far-reaching implications for human society and ecosystems, including major impacts on energy consumption and water supply demands," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "We are pleased that the University of Maine has been awarded this federal funding to continue its critical research into abrupt climate change - knowledge which will surely benefit society at large." 
   Senators Snowe and Collins have long supported further research into the implications of abrupt climate change. Collins, Snowe and Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT) have sponsored the "Collins-Snowe-Jeffords Abrupt Climate Change Research Act of 2003" - legislation that would create a $60 million research program under NOAA. 
   Additionally, in September 2003, Snowe and Collins secured $1.6 million in the fiscal year 2004 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill for research on "Abrupt Climate Change" to be conducted through the joint efforts of the NOAA and the University of Maine.
