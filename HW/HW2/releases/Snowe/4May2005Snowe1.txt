 NEI is a part of Federal government's National Institutes of Heath (NIH) founded under the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). 
   "The results of research projects undertaken at Jackson Lab add a significant amount of information to what we currently know about a wide range of diseases," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This particular grant will allow Jackson Laboratory to conduct new and innovative vision research that will greatly benefit those with vision problems, while at the same time aid in keeping it one of the foremost research institutions in the country." 
   The National Eye Institute (NEI) conducts and supports research that helps prevent and treat eye diseases and other disorders of vision. This research leads to sight-saving treatments, reduces visual impairment and blindness, and improves the quality of life for people of all ages. NEI-supported research has advanced our knowledge of how the visual system functions in health and disease.
