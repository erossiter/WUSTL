SEN. SNOWE ADVOCATES FOR BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today sent a letter to United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Commander Admiral Timothy J. Keating thanking him for agreeing to visit Brunswick Naval Air Station and conveying to him a report written by the NAS Brunswick Task Force, a grassroots organization composed of a wide array of leaders from the local community. Sen.  
 Snowe also sent a letter and the report to NORTHCOM Deputy Commander Lieutenant General Joseph R. Inge. 
   "Brunswick Naval Air Station is integral to our efforts to defend America at home and abroad," said Snowe. "I look forward to Admiral Keating's visit to Brunswick, and I am happy to pass on to him and General Inge the NAS Brunswick Taskforce report, which outlines the importance and value of the Brunswick Naval Air Station to our national security and highlights the tremendous role the station can play for homeland defense." 
   The NAS Brunswick Taskforce report presents key points about the strategic location, military value, and capability of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, the only remaining fully operational military airfield in the northeastern United States. 
   NORTHCOM's stated mission is to deter, prevent, and defeat threats and aggression aimed at the United States, its territories, and interests within the assigned area of responsibility, and as directed by the President or Secretary of Defense, to provide military assistance to civil authorities including consequence management operations.
