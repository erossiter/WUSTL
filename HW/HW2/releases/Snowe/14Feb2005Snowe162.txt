SEN. SNOWE RECEIVES PATSY MINK AWARD
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) received the Patsy Mink Award on Wednesday for courage in advancing opportunities for women and girls in sports from the National Girls and Women in Sports Day Coalition.  
   "Coming from an organization so thoroughly devoted to the welfare of women of all ages, this award carries unique meaning and I am honored to receive it," said Snowe. " I look forward to working with members of the Coalition to encourage the passage of the High School Sports Information Collection Act, legislation that I will reintroduce this month. As you know, this bill will go a long way toward ensuring that our high schools are complying with civil rights law. On these and many other issues, I am sure we will have ample opportunity to work together on the priorities advocated by the National Girls and Women in Sports Day Coalition." 
   Patsy Takemoto Mink (1927-2002) served in the US Congress from 1965-1976 and again from 1990-2002, where she represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District. The first woman of color elected to the US House of Representatives, she worked tirelessly for civil rights, women's rights, economic justice, civil liberties, peace, and the integrity of the democratic process.
