SEN. SNOWE SWORN IN FOR THIRD TERM IN U.S. SENATE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) was sworn-in as a member of the 110th Congress on Friday, January 5, 2007. In a ceremony held in the U.S. Capitol, Vice President Dick Cheney, who serves as president of the Senate, administered the oath of office to Sen. Olympia Snowe and thirty-two other newly-elected Senators. Sen. Olympia Snowe commemorated the event with family, friends, constituents, and staff at a reception directly following the ceremony. Snowe was re-elected to her third term in the U.S. Senate in November with 74% of the vote.  
   "I am honored to begin my third term in the United States Senate today and enormously grateful to the people of Maine for entrusting me with the responsibility of representing our state." Snowe said. "Finding solutions to the challenges facing our nation will require working across the political divides, and I will continue to be a voice of responsible consensus-building in the Senate. At a time when the United States must confront and overcome historic threats to our national security and chart a new course in Iraq; work to provide accessible, quality health care; and bolster our economy, it is more imperative than ever that we dramatically alter the political dynamic. We must achieve results through accommodation and bridge-building when possible, and recognize that there is strength in compromise, courage in conciliation, and honor in consensus. There simply is no other way, and we must respond to the will of the people if the legacy of the 110th Congress is to be one of responsible stewardship worthy of the public trust." 
   Entering the 110th Congress, Snowe will serve as a member of the Senate Finance Committee; the Senate Commerce Committee, where Snowe will serve on the Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee; the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence; and as Ranking Member on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
