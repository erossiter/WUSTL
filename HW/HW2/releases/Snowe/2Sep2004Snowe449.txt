SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES DEFENSE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT WITH EASTERN MAINE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, (R-Maine) today announced that the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has awarded a Department of Defense (DoD) Technical Assistance Cooperative Agreement to the Eastern Maine Development Corporation's (EMDC) Market Development Center, based in Bangor.  
 DoD will fund approximately 50 percent, or $365,000, of the agreement. 
   "I am pleased that the Defense Department has recognized the excellent work of Eastern Maine Development Corporation's Market Development Center, which assists small businesses throughout Maine in securing vital government procurement contracts. The Market Development Center is an invaluable resource for Maine's small businesses by increasing their procurement opportunities with the federal government, and thereby providing economic investment and job creation in our communities," said Snowe, who is chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business. "By tapping into the ingenuity and innovation of small businesses, our nation's military will have access to a greater array of advanced technology developed by Maine businesses to aid our servicemen and women in their mission." 
   Organized and managed by EMDC, the Market Development Center assists small businesses throughout Maine with obtaining government prime and sub-contracting opportunities. In 2003, the Center helped Maine's small businesses secure more than $100 million government procurement contracts. Information on services provided by the Market Development Center can be found at www.mdcme.org or by calling 1-800-339-6389. 
   The total agreement between DoD and EMDC is worth $730,000.
