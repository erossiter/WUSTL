SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE ARMY CONTRACT FOR BANGOR AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that the Department of the Army awarded $13,078,378 to CCI, Inc. in Anchorage, Alaska, to repair airfield pavements at the Bangor Air National Guard Base. Specifically, CCI will use the grant to demolish and replace an existing aircraft parking apron. 
   "As one of the most efficient and strategically-located air units in the nation, the Bangor Air National Guard Base deserves the necessary funding to repair and improve its existing facilities in order to better serve and support our active duty military," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Hopefully these structural upgrades will enhance the Bangor Air National Guard's proposal to the National Guard to expand its hangar facilities, obtain an active duty unit, and acquire state-of-the-art tanker aircraft."
