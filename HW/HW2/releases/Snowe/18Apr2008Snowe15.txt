SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR MAINE MOCCASIN WORKERS IN LEWISTON
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that the U.S. Department of Labor has granted Trade Adjustment Assistance for the employees of Maine Moccasin in Lewiston, who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after March 5, 2007. Maine Moccasin implemented substantial layoffs last year after an increase of imports hampered the company's production of uppers for shoes. Workers can access these benefits by going to their local one-stop career center. The easiest way to locate the closest one-stop is by going to www.servicelocator.org and entering their zip code. 
   "Small businesses throughout Maine have suffered as a result of our slowing economy and the increase of imports of manufactured goods from abroad," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "It is critical that we continue providing assistance to workers displaced by trade so that they may rejoin the workforce and boost small businesses in America."
