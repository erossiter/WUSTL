SEN. SNOWE SPONSORS BILL TO BRING LIVE EARTH CONCERT TO CAPITOL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) has joined with Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada) to introduce a resolution that would allow a free concert organized by former Vice President Al Gore to be held on the Capitol Grounds in early July. The "Live Earth" concert, scheduled to be held on July 7th, is part of a series of seven concerts scheduled to be held around the world to raise awareness and draw attention to the need for action to combat global climate change.  
   "The United States has an obligation to the world and to future generations of Americans to lead the fight against global warming," Snowe said. "The Live Earth series will continue the growing momentum among the international community highlighted by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recent findings and the G8+5 summit held in Washington D.C. last month. I am thrilled to join Senator Reid as a sponsor of this resolution and hope this event will continue to raise awareness of the causes and consequences of global warming and demonstrate the United State's commitment to combating climate change. Live Earth promises to be a wonderful concert and a monumental event, and I can think of no better venue than in Washington D.C." 
   Live Earth organizers also include Former EPA Administrator Carol Browner, Theodore Roosevelt IV, Brent Scowcroft, and the former President of Georgia-Pacific Corp. Lee Thomas. Scheduled performers for the Live Earth series include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, the Police, Fall Out Boy, Genesis, Akon, Bon Jovi, and Kelly Clarkson.
