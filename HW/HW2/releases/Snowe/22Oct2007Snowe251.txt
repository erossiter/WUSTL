SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS DECISION TO RESCIND FISHING RESTRICTIONS OFF COAST OF MAINE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, applauded the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) decision to rescind unreasonable fishing restrictions of the coast of Maine set to go take effect Saturday. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced the decision after conducting an aerial survey that Sen. Snowe had requested of the proposed Dynamic Area Management (DAM) zone southeast of Beals and Machias.  
   "The retraction of this potentially crippling regulation is exceptionally good news and a welcomed relief for Downeast Maine ," Sen. Snowe said. "I am extremely pleased that our hardworking lobstermen will be able to continue to fish throughout the remainder of the season."
   On Monday, NMFS announced a two week change in fishing regulations for 841-square-nautical miles off the southeast coast of Maine . The DAM zone, which would have taken effect Saturday, was triggered after whales were sighted in that region on Oct. 5. During today's flyover requested by Sen. Snowe, no whales were sighted in the area. 
   "This is wonderful news for Maine and I will continue to do all in my power to ensure that these regulations are revised so that this threat no longer endangers Washington County 's economy," Sen. Snowe said.
