SEN. SNOWE BACKS GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REPORT THAT FINDS SHORTCOMINGS IN NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE RULING
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today announced the release of a report by the GAO that found shortcomings in the scientific underpinnings of a National Marine Fisheries Service rule-making process that could force Maine lobstermen to use sinking groundline in order to protect large whales. The GAO report concluded that the NMFS relied on insufficient scientific information and failed to adequately account for uncertainties regarding the socioeconomic impact to Maine's fishing industry and coastal communities when developing new rules required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Senator Snowe requested that the GAO conduct the report last year after NMFS could not provide evidence or assurances that it fully analyzed various options for alleviating the economic impact on Maine lobstermen while still protecting whale populations - such as exempting areas with few whale sightings or allowing for the use of new "whale safe" gear technologies now under development.  
   "It is imperative that we protect our populations of large whales, but we must ensure that any plan intended to achieve this goal is based on sound science and fairly distributes the costs and benefits among affected parties," said Senator Snowe. "The findings of the GAO report released today show that the National Marine Fisheries Service has not fully accounted for the potentially severe socio-economic impacts of this decision on Maine's fishing communities, nor has the agency shown the extent to which its proposed rule will achieve the goal of reducing the interactions of whales and fishing gear." 
   NMFS had planed to release a final rule in the fall of 2006 which would have required the majority of Maine's lobstermen to use sinking rope to link their traps. The purpose of the rule was to minimize the amount of rope suspended in the water column which can entangle whales. But in many areas of the Maine coast, rocky bottom and extreme tidal events cause these ropes to degrade and break, making their use costly, impractical, and dangerous for fisherman. In October 2006, the President's Office of Management and the Budget rejected the proposed rule and sent it back to NMFS for revision. In February 2007, the Ocean Conservancy and the Humane Society filed a lawsuit with NMFS on the grounds that the deadline for issuance of this rule under the Marine Mammal Protection Act had expired. That suit was settled last week when NMFS agreed to promulgate a final rule by October 1, 2007. 
   The findings of the GAO study released today include: 
   * NMFS "cannot estimate the extent to which risks to whales will be reduced" by the rule's proposed gear restrictions. 
   * NMFS "has not resolved potential implementation challenges with using modified gear in rocky ocean bottom areas." 
   * NMFS "did not adequately represent the economic uncertainties associated with the costs of the proposed gear modifications and could not fully assess impacts on fishing communities." 
   * NMFS "has not developed strategies for fully evaluating effectiveness of the proposed gear modifications." 
   "I am deeply concerned about the ability of the National Marine Fisheries Service to incorporate the findings of this GAO report into its rule-making process in the brief window of time provided by the recent settlement," said Senator Snowe. "While we must act on the best scientific information to protect endangered species such as the North Atlantic right whale, if Maine's lobstermen are forced to bear undue costs imposed by poorly conceived regulations, they are likely to become an endangered species themselves." 
   Senator Snowe intends to work with NMFS to ensure that the recommendations contained in this report are addressed to the maximum extent practicable, and the resulting rule balances the mandate to protect critically endangered species of whales with the needs of Maine's fishing industry.
