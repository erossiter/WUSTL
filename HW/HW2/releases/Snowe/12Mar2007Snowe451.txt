SEN. SNOWE WELCOMES MAINE GUARD TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) extended her deep on Monday, March 12, after serving 12 months in Iraq. A regional representative from Sen. Olympia Snowe's Bangor office was present to welcome home the Security Force I Unit at the Army Aviation Support Facility in Bangor.  
   "I extend a warm welcome home to our valiant troops who return to Maine today after courageously serving overseas for the past year," said Senator Snowe. "We owe a debt of gratitude to these brave men and women and I am so pleased that they are able to reunite with their families and loved ones after performing such dedicated service. I also send my thoughts and prayers to the families of Staff Sergeant David Michael Veverka and Staff Sergeant Dale James Kelly, who were killed in May while serving with this unit in Iraq." 
   Staff Sergeant Dale James Kelly Jr. of Richmond, Maine and Staff Sergeant David Michael Veverka, were members of B Company, 3-172 Infantry Battalion, Maine Army National Guard. They were killed in an attack in Iraq on May 6, 2006. 
   Senator Snowe was unable to be present personally to welcome home the troops because of scheduled votes in Washington, DC.
