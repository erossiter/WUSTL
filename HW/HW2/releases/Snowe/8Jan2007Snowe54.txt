SEN. SNOWE COSPONSORS INTRODUCTION OF CHILD ABDUCTION PREVENTION LEGISLATION
  Continuing her long standing support of legislation that would provide state law enforcement with resources to combat child family abduction, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today signed on as an original cosponsor of the "Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007." Introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the bipartisan legislation allocates $500,000 in federal grants for state and local law enforcement agencies to assist in extradition, investigation, training and media campaigns to address the widespread abduction of children by family members. An identical version of this bill (S.994) passed the Senate by unanimous consent in the 109th Congress.  
   "Child abductions by family members are a far too common and devastating occurrence. More than 200,000 children were abducted by family members last year and the time to confront this issue head on is long overdue," Snowe said. "This legislation will give our local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies the resources and knowledge they need to address the alarming issue of family abductions. The 'Family Abduction Prevention Act' is an essential step toward addressing this national crisis and making our children more secure." 
   The Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007 would provide matching grants to States for the costs associated with improving family abduction prevention programs. Specifically, the bill would assist States with: 
   * Costs associated with the extradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family abduction;
   * Costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to investigate cases of missing children; 
   * Training for local and State law enforcement agencies in responding to family abductions; 
   * Outreach and media campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions; and 
   * Assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with "flagging" school records, a practice that can lead to the discovery of abducted children.
