CHANGING FACE OF POWER: WOMEN IN SENATE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today lauded the opening of "Changing the Face of Power: Women in the U.S. Senate," an award-winning exhibit by photojournalist Melina Mara in Augusta, Maine. The exhibit includes photos of Maine Senators, Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins.  
   "It is a humbling honor to be associated with my exceptional colleagues - past and present - who have proven that the halls of Congress must be open to all Americans," said Snowe. "I commend the Maine Women's Fund the Women's Studies Program at the University of Southern Maine for supporting this exhibit, and congratulate Melina Mara for her artistic vision." 
   The traveling exhibit is presented by The Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin. It is supported in Maine by the Maine Women's Fund and the Women's Studies Program at the University of Southern Maine. 
   "We have come a long way since the days when, incredibly, we had to fight to ensure that research on diseases affecting women actually included women in those studies - or when no federal laws existed guaranteeing the right to take time off to care for a family member." said Snowe. "As women have become a larger part of the political establishment, issues of importance to women have risen to greater prominence on the legislative landscape - and rightfully so. From health issues like the creation of a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, to my refundable child tax credit, or even programs to help women begin small businesses, women legislators have played a key role in bringing these concerns to the top of the agenda in Congress."
