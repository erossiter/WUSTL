SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION GRANTS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded Maine $2,604,227 in federal funding.  
 The funds have been allocated to four Maine towns to be used for greatly needed equipment and facilities. 
   "Because Maine residents, many of whom live in rural areas, depend so heavily on local roads and airports for their transportation needs, it is vital that towns receive adequate transportation funding," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This grant will go a long way toward keeping communities in Maine connected to the rest of the state and the nation." 
   "It is extremely important to ensure that our local communities receive federal funding to provide adequate provisions for their transportation services." Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The following towns will receive funding: 
   * $1,384,222 to Bangor International to Construct a Deicing Containment Facility. 
   * $170,000 to the City of Caribou to acquire Snow Removal Equipment. 
   * $450,000 to the Town of Bethel to Expand the general aviation aircraft apron. 
   * $600,000 to the Town of Sanford to rehabilitate the tie-down aircraft apron pavement. 
   The Department of Transportation (DOT) aims to improve safety, increase mobility in support of the nation's economy, protect human and natural environment, achieve organizational excellence, and support the national security strategy. DOT has provided the grants allocated to Maine through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA issues and enforces regulations and minimum standards covering manufacturing, operating, and maintaining aircraft.
