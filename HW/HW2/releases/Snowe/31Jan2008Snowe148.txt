SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS VA DECISION TO RAISE MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR DISABLED VETERANS
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced today that she received a letter today from Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary James Peake, notifying her that effective February 1, 2008, the VA is raising its mileage reimbursement rate to 28.5 cents a mile for the VA Beneficiary Travel Program. This action is in response to the bipartisan letter Senator Snowe sent to the VA Secretary requesting an increase on January 14, 2008.  
   "This is terrific news for Maine's veterans and those living in rural areas across our country," Snowe said. "For more than three decades our veterans have been waiting for increased support while prices at the pump have reached record levels. The VA's decision couldn't have come at a better time and I applaud Secretary Peake's decisive action on this longstanding issue."
   Under current law, veterans with a disability of 30 percent or more are entitled to a reimbursement of 11 cents per mile, a rate that has not changed since 1977. Senator Snowe's recent letter to the Secretary Peake urged the VA to provide critical assistance to veterans traveling long distances to VA health care facilities by reimbursing them at 28.5 cents per mile, which has been fully funded within the Consolidated Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2008.
   In the 110th Congress, Senator Snowe has been at the forefront of bipartisan efforts to increase the mileage reimbursement rate for disabled veterans, supporting measures such as S.1146, the Rural Veterans Healthcare Improvement Act and S.994, the Disabled Veterans Fairness Act. Additionally, in May of 2005 and April of 2007, Senator Snowe sent letters to then-VA Secretary Jim Nicholson requesting a mileage reimbursement increase.
