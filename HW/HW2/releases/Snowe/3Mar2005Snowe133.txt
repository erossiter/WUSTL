SEN. SNOWE WELCOMES VICTORIOUS RED SOX TO NATION'S CAPITAL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today congratulated the Boston Red Sox once again for their World Series victory last year over the St.  
 Louis Cardinals. Snowe joined President Bush and other Members of Congress from New England at the White House in honoring the Red Sox' achievement. 
   "Red Sox fans in Maine, New England, across the country and around the world have dreamed their entire lives of their team bringing home a World Series Championship," said Snowe. "After 86 years, those dreams came true, and I am proud to welcome the Red Sox to Washington D.C. - they have certainly earned the honor of meeting with the President at the White House." 
   "This team showed what can be achieved when everyone works together toward a common goal. Congratulations to the Red Sox, 2004 World Series Champions."
