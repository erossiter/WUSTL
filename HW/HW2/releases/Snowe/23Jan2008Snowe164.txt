SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FIREFIGHTERS ASSISTANCE GRANTS AWARDED TO MAINE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Assistance program have awarded $649,169 in vehicle acquisition and operations and safety grants to four Maine fire departments. These awards aim to enhance first responders' ability to protect the health and safety of the public and provide fire departments with additional resources to purchase essential equipment such as brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances and fireboats. 
   "Every day, Mainers rely on local fire personnel to protect our communities from the threat of a fire disaster," Senator Snowe said. "Nothing is more important than ensuring that our fire personnel have the resources they need to keep our families safe."
    The Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program is an important component of a coordinated effort to strengthen the Nation's overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and fire-related hazards. Since 2004, with the Fiscal Year 2007 awards, AFG has provided a total of almost $2.2 billion to first-responder organizations to purchase response equipment, personal protective equipment, and vehicles.
