SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON PASSING OF P.D. MERRILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement on Thursday, Feb. 15, on the passing of P.D. Merrill of Yarmouth. Merrill was the former owner of Merrill's Marine Terminal, a member of the Board of Trustees at the University of New England, and an outspoken defender of Portland's working waterfront.  
   "P.D. Merrill's candid character, unwavering passion, and honorable commitment to civic duty will be greatly missed by the greater Portland community and the entire state of Maine," said Senator Snowe. "Merrill was extremely dedicated to keeping his father's dream alive, and as a result, Merrill's Marine Terminal succeeded as one of the only privately owned cargo terminals on the East Coast for more than twenty years. 
   "A few years ago, I had the opportunity to participate in a roundtable discussion on small business health insurance at Merrill's Marine Terminal. It was an honor to see firsthand Merrill's commitment to encouraging open conversation between the leaders, business owners, and workers in our state. Beyond his allegiance to defending Portland's working waterfront and Maine's economy, Merrill's legacy lies in his philanthropic contributions that helped make our state a better place to work, live, and prosper."
