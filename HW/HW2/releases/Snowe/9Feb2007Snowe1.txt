SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM NATIONAL YOUNG LEADERS CONFERENCE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met with high school students participating in the National Young Leaders Conference on Friday, Feb. 9. Ian Connors of Portland and James Staszko of Scarborough took part in the six day program.  
   "Every year, the National Young Leaders Conference provides an excellent opportunity for students to travel to Washington and study politics on the national level," said Senator Snowe. "I hope Ian and James enjoy their time in the nation's capitol and share their experiences with their families and classmates when returning home to Maine." 
   The National Young Leaders Conference is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council. Students spend the week meeting with members of Congress, participating in interactive activities, and debating current issues. The program is designed to educate and inspire future leaders who desire an opportunity to learn outside of the classroom.
