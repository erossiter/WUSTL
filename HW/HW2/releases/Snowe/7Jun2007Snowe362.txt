SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S RECENT PROPOSAL TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement in response to President Bush's recent proposal to institute a "long-term global goal" for reducing greenhouse gas emissions:  
   "I welcome the President's decision to build upon the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in developing a mid- and long-term goal to guide both domestic and international actions on global warming," said Senator Snowe. "While he has not hit a "walk off home run," I truly welcome him onto the field. There is a great urgency here and the United States must be a leader in building a universal solution. 
   "I am encouraged that the President is finally engaged in this preeminent economic and environmental issue as I and many in the Senate have been since before the turn of the new century. I implore the Administration not to delay to future meetings, but rather use the upcoming G8 meeting to achieve his outlined goals. It is time that a substantive international framework is established that considers the post-2012 Kyoto Protocol for the largest emitters of greenhouse gases from the developed and developing countries that creates not only a long term goal for reductions, but also takes measurable steps to reduce carbon emissions in the near future." 
   Senator Snowe is currently spearheading a letter urging the President to constructively engage in the development and consensus of a joint communique on climate change at the upcoming G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany and adopt the set of principles proposed by G8 President and German Chancellor Merkel that would open the door to meaningful participation of the G8 and developing countries in a global solution to a global problem.
