SEN. SNOWE RENEWS EFFORT TO ENSURE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVE ADEQUATE CARE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) joined Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (Conn.-3) on Thursday, Feb. 1, to renew their support for breast cancer patients. The bipartisan Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act, introduced in both the House and the Senate today, would ensure that breast cancer patients have access to appropriate health care by guaranteeing that they have the option of remaining in the hospital for up to 48 hours following a mastectomy with insurance coverage. Many women are forced to leave the hospital the same day as surgery because their insurance will not cover their stay.  
   "We are renewing our effort today to ensure that the millions of American women diagnosed with breast cancer each year know they will receive the care they need and deserve," said Snowe. "Guaranteeing women have the option of remaining in the hospital for up to 48 hours following a mastectomy provides both the patient and the doctor with piece of mind and the time to make appropriate treatment decisions. It is inexplicable that the Congress has not taken action to ensure this basic right to adequate treatment, and I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to enact this legislation immediately." 
   According to the American Cancer Society, there are approximately three million women living with breast cancer in the United States, and a woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime. 
   Over 14 million Americans have now signed a petition sponsored by Lifetime Television calling for passage of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. The bill would ensure that women receive the appropriate care by: 
   * Guaranteeing a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for a woman having a mastectomy or lumpectomy, and 24 hours for a woman undergoing a lymph node removal; 
   * Requiring health plans to include notice of these benefits in their monthly mailing and yearly information packet sent to plan participants; 
   * Requiring plans to provide full coverage of second opinions should the patient seek one. 
   This bill does not mandate a 48 hour hospital stay if a patient does not choose to stay, nor does it set 48 hours as a maximum amount of time a woman can stay in the hospital. It simply ensures that any decision in favor of a shorter or longer hospital stay will be made by the patient and her doctor, and not an insurance company. 
   In the Senate this legislation is cosponsored by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Thad Cochran (R-MI), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Bob Menendez (D-NJ).
