SEN. SNOWE WORKS TO CONTROL CRIME, IMPROVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) voted for an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution which she cosponsored that would restore funding for key Justice Department aid programs that were slashed or eliminated by the Administration's budget. The amendment, introduced by Sens. Dayton (D-MN) and Chambliss (R-GA), would restore the Byrne and Justice Accountability Grants (JAG) to the Fiscal Year 2003 level of $900 million. The Senate passed this amendment by voice vote.  
   "Those who work tirelessly to prevent crime in our communities should have the strong support of the federal government," said Snowe. "It is absolutely vital that we fund crime enforcement activities and do everything we can to make our communities safer. I have long supported the JAG program since it allows recipient counties, cities, and towns to be more effective at preventing and controlling crime and therefore increases their ability to keep communities across the nation safe. I commend my colleagues for recognizing the value of this program and funding it appropriately." 
   The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program allows states, tribes, and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. Grant funds can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice for any one or more of the following purpose areas: 1) law enforcement programs; 2) prosecution and court programs; 3) prevention and education programs; 4) corrections and community corrections programs; 5) drug treatment programs; and 6) planning, evaluation, and technology programs.
