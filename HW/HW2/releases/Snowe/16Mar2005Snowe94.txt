SEN. SNOWE TO COSPONSOR SEN. FEINGOLD'S 'PAY-GO' AMENDMENT TO BUDGET RESOLUTION
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) announced today that she will co-sponsor the "pay-as-you-go" amendment by Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI). 
   "To confront our historic deficits, the Congress must return to a policy that successfully contributed to bringing our budgets into balance in the 1990s. Pay-go applied to both sides of the ledger - both to revenues and spending as contained in the Feingold amendment - is an effective tool in bringing needed restraint back to the budget-making process," said Snowe. 
   The Feingold amendment would restore pay-as-you-go budgeting rules to both spending increases and reductions in revenue that would either increase or create a deficit.
