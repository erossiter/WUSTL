SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS, REP. MICHAUD ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL TRANSITION TEAM MEETING FOR DISPLACED NORSUN EMPLOYEES
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, and Rep.  
 Mike Michaud today announced today announced that their offices are holding a second meeting of the NorSun transition team to further coordinate state, local and federal efforts to assist approximately 50 workers. The workers were notified of the closure of NorSun on August 10th when the plant shut-down.
   The transition team, coordinated by representatives from each of the member's state offices, brings together agencies who can offer assistance to the laid off workers and area service providers, examines the needs of the communities and determines the resources that can be brought to bear during these transition months to help the workers.
   "The community of Fort Kent and people from around the County continue to support these laid-off workers, with dozens of agencies, organizations and local groups that continue to assist these workers through the difficult months of transition," Snowe, Collins and Michaud said in a joint statement. "By continuing these forums which bring together all of the resources available, our efforts are resounding to ensure that we are as effective as possible in getting information and assistance to every worker who needs help."
   The transition team, chaired by University of Maine at Fort Kent President Dr. Richard Cost, includes representatives from the Maine Department of Human Services, the Aroostook Mental Health Center, the Aroostook County Action Program (ACAP), Fort Kent Adult Education, and local banks and churches.
   The transition team will hold organizational meetings for the agencies in Fort Kent next week:
