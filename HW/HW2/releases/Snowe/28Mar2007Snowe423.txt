SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON COCHRAN AMENDMENT
  During debate on the $121.7 billion dollar war supplemental bill now under consideration, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Wednesday, March 28, 2007, released the following statement on her support of the Cochran amendment:  
   "First let me say there's no question our commitment cannot be open-ended or unconditional and I support setting conditions for a phased withdrawal," said Senator Snowe following the vote. "Rather than mandating a 120 day timetable for withdrawal - that places no conditions and no onus on the Iraqis to achieve their own national reconciliation but only telegraphs a specific date to our enemies and thereby jeopardizes the security of the troops that remain. We should be giving the Iraqi government 120 days to complete work on specific, concrete national reconciliation benchmarks. By cataloging our progress, we can better ensure that our country's presence is tied to actual results and further solidify Iraq's path to independence in the future. 
   According to Senator Snowe, "the Iraqi government must know that any opportunity gained from our increased troop levels in Baghdad is a window that we will soon close if they fail to take urgent action and show tangible results in tandem. If, at the end of 120 days, our commanders report the Iraqis have not met the benchmarks, then our commanders should plan for the phased redeployment of the troops we deployed for the Baghdad Security Plan, period. So either way, we would begin phased redeployment in a reasonable period of time - either because the Iraqis are truly solidifying their nation and their own security, or because we will know soon and once and for all if they possess the political capacity and will to make it happen."
