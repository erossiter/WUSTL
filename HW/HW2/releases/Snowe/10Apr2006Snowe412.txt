SENATE PASSES SEN. SNOWE'S BILL HONORING SMALL BUSINESSES, SBA
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today announced the Senate has passed a resolution honoring America's small businesses and the Small Business Administration in advance of National Small Business Week, which begins April 9th. The resolution passed unanimously.  
   "From family farms to software development, small businesses form the backbone of our economy and provide much of the innovation that moves our country forward," said Snowe. "Americans who assume the risk and responsibilities inherent in owning and operating a business deserve our praise and admiration. To ensure that the spirit of entrepreneurship remains strong in America, we should give small businesses the support they need to thrive." 
   Snowe's bill honors America's 25 million small businesses and the tremendous contributions they make to our economy and way of life. It also highlights the SBA's pivotal role in overseeing the delivery of financial and business development tools for millions of aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small businesses across the United States. 
   "The SBA has been a critical partner to millions of small enterprises as well as aspiring entrepreneurs as they embark on the path to prosperity and job creation," said Snowe. "We must strengthen the SBA's core loan and technical assistance programs that have proven time and again to be a cornerstone in aiding the efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs."
