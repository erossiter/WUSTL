SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH WINNER OF NATIONAL PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLAR AWARD FOR 2005
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met today with Jesse Kaplan of Brunswick who won the National Presidential Scholar award for 2005.  
   "Jesse is a truly accomplished and intelligent young man," said Snowe. "He is clearly deserving of this very prestigious award. I congratulate him on all the hard work it has taken to win such an accolade and wish him the best of luck at Harvard this coming fall." 
   The United States Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964, by Executive Order of the President, to recognize and honor some of our Nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors. Each year, up to 141 students are named as Presidential Scholars, one of the Nation's highest honors for high school students. In honoring the Presidential Scholars, the President of the United States symbolically honors all graduating high school seniors of high potential. 
   From President Lyndon Baines Johnson to George W. Bush, the Presidential Scholars Program has honored more than 5,000 of our nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors. Initiated by President Johnson, the Presidential Scholars Program annually selects one male and one female student from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Americans living abroad, 15 at-large students, and up to 20 students in the arts on the basis of outstanding scholarship, service, leadership and creativity through a rigorous selection and review process administered by the US Department of Education.
