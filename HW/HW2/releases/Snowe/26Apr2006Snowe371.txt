SEN. SNOWE THANKS SBA ADMINISTRATOR HECTOR BARRETO FOR SERVICE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today released the following statement in response to Small Business Administration Administrator Hector Barreto's resignation announcement:  
   "Administrator Barreto's previous success in the financial services industry and his standing in the small business community has served the President, our nation, and small businesses, and I thank him today for that service. His tenure as administrator is the second longest since the SBA was created by President Eisenhower and Congress in 1953. I believe President Bush is committed to supporting the SBA's mission and our nation's Main Street small business community. I look forward to working with Hector's successor, who I hope will be someone who has a deep commitment to the success of small businesses and understands the vital role the SBA plays in that success. I wish Hector well as he embarks on new career challenges."
