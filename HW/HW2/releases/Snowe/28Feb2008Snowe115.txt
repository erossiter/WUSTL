REP. SNOWE CALLS FOR SENATE TO PASS POST-9/11 VETERANS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT
  U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) joined with several of her colleagues today to reintroduce the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007. This legislation significantly enhances the educational benefits provided to our newest generation of veterans by providing increased tuition assistance, coverage for books and fees, and a monthly stipend for housing costs. 
   "The time has come for Congress to initiate a comprehensive overhaul of the current educational benefits provided to our brave men and women in uniform," said Senator Snowe. "This robust and responsive educational assistance program not only rightfully acknowledges our veterans heroism, but will help spark economic growth and expansion. At a time when recruitment and readiness is an issue of national necessity, these enhanced benefits will further our goal of building and sustaining a modern military force."
   Under this bipartisan legislation, the benefits scale for active and reserve components is readjusted recognize cumulative active duty service, as veterans returning from Iraq or Afghanistan may earn up to 36 months of benefits, equivalent to four academic years. Additionally, this bill creates a voluntary program allowing colleges and universities to enter into equitable cost-sharing arrangements to assist veterans whose tuition costs exceed the benefits provided under the legislation.
   This bill represents a bipartisan update to S.22, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007, which was originally introduced by Senator Jim Webb on January 4, 2007.
