SEN. SNOWE RECEIVES AWARD FROM MAINE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today received a Special Recognition Award from the Maine School Boards Association.  
 Snowe won this honor for her efforts in securing funding for schools and libraries across the nation to improve their telecommunications options and access to internet services. 
   "I am thrilled to receive this award today," said Snowe. "E-Rate funding is essential to students, especially those in rural areas, because it gives them access to technology that they otherwise would not have, preparing them for higher education and the workforce. I pledge to continue the fight for E-Rate funding and to keep it one of Congress' priorities." 
   Senators Snowe and Rockefeller (D-WV) gained the inclusion of their E-rate provision in the telecommunications reform bill by a single vote in the Senate Commerce Committee and successfully fought back an effort on the Senate floor to remove the provision from the bill. The Senators then defended E-rate during the two and one-half year implementation process at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), ensuring it was implemented in a manner consistent with the language of the law and intent of the authors. 
   The Snowe-Rockefeller E-Rate provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries.
