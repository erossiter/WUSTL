SEN. SNOWE VOTES FOR PORT SECURITY AMENDMENT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), who chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries and the Coast Guard, today voted for an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution offered by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-FL) which would increase funding by $978 million for port and maritime security, particularly increasing funding for the Container Security Initiative (CSI), the long-delayed Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program, and greater data gathering technology. The Senate passed this amendment by a vote of 90 to 8.  
   "In our zeal to reinforce and strengthen our security in the air, we have neglected other modes of transportation, especially the maritime sector," said Snowe. "An effective port security apparatus is long overdue, and we must make a real commitment to providing the Coast Guard and other entities the resources they need to get the job done. I applaud the Senate for passing this amendment and taking this first step towards adequately funding our maritime security efforts." 
   CSI is a program intended to help increase security for containerized cargo shipped to the United States from around the world. 
   The TWIC program is working toward a system-wide common credential that would be used across all transportation modes for all personnel who require unescorted physical and or computer access to secure areas of the national transportation system. This amendment would designate funds for background checks for workers who could eventually receive TWIC credentials. TWIC is being developed in response to threats and vulnerabilities identified throughout the transportation system.
