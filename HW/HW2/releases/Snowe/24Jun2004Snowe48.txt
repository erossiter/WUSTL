SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS FEDERAL COURT RULING ON FCC MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES
  A member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) hailed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit today which invalidated two key provisions of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) media ownership rules. Snowe, who has long been concerned by the negative impact of media consolidation on programming, secured Senate passage of an amendment this week with Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to the FY2005 Defense Authorization bill that effectively repealed the media ownership rules. The Defense Authorization bill passed the Senate late last night. 
   "I applaud today's ruling by the 3rd Circuit Court that the arbitrary rules established by the FCC were carelessly and improperly written last June. The court confirmed my long-held belief that the FCC did not have sufficient basis for rewriting those rules that prevent our media outlets from falling under the control of a few large corporations," said Snowe. "This decision further underscores the position that I and many of my colleagues in the Senate have long argued, that the FCC must provide reasonable and sufficient justification for any proposed changes to the current media ownership rules. Today's true winners are the local communities and the independent broadcasters who will retain this critical protection against excessive consolidation."
   The 3rd Circuit Court struck down two specific key provisions of the FCC media ownership rules today due to insufficient justification for the numerical limits set on cross-ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast station within the same market and television ownership of two or more stations within the same market. A third provision, which would have raised the media ownership cap to 45 percent in any given market, was effectively reduced to 39 percent under the Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus Spending Appropriations.
