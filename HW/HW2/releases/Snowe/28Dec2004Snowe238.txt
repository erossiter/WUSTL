SEN. SNOWE EXPRESSES GRIEF AT EARTHQUAKE, TSUNAMI TRAGEDY; PRAISES BUSH ON FORMATION OF ASIAN RELIEF COALITION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today expressed her most profound sadness at the tremendous loss of life due to Sunday's earthquake and Tsunami that have resulted in more than 80,000 deaths.  
   "Without question, last Sunday's tragedy is one of the single largest disasters of modern times with the death toll continuing to grow and with countless more homeless, lacking food and clean water," said Snowe. "I extend my deepest condolences to the entire region as it struggles to recover from this unimaginable devastation." 
   Snowe also commended President Bush on the formation of an Asian Relief Coalition comprised of the United States, India, Australia, and Japan to coordinate worldwide relief and reconstruction efforts for those areas ravaged by Sunday's earthquake and Tsunami. The President announced this coalition at a news conference held this morning from his ranch in Crawford, Texas. 
   "By creating an Asian Relief Coalition, President Bush has rightly brought together nations around the world to coordinate worldwide relief and reconstruction efforts for those nations devastated by Sunday's earthquake and Tsunami. A unified, global effort is the best means of providing the most appropriate and needed help to those affected by this tragedy. I commend the President for bringing the strength and assets of the United States and the global community to bear to bring relief to those in such dire need," said Snowe.
