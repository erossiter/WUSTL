SEN. SNOWE DISAPPOINTED BY PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PLAN FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) Wednesday, Feb. 7, commented on President Bush's Fiscal Year 2008 budget proposal that would greatly impact veterans' healthcare. The President's budget recommends offsetting some of the increase in the VA's budget by instituting new enrollment fees and increasing co-payments for some veterans. The budget also contains a 1.4 percent cost of living adjustment effective January 1, 2008 to recipients of pensions, disability compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation.  
   "While I appreciate President Bush's proposal to increase Veterans Program funding, it is simply not enough, and I do not believe any increase should come at the cost of our nation's veterans in the form of higher enrollment fees and co-payments," said Senator Snowe. "Today as more than 600,000 veterans have returned from service in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have an obligation to provide every veteran with timely, quality health care." 
   The 2008 budget for Veteran's Affairs requests $84.4 billion, which includes $29.7 billion in discretionary funding for the medical services account and $2.4 billion in estimated collections, a portion of which could come from new proposed user fee increases imposed on some veterans (priority level 7 and 8). The first user fee proposal would establish an income-based annual enrollment fee that ranges from $250-$750, and the second would increase pharmacy co-payments from $8 to $15. Senator Snowe has long opposed income-based enrollment fees and higher pharmaceutical co-payments and will continue to raise objections to proposals that restrict veterans' access to healthcare.
