SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR ACTION ON H-2B VISA AVAILABILITY
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) today sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter and Ranking Member Patrick J. Leahy urging them to address the shortages in annual H-2B visa availability.  
 The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced yesterday - less than four months into the fiscal year - that it had already reached the annual 66,000 cap for H-2B visas for the current fiscal year (FY 2005). 
   "The lack of H-2B visa availability is an ongoing problem that can only become worse with the passing of each fiscal year," said Snowe. "The affected industries need relief, and they need it now. This is not a partisan immigration issue. For the sake of small businesses all across the nation, Congress must prioritize this issue in the early days of the 109th Congress." 
   Last year, the cap for FY 2004 was reached in March, 2004, severely impacting year-round American jobs and small business owners whose livelihoods depend on a successful summer season. During the last Congress, Senator Snowe cosponsored S.2258, the "Summer Operations and Services (S.O.S.) Relief and Reform Act"and S. 2252, the "Save Summer Act," and supported efforts to bring relief to employers in Maine and across the nation. 
   "From bed-and-breakfasts to local restaurants, the small businesses that comprise Maine's largest economic sector rely on additional summer help from some 3,000 seasonal, foreign workers who hold an H-2B visa," said Snowe. " Business owners all over Maine are in dire need of legislative action." 
   In Maine, approximately 87,000 jobs are directly tied to the success of tourism, which generates $13.9 billion for Maine's economy and $556 million in state tax revenue.
