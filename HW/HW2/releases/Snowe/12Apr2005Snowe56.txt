SEN. SNOWE PLEASED WITH PINE SHOOT BEETLE DECISION
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today praised the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for its decision to allow white pine logs and bark to be transported into Maine from New Hampshire for processing under limited permits. Previously, white pine was prohibited from being transported into Maine for fear of infesting trees in Maine with pine shoot beetles from New Hampshire.  
   "The wood products industry is vital to Maine's economy, so it is imperative that lumber and other products be transported across Maine's border without fear of spreading pine shoot beetles," said Snowe. "In this case, I was convinced that white pine logs and bark could be safely brought into Maine - the reality of this is that timber companies in Maine would not import infested logs that could destroy their own trees and their future profits." 
   In an effort to bring the issue to resolution last week, Senator Snowe spoke by phone with APHIS Deputy Administrator Richard L. Dunkle. On April 7th, APHIS announced that white pine log and bark white pine logs and bark would be allowed to move, under limited permits, from quarantined areas in New England to non-quarantined areas in Maine under the protocols APHIS has determined to be adequate. Industry in Maine and the government of the State of Maine had requested this action as well. 
   APHIS has developed protocols for handling white pine logs and bark that are adequate to prevent the spread of pine shoot beetles and under which these regulated articles may move out of the regulated area. These protocols are incorporated in the compliance agreements for shipping and receiving white pine logs. In addition, the State has agreed to conduct a random audit of approximately ten percent of all agreements to ensure compliance with said protocols and conditions.
