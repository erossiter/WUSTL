  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded $150,000 to the Maine Department of Education as a part of the Advanced Placement Incentive Program. The funds will be utilized to increase the participation of low-income high school students in both pre-AP and AP courses and tests.  
   "The U.S. Department of Education funding will encourage students of all backgrounds to participate in advanced placement courses and help inspire them to pursue higher education," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "It is important that all students have the same opportunities, especially those who are committed to academic excellence." 
   The Advanced Placement Incentive Program provides grants to eligible entities to enable them to increase the participation of low-income students in both pre-AP and AP courses and tests. Grants support the development, enhancement, or expansion of pre-AP courses aligned with AP courses in mathematics, science, English, and other core academics.
