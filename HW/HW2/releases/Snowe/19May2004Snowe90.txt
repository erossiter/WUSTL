SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF 'PROJECT BIOSHIELD'
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today applauded Senate passage of Project Bioshield (S. 15) to authorize funding for research and production of vaccines for smallpox, anthrax, botulism toxin, among other dangerous pathogens like Ebola and plague.  
 The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 99 to 0. 
   "By approving Project Bioshield today, the Senate has taken a significant step to ensuring the protection of people against a potentially dangerous bioterrorist attack," said Snowe. "Anthrax attacks have already claimed American lives and the discovery of ricin in Senator Frist's office this February demonstrates that while this bioterrorist threat is a continuing one, it is one that we can defend against. This legislation does just that by providing critical resources for research and production of vaccines to ensure our nation's overall safety against this potentially deadly threat." 
   Project Bioshield is a 10-year initiative to develop and stockpile vaccines and medications to combat a bioterrorism attack. The bill authorizes funding for research and production of vaccines against smallpox, anthrax and botulism toxin, as well as other dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and plague. No vaccines are available for these pathogens, except smallpox and anthrax, and these two pathogens need safer replacements vaccines. 
   "This legislation will help increase our national commitment to vaccines. Considering that these vaccines have no commercial application, this legislation ensures that we have sufficient resources available to combat these deadly pathogens," said Snowe. 
   The bill also permits the federal government, in the event of a national emergency, to make certain treatments available to the public before they are approved by the FDA and guarantees $5.6 billion for the program over 10 years.
