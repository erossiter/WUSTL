SEN. SNOWE BACKS BILL ADDRESSING 'DISGRACEFUL' CONDITIONS AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL HOSPITAL
  Appalled by recent reports of substandard living conditions for thousands of our nation's brave service men and women at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital in Washington D.C., Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) has joined Sens. Barack Obama (D-IL) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) as a cosponsor of the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act. The bill would ensure that wounded service members at Walter Reed and all other military outpatient housing units receive the level of treatment, care, and service they have unquestionably earned. 
   The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act would specifically require improved military housing facilities and robust inspections of each facility, reduce bureaucratic red tape that prevents service members from receiving timely and efficient care, while improving access to counseling and support programs for service members and their families.  
   "I was incensed when I discovered that our brave men and women who have risked their lives in service to our country are convalescing under these disgraceful conditions," Snowe said. "It is disrespectful to all of those who have so honorably worn our nation's uniform and fought in defense of our freedom." The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act: 
   * Establishes standards for military outpatient housing-including that outpatient dormitories must match the existing service standard for active-duty barracks-and that repair requests must be completed within 15 days or alternate housing must be offered. 
   * Establishes a zero-tolerance policy for pest infestation. 
   * Creates an inspection regime to ensure high-level military officials are aware of problems at medical facilities. 
   * Requires an EMT and Crisis Counselor at all outpatient residences 24 hours a day. 
   "These brave men and women and their family members come to Walter Reed in need of care and support and it is the shared responsibility of every American to ensure they do not carry that burden alone. Support and counseling must be readily available for all out patient residents and family members, who should never be forced to choose between tending to their loved one or keeping their job," Snowe said. The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act: 
   * Provides federal protections for the jobs of family members who are caring for recovering service members, so they do not have to choose between caring for their loved one and keeping their job. 
   * Extends medical care to family members while they are living at military treatment facilities. 
   * Extends employment services to care-giving family members. 
   * Strengthens existing anonymous crisis counseling and respite services. 
   "The unacceptably long process delays for troops who seek a determination for their military status and disability level must be addressed and eliminated," Senator Snowe said. It takes an average of 209 days for soldiers to go through the process of determining whether or not they can remain in the military and, if not, at what level of disability they will be assessed and discharged. This process is made more complicated with duplicative requirements, extensive paperwork, and inefficient case management. The bill: 
   * Brings the Physical Disability Evaluation System (PDES) under one command to reduce bureaucratic red tape and unnecessary delays. 
   * Calls for injury-specific PDES procedures to allow the most severely injured service members to bypass unnecessary and lengthy steps. 
   * Requires that PDES system be available and accessible entirely online so that service members and case managers can more easily complete paperwork requirements. 
   * Requires a single location for PDES processing at hospitals that serve more than 100 recovering service members. 
   * Requires the Pentagon to identify and implement other ways to streamline PDES. 
   Earlier this year, Senator Snowe and Senator Obama introduced the Lane Evans Healthcare Benefits Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation would ensure veterans receive timely and efficient medical treatment and post-deployment services by creating a data registry of the medical needs and treatments of the more than 600,000 service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.
