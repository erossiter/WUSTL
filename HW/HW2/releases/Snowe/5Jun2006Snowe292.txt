SEN. SNOWE GIVEN 'SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE' AWARD BY U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  At the Portland Regional Chamber's monthly "Eggs and Issues" breakfast this morning, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) its "Spirit of Enterprise Award" for her work on behalf of businesses throughout Maine and America during the first session of the 109th Congress. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe addressed the largest ever gathering at the "Eggs and Issues" breakfast. 
   "Chambers of Commerce throughout Maine and America serve as the economic pulse of our economy. They intimately understand what our businesses need to thrive in an increasingly competitive global economy," said Snowe. "Receiving the Chamber of Commerce's "Spirit of Enterprise" award is a tremendous honor and one that I will never take for granted. I understand that our nation's businesses - and especially in Maine - our small businesses are the engine of our economic growth employing millions of Americans. I again thank the Chamber for this prestigious award and pledge to continue to work to ensure a strong economy for our nation's businesses."
   Snowe received a score of 78 percent from the U.S. Chamber of legislation that they deem essential to economic growth. This is the highest score of any member of Congress in the Northeast. Snowe received a similar award for her work during the 108th Congress. 
   At the breakfast, Snowe laid out her vision for how the Congress should move forward to address those issues that matter to the people of Maine and America. Snowe said that she believes that pragmatism not politics is the means of getting things done in Washington and that during these increasingly partisan times there is honor in consensus building.
