SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS CREATE TRANSITION TEAM FOR SANMINA-SCI EMPLOYEES AT WESTBROOK PLANT
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) today announced that their offices are creating a transition team to assist approximately 325 workers of Sanmina-SCI's Westbrook plant who were notified on Monday that the plant will close in March 2005.  
 The Senators' offices have already been in contact with the Mayor of Westbrook to facilitate coordination and cooperation of making resources available to the displaced workers and their families. 
   "The closure of Sanmina-SCI will place a tremendous burden on those affected workers, their families, and indeed, the entire Westbrook community. It is particularly sad to receive such bad news so close to the holidays," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We will do everything we can to help these displaced workers and their families during these difficult times. It is our hope that a task force and upcoming meetings with state and federal agencies will provide useful information to these workers about what resources are available." 
   The transition team, coordinated by representatives from each of the Senator's state offices, brings together agencies who can offer assistance to the laid off workers and area service providers, examines the needs of the communities and determines the resources that can be brought to bear during these transition months to help the workers. 
   Senators Snowe and Collins will be announcing transition team meetings for the displaced workers, their families and the community shortly.
