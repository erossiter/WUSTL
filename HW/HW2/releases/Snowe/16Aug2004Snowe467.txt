  Cheering on Maine's Olympians in Athens, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) congratulated Portland native Ian Crocker on his bronze medal in the Men's 4x100 meter Freestyle Relay. Crocker, who is participating in his second Olympic Games, was joined by fellow Americans Michael Phelps, Jason Lezak, and Neil Walker in capturing the medal for the United States.
   "Joining with Mainers across the state, I congratulate Ian on his victory in Athens as part of the U.S. Men's 4x100 meters Freestyle Relay Team," said Snowe. "Swimming strong against formidable competition, Ian and his fellow teammates represented the United States on the international stage with honor and sportsmanship. I wish Ian the best of luck in his remaining races during these 2004 Olympic Games."
   Ian Crocker, a 21 year old from Portland, returns to the Olympics after winning the gold medal in the Sydney Games as part of the U.S. Men's 4x100m Medley Relay Squad. Crocker, the first Olympic swimmer from Maine, grew up training at Reiche Pool, a four-lane, 25-yard pool in Portland before joining the club team, the Portland Porpoises. Crocker will also compete in the 100-meter Butterfly in Athens.
   Teams swimming for South Africa and the Netherlands captured the gold and silver medals, respectively.
