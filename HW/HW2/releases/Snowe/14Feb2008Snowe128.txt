SEN. SNOWE ATTENDS ECONOMIC STIMULUS LEGISLATION SIGNING CEREMONY
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, attended today's signing ceremony at the White House for the economic stimulus package that included relief for 21.5 million seniors, 250,000 disabled veterans and their widows. 
   "This a tremendous day for the American people as we pass bipartisan stimulus legislation that extends tax relief to the people in this country who need it the most including millions of seniors who are living on a fixed income, our military veterans and their widows," Senator Snowe said. "However I will continue my efforts to provide relief to the long-term unemployed and heating assistance to low-income families."
   As Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, Senator Snowe was also particularly pleased that the stimulus legislation included a provision to increase small business expensing to $250,000.
   "As small businesses are the backbone of this nation's economy, it is only fitting that the stimulus package enables these firms to invest in the products and technologies of the future, as well as create new jobs," added Senator Snowe. "By allowing small businesses to write off more of their purchases instead of waiting years to recover costs through depreciation deductions, this bill does just that and will be a tremendous asset in helping the economy weather the current downturn."
