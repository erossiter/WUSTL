SENATE PASSES ENERGY BILL WITH LANDMARK CONSERVATION, RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX INCENTIVES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) voted today for a Senate Energy bill that is a legislative milestone in providing $14 billion in tax incentives most of which are aimed at promoting conservation and renewable fuel development. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Snowe succeeded in securing numerous conservation and renewable energy tax incentives in the tax portion of the Energy Bill. The Energy bill passed the Senate today by a vote of 85 to 12.  
   "This legislation is not what I would have written. I believe we need to bring greater balance to our nation's energy policy especially during these times of skyrocketing oil prices," said Snowe. "I voted for the Energy Bill, however, because it truly is historic in providing landmark tax incentives for conservation and alternate energy development. These incentives are a benefit to a more thoughtful energy policy and will prove essential to countless Mainers." 
   This legislation includes several provisions based on the Efficient Energy through Certified Technologies and Electricity Reliability (EFFECTER) Act, legislation that Snowe introduced with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to provide targeted tax incentives and standards for energy efficiency. 
   Snowe also fought for provisions in the legislation essential to cold winter states like Maine, including one to provide incentives to weatherize and retrofit homes and increase energy efficiency. "Too many homes suffer through our long and often brutal winters, but now we have set in place incentives to weatherize and retrofit homes and increase efficiency. This is essential to lowering our heating bills and keeping our homes and businesses warm," continued Snowe. 
   The Energy bill also includes an extension of the Section 45 tax credit put forward by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Snowe for the production of electricity from certain renewable sources. In addition, the period which taxpayers can claim the credit would be extended from 5 years to 10 years to provide parity for all renewable sources like biomass, wind, and solar. 
   "This provision is hugely important for Maine's biomass industry by allowing them to stand on a level playing field with other renewable sources," said Snowe. 
   Snowe is disappointed that three provisions she fought to include in the Energy bill failed. The first would have given Governors veto authority over a decision by the Federal Government to site a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) facility in their state. The second would have maintained the moratorium against off-shore oil exploration and drilling. The third would have required mandatory reductions in heat-trapping pollution that may be warming the Earth. 
   Other Snowe provisions that are in the Energy Bill include: 
   * Credit for residential energy property 
   Provides $50 for each advanced main air circulating fan (Tier 1) and $300 for each Tier 2 energy efficient property. Residences receive $2,000 if energy costs are reduced by 50% or $4,000 multiplied by the energy reduction if it falls between 20% and 50%. 
   * Incentives for Commercial Building Properties 
   Provides incentives to a commercial building that reduces the total energy and power costs with respect to the interior lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water by 50%. The incentives amount to $2.25 per square foot of the commercial building. 
   * Energy Efficient New Homes 
   Provides a $1,000 - 2,000 tax credit for newly constructed homes that have a projected reduction of heating and cooling costs that is 30% - 50% less than a comparable home. 
   * Deduction for business energy property 
   Provides $150 for each advanced main air circulating fan (Tier 1) or $900 for a Tier 2 energy efficient property qualified by the Department of Energy. This is also applicable to residential rental building properties. The deduction for the rental properties is $6,000 for each rental unit if energy costs are reduced by 50% or by $12,000 multiplied by the energy reduction if it falls between 20% and 50%. 
   * Energy Credit for combined heat and power system property 
   Provides a 10% credit for the purchase of a CHP property. CHP refers to "combined heat and power" and has a fairly complicated definition, but basically refers to the use of thermal power. 
   * Energy Efficient Appliances 
   Provides incentives for various energy efficient appliances that meet standards Energy Star Program standards. The appliances include clothes washers, dishwashers and refrigerators. 
   * Residential solar hot water, photovoltaics and fuel cell property 
   Provides a tax credit of 30% of expenditures to a maximum total of $2,000 for the purchase of photovoltaic technology or solar energy property. 
   * Credit for business installation of qualified fuel cells and stationary microturbine power plants 
   Provides a 30% business energy credit for the purchase of fuel cell power plants for businesses. A fuel cell power plant is defined as a converter of fuel into electricity that reaches an efficiency of 30% through electrochemical means. This provision also includes a 10% credit for qualifying microturbine power plants. 
   * Business solar investment tax credit 
   Provides a 30% business energy credit to businesses that uses solar energy to generate electricity, to heat or cool a structure, or to provide solar process heat.
