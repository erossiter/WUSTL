SEN. SNOWE PRAISES PENTAGON'S INITIAL REJECTION OF NAVY'S WINNER-TAKE-ALL STRATEGY FOR DD(X)
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement regarding a memo from the Department of Defense, signed by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Michael Wynne, which initially turned down the Navy's request to allow a single shipyard to build the DD(X) destroyer:  
   "Today's announcement by the Pentagon is proof that they recognize the need to step back to reevaluate this ill-advised one-shipyard policy. Maintaining multiple shipyards is absolutely vital because we cannot foresee how many destroyers we will need in the future. One is simply not enough to preserve the flexibility and capacity necessary to protect our nation. 
   "I and my Senate Colleagues from other shipbuilding regions have repeatedly made the case to the Department of Defense that the Navy's proposed strategy is short-sighted and endangers the skilled workforce and industrial base that supports our national defense. While today's decision to delay judgment is good news for Bath Iron Works, it is not a final decision - I will continue to urge Navy and Pentagon officials to abandon this misguided strategy that undermines our ability to build destroyers."
