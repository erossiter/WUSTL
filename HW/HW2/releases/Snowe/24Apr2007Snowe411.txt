SEN. SNOWE MOURNS LOSS OF LEBANON WOMAN, GRANDDAUGHTER KILLED IN STORM FLOODWATERS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today extended her condolences to the family of Donna Dube of Lebanon and her granddaughter, Saphire Perro of Manchester, New Hampshire, who lost their lives in the storm floodwaters on Monday.  
   "My heartfelt condolences go out to the family of Donna Dube and Saphire Perro," said Senator Snowe. "This terrible storm has adversely impacted so many Americans on the upper East Coast and I am deeply saddened to hear about these lives lost in our state. I commend the heroic efforts of George Eliason, who bravely risked his life to help Donna and Saphire. Mr. Eliason is one of many Mainers who have gone above the call of duty to help our state recover during this difficult time." 
   Snowe extends her continued support and assistance to all Maine communities severely impacted by the massive rainstorm Monday that left more than 130,000 residents without power. Staff members from Senator Snowe's Washington, DC and Maine district offices have been working extensively with Governor John Baldacci's office and the Maine Emergency Management Agency to better assess the extent of the storm's damage. 
   Senator Snowe has also created a link on her web site to help Mainers navigate useful services to help recover and re-build in the aftermath of the storm. Please visit www.snowe.senate.gov for more resources. Anyone with urgent needs should call 2-1-1 for immediate assistance.
