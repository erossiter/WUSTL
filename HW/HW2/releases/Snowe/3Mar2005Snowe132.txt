SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $700,000 FROM U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has awarded Maine $680,906.  
 The funds have been allocated through a total of $18 million awarded to 21 states to implement systems to provide reemployment and eligibility assessment (REA) services to unemployment insurance (UI) applicants. 
   "This REA grant will help provide Mainers with the services they need in this difficult time," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "It is essential that workers get all the support they need to help them re-enter the workforce, especially since the layoffs affect not only the workers, but their families and the community as well." 
   The grant guidelines require that these funds be used to conduct in-person assessments in One-Stop Career Centers within the state. The assessment must include an unemployment eligibility review, the provision of labor market information, development of a work-search plan and referral of reemployment services.
