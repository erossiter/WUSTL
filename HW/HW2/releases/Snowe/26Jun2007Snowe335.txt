SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION HEARING FOR JOHN RIZZO
  During today's nomination hearing of John Rizzo as the general counsel to the Central Intelligence Agency, Senate Intelligence Committee members questioned his role as the agency's top legal advisor in reviewing and establishing the official guidelines for the administration's detainee and interrogation program. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the committee, made the following comments today after hearing:  
   "I recently supported a resolution urging the administration to promptly complete a long overdue review of the program and mandating that Congress and the Administration evaluate whether a separate CIA detention program is necessary, lawful, and in the best interests of the United States. It is important to weigh the value of the program against the damage it does to the image of the United States abroad. Without fully grasping the legal basis, it is difficult to thoroughly evaluate his record with respect to this controversial program. I urge the administration to provide the legal review promptly as the Committee considers his nomination."
