SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $208 MILLION LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT TO BATH IRON WORKS
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) announced today that Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine has been awarded a $208,060,756 cost plus incentive fee / award fee contract modification under previously awarded contracts for the construction of a Littoral Combat Ship.  
 "Today, the Navy reaffirmed Bath Iron Work's reputation as the nation's premier shipyard with its decision to award this $208 million contract for construction oversight of the LCS," said Snowe. "BIW's long and storied tradition is one earned at the hands of the men and women of the world class workforce who make it all possible, and I commend them and congratulate Bath Iron Works on this well deserved contract."
 The Littoral Combat Ship takes advantage of the newest generation hull forms, and tailored, modularized combat systems package designs to enable the LCS to defeat enemy littoral defenses, including mines, fast swarming small boats, and submarines, ultimately ensuring maritime access in any environment.
