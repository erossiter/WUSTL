SEN. SNOWE PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR NORSUN EMPLOYEES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today said she will work to help the 44 NorSun employees in Fort Kent who lost their jobs when NorSun closed their potato processing plant yesterday with plans to move their business to Idaho. 
   "For the 44 workers who lost their jobs yesterday at NorSun, I will leave no stone unturned to provide all the possible support available to help during these difficult times," said Snowe. "Over the coming weeks, my staff and I will examine each and every opportunity available to mitigate the affects that the closure of the NorSun processing plant in Fort Kent will have on the workers, their families, and the surrounding community."
   The Maine Department of Labor has set up a RETI session tomorrow with NorSun management to work collaboratively for the best interests of the dislocated employees. The RETI session for employees is expected to be set up for the employees within a few days.
   Snowe's staff is holding a meeting tomorrow with members of NorSun's staff and a Fort Kent's Economic Development representative to determine what actions can be taken to assist the employees.
