SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH FRATERNAL MOST VALUABLE PARTICIPANT: WILFRED J. BELL OF CARIBOU
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today met with Wilfred J. Bell of Caribou, who is one of the four Fraternal Most Valuable Participants (MVPs) for the week of August 20, 2007. The National Fraternal Congress of America recognizes Fraternal MVPs as "Fraternalists-in-Action" who volunteer their time, energy and compassion to strengthen their communities through participation in local lodge activities and other charitable endeavors.  
   "I congratulate Will on his recent honor of being named the Fraternal Most Valuable Participant from Maine," said Senator Snowe. "As a Fraternalist-in-Action, Will has illustrated exceptional compassion and vision through his volunteer efforts, his dedication to his community, and his commitment to making our state a better place." 
   Wilfred J. Bell is currently chief ranger of both Court #1465 and the Maine State Court. He chaired six state conventions and received Legion of Honor and Maine Forester of the Year awards. As a member of Catholic Order of Foresters, Wilfred has been involved in fundraisers supporting Holy Rosary Church. He chaired a committee that sponsored several annual variety shows and auctions, which raised money to help rebuild the church after it was destroyed by a fire. 
   He has also chaired, directed, or presided over as president of several community organizations including the Chamber of Commerce, United Fund, Kiwanis, Senior Citizens Committee, Caribou Bicentennial Committee, and Coalition for Affordable Energy. He served two terms in the Maine House of Representatives and presently is Aroostook County treasurer and president of Maine's county treasurers association.
