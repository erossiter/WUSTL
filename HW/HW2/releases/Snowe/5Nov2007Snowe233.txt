SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS DISAPPOINTED BY PRESIDENT'S VETO OF WRDA
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today released the following statement on the President's decision to veto the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which authorizes $26.9 million to help ensure that the Army Corps of Engineers will have the funds necessary to fully protect the residents and beachfront at Camp Ellis in Saco.  
   "The President's decision to veto the Water Resources Development Act, a bill that passed with vast bicameral bipartisan support, is a profound disappointment," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "For years, Camp Ellis has lacked the resources needed to save shorelines and beach front homes from destruction. The President's veto is a step in a wrong direction and is wasting what little time our communities have to plan for the future. We remain committed to overriding the President's veto, enacting this legislation into law, and providing our communities the ability to invest in their future." 
   Both the House and the Senate are expected to vote to override the President's veto.
