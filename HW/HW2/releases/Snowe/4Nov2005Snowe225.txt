SEN. SNOWE VOTES FOR AMENDMENT TO BRING FISCAL DISCIPLINE BACK TO BUDGET PROCESS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) voted in favor of an amendment by Sen.  
 Kent Conrad (D-ND) to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Budget Reconciliation Act to reinstate the "pay-as-you-go" rules requiring any additional tax reductions or mandatory spending increases be subject to a 60 vote point of order unless fully offset or "paid for" - rather than deficit financed. 
   "Today, I voted to reinstate essential pay-as-you-go rules as a means of bringing fiscal sanity to the budget process. This is a common sense approach to reigning in the deficit. I have long believed that we must be prudent in examining both sides of the federal ledger - both to revenues and spending - to bring balance to our spending blueprint. This amendment is sound policy, consistent with my principles, to raise the bar so we can address the long-term economic well-being of our nation by putting our fiscal house in order in a fair and equitable manner," said Snowe. 
   The Conrad amendment failed by a vote of 50 to 49 due to a procedural hurdle that required a 60 vote threshold to succeed.
