SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR CONTINUED VIGILANCE IN WAKE OF FOILED TERRORIST PLOT IN UNITED KINGDOM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement today in response to the announcement that a terrorist plot to attack international flights from London to the United States has been uncovered and the terrorists apprehended: 
   "I would like to commend the British Government for disrupting an intricate plan to attack thousands of innocent civilians. It is clear that we continue to be the target of terrorists who threaten our very way of life. They have proven their willingness to cross international borders and use what ever means necessary to accomplish their goal of mass murder and the disruption of all freedom-loving societies. That is why it is absolutely imperative that we continue to fight terror with unwavering vigilance and commitment. 
   "Furthermore, our government's greatest, single responsibility is to ensure the safety of the American people. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I believe it is only through our continued international partnerships and coordination with our valued allies that we can fulfill that charge."
