SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $75,000 FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTORING
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $75,000 in federal funding to the Drug-Free Communities Support Programs in Maine.  
 This federal grant is awarded by the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. 
   "This federal funding is critical to ensuring that state and local agencies have the necessary resources to provide recovery support for substance abuse to young adults in our communities," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The federal grant was allocated as follows: 
   * $75,000 to the Regional Medical Center at Lubec, Inc., Coalition for Healthy Tommorows (CHT), to strengthen collaborations and partnerships through mentoring and preventing substance abuse in those who have not yet begun abusing, on reducing harm for those who abuse now, and on providing a continuum of care for those who need intervention and recovery support. 
   The Coalition for Healthy Tommorows (CHT) is a community-based coalition that seeks to provide for proven drug prevention strategies, increases awareness within communities and enhances mentoring opportunities. The community-based coalition has served Washington County since 1997.
