SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $150,000 IN FUNDING FOR PENOBSCOT INDIAN NATION FOR PENOSBCOT RIVER RESTORATION
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has awarded a $149,490 grant to the Penobscot Indian Nation.  
 The funds have been allocated through the Tribal Landowner Incentive Program and will be used for a project called 'Katahdin to the Sea: Restoring the Penobscot River Ecosystem.' 
   "Maine is a state renowned for its natural environment so it is critical that we do everything we can to preserve Maine's ecosystems," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "We applaud efforts by the Penobscot Indian Nation to restore the Penobscot River's ecological balance and encourage others to work toward maintaining Maine's stunning natural beauty." 
   The Tribal Landowner Incentive Program supports federally recognized Indian tribes to develop programs that benefit wildlife and their habitat, including non-game species on tribal lands.
