SEN. SNOWE PRESSES BUDGET NEGOTIATORS TO RESIST FOOD STAMP CUTS
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) joined her colleagues Sens.  
 Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) in offering a motion to instruct budget conferees to insist that the conference report must not contain any cuts to federal food assistance programs, including the food stamp program. The federal food stamp program is the first line of defense against hunger and food insecurity, providing nutrition assistance for over 25 million Americans. 
   "For many Americans struggling to make ends meet, the food stamp program is the difference between having enough to eat and going hungry," said Snowe. "We must not seek to achieve budget savings on the backs of low-income families, seniors, and disabled Americans who rely on food stamps just to survive. I urge the budget negotiators to do the right thing and resist any efforts to cut funding for this vital program." 
   Eighty percent of benefits under the food stamp program, over $23,000,000,000 in 2005, are provided to families with children, making the program the most important form of assistance for children in the United States. In addition, the food stamp program plays an important role during natural disasters, such as the recent hurricanes in the Gulf Region. The program has provided emergency food assistance to approximately 2,200,000 individuals affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, allowing disaster victims to obtain critical food within days after the storms.
