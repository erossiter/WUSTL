SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR SAUNDERS BROTHERS WORKERS IN GREENWOOD
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that the U.S. Department of Labor has certified Trade Adjustment Assistance for Saunders Brothers LLC employees in Greenwood, Maine. This ensures assistance eligibility for all workers who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after January 15, 2007. Workers can access these benefits by going to their local one-stop career center. The easiest way to locate the closest one-stop is by going to and entering their zip code. 
   "The effects of our troubled economy have permeated Maine's small businesses and as a result, many hard-working people have lost their jobs," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "It is imperative that we assist these workers in finding and attaining new jobs that will help restore their quality of life and bring to new life to our economy."
