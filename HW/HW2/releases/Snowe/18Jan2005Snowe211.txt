SEN. SNOWE PRAISES BUSH'S TSUNAMI WARNING PLAN
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) called the Bush administration's plan to implement a comprehensive tsunami warning system a tremendous step forward in protecting the nation and the world from potential tsunamis.  
 The Bush administration announced today a plan to implement a comprehensive tsunami warning system for the United States by mid-2007. The plan includes the purchase and deployment of 37 tsunami warning buoys which will be placed in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean oceans, ensuring that the entire U.S. coastline will have a tsunami warning system in place. 
   "Today's announcement is a tremendous step forward to help ensure the safety of our coastal towns and communities. By establishing a tsunami warning system we will be better protected against natural disasters like the one that took the lives of close to 140,000 people in South Asia," said Snowe. "I applaud President Bush for this action and look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues in Congress to ensure that not only our nation, but indeed our world, has a warning system in place." 
   Snowe was critical of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) initial response and the lack of warning provided to Indian Ocean nations and still believes that the U.S. needs to aggressively pursue a global warning system. Her bill, S.1400, that passed in the Senate during the 108th Congress would have authorized the creation of a national network which could have become part of a world-wide network. This network would have been capable of warning against numerous natural disasters as well as provide critical oceanographic and atmospheric information.
