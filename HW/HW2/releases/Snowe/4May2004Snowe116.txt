SEN. SNOWE HAILS EXPANSION OF U.S. AIRWAYS SERVICE TO PORTLAND
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is praising an announcement by US Airways of expanded daily service between Portland International Jetport and the airline's hub city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Snowe has been a long and consistent advocate of the expanded service, and has previously facilitated discussions between US Airways officials, representatives of Maine's airports and other members of Maine's Congressional delegation.  
   "US Airways has a long-standing commitment of service to Maine's commercial airports, and today's announcement of new flights between Portland and Charlotte shows the airline's recognition of the great potential of Portland International Jetport," said Snowe, a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation. "This new service will expand options for Maine's air travelers with direct access from Portland to Charlotte - a gateway hub for international and domestic flights alike. Coupled with the airline's frequent connections to New York City, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, this new service will give travelers much greater flexibility in meeting their air travel needs in a way that is beneficial to both Portland and US Airways."
   The new service will include a daily non-stop, round-trip between Portland and Charlotte, N.C. on US Airways Express carrier Mesa Airlines, utilizing a 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet. Flights, which are now on sale, are expected to begin by July 11, 2004. Service on the two and a half hour flight will include a departure from Portland at 7:00 a.m., arriving in Charlotte at 9:30 a.m.; and return flights from Charlotte to Portland at 8:00 p.m., arriving at 10:20 p.m. The new service compliments US Airways' frequent flights from Portland to New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
