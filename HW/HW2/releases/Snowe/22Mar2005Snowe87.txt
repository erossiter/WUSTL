SEN. SNOWE DISAPPOINTED THAT CRITICAL 'PAY-GO' AMENDMENT TO BUDGET RESOLUTION FAILED TO GARNER SUFFICIENT SENATE SUPPORT
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) is disappointed that an amendment to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Budget Resolution by Sen.  
 Russell Feingold (D-WI) to reinstate "pay-as-you-go" budget discipline rules failed to pass the Senate today. Snowe cosponsored the amendment. 
   "With our deficit reaching an historic high, the Congress had before it in the Feingold amendment an effective way of returning to a policy that successfully contributed to bringing our budgets into balance in the 1990s. Pay-go applied to both sides of the ledger - both to revenues and spending - would have brought needed restraint back to the budget-making process," said Snowe. "This amendment would have set our nation back on the right track in confronting our deficits. I'm disappointed that it failed to garner sufficient support today and vow to explore other means of bringing greater fiscal responsibility back to the budget process." 
   The Feingold amendment would have restored pay-as-you-go budgeting rules to both spending increases and reductions in revenue that would either increase or create a deficit. The amendment failed by a vote of 50 to 50.
