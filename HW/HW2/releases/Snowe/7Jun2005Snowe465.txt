SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $2 MILLION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that Maine has received $2,366,000 in funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development office.  
   "Federal Funding plays a crucial role in providing rural communities with necessary infrastructure and support," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "As a result of this recent funding, jobs will be created and community enhancement projects will be able to move forward." 
   The federal funds were allocated as follows: 
   * $215,000 Water and Waste Disposal loan and $90,000 grant for the Town of Farmington to replace existing sewer mains on Lincoln Street that are old and undersized. The new sewer mains will meet current system flows. 
   * $23,000 Community Facility Grant to the New Portland Community Library to construct and provide related equipment/furnishings for an existing library. 
   * $2,038,000 Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan to the Eastern Maine Development Corporation to acquire real estate that will serve as corporate headquarters, housing all regional economic development and related administrative functions. This project is expected to save/create 48 jobs. 
   The USDA Rural Development project provides guaranteed loans, approved loans, and approved grants. Rural Development is committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in rural America. The loans and grants are used for community programs, which seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
