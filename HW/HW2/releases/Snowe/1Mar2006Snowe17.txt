SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE OVER $1.9 MILLION IN GRANTS FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) has awarded Maine two grants totaling $1,901,675.  
   "This funding from the Department of Health & Human Services will greatly benefit children of York County as well as facilitate important medical research," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The Head Start Project is an immensely empowering program for young children as they enter our state's school system, and this upcoming research at Jackson Laboratory will be another important step towards better understanding and addressing cancer." 
   The funding is allocated as follows: 
   * $1,168,880 to the York County Community Action Corporation in Sanford for Head Start Projects, which are federally funded comprehensive school readiness programs for children ages 0-5 and their families. The programs work to enhance children's self esteem and school readiness skills and supports parents as the primary teachers of their children. 
   * $732,795 to Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor for a cancer biology research project, entitled "Electronic Access to Mouse Tumor Data." 
   The Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The Department includes more than 300 programs, covering a wide spectrum of activities, and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.
