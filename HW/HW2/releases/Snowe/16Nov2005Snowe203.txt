SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS AMENDMENT SECURES ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY FOR CLOSED BASES
  Today the U.S. Senate passed legislation authored by Sens.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) providing for a Department of Defense investigation under the Superfund statute of the environmental condition of the property and groundwater of military installations closed by the latest Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The amendment is part of the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense Authorization bill, which the Senate passed today by a vote of 98 to 0. 
   "A thorough environmental study is a crucial first step on the path to successful redevelopment, and its cost should not be borne by communities that are already reeling from the impact of base closures," said Snowe and Collins. "This legislation helps ensure that hard-hit communities are able to focus on the long process of economic recovery." 
   This amendment also states that DoD shall consult with the Environmental Protection Agency, other federal agencies, and State, tribal and local governments.
