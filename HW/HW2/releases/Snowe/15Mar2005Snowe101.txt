ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE VISITS BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today thanked Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense Paul McHale for visiting Brunswick Naval Air Station (BNAS).  
 McHale's tour of BNAS gave him a close-up look at the facilities and systems that make BNAS vital to our national security. 
   "I am pleased that Assistant Secretary McHale recognizes the unique capabilities Brunswick Naval Air Station offers to our efforts to detect maritime threats before they reach our shores," said Snowe. "His visit can only serve to broaden awareness among Pentagon decision-makers of the importance and value of BNAS to homeland defense." 
   In addition, Snowe sent a letter last week to United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Commander Admiral Timothy J. Keating thanking him for agreeing to visit Brunswick Naval Air Station and conveying to him a report written by the NAS Brunswick Task Force, a grassroots organization composed of a wide array of leaders from the local community. Snowe also sent a letter and the report to NORTHCOM Deputy Commander Lieutenant General Joseph R. Inge. 
   The NAS Brunswick Taskforce report presents key points about the strategic location, military value, and capability of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, the only remaining fully operational military airfield in the northeastern United States.
