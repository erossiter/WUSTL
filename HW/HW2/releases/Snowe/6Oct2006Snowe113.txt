SEN. SNOWE: PURCHASE, SALE OF OLD TOWN MILL SITE CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement in response to the signing of a purchase and sale agreement with Georgia-Pacific for the company's Old Town mill site. Red Shield, a biorefinery company, will generate power at the site and to the power grid, expecting to employ 250 workers. The first two tenants of the Old Town Mill site, Hallowell International, LLC, and Lamtec Inc., are expected to eventually employ another 250 workers as well.  
   "Today's signing of the purchase and sale agreement is cause for optimism for the Old Town community and the hundreds of Mainers whose lives have been affected by this long and difficult struggle," said Senator Snowe. "The Old Town community and local officials, local and state representatives, the State's Congressional delegation, and the Governor have worked hand in hand for the past six months to meet this challenge head on, and we will continue that partnership as we work toward achieving our ultimate goal of putting Mainers to work. Today's agreement is the first step toward achieving that goal. The challenge before us now is to stay the course and capitalize on today's announcement. I will continue to support every effort to bring more jobs to the Old Town community and do all I can to advance the redevelopment of the Old Town Mill." 
   Since March, negotiations have centered around conversations with prospective buyers, including numerous phone calls between Senator Snowe and officials from both Georgia-Pacific and Koch Industries. Working with these officials, Senator Snowe's conversations focused on efforts to reach a settlement for the sale of the mill and the employment of as many Mainers as possible.
