SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS, REP. ALLEN PREPARE CASE FOR BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION
  Today, Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) and Rep.  
 Tom Allen (D-ME) met to prepare for the July 6th BRAC regional hearing in Boston. In a mock hearing, the delegation finalized their parts of the presentation that will make the case for removing the Brunswick Naval Air Station (BNAS) from the Pentagon's list of military facilities that will be realigned. 
   "With just over a week until the regional hearing in Boston, we met today to prepare the case we will make to the BRAC Commission," said Senators Snowe and Collins, and Congressman Allen. "Our arguments are strong and are based on the facts. We will demonstrate that the Navy has substantially deviated from the criteria they by law must follow in recommending the Brunswick Naval Air Station for realignment. Brunswick Naval Air Station is indispensable in both our current and future efforts to counter threats to our security at home and abroad and must remain a part of our national security arsenal." 
   BNAS is the only remaining fully capable active-duty military airfield in the northeastern United States and near its coastal cities - a region that is home to more than 48 million people, and it sits astride all major sea lanes and air routes across the North Atlantic. 
   Tomorrow, Maine's congressional delegation will meet to prepare their case for the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) in Limestone.
