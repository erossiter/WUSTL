SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES DEFENSE CONTRACT TO BATH IRON WORKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) announced today that the U.S. Navy has awarded a $488,647,719 contract to Bath Iron Works (BIW) in Bath for the construction of a DDG-51 Class AEGIS Destroyer. The vessel is expected to be completed by May 2010.  
   "I am pleased that the Defense Department has again recognized the quality that Bath Iron Works consistently provides by awarding this contract, thus ensuring a steady workload that will keep BIW competitive. In our nation's ongoing global war on terror, our military must have access to the best equipment to effectively complete their mission," said Snowe. "Shipbuilding is a critical tool in the U.S. military's arsenal and provides vital economic benefits to communities, like Bath. I support the quality work and dedicated workers at BIW and will continue to work with the Navy to ensure our shipbuilding accounts are stable." 
   Yesterday, Snowe met with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark to discuss the Navy's proposed shipbuilding plan for both the DDG and DD(X) destroyers. Snowe has long urged the Navy to deepen and stabilize their shipbuilding and conversion accounts, and expand their budget to include the DD(X) Destroyers. BIW is slated to build several ships of this class and are one of the primary shipbuilding yards to contract with the Navy. 
   "Given the unknown challenges of the future, America must be able to build major surface combatant ships which, subsequently, are dependent on the stability of our shipbuilding accounts. Critical components to this stability are the DDG-51 program, currently underway at BIW, and the DD(X) program that is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2005," said Snowe. 
   Snowe was the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee from 1998-2000.
