SEN. SNOWE SAYS NEW KAISER FOUNDATION STUDY FINDS FOURTH YEAR OF DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS; RENEWS CALL FOR SENATE TO ACT ON AHP BILL
  As the Kaiser Family Foundation today issued its 'Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey,' which finds a fourth straight year of double-digit increases in health insurance premiums, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) voiced concern that the Senate is 'blocking the good in pursuit of the perfect' by failing to give small businesses access to national Association Health Plans (AHPs).  
   "Today's release of the Kaiser Foundation study provides a sobering reminder that the nation's small businesses have endured another year with no new help to secure health insurance at reasonable costs,"said Snowe, Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. "I am deeply disappointed that the Senate still has not acted to approve AHP legislation. It appears that we are waiting for a perfect solution to the crisis of the uninsured when AHPs offer a practical means to start providing relief immediately to thousands - without increasing costs to the federal government." 
   Snowe is sponsor of the Senate's AHP bill, S.545, "The Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2003," which will allow small businesses to pool together, nationally, through trade associations, and either purchase their health insurance from a provider or self-insure in the same way that large employers and unions currently are permitted. Snowe's bill has earned bipartisan support in the Senate and is a top priority for over 150 small business associations and trade groups across the country. AHPs also were included in the final recommendations of the Senate's Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured. Senator Snowe served on the Task Force, which issued its report on May 11. 
   "Although the House has approved national AHPs twice and the President stands ready to sign them into law, the Senate continues to deny this remedy to those suffering the most from rising health insurance costs - hard working small business owners and their employees," Snowe added. 
   Among its findings, the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) survey reported that: 
   * Health insurance premiums increased 11.2 percent in 2004; the fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth and the eighth consecutive year of increases; 
   * Premiums continued to increase faster than overall inflation (2.3 percent) and wage gains (2.2 percent). Since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased by 59 percent compared with inflation growth of 9.7 percent and wage growth of 12.3 percent; 
   * Small employers (defined as 3-199 employees) providing health insurance fell from 68 percent in 2001 to 63 percent in 2004; 
   * KFF estimates that overall there are at least 5 million more jobs not providing health insurance in 2004. 
   Snowe said enactment of national AHPs could help reduce some of the pressures and burdens now contributing to rising health insurance costs and trim the ranks of the nation's 45 million uninsured individuals. In fact, studies by the Small Business Administration, the General Accounting Office, and the Congressional Budget Office have all found that AHPs operate with between 13 percent and 30 percent lower administrative costs. 
   "Clearly, most families, particularly those running their own small business or dependent on employment by a small enterprise, cannot endure yearly, double-digit increases in their health insurance indefinitely," Snowe said. "I strongly urge the Senate leadership to act on AHP legislation before the end of this session."
