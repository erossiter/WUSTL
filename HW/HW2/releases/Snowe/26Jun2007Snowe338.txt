SEN. SNOWE PRAISES PASSES OF LEGISLATION RAISING FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS FOR FIRST TIME IN GENERATION
  A compromise agreement reached in the Senate today would raise the fuel economy standard for all cars, trucks, SUVs by 10 miles per gallon by 2020. The basis for the compromise was the "10-in-10" legislation authored by Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine). Sen. Olympia Snowe has been working to increase the standards for the last 6 years. 
   "The bipartisan compromise we have reached will move use towards finally making substantive changes in CAF? standards for the first time in a generation. That both parties would come together to chart a new energy policy is a landmark moment for this institution and frankly comes not a moment too soon," Senator Snowe said. "By increasing CAFE standards, our country is not only forming a foundation of energy security, but promoting a critical element in addressing climate change on the federal level. We've had the technology to make these advancements, but now we have the political willpower to finally achieve these goals and improve the future of our environment for generations to come."  
   Major Provisions of the Bipartisan Compromise 
   * Increases fleetwide average fuel economy for all cars, SUVs, and trucks by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years - or from 25 to 35 miles per gallon by Model Year 2020. 
   * Gives automakers the time and flexibility needed to meet these new fuel economy standards. Requires the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to determine vehicle fuel economy based on their attributes, such as size or weight. 
   - Each class of vehicles - as determined by NHTSA - will be required to meet the new fuel economy standard for that particular class to achieve the fleetwide average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. This means that each automaker will no longer be required to average the fuel economy for the entire fleet of cars they produce. This creates a level playing field for all automakers. 
   - From 2011 to 2019, NHTSA must set fuel economy standards that are the maximum feasible, and ratchet these standards up, making steady progress, to meet the 2020 target of 35 miles per gallon. 
   - In 2020, the total average must meet 35 miles per gallon, unless NHTSA determines - based on clear and convincing evidence - that the achievement of the 35 miles per gallon standard would not be cost-effective for the nation. 
   - From 2021 to 2030, NHTSA must set fuel economy standards that are the maximum feasible, and ratchet these standards up at a reasonable rate. 
   * Provides manufacturers the flexibility to meet standards using credit system. The Ten-in-Ten bill gives automakers flexibility to meet the standard by establishing a fuel economy credit trading program. 
   - NHTSA would design, run, and operate this credit trading program. 
   - The credit trading program gives an automaker a financial incentive to exceed the standards and, if it does, it can: 
   - Sell credits to another automaker, and profit from having a more fuel efficient fleet; or 
   - Bank its credits for up to five years - insurance if they fall below the standard in a later year. 
   - And if an automaker cannot meet the standards in a given year, they can purchase credits, used banked credits, or borrow from projected surpluses from future years. 
   - This provision was strongly recommended by the National Academy of Sciences in 2002. 
   * Protects commercial and work truck fleets while improving fuel efficiency standards. 
   - For the first time ever, directs NHTSA to develop a structure to evaluate and establish fuel efficiency standards for commercial trucks that increase at the maximum feasible rate. 
   - Removes work trucks weighing up to 10,000 pounds, such as those used in the agricultural and construction trades, from fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars and light trucks. 
   * Other provisions: 
   - Requires the Department of Transportation to improve the fuel economy of medium and heavy duty trucks over a 20 year period, for the first time addressing this sector of concern. 
   - Automakers that sell less than 0.4 percent of the cars sold in the United States would have their fuel economy standard set by NHTSA at the maximum feasible level outside of the regular car standard. (Currently 0.4 percent of the cars sold in the U.S. each year is approximately 60,000 cars). 
   - Creates a labeling program to inform consumers of which vehicles are the most fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. 
   - Requires the federal government to purchase the most fuel efficient cars practicable. 
   - Provides funding for research and development for fuel saving technologies and grants to expand the availability of alternative fuels from moneys raised by fuel economy civil penalties. 
   - Requires NHTSA to issue a final rule by 2018 to create safety standards that address the differences between the largest and smallest vehicles.
