SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE OVER $1.8 MILLION TO MAINE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLANNING
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the state of Maine a $1,800,124 Emergency Management Performance Grant for the 2006 fiscal year.  
   "The tragic events of September 11th, 2001 and, more recently, of Hurricane Katrina have illustrated the vulnerability of the U.S. to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other potential catastrophes," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "It is crucial, therefore, that all levels of government - federal, state, and local - take measures now to ensure that emergency management plans are in place and that our responses to any such crises are swift, calculated, and effective. This funding will be instrumental in preparing the state of Maine for emergency situations, should any arise in the future." 
   The U.S. Department of Justice's Emergency Management Performance Grant Program is intended to facilitate preparedness and effective, pre-incident catastrophic planning in states and U.S. territories. These planning efforts include the development of comprehensive emergency operations plans, including annex/appendices addressing evacuation, shelter/reception, logistics and resource management, and other key plan components.
