SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO PROTECT MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) voted for a motion to instruct budget conferees to oppose any conference report that would impair access to, undermine eligibility for, or otherwise adversely impact Medicaid services for beneficiaries.  
 This legislation, offered by Sen. Max Baucus, passed by a vote of 75 to 16. 
   "The savings package the Senate approved strikes the proper balance not only in numbers, but most importantly in policy - I firmly believe that we must not create savings by limiting benefits that aid the least advantaged and most vulnerable Americans," said Snowe. "The savings in this agreement are derived not from reducing benefits, but by making needed reforms and eliminating unneeded spending. I urge the budget conferees to follow the Senate's lead and oppose any spending cuts in Medicaid that adversely affect those most in need." 
   Yesterday, Snowe sent a letter to Majority Leader Frist urging him to support the Senate's spending reduction bill, which achieves $10 billion in savings over five years in the Medicaid and Medicare programs without cutting any benefits to Americans enrolled in these vital programs. Snowe insisted on these protections as the Finance Committee crafted its spending reduction package in October. The House bill, in contrast to the Senate version, imposes new cost-sharing requirements on beneficiaries, alters eligibility policies for long term care that impact the middle-class, and provide unlimited flexibility to states to change benefits. 
   Joining Senator Snowe in sending the letter to Majority Leader Frist were Senators Gordon Smith (R-OR), Mike Dewine (R-OH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Norm Coleman (R-MN).
