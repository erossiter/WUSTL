SEN. SNOWE PLEASED OXFORD AVIATION EXPANDING INTO CORPORATE JET MARKET
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today applauded Oxford Aviation's announcement that it is expanding into the corporate jet market. The company will establish a 93,000 square foot facility at the Sanford Regional Airport, which will result in the creation of over 200 new jobs in the Sanford area. The purpose of this expansion is to create a new state of the art aircraft refurbishing and completion facility.  
   "I was thrilled to learn of Oxford Aviation's planned expansion in Sanford," said Snowe. "This new facility will provide new economic opportunities for the hardworking men and women in that area. I have long supported Sanford Regional Airport, and I will do all I can to help the airport continue to grow and thrive." 
   Oxford Aviation was established in 1988 and grew from a one-person, 8,000 square foot maintenance facility to a 45,000 square foot state of the art refinishing facility employing over 60 craftsmen and craftswomen. Over 99 percent of Oxford Aviation's revenue is derived from work coming from outside Maine.
