SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST WINNER FROM MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met today with Caitlin Katsiaficas of Portland who won the National Peace Essay Contest Scholarship for the State of Maine.  
   "It was a pleasure to meet with Caitlin and congratulate her on her recent accomplishment," said Snowe. "Her essay is an outstanding work on international peacekeeping and shows a great depth of knowledge on the subject. Given her clear passion and intelligence, I am sure she will continue along a path of great success as she continues on to college."
