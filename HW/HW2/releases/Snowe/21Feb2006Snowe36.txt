SEN. SNOWE ON INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE DECISION ON NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY INQUIRY
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement today on the committee's consideration of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program: 
   "The Intelligence Committee today rightly asserted its leadership by fulfilling its oversight responsibility over the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program. As a co-equal branch of government, I believe it is imperative that the Congress - specifically the Senate Intelligence Committee - fully understands how this program functions to enable us to draft a legislative solution that includes sufficient congressional and judicial review over a program that currently has none. Therefore, the Administration must demonstrate its commitment to avoiding a constitutional deadlock by engaging in good-faith negotiations before March 7 when the Intelligence Committee reconvenes. 
   "Clearly our nation needs the best and most effective tools to combat a dangerous terrorist threat - and I believe this NSA program is essential to that goal. In order to ensure its success, however, we have to ensure that the American people have the confidence that their government is working to protect their individual liberties through sufficient checks and balances.".
