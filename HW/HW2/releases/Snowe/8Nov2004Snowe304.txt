   "Jock and I extend our deepest sympathies to Governor Reed on the loss of his exceptional wife, Cora, who we had the privilege of knowing for more than 30 years. Cora was a remarkable woman who earned a place in the hearts of Mainers and ensured - through her gracious hospitality and warmth - that the Blaine House truly belonged to all Maine people. She left a lasting legacy at the governor's residence and in the state she loved, and during this most difficult of times our hearts and prayers go out to Governor Reed and the entire family."
