SEN. SNOWE DECRIES FILIBUSTER THREAT AGAINST ALITO
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today decried threats from prominent Senate Democrats to mount a filibuster preventing a vote on the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court.  
 Snowe issued the following statement: 
   "While I have not made any decision yet on an up-or-down vote on the nominee itself, I find it regrettable that there are those who are trying to resurrect a filibuster even as there is clearly nothing in the record that constitutes extraordinary circumstances. This unfortunate effort only serves to further politicize and polarize this process when this should be a time of careful deliberation based on the facts of the nominee's record and testimony."
