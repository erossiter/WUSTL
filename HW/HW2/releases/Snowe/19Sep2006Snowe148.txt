SEN.SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON DETAINEE LEGISLATION PASSED BY SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement on legislation passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday by a vote of 15 to 9.  
   "I strongly support the legislation passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday. It is essential we demonstrate that our Nation will maintain our longstanding obligations as a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. For the safety of our own troops, we must hold our armed forces and intelligence officers to the same standard we expect the international community to hold theirs. Furthermore, the men and women of the Central Intelligence Agency are doing all they can to keep America safe, and we must ensure they have both the tools and the clear guidelines they need to effectively do their jobs. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I believe the legislation offered by Senators Warner, McCain, and Graham is the best path to achieving our goals of protecting our brave men and women is harms way, while protecting our nation against terrorism."
