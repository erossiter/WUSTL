SEN. SNOWE PRAISES NATIONWIDE ISSUANCE OF HARRIET BEECHER STOWE STAMP
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe today praised the first day issuance of the U.S. Postal Service's new Harriet Beecher Stowe stamp, as it was celebrated at Bowdoin College in Brunswick this morning. The new 75-cent Harriet Beecher Stowe stamp is the ninth in the USPS's Distinguished Americans series. A Regional Representative from Sen. Olympia Snowe's District office attended the event.  
   "The U.S. Postal Service is to be commended for choosing Harriet Beecher Stowe as an honoree in its Distinguished Americans series," said Senator Snowe. "This is a fitting tribute to an American icon whose universal appeal as a writer, humanitarian, and abolitionist was recognized both in this country, across the Atlantic Ocean, and eventually around the world. The prominent legacy she has left in Brunswick, where she lived and wrote the majority of her timeless work Uncle Tom's Cabin, is indelibly written into Maine's rich history. I am so pleased that our state was home to such remarkable figure and landmark work of literature." 
   Earlier this year, Senator Snowe sponsored legislation, S.662, which would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a feasibility study to determine the suitability of the Harriet Beecher Stowe House for inclusion as part of the National Park Service.
