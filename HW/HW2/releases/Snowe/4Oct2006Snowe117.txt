SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $670,000 IN FUNDING TO MAINE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded a five year grant for $670,000 to the Maine Department of Education in Augusta. Under the State Personnel Development Grants Program, the funding will be used to improve the professional development of administrators, teachers, and paraprofessionals who work with students with disabilities.  
   "The U.S. Dept. of Education funding will greatly improve the skills of those individuals who work with disabled students," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "It is important that all students in our state, including those with disabilities, have access to the best education possible." 
   The purpose of the State Personnel Development Grants Program is to assist State Education Agencies in reforming and improving their systems for personnel preparation and professional development in early intervention, educational, and transition services in order to improve the results for children with disabilities.
