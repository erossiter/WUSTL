SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $53 MILLION TO BATH IRON WORKS FOR DD(X) DESTROYER
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today announced that the Department of Defense has released $53 million to Maine's Bath Iron Works (BIW) to begin detailed design work for the second ship of the DD(X) class.  
 The funding was approved as part of the fiscal year 2005 Defense Authorization bill. 
   "Bath Iron Works is one of the nation's foremost shipbuilders. This $84.4 million to BIW will put the second DD(X) on its way to becoming an essential part of our naval arsenal," said Snowe. "During these times of increased terrorism and international instability, it is vital that we have a well-equipped navy that can make its presence felt around the globe. The DD(X) is at the forefront on transforming our Navy and deserves our continued support." 
   This $53 million in funding comes out of a total of $84.4 million for this second DD(X) destroyer. The remaining funding will be released at a later date.
