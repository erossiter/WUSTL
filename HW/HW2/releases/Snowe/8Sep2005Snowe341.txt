SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES LEWISTON FOR BEING CHOSEN AS 2005 'MOST PATRIOTIC CITY'
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today congratulated Lewiston for being chosen as the 2005 'Most Patriotic City' by the Paralyzed Veterans of America.  
   "I would like to extend my deepest congratulations to the City of Lewiston, Mayor Guay, and the city council on this wonderful and well deserved recognition," said Snowe. "Having grown up in Lewiston, I know firsthand what a wonderful and truly American city it is- there is no place more worthy of the 'Most Patriotic City' award." 
   Lewiston was nominated for this award by Lewiston resident Denis Beaulieu. The Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) organization, the group that decided to give Lewiston this award, was particularly impressed by the city's hosting of the "Letters from War" military reception, as well as the yellow ribbons hung in Veterans Park as part of Operation Community Support. 
   There will be a plaque presentation to the Mayor on Monday, September 19th in Lewiston to commemorate the fact that the city was chosen as the 2005 'Most Patriotic City'. It will be presented by Ken Medeiros, President of the New England Paralyzed Veterans of America organization. Community members, veterans and those currently serving- as well as their families- are welcome to attend. The presentation will take place at 10:30 am in the Council Chambers.
