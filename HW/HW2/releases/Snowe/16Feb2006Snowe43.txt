SEN. SNOWE BILL DOUBLES EXPENSING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today introduced legislation that doubles the dollar amount of new investments a small business can expense and makes that change a permanent part of Federal tax law.  
   "We must provide small businesses with critical incentives like expensing so they continue to invest in new technology, expand their operations, and most important, create jobs. Small businesses drive our nation's economic growth, and this bill strengthens their ability to lead the way," said Senator Snowe. "As the Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I'm responding to small business owners in my home state of Maine and across the nation who have demonstrated that this investment incentive works and have asked Congress to expand it and make it permanent." 
   The Internal Revenue Code (Section 179) allows small businesses to expense or fully deduct from taxable income a limited amount of new business equipment costs in a year. This tax benefit is phased out dollar for dollar for any investment above $400,000. Under current law, small businesses can expense up to $100,000 through 2007, indexed for inflation. Starting in 2008, however, small businesses will only be able to expense up to $25,000 in new investment per year. Additionally, the $400,000 threshold limit for the phase-out will be reduced to $200,000, which will severely limit the number of small businesses that can qualify. 
   This bill: 
   * Doubles the dollar amount of new investment a small business can expense from $100,000 to $200,000 beginning January 1, 2007;
   * Increases the amount of total investment a small business may make in a year and qualify for the expensing provision from the current law level of $400,000 to $800,000;
   * Expands the definition of qualifying property to permanently include off-the-shelf computer software; 
   * Makes permanent the new, higher expensing limit, and indexing it annually for inflation.
   Qualifying businesses will be able to write off more of the equipment purchases today, instead of waiting five, seven or more years to recover their costs through depreciation. That represents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time small businesses would otherwise have to spend complying with complex and confusing depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment will contribute to continued productivity growth in the business community, which economic experts have repeatedly stressed is essential to the long-term vitality of our economy. 
   As a result of this bill, more businesses will qualify for this benefit because the phase-out limit will be increased to $800,000 in new assets purchases. At the same time, small business capital investment will be pumping more money into the economy. Accordingly, this is a win-win for small business and the economy as a whole.
