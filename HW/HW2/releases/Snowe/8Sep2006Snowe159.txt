SEN. SNOWE SECURES BILLIONS IN FUNDING FOR MAINE IN DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced today that she has successfully secured billions of dollars in funding for Maine's defense industry in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Defense Appropriations bill that passed the Senate today. Snowe successfully fought to fully fund the construction of the Navy's next generation destroyer, the DDG- 1000, which will be built at Maine 's Bath Iron Works. 
   "The Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the Senate today is a reflection of the key role the state of Maine plays in ensuring the security of the United States . It is an affirmation that Maine built is best built and that our entrepreneurial workforce will continue to lead the way in innovation and know-how," Snowe said. "I am especially pleased that this bill fully funds the DDG- 1000 Destroyer program. I pledge to fight to ensure that the Senate's position - and that of the Navy itself - to fund the construction of two lead ships in 2007 is maintained when this bill is reconciled with the version passed by the House of Representatives."
