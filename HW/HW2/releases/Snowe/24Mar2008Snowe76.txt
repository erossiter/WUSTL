SEN. SNOWE, FORMER GOV. MCKERNAN ISSUE STATEMENT ON PASSING OF VETERAN MAINE JOURNALIST DYK
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe and former Governor John R. McKernan, Jr. released the following statement today upon learning of the passing of long-time Maine TV and radio reporter Robert "Bob" Dyk: 
   "We were deeply saddened to learn of Bob's passing after his brave fight against cancer. We were fortunate to have known Bob for many years as a mainstay of Maine television and radio, where he only enhanced his longstanding reputation as a true and consummate professional. Bob was invariably a fair-minded, straightforward journalist who brought to bear his depth and breadth of experience from throughout the world for the benefit of Maine people. On a personal note, we always enjoyed frequently running into Bob and his wife, Trish, at the grocery store in Falmouth - he always had a twinkle in his eye that reflected his wonderful sense of humor, and that remained true the last time we saw him.
   "Bob's impact on Maine will continue to reverberate as we all share in the sorrow of his loss - and our thoughts and prayers are with his beloved Trish; his daughter, Gaby; his son, Tom; and Bob's entire family at this most difficult of times."
