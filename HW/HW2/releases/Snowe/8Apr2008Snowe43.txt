SEN. SNOWE HIGHLIGHTS NEED TO COMBAT IDENTITY THEFT, FRAUD
  At today's hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation reviewing the performance of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) highlighted the need to strengthen efforts to combat identify theft and online fraud. In 2006, the Federal Trade Commission received more than 240,000 complaints of identity theft and reported that identity thefts related to tax refund fraud increased 396 percent from 2002 to 2006. 
   "In addition to greater enforcement efforts in pursing these online fraud scams and identity thefts, the FTC must also ensure that companies are employing adequate resources and practices to safeguard its customers and employees' sensitive personal and financial information," Senator Snowe said. "There have been several data security breach cases that have raised serious concern, including last month's Hannaford Brothers security breach, which potentially exposed 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers to identity thieves."
   More than 3.5 million Americans lost more than $3 billion dollars to phishing schemes and online identity theft over a 12 month period ending in August 2007-this is a 57 percent increase over the previous year. It's estimated that approximately 59 million phishing e-mails are sent a day and even the FTC reported that, in May 2007, phishing emails accounted for 79 percent of malicious email traffic.
   Earlier this year, Senator Snowe has partnered with Senators Nelson and Stevens to introduce the Anti-Phishing Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which would provide more explicit tools for enforcement agencies to pursue phishing scams and stiffer penalties to deter phishers from engaging in these fraud activities.
