SEN. SNOWE PRAISES SENATE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO RAISE FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today applauded the Senate Commerce Committee's approval of landmark legislation that if passed, would increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the entire automobile fleet by 10 miles per gallon over the next 10 years. Sen. Olympia Snowe joined Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-HI) and thirteen other Senators in introducing the "10 in 10" bill earlier this year. As a long-time advocate of raising CAFE standards, Sen. Olympia Snowe believes this legislation is vital to helping our country reduce its dependence on foreign oil. The Ten-in-Ten legislation will reduce oil imports by 2.1 million barrels each day - the exact amount that we currently import daily from the Persian Gulf.  
   "It has been a privilege to work with Senator Feinstein on measures to increase CAFE standards since 2001, and today's decision by the Commerce Committee paves the way for all Americans to adopt significantly higher fuel efficiency standards," said Senator Snowe. "Our fuel economy standards have been dormant for far too long. By increasing CAFE standards, our country is not only forming a foundation of energy security, but promoting a healthier environment on the federal level. It is no longer a question of whether or not our nation has the technology to achieve these goals, but whether as Americans, we have the willpower to collectively improve the future of our environment for generations to come." 
   The Snowe-Fienstien legislation would raise average fuel economy standards for all passenger vehicles and light trucks from today's combined average of 25 to 35 miles per gallon by Model Year 2020. Chairman Inouye and ranking member Ted Stevens (R-AK) amended the bill last week to require that the fuel economies of medium and heavy duty trucks also improve by 4 percent per year. 
   As amended, the bill would: 
   * Mandate a 35 mpg fuel economy standard for all automobiles less than 10,000 pounds. This includes all SUVs, light trucks, and passenger vehicles under the current definition. 
   * Include increases in automobile fuel efficiency of 4 percent from MY2021 to MY 2030. 
   * Expand CAFE to include fuel efficiency requirements for trucks larger than 10,000 for the first time and require an annual 4% increase in fuel efficiency. 
   * Authorize the Secretary to establish a CAFE credit trading program to allow manufacturers whose automobiles exceed CAFE standards to earn credits to be sold to manufacturers whose automobiles fail to achieve such standards. 
   * Establish a federal price gouging law that prohibits selling gasoline and petroleum distillates at an unconscionable level during a national emergency.
