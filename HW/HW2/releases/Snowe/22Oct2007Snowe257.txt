SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE FAILURE TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT'S SCHIP VETO
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement on the failure by the House of Representatives to override the President's veto of legislation to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Snowe has supported the bipartisan effort to expand the program by $35 billion to provide health insurance for an additional four million American children and an additional 11,000 kids in Maine.  
   "Today's failure by the House of Representatives to override the President's veto is deeply troubling. Millions of families across America, including those in my home state of Maine, desperately rely on this vital program to provide critical health care services for their children," said Senator Snowe. "Those families and this country cannot afford to wait while our children go without coverage - the current status quo is unacceptable. While Congress and the President debate philosophical differences the following stark realities still remain: children will continue to go without coverage, parents will finance care on credit cards, and families will fall further into debt. This nation can and must do better - we cannot keep the children waiting."
