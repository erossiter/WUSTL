SEN. SNOWE COMMITTED TO LEGISLATIVE DUTY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) was present for every Senate vote in 2004, according to a vote study by the Washington, D.C. weekly magazine Congressional Quarterly. 
   "The people of Maine sent me to Washington, D.C. to represent their views and work in their interest," said Snowe. "It is my honor to serve them and my duty to be present when the Senate votes." 
   18 senators and 11 House members were the only lawmakers who cast "yea" or "nay" votes on every roll call ballot conducted in 2004.
