SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $336 MILLION FOR DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION OF NAVY DESTROYER
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that the Department of the Navy has awarded Bath Iron Works (BIW) in Bath, Maine a contract valued at more than $336 million for the design and construction of the next generation DDG Destroyer.  
   "Today's announcement marks a momentous point in the DDG program. With the funds awarded today, the men and women of Bath Iron Works can begin doing what they do best, build the highest quality ships in the world," Snowe said. "After many years of moving toward the design and construction of the DDG destroyers, this is a good day for not only Bath Iron Works and the state of Maine, but for the United States Navy and the American people. These ships will provide the backbone of American naval supremacy for generations to come."
   The total value of the cost-plus-award-fee contract is $336,261.007. The DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer, formerly known as the DD(X) Destroyer Program, will provide affordable and credible independent forward presence and deterrence as well as advanced land attack capability for the United States Navy.
