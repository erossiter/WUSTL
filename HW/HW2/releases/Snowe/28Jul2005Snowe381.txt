ADMIRAL NATHMAN AFFIRMS BRUNSWICK'S VALUE TO SEN. SNOWE
  During a phone conversation with Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Admiral John B. Nathman, U.S. Fleet Forces Command Commander, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, told Snowe that the Fleet Forces Command (CFFC) supports Brunswick Naval Air Station's homeland defense role.  
   "I am pleased that Admiral Nathman and I share the same conviction - Brunswick Naval Air Station is an essential component of our homeland security efforts," said Snowe. "I appreciate his taking the time to personally assure me that Fleet Forces Command recognizes Brunswick's homeland security value today and is committed to maintaining it in the future." 
   Admiral Nathman praised Mane's congressional delegation for its thoughtful presentation at the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Regional hearing in Boston earlier this month.
