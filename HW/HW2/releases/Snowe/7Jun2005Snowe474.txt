SEN. SNOWE MAKES FINAL REQUEST FOR BRAC INFORMATION
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England making a final plea for the timely declassification and release of information and data the Department of Defense used to arrive at its recommendations to close Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center in Limestone, and to realign Brunswick Naval Air Station.  
 Snowe has drafted a preliminary injunction to file in federal court in the event the full amount of information required has not been properly disclosed. 
   "The Department of Defense has had two years, knowing the statutory deadline for release of information, to determine how the relevant information would be disseminated," said Snowe. "It is unacceptable and inconceivable that we are now 16 days past the deadline. The sand has run through the hourglass - it is long past time this data be made available, and I will take whatever steps necessary to ensure its release." 
   In a letter dated June 1, 2005, Acting Deputy Secretary Gordon England wrote that DoD was undergoing a process and an effort that "should allow the Department to declassify the vast majority of the data by the end of this week." DoD has not met that June 3rd deadline.
