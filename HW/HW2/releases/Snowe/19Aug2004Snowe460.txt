SEN. SNOWE URGES SECRETARY OF STATE TO INVESTIGATE MASSACRE IN BURUNDI
  After hearing from members of the African community in Maine, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today said she concerned by the recent killing of Congolese refugees at the Gatumba refugee camp in Burundi and asked Secretary of State Colin Powell to investigate and find a peaceful solution to this tragedy.
   "I write to express my deep concerns over the current situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa. I have recently heard from a number of my constituents from the African community in the Portland area of Maine who have friends and family members living in this troubled region," Snowe wrote in a letter to the Secretary of State.
   Tension in the border area between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi remain high after the recent killing of approximately 150 Congolese refugees at the Gatumba refugee camp in Burundi on August 13, 2004 at the hands of armed groups including the National Liberation Front of the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People.
   "I urge you to work closely with the United Nations, the Africa Union and leaders of each of the nations in the region to investigate this recent massacre and to find a peaceful solution to this horrible tragedy," concluded the letter.
