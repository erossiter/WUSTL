SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM NATIONAL YOUNG LEADERS CONFERENCE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with high school students participating in the National Young Leaders Conference in her Washington, DC office. Samantha Avery of Lebanon and Michelle Munger of Cape Elizabeth took part in the six-day program.  
   "The NYLC program offers students the unique opportunity to study politics on the national level," said Senator Snowe. "I enjoyed meeting with Samantha and Michelle during their stay in Washington and I hope they benefit from this truly inspirational program." 
   The National Young Leaders Conference is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council. Students spend the week meeting with members of Congress, participating in interactive activities, and debating current issues. The program is designed to educate and inspire future leaders who desire an opportunity to learn outside of the classroom.
