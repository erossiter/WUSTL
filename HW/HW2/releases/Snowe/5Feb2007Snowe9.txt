NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE REINFORCES NEED FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on Monday, Feb. 5, released the following statement in response to the Director of National Intelligence's Estimate of the "Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead" released this morning:  
   "This morning's release of the DNI's latest estimate of the conditions in Iraq further reinforces that there is no military solution in Iraq and that only a political and diplomatic solution is possible," Snowe said. "With the 'current winner-take-all attitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene' the prospects for reconciliation are bleak. According to the NIE, the Shia 'mistrust U.S. efforts to reconcile Iraqi sects' and the Sunnis 'believe the central government is illegitimate and incompetent.' How will 21,500 additional U.S. men and women resolve these differences? 
   "Though I oppose a troop surge in Iraq, I am a cosponsor of a resolution before the Senate that advocates increasing our counterterrorism efforts, maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, promoting regional stability, and continuing to train the Iraqi Security Forces, all without withdrawing precipitously. As Iraq becomes increasingly fractured and our forces engaged in urban combat, it's time to take our forces off the front lines and put those who have the most to gain in the lead."
