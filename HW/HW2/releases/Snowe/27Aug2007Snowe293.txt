SEN. SNOWE QUESTIONS IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S DESIRE TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement today as the Iraqi Parliament adjourned for the summer, leaving behind a failure to achieve any of the political benchmarks toward national reconciliation before September:  
    "As they adjourn for the summer and leave behind our brave American soldiers as they fight to provide breathing space for Iraqis to achieve national reconciliation, one must question the Iraqi government's desire and commitment to achieving that goal. Postponing this month-long vacation and working to make substantial progress on the political benchmarks in advance of the reports Congress will receive in September by the independent Government Accountability Office and Gen. David Petraeus would have signaled to the American people that the Iraqis were serious about solidifying their national interests rather then their own sectarian interests. It's time to prepare for the inevitable transition of our troops in Iraq to a new tailored mission focused on counterterrorism operations, protecting U.S. and Coalition personnel and assets in the field, and training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces. The American people have made profound personal and financial sacrifice to help the Iraqi government achieve national reconciliation. Regrettably, the Iraqi leadership has failed to make any measurable progress on any of the political objectives they themselves agreed to."
