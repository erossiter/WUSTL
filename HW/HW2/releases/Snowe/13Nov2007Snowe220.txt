CONGRESS APPROVES FINAL VETERANS SPENDING, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL THAT INCLUDES FUNDS BENEFITING PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD
  U.S. Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH), Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME) and John Sununu (R-NH) released the following joint statement today after the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs spending bill that includes $9.7 million for a Consolidated Emergency Control Center at the Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and $1.2 million for the planning and design of a Dry-dock Waterfront Facility at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  
   "These provisions are critical to the continued success of the high-caliber operations conducted at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The $9.7 million set aside for a Consolidated Emergency Control Center makes possible a new state-of-the-art facility to complement the shipyard's safety record by greatly increasing the emergency operations team's ability to direct and control the collection and evaluation of information, mobilize emergency responders, and to notify off-site organizations in the event of an emergency. 
   "In addition, the $1.2 million designated for the planning and design of the Dry-Dock No. 3 Waterfront Facility will begin the renovation of facilities necessary for future overhaul work on VIRGINIA-class attack submarines. These renovations will enable the Shipyard's "gold-standard" workforce to bring the efficiencies and innovations that has won them nationwide acclaim to bear on the VIRGINIA program so our submarine force will continue to be unmatched. 
   "We continue to fight for additional military construction funds for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard so that the best shipyard workers in the world have the facilities and equipment to match their talent, skills and ingenuity."
