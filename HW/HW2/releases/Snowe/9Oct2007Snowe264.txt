SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH 'MAINE'S OUTSTANDING OLDER WORKER'
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met with "Maine's outstanding older worker for 2007," Patricia Myshrall of Brunswick yesterday in her Washington, D.C. office. Patricia Myshrall was in Washington Wednesday to receive the award as a part of the Experience Works Prime Time Awards Program. Patricia Myshrall has worked as a library assistant at Bowdoin College for nearly forty years.  
   "I enjoyed meeting Patricia Myshrall during her trip to Washington and I congratulate her on this truly remarkable award," said Senator Snowe. "Pat is a committed and dedicated employee of the Bowdoin College library and her years of service have made the college campus a better and brighter place." 
   Launched in 1998, Experience Works Prime Time Awards Program salutes America's senior workforce by identifying winners in three categories: Outstanding Older Workers, Outstanding Employers of Older Workers and America's Oldest Worker.
