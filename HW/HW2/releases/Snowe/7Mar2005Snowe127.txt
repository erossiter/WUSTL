SEN. SNOWE PLEDGES TO CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR MAINE'S FISHERMEN
  At this year's Maine Fishermen's Forum, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, sent a clear and resounding message: that she will continue to fight for Maine's fishing industry in Washington. The Senator attended the Fishermen's Forum today and delivered a letter of support to all participants.  
   "Whether you fish for groundfish, lobsters, scallops, herring, tuna, or any other species regulated under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, you know first-hand how this Act has impacted your fishery and your livelihood. As Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, and as your voice in the U.S. Senate, I seek your advice and input on how this Act should be amended as we debate it in Congress," Snowe wrote in her letter. 
   "As we have seen in the case of Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, our Federal fisheries law has not always been implemented with the fairness and flexibility that Congress intended. Clearly, some provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996, the last major amendment to this law, have led to significant - and often unnecessary - economic hardships for New England's fishermen, and we must work together to rectify these shortcomings. To ensure the Act better sustains fish and fishermen, I pledge to work with you, the Maine Fisherman," the letter continued. 
   Snowe would like to press forward on the following issues of concern and specifically asked for fishermen's input and thoughts: 
   * Repeal the arbitrary 10-year rebuilding timeline requirement and instead set fishing rates that produce the "maximum sustainable yield." The timeline has required scientists to set speculative biomass targets that lead to drastic - yet often biologically unnecessary - reductions in fishing. By fishing at rates up to the maximum sustainable yield, or "F-msy," overfishing would not occur and stocks would rebuild at a natural rate to a state of ecosystem balance. 
   * Sharpen the focus of Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) protections to those parts of EFH that are "Habitat Areas of Particular Concern." Congress originally meant for EFH to apply to areas that were especially important or highly vulnerable, but the term has been applied too broadly. This change would focus habitat conservation work on key areas, making management more efficient and effective. 
   * Create a national cooperative research and management program. When fishermen team up with scientists to use fishing vessels as research platforms, we get better science and new fishing opportunities. Congress should formally authorize funding for this program and make sure that participating fishermen would not be penalized by losing catch history or days-at-sea. 
   * Enhance the Council's ability to better achieve the Act's objectives for fisheries sustainability. Congress should seek authorizations for fishing quota national standards, require better social and ecological impact assessments, improve scientific peer review and data management, and streamline regulatory requirements and public meeting notices. 
   "Now is the time for us to work together and chart a new course for the future of Maine's fisheries. I welcome your input on these and other amendments, because you are the experts and your voices must be heard. Please help me and my staff achieve the best possible changes to the Magnuson-Stevens Act in the 109th Congress," the letter concluded.
