MAINE DELEGATION STATEMENT ON NAVY'S DECISION TO DEACTIVATE VP-92 RESERVE P-3 SQUADRON AT BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins and Reps. Tom Allen and Michael Michaud released the following statement on Tuesday, Feb. 6, regarding the U.S. Navy's decision to deactivate VP-92 reserve squadron at the Brunswick Naval Air Station:  
   "The Navy has informed us of its truly regrettable decision to deactivate VP-92, a reserve P-3 squadron stationed at Brunswick Naval Air Station, ten months early in the fall of 2007. Ultimately, the squadron's premature exit from Brunswick is a tremendous disappointment given the significant impact the closure of the base is already having on the entire Brunswick community. Our primary concern is that the personnel assigned to VP-92 be given every opportunity to continue their careers in the Navy Reserve. We believe the Navy must take every available step to assist the community, the workers and their families during this difficult transition. We have asked the Navy for a detailed plan to ensure that the deactivation or relocation of any of the squadrons at BNAS do not compromise maritime patrol requirements and our national security."
