SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR GREATER PROTECTION FOR U.S. TROOPS SERVING IN HARMS WAY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) called Senate passage of legislation she cosponsored to increase funding for armored humvees essential to protecting American troops serving in harms way in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
   "This legislation is a victory for our troops and their families. I have long been concerned by the insufficient amount of armor for our soldiers serving in harms way. I believe they must have absolutely every resource to do the job that they have so valiantly volunteered for," said Snowe. "Last fall, I urged the Secretary of Defense to fully mobilize our nation's industrial base to provide our fighting men and women with the armor they need to protect themselves. Passage today of this legislation will give our armed forces the tools they deserve." 
   The legislation, offered by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner (R-VA), increases funding for procurement and armoring of Humvees by $105 million for the Army and $340.4 million for the Marine Corps. It would also require the Secretary of Defense certify to the congressional defense committees that the Army and Marine Corps have a validated requirement for procurement of the vehicles based on a statement of urgent needs from a commander of a combatant command. It further requires the Secretary of Defense to submit not later than 15 days after an allocation of such funds a report to the congressional defense committees a report describing allocation of funds. 
   In the last year, the Army has reportedly revised its estimate of the Army's overall "up-armored" HMMWV requirement from 1,000 to 11,000. As of March 2005, the army has established a requirement for 8,500 "up-armored" vehicles in Iraq, up from the May 2003 requirement of 235 vehicles.
