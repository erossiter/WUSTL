SEN. SNOWE RENEWS CALL FOR CONGRESS TO TAKE ACTION TO PASS 'BIPARTISAN, TIMELY AND TARGETED' ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing held this morning, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) repeated her call for Congress to expeditiously enact economic stimulus legislation to encourage consumer spending and business investment. Senator Snowe said Congress should provide tax rebates to individuals and incentives to encourage job-creating business investment. 
   "It's encouraging that the Senate Finance Committee began an immediate discussion on ways to address the most urgent, domestic issue facing our nation today - strengthening the economy," said Senator Snowe. "Many of my constituents in Maine require critical assistance in these increasingly challenging economic times. The historic and exorbitant costs of gasoline and heating fuel have only exacerbated the problem. I intend to work with my colleagues to pass a bipartisan, timely and targeted stimulus package."
   As she has in the past, Senator Snowe called for stimulus legislation to include a measure she has introduced with Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) that would enable more hard-working, low-income families receive the refundable child credit. The provision would reduce the income threshold for the refundable credit to $10,000 and de-indexing it from inflation just as it originally passed the Senate in May of 2001.
   "The consequences of inaction are serious for low-income Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, and our proposal will ensure that those qualifying families who benefit the most from are the one's receiving it," said Senator Snowe.
   In addition, in her capacity as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Snowe has also called on Congress to enact small business incentives to boost investment and job creation. Specifically, Senator Snowe said Congress should:
   * Increase the amount of investment small businesses are able to write off immediately each year to $200,000 freeing up capital to be used for creating jobs;
   * Lengthen the carryback period of net operating losses to five years to provide small businesses a longer period over which to offset current losses and obtain immediate tax refunds; and
   * Extend the R&D Tax Credit, which expired at the end of 2007, to spur innovation in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing and health care, so that the economy will have cutting-edge technology to lead a recovery.
   "Any effective economic stimulus package must address the unique requirements of America's small businesses," said Senator Snowe. Our nation's small businesses account for 99.7 percent of all employer firms, employ nearly half of the private-sector workforce, and have created three quarters of net new jobs annually throughout the past decade. Small businesses have been critical to our past economic growth and it is clear that they will play an integral role in any recovery."
