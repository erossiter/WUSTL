SEN. SNOWE'S LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM PASSES SENATE
  Legislation introduced by U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) that establishes a national system for gathering real-time ocean data, based upon the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observation System (GoMOOS), passed the Senate today. The Coastal and Ocean Observing System Act of 2007 would augment and integrate a loosely-knit network of regional observation systems currently deployed in coastal zones across the country, by establishing an interagency framework to manage them through a single office under the purview of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other related Federal agencies. 
   "An integrated ocean observing system will provide additional, more accurate advance warning of ocean-based threats from tsunamis and hurricanes to harmful algal blooms and pollution, enhance weather and climate forecasting," said Snowe. "I am pleased that the Senate unanimously approved this critical legislation for our coastal communities, and to increase efficiency of operations for maritime and shoreside industries alike and provide significant economic benefits for the Nation as a whole."  
   This bi-partisan, science-based bill would authorize, establish, and maintain an integrated network of ocean observing and communication systems around our nation's coastlines. This system would collect instantaneous data and information on ocean conditions such as temperature, wave height, wind speed, currents, dissolved oxygen, salinity, contaminants, acidity, and other variables - and convert it into a form of information that could be readily utilized by interested parties. 
   "As a representative of a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I want to ensure that the citizens of Maine, and all coastal states, have the tools they need to monitor and assess what is happening off their shores," said Snowe. "Maine's coastal communities always have been integral to the economic well-being of our state, and are highly dependent on the fisheries resources, coastal habitats, tourist destinations, safe harbors, and other essential services connected to the sea. Nationwide, over fifty percent of our citizens live in coastal areas. By investing in better understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological components of our oceans, we are investing in our future." 
   Among its provisions, the bill would: - Develop and maintain an integrated marine data monitoring and management system that provides for comprehensive and continuous ocean and coastal observations; - Facilitate timely warnings to coastal communities about potentially hazardous ocean conditions detected by coastal and offshore buoys, satellites, and other ocean observing instruments; - Coordinate state agencies= regional ocean observing systems' efforts regarding data measurement requirements, standards and protocols for quality control, and data management and planning activities; - Establish a research and development program to study the relationship between ocean conditions and human activities, develop new observation technologies, enhance security at US ports, and improve public education. 
   Snowe gave the following tangible examples of how this nationwide integrated ocean observing system will benefit Maine and the nation: - 
   * Natural Distasters B Ocean observing system would detect hazardous ocean conditions -- such as harmful algal blooms, oil spills, tsunamis, and hurricanes -- and enable marine scientists to predict, track, and warn coastal communities about their potential impacts. 
   * Weather and Climate forecasting B Ocean observing system would provide data to increase accuracy of predictions from weather and climate models, allowing industries such as electricity generation to operate more efficiently. 
   * Port Security B Ocean observing system will help ports "push out their borders." By detecting the presence of harmful chemicals and tracking their paths, it will be able to ascertain biological threats and it will be able to track vessels and determine any possible suspicious activity. 
   * Fisheries Science B Ocean observing system would provide the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with critical nation-wide environmental data to improve fisheries modeling and management, coastal planning and harmful algal blooms management and mitigation. 
   * Coast Guard B Ocean observing system would provide the Coast Guard with valuable real-time information on sea-state conditions to determine when and how to conduct missions, including search-and-rescue activities.
