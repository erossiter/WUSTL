SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION TO DISCUSS CRITICAL ISSUES FACING STATE, LOCALITIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met today with representatives of the Maine Municipal Association to discuss critical issues facing communities throughout Maine.  
 Snowe listened to the concerns of the representatives and discussed ways the federal government can aid state and local communities. 
   "I am pleased that members of the Maine Municipal Association came to Washington, D.C. to speak with me about such critical subjects as transportation, education, housing, and water quality," said Snowe. "The issues that they deal with on a daily basis are of critical importance to all communities in the State of Maine. I look forward to working with them and receiving their continued input as the 109th Congress progresses." 
   In their 2005 Federal Issues Paper, the Maine Municipal Association noted, "The array of issues facing the Congress is daunting. We recognize the significant pressures on discretionary programs important to municipalities stemming from the Administration's proposed permanent tax cuts and Social Security reform, as well as the continued war in Iraq and the President's promise to cute the federal deficit in half. At the same time, we believe it is important to recognize the value of successful programs such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and the critical role of federal funding for transportation and homeland security, and the direct impact on local property taxpayers for under-funding federal commitments for education mandates." 
   The Maine Municipal Association is a voluntary membership organization of the State's cities, towns, plantations and organized townships to provide a unified voice for Maine's municipalities to promote and strengthen local government.
