SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN GIRLS AND BOYS NATION
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with Maine students participating in the American Legion Boys Nation and the American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation in her Washington, DC office. Snowe met with Boys Nation Senators Greg Jensen of Falmouth, Justin Rouse of Eliot and Girls Nation Senators Katherine Rhames of Biddeford and Coral Sandler of South Portland. Sandler was named "First Outstanding Girl" at Dirigo Girls State in Bangor earlier this summer.  
   "I enjoyed meeting with Greg, Justin, Katherine, and Coral during their trip to the nation's capital," said Senator Snowe. "These young leaders are true role models and should be proud of their outstanding accomplishments in the Girls and Boys State programs. It is tremendous to see students taking an active interest in government and politics." 
   Boys State and Girls State are summer leadership and citizenship programs sponsored by The American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary for high school students between their junior and senior years. Ever year, two delegates from each state are chosen to participate in Boys and Girls Nation in Washington, DC.
