SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE LETTER CARRIER WHO WAS NAMED 'NATIONAL HERO OF THE YEAR'
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met today with Maine letter carrier David Heald of Alfred who was named National 'Hero of the Year' by the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC). Mr.  
 Heald used his Navy life-saving skills to prevent a motorcyclist from bleeding to death after an accident that occurred in Sanford. 
   "It was truly an honor to meet with David Heald, NALC National Hero of the Year," said Snowe. "I was able to get a firsthand account of his brave actions that saved the life of a lucky motorcyclist. I congratulate him on winning this well-deserved award." 
   David Heald was driving home from work when he came upon a gruesome accident in which a motorcyclist had smashed into a sedan, severing his leg three inches below the hip. Using life-saving skills he learned in the Navy, Mr. Heald took off his shirt and covered the injury and then used a leather bungee strap to create a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. According to police, had Heald not made the tourniquet and applied it correctly, the motorcyclist would have died before paramedics arrived. 
   David Heald was chosen as National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) Hero of the Year for 2005 by a panel of independent judges. NALC President William H. Young will present him with an award naming him as their Hero of the Year on September 28th in a ceremony in Washington, D.C.
