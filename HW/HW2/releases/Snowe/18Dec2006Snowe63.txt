   Dear Mr. Britt and Mr. Smith, 
   As a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, I am writing to express my hope that a retransmission consent agreement will be reached between Time Warner Cable and Sinclair Broadcasting Group, the owner of CBS affiliate WGME-13, by the January 5, 2007 deadline. 
   I understand from recent stories in the Portland Press Herald and Sun Journal that Time Warner and Sinclair are undergoing negotiations for carriage of WGME to 180,000 former Adelphia subscribers. Reports indicate that negotiations are ongoing but a deal has not been finalized. As you know, many of my constituents - your subscribers and viewers - value WGME's entertainment and local news programming. It is in Time Warner, Sinclair and consumers' best interest that an agreement is reached. 
   I look forward to hearing news of completed negotiations prior to the January 5, 2007 deadline. 
   Sincerely, 
   OLYMPIA J. SNOWE 
   United States Senator.
