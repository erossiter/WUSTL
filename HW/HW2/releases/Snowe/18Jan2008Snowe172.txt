  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today released this statement following the announcement by General Dynamics, parent company of Bath Iron Works, that 73 LS6 will lose their jobs as of February 1, 2008. 
   "We are saddened by the announcement today that General Dynamic intends to layoff 73 workers at Bath Iron Work by February 1st. The men and women of Bath Iron Works are the hardest working, and most dedicated shipbuilders in the world and it is extremely disappointing to learn that some will lose their jobs through no fault of their own.
   "BIW is critical to maintaining the strength of our Navy, to equipping the fleet with the most advanced technologies available, and to fortifying our national security. We will continue to work closely with the Navy for the workload necessary to continue to produce the finest combat ships in the world.
   "We will make every effort to ensure that employees affected by this layoff will receive the assistance they deserve regarding retraining opportunities, unemployment insurance, and any other resources are available."
