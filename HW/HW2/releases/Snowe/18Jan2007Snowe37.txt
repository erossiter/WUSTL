SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS BIPARTISAN SENATE IRAQ RESOLUTION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced on Thursday, January 18, that she will support Sens.Joe Biden (D-DE), Carl Levin (D-MI) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE) in introducing a Senate Resolution calling for a vast change of U.S. policy in Iraq.  
   Snowe issued the following statement today: 
   Today, I am announcing my support for a Resolution put forward by this distinguished group of bipartisan Senators. Now is time for the Congress to make its voice heard on a policy that has such significant implications for the nation, the Middle East and the world. This Resolution is an expression of the American people's frustration with our current Iraq policy. Its focus rightly hinges on a diplomatic and political solution as a military solution is no longer feasible in Iraq. An increase in troops will not solve the root causes of violence in Iraq nor do I believe that the Iraqi government has shown the will or the capacity to bring about effective national reconciliation. I believe this resolution offers a clear expression for a new strategy that will have "the Iraqi political leaders make the political compromises to end the violence."
