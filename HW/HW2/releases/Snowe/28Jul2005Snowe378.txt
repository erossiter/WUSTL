SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) today announced that $1,882,600 in federal funding has been awarded to the Northern Maine Medical Center and West Paris Water District from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development project.  
   "The Rural Development project has been a crucial resource for providing funds to help develop public services in Maine, especially in our rural communities," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We are glad to see these funds go toward projects that will help improve the communities served by the Northern Maine Medical Center and the West Paris Water District." 
   Two loans with a total of $1,500,000 have been awarded to Northern Maine Medical Center to improve office and exam space for the orthopedic surgeon and to upgrade the Intensive Care Unit. 
   A loan of $300,000 and a grant of $82,600 have been awarded to the West Paris Water District to replace a pipe that will provide adequate fire flow in the community. 
   The USDA Rural Development mission provides guaranteed loans, approved loans, and approved grants. Rural Development is committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America. The loans and grants are used for community programs, which seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
