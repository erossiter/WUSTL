SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT DECISION TO HEAR GLOBAL WARMING CASE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) said today that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear a case by a dozen states on global warming, is a sad commentary on the ability of either the Bush Administration or the Congress to directly address the issue of global climate change. 
   Snowe issued the following statement today:
   "For too long our nation has lacked a cohesive national policy to address global climate change forcing states around the country, including my home state of Maine, to take the lead. States have stepped in where the Federal government has clearly failed - and this lack of a comprehensive strategy has forced the United States to relinquish any influence it could have had in international negotiations that move ahead without us. 
   "Yet, I have mixed feelings about the Supreme Court's decision to hear a case of such magnitude. The fact of the matter is that the Court is filling a void caused by the inaction with in the Congress and the Administration. Yet, it appears that the only way to spur greater U.S. action is through the courts. For those of us who have long pressed for greater U.S. leadership both nationally and internationally, this step is far better than a future of further inaction. That is why I will use this case as a call to action to develop a national framework to address an issue that threatens not only our environmental health, but the economic well-being our nation." 
   In the case before the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2003 decision that carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, which regulates other industrial emissions.
