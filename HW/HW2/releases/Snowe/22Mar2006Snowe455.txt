SEN. SNOWE CALLS TOM'S OF MAINE ENTREPRENEURIAL MODEL FOR MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today called the phenomenal success and subsequent $100 million purchase by Colgate Palmolive of Tom's of Maine a model for Maine businesses.  
   "Today's announcement that Colgate will purchase control of Tom's of Maine is a reflection of Tom and Kate Chappell's work as true trailblazers and visionaries. Their highly successful business was founded on a commitment to high-quality, environmentally sound products and on an unwavering commitment to the state of Maine. That dedication is reflected in the fact that the company's headquarters and employees will remain in Kennebunk with Tom at the helm. I believe that once Colgate in partnership with Tom's experiences firsthand the tremendous work ethic of our labor force, they will choose to expand their operations in Maine, creating more jobs for our state's economy. 
   "Tom's of Maine in many ways reflects the Maine's values of dedication, hard work, and entrepreneurship. I congratulate Tom, Kate and the entire Tom's of Maine workforce for this momentous achievement.".
