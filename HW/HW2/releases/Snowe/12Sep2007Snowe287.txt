SENS. MENENDEZ, SNOWE TO INTRODUCE RESOLUTION TO URGE TURKEY TO END ITS MILITARY OCCUPATION OF REPUBLIC OF CYPRESS
  United States Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Olympia J. Snowe (R - ME) today announced they will introduce a resolution in the Senate to encourage the government of Turkey to end its military occupation of the Republic of Cypress.  
   "I can see no reason for even one Turkish soldier to remain on Cyprus. Turkey's pretext for this military occupation has been refuted over and over again by millions of peaceful crossings by Turkish-Cypriots and Greek-Cypriots," said Menendez. 
   "This year marks the 33rd anniversary of Turkey's illegal invasion and occupation of the sovereign territory of the Republic of Cyprus, a long-standing friend and ally of the United States. The entire world recognizes the unlawful nature of Turkey's actions, and the time has long passed for Turkey to withdraw its military presence on the island. It is a testament of the integrity of the Republic of Cyprus that it continues to make good faith efforts to reach a peaceful solution to end the forced partition of its nation. Our resolution is an unequivocal statement that the United States stands ready to lend its support to these reunification efforts," said Snowe. 
   This resolution, introduced in the House by Rep. Albio Sires (D-NJ-13), would: 
   1) call on the United States to help Turkey understand the benefits of withdrawing 
   2) urge Turkey to immediately withdraw the troop 
    3) urge Turkey to do this quickly so that all sides can see benefits. 
   Menendez and Snowe will introduce the resolution when the Senate reconvenes in September.
