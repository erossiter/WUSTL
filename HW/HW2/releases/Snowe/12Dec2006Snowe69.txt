CITING TODAY'S UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE CHINA REPORT, SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF BOLD TRADE ENFORCEMENT BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe called today's United States Trade Representative Report on China's trade compliance a startling recognition that American trade rights must be more vigorously enforced. Sen. Olympia Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee that oversees international trade, believes legislation that she introduced in the final hours of the 109th Congress, the Trade Complaint and Litigation Accountability Improvement Measures Act, will give U.S. businesses and workers a greater say in whether, when and how U.S. trade rights should be enforced. 
   "America's prosperity is due in no small part to its excellence in assuring the rule of law. It is fundamental to the success of worthy enterprises in a functioning market that the government- rather than choosing winners and losers- consistently and dispassionately enforce the rules that bind all parties. It is the extension of this founding principle of the American economic tradition to international trade agreements that the Trade CLAIM Act seeks to accomplish - and which America's businesses and workers have long been promised," said Snowe.  
   USTR today released its congressionally mandated annual "2006 Report to Congress on China's WTO Compliance" that found that "China continues to pursue problematic industrial policies that rely on trade-distorting measures such a local content requirements, import and export restrictions, discriminatory regulations and prohibited subsidies, all of which raise serious WTO concerns. China's shortcomings in enforcing laws in areas where detailed WTO disciplines apply, such as intellectual property rights (IPR), have also created serious problems for the United States and its other trading partners." 
   "While I am pleased that USTR recognizes that China has much progress to make in living up to its trade obligations to the U.S., I was disappointed that the report did not discuss the trade effects of China's ongoing currency manipulation. Although USTR expressed a willingness to take formal action against China if negotiations on trade disagreements fail, its record in following through on that pledge has been far too inconsistent," said Snowe. 
   Snowe cited the fact that USTR has only brought one case against China in Five years since its WTO accession and just last month acquiesced to a Chinese request for further discussions before bringing a formal IPR case against it in the WTO. 
   The Trade CLAIM Act would amend Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974- the statute setting forth general procedures for the enforcement of U.S. trade rights- to limit USTR's ability to decline an interested party's petition to take formal action in cases where a U.S. trade right has been violated to instances where: 
   * the matter has already been addressed by the relevant trade dispute settlement body; 
   * the foreign country is taking imminent steps to end to ameliorate the effects of the practice; 
   * taking action would do more harm than good to the U.S. economy; or 
   * taking action would cause serious harm to the national security of the United States. 
   The bill would also grant the U.S. Court of International Trade jurisdiction to review de novo (i.e., without deference to USTR's decisions) USTR's denials of Section 301 industry petitions to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair foreign trade laws or practices. Such jurisdiction would include the ability to review USTR determinations that U.S. trade rights have not been violated as alleged in industry petitions, and the sufficiency of formal actions taken by USTR in response to foreign trade laws or practices determined to violate U.S. trade rights. 
   Snowe believes that by: 
   * Providing judicial review over USTR decisions not to enforce U.S. trade rights, the bill ensures impartial third party oversight by a specialty court not subject to political and diplomatic pressures; 
   * Increasing the likelihood of facing a U.S. trade challenge would put greater pressure on foreign trade partners to cease and desist from unfair trade practices; and 
   * Depoliticizing the enforcement of U.S. trade rights should lead to greater recognition of the effectiveness of the dispute resolution institutions provided for under U.S. bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, bolstering popular support for those agreements and the notion that free trade can be fair trade. 
   "A solid consensus has grown around the principle that whatever our trade laws may be, they should be consistently and vigorously enforced. The distressing reality is that U.S. industry and labor groups are often rebuffed in attempts to petition the United States Trade Representative to initiate a formal investigation or bring a dispute resolution action under the relevant trade agreement," continued Snowe. 
   Snowe cited USTR's handling of the trade effects of China's currency manipulation practices as representative of the problem. In September 2004, a U.S. industry coalition filed a petition under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974- the statute setting forth general procedures for the enforcement of U.S. trade rights- alleging that Chinese currency manipulation practices constituted a violation of China's obligations to the United States under World Trade Organization rules, and calling for USTR to conduct an investigation of such practices. 
   USTR rejected the petition on the day it was filed, contending that "an investigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, and practices covered in the petition. The Administration is currently involved in efforts to address with the Government of China the currency valuation issues raised in the petition. 
   The USTR believes that initiation of an investigation under [the Section 301 process] would hamper, rather than advance, Administration efforts to address Chinese currency valuation policies." 
   As noted in USTR's rejection of these petitions, current law allows the Executive to decline to initiate an industry-requested investigation where it determines that action under Section 301 would be ineffective in addressing the offending act, policy or practice. The merits of USTR's determination are unreviewable under current law. USTR used this loophole to avoid having to even investigate industry's claim. 
   "By providing for judicial review of USTR decisions not to enforce U.S. trade rights, the bill provides for impartial third party oversight by a specialty court not subject to political and diplomatic pressures. In delinking discreet trade disputes from the mercurial machinations of international relations, this Act would end the sacrifice of individual industries on the negotiating table, and leave it to the free market- uniformly operating under the trade rules to which our trading partners have already agreed - to decide their fate," concluded Snowe.
