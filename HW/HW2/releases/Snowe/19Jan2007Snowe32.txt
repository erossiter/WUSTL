SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS PERMANENT INTERNET TAX BAN
  As a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Sen.Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) on Friday, January 19, co-sponsored legislation to permanently ban newly-established Internet taxes. The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), would indefinitely prohibit new taxes on Internet access services and multiple or discriminatory taxes on Internet commerce currently banned by the Internet Tax Moratorium. 
   "Failure to act on this vital legislation will undoubtedly increase prices and discourage Mainers and Americans from utilizing Internet services," said Senator Snowe. "I have supported bans placed in the past and strongly believe by permanently enforcing this moratorium; we will both encourage and invest in Internet deployment for years to come." 
   The initial Tax Freedom Act, enacted in October 1998, grandfathered state and local access taxes that were generally imposed and enforced prior to October 1, 1998.
