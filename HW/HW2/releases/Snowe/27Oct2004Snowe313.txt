  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today urged Mainers, and indeed all Red Sox fans to 'bask in the glow' of the Red Sox World Series Victory last night over the St.  
 Louis Cardinals.
   "After 86 years, loyal, die-hard Red Sox fans can celebrate a World Series Championship. Decade after decade, generations of Mainers have invested their baseball hopes and dreams in the fortunes of the Red Sox. Today, Maine, New England, and members of "Red Sox Nation" everywhere can bask in the glow of this ultimate victory.
