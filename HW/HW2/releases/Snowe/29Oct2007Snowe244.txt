SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS DISAPPOINTED WITH FEDERAL DECISION TO DENY ASSISTANCE TO NEW ENGLAND GROUNDFISHERMEN
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, and U.S. Senator Susan Collins today released this statement following the Administration's decision to deny help to commercial fishermen who are being hurt by restrictive regulations. 
   "We are disappointed with the Administration's decision to deny Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island's request for financial assistance to help New England's groundfish industry. It is clear that restrictive regulations have indeed devastated the groundfish industries in our states. We have asked officials the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for further justification of this decision and expect to be briefed this week. 
   "In addition, we are pleased that, with our support, the Senate passed an amendment last week to the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill that would provide $15 million for in funding for "regional coastal fisheries disaster assistance" under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. We will continue to support the State of Maine's efforts to have a commercial fisheries failure declared for Maine's struggling groundfish industry."
