SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS TO REDUCE RANKS OF 6 MILLION UNINSURED
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, applauded President Bush's focus on Association Health Plans for small businesses in New Hampshire today and called for Congress to pass legislation that provides them with affordable health insurance. 
   "As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I commend the President for addressing the foremost concern of small businesses today - health care costs," said Snowe. "Our country is home to the most sophisticated medical and pharmaceutical technologies in the world, and yet health insurance is out of reach for many small businesses, which prevents millions of Americans from obtaining the medical care they need. I look forward to working closely with the Bush Administration and other Members of Congress to ensure that AHP legislation receives a long-awaited vote this year. AHPs represent an opportunity to drastically shrink the ranks of America's nearly 46 million uninsured, without significantly expanding the health care bureaucracy or increasing federal spending." 
   Last year, Senator Snowe introduced S. 406, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2005. The bill mirrors the House version of Association Health Plan (AHP) legislation, which last year the House of Representatives passed overwhelmingly, 263-165. This was the eighth time the House has passed such a bill. Small Business Health Plans represent a fair, fiscally sound, and tested approach that provide small businesses with the freedom to offer the same health insurance options currently available to employees of large companies and government agencies.
