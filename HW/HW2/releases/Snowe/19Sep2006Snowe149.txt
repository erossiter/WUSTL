CRITICAL PORT SECURITY LEGISLATION PASSED
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that shares jurisdiction over transportation security, today voted for passage of critical port security legislation. H.R. 4954, the Port Security Act, which passed unanimous vote, includes provisions sponsored by Sen. Snowe that increase port security worker training requirements, passenger rail safety, and authorize the resources necessary for the Coast Guard to extend our maritime borders through international port inspection.  
   "Improving the security of our nation's ports is critical to ensuring the safety of the American people and the strength of our economy," Snowe said. "This comprehensive legislation addresses many of the long standing vulnerabilities by increasing cargo container inspections, radiation screening, and improving security on the Downeaster and other passenger trains throughout the nation. This legislation has built on the foundation of maritime security legislation passed in 2002, and taken steps to properly funding, implementing, and enhancing security measures to counter emerging threats." 
   Senator Snowe sponsored the following provisions of the Port Security Act: 
   * Extension of Gulf of Maine Research Institute Bulkhead Replacement: 
  A provision extending the deadline for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute to replace the bulkhead located on the Coast Guard property in Portland. The previous deadline of 2006 has been extended to the end of 2008. 
   * Port Security Worker Training Requirements: 
  A provision addressing the requirements included in the 2002 Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), which requires port and terminal operators to provide security training regimes for employees of these ports, by allowing for forming training partnerships, including public safety entities and academic institutions, between port operators and these partners to provide training. This would permit the Maine Maritime Academy to contract with port operators around the country to provide port workers security training. 
   * Increase Passenger Rail Safety: 
  A provision that requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a passenger and baggage screening pilot program at five Amtrak stations, undertake specific security measures, including testing explosives detection technologies and require picture ID of passengers before boarding a train. In response to calls to action by Snowe, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) initiated a passenger and baggage screening pilot program at the Washington, D.C.-Metro area rail station of New Carrolton, MD in April 2004. 
   * Coast Guard Inspection of Foreign Ports: 
  Authorizes the allocation of the resources necessary for the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect foreign ports to ensure International Port Security standards are being met. This provision requires the Coast Guard to perform inspections every two years and authorizes the resources necessary to meet that requirement. 
   The Port Security Act also includes provisions that: 
   * Mandate unannounced inspections of port facilities reflecting which is meant to address the concerns you had about the CG announcing its inspections ahead of time. 
  * Create an interagency operation centers on a national scale that you championed in the original maritime security act. 
  * Increase domestic radiation detection capabilities as you have called for. 
  * Address the issue of car ferries traveling from Canada to ensure the safe flow of commerce and the security of the border.
