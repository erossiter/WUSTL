SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR BANGOR
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that a $4,200,000 Rural Development loan has been awarded to the Galt Block Warehouse Co., Inc of Bangor by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  
   "Maintaining local facilities is crucial in order to ensure adequate services for the public," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The improvements that will be made to the Galt Block Warehouse will greatly benefit the entire Bangor community." 
   The Rural Development funds will be used to restructure debt associated with real estate and commercial freezer space, make building improvements to accommodate prospective tenants, and pay related professional and loan fees. The company owns and operates a total of 376,500 square feet of secure, temperature controlled warehouse space. In addition to the freezer, Galt Block services include not only dry storage, but also handling, distribution, inventory management, logistics management, order sorting, picking, packing, labeling, and other customized services. 
   The USDA Rural Development mission provides guaranteed loans, approved loans, and approved grants. Rural Development is committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America. The loans and grants are used for community programs, which seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
