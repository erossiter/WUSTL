SEN. SNOWE HONORED FOR EFFORTS TO INCREASE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR BREAST CANCER RESEARCH
  A champion for greater federal funding for breast cancer research, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was honored this morning by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation as a 'Funding Hero' for her ongoing efforts to increase federal funding for the cause. 
   "I am deeply honored to receive the "Funding Hero" award from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation - an institution whose dedication and commitment to innovate research has saved countless lives," said Snowe. "Breast cancer strikes 216,000 American women each year, affecting 1 in 7 women at some point in their lifetime, with men increasingly at risk. Nearly all Americans know of a family member, friend, or co-worker - or themselves - who has been afflicted with the disease. Breast cancer knows no boundaries, and our joint efforts to combat this deadly disease must be equally unwavering. I will continue fighting for increased federal funding for the critical research that has already lowered the mortality rate for breast cancer by 2.3 percent annually this past decade." 
   Throughout her tenure in the Senate, Snowe has led the effort to include funding for the Department of Defense (DoD) Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program within the yearly Defense Appropriations bill. Established in 1992, the DoD program funds research at universities, hospitals, non-profits and for-profit institutions, private industry and state and federal agencies to eradicate breast cancer. Since 1994, Snowe has secured $1.3 billion for the program, including $150 million in the fiscal year 2005 Defense Appropriations bill. 
   The event, hosted by Evelyn Lauder of the famed Estee Lauder Foundation, kicked off National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was also honored.
