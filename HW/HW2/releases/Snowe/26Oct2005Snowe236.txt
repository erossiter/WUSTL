SEN. SNOWE ENSURES MEDICAID, MEDICARE SAVINGS DO NOT IMPACT BENEFICIARIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, lauded the final savings package produced by the committee, which achieves $10 billion in savings over five years in the Medicaid and Medicare programs without cutting any benefits to Americans enrolled in these vital programs. During negotiations, Sen. Snowe repeatedly insisted that she would not support any plan that saves money by targeting those in need. The package also directly benefits health care facilities throughout Maine, including Maine's two private psychiatric hospitals and community health centers across the state.  
   "In my view, this package strikes the proper balance not only in numbers, but most importantly in policy - I firmly believe that we must not create savings by limiting benefits that aid the least advantaged and most vulnerable Americans," said Snowe. "The savings in this agreement are derived not from reducing benefits, but rather from making needed reforms and eliminating unneeded spending, while at the same time including spending that strengthens Medicare and Medicaid. I commend Senator Grassley for his leadership during what has been a difficult and sometimes contentious process." 
   The fiscal year 2006 Budget Resolution called for the Senate Finance Committee to identify $10 billion in savings in programs it oversees, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The package adopted by the Finance Committee meets this goal through $4.3 billion in savings from Medicaid and $5.8 billion in savings from Medicare. These savings are derived largely from reductions in wasteful spending in both programs, and does not reduce any benefits to persons in either program. An earlier proposal had called for $10 billion in cuts to Medicaid, which Snowe adamantly opposed. 
   The Finance Committee's package includes increases in spending to programs critical to Maine, including covering shortfalls in the State Children's Health Insurance Program ("SCHIP"), $170 million additional support for rural hospital outpatient programs, and a 1 percent increase in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals, which is key to maintaining access to full medical care in rural areas. 
   The bill also included two amendments authored by Senator Snowe. The first provides $30 million in Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals treating adult psychiatric patients, which will directly benefit Spring Harbor Hospital in Portland (affiliated with Maine Medical Center) and Acadia Hospital in Bangor, the two private psychiatric hospitals in Maine. The second amendment provides $40 million in Medicare reimbursements to community health centers for preventive treatments that they render. There are more than 30 community health centers across Maine. A list of all these facilities is available at www.mepca.org/members/members.aspx. 
   "I am particularly pleased that this package addresses my concerns that home health care not be impacted," said Snowe. "We have also helped preserve access to primary and preventative care services for Medicare beneficiaries through improved payments to community health centers." 
   Medicaid provides health and long term care services to 53 million low-income pregnant women, children, individuals with disabilities and seniors - 300,000 of them in Maine. It provides coverage to the uninsured, who now number more than 45 million Americans, as well as 35 million seniors and 6 million Americans with disabilities. 
   Following are the details of the package the Finance Committee passed today: 
   * Promotes access to health care. 
   * Ensures continuity of health coverage for low income children by providing funding to states that face shortfalls in the State Children's Health Insurance. 
   * Program (SCHIP) and expanding outreach and enrollment activities to get more kids covered. 
   * Expands Medicaid benefits through the Family Opportunity Act so that parents of severely disabled children can go to work and earn above-poverty wages while maintaining vital services for their severely disabled children. 
   * Achieves savings, preserves services, protects beneficiaries. 
   * Helps state Medicaid programs obtain millions in payments owed by third party payors each year. 
   * Ends drug manufacturer gaming of the system by closing the authorized generic loophole so that appropriate rebates are paid to states. 
   * Balances savings from pharmacy payment changes with an increase in the rebate paid by drug manufacturers to 17%. 
   * Cracks down on Medicaid fraud and abuse. 
   * Encourages states to aggressively pursue Medicaid fraud by implementing state false claims acts, which at the federal level is the single most important tool U.S. taxpayers have to recover the billions of dollars stolen through fraud every year. 
   * Requires employers who do business with Medicaid to have a false claims act education program so that those with evidence of fraud against Medicaid know they may pursue claims, on behalf of the government, in order to recover the stolen funds. 
   * Dramatically increases resources to fight fraud and abuse in Medicaid, which will protect state and federal budgets and generate savings of at least 13:1 from this investment. 
   * Protects Medicaid benefits for long term care coverage. 
   * Provides new options for private coverage of long term care through Long-term Care Partnerships. 
   * Closes loopholes that permit the unscrupulous "gaming" of Medicaid eligibility rules to intentionally shelter assets to qualify for taxpayer-financed long term care coverage in Medicaid. 
   * Makes a down payment to respond to the health care needs of low income families affected by Hurricane Katrina by providing $1.8 billion to protect Medicaid benefits in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. 
   * Begins implementation of Value-based Purchasing in Medicare, which makes critical and necessary systematic changes to Medicare payment policies to encourage and reward quality and patient safety while controlling rising health care costs. 
   * Preserves access to health care for seniors and individuals with disabilities in Medicare. 
   * All providers paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule will see a 1.0% payment rate increase instead of a 4.4% payment cut in 2006. 
   * Ensures beneficiaries are not denied access to critical inpatient rehabilitation facility services by freezing implementation of the "75% rule" at the 50% level. 
   * Ensures all beneficiaries needing extensive therapy services are not denied these needed services by extending the moratorium on therapy caps. 
   * Ensures access to ESRD facilities that provide high quality dialysis services to over 430 thousand beneficiaries with kidney disease. 
   * Fights waste in the Medicare program by preventing unnecessary payments to durable medical equipment suppliers for maintenance of capped rental equipment. 
   * Protects access for rural beneficiaries. 
   * Extends the hold-harmless provisions for small rural hospitals and sole community hospitals from implementation of the hospital outpatient prospective payment system. 
   * Extends the Medicare Dependent Hospital program, which provides financial protections to rural hospitals with less than 100 beds that have a greater than 60 percent share of Medicare patients. 
   * Preserves access to community hospital care by ending unfair competition from physician-owned limited service hospitals. Prohibits new physician-owned limited service hospitals from having any ownership or investment interest by physicians who refer Medicare and Medicaid patients to the facility.
