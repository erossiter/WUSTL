SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF FISCAL 2005 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) said today that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2005, which passed the Senate last night by a vote of 97 to 0, takes critical steps to prosecuting the global war on terror.
   "This legislation that passed the Senate last night will provide critical and necessary resources to the Department of Defense as we continue to fight an international war on terror," said Snowe. "As our military is actively engaged overseas, it is absolutely essential that we provide our fighting men and women with the support they need to fulfill their mission. I'm pleased this legislation passed unanimously last night broadcasting to both our military and the world that we stand united behind our soldiers during these trying times." 
   Snowe also announced that several key amendments she championed were also approved, including the preservation of air search and rescue presence along Maine's coastline, a repeal of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) media ownership rules, several critical provisions that will help small businesses, and an amendment requiring that the Department of Defense (DoD) health program cover reproductive health services in cases of rape and incest.
   "I am pleased that several key amendments I sponsored and supported were adopted in the Senate's FY2005 Defense Authorization bill, strengthening the overall package while providing additional benefits for the citizens of Maine," said Snowe. "From mariners off the 3,500 mile Maine coastline to our retiring servicemen and women, the Defense Authorization bill included critical provisions to improve the lives and livelihoods of people around our nation. I will continue to work throughout the upcoming appropriations process for those priorities that are vital both to Maine and the nation."
   As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Snowe was also pleased that the Senate gave a boost to small businesses struggling to win job-growing contracts with federal agencies Defense Authorization Act, which contains key small business provisions.
   "Small businesses are renowned for their role in making important contributions to our nation's industrial base by delivering cutting-edge, cost-effective solutions to our civilian and defense agencies," Snowe said. "This important bill will help build upon that well-deserved reputation."
   Amendments sponsored by Snowe in the Senate-passed Defense Authorization bill included:
   Search & Rescue Units at Brunswick Naval Air Station -
   * Co-sponsored with Senators Trent Lott (R-MS), Thad Cochran (R-MS) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), Snowe was successful in securing the presence of a helicopter sea rescue capabilities. The amendment dictates that the Secretary of Defense would not be permitted to reduce or eliminate any search and rescue capability at any U.S. military installation without first demonstrating that equivalent search and rescue capabilities will be provided without interruption by other federal agencies in accordance with the National Search and Rescue Plan. This amendment is modeled on the agreement Snowe secured in April with the Coast Guard which committed to concrete steps to enhance existing search and rescue units, which patrol and protect the 5,300 miles of Maine's coast line
   "I cannot stress enough how critical the search and rescue helicopter unit at Brunswick Naval Air Station is to Maine, our coastline and our mariners. The presence of those units dramatically reduces the potential for the unnecessary loss of life off our coasts and, therefore, must be protected by any means available and this provision does just that," Snowe said.
   Media Consolidation -
   * Passed by voice vote, Snowe co-sponsored an amendment with Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) that permanently repeals the FCC media ownership rules. Snowe has long been concerned by the negative impact of media consolidation on programming, stating "I do not think we can dismiss the connection between consolidation and the rise in disregard for family and community standards. This amendment effectively protects local communities and independent broadcasters from the further consolidation of media outlets into the hands of a few large corporations."
   Energy Efficiency -
   * Adopted by unanimous consent, an amendment cosponsored by Snowe with Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) for the Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) program, which promotes consensus energy efficiency standards and reforms in government contracting by requires all federal agencies to utilize the most cost-effective as well as energy efficient products. Additionally, future agency buildings must be designed with energy efficiency incorporated into the final planning. This provision was contained in the "Effector" legislation co-sponsored by Snowe and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
   Base Realignment & Closure (BRAC) -
   * In her continuing efforts to protect the Brunswick Naval Air Station and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Snowe joined with Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in offering an amendment to prevent the Department of Defense (DoD) from utilizing a provision in the base realignment and closure (BRAC) proceedings that would allow the DoD to inactivate, or "mothball", a military base or unit. This Snowe-Lott-Dorgan amendment was accepted to the bill.
   Snowe, however, was disappointed that her other amendment to outright delay the domestic BRAC process until 2007 to follow on a 2005 foreign BRAC failed. The amendment previously offered to the FY2005 Defense Authorization bill by the three Senators, along with Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Thad Cochran (R-MS), and Tom Daschle (D-SD), failed by a Senate vote of 47 to 49. "I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass my previous amendment on BRAC, particularly given that we live in an unprecedented era fighting a global war on terrorism. I remain steadfast in my commitment to finding any and all means necessary to fight this ill-advised base closing process," Snowe said.
   Military Benefits including Veterans -
   * Cosponsored with Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), Snowe offered an amendment to assist Armed Services personnel with transition from the military to civilian life. The Feingold-Snowe amendment enhances professional services offered to veterans and service-disabled veterans including counseling, job training, and education. The Departments of Defense and Labor will also conduct a study on job training and certification programs for persons separating from the Armed Forces. Additionally, the Feingold-Snowe amendment requires the General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a study on the effectiveness of various transition assistance programs for discharged members of the military. The study will also investigate the transition from military health care to VA health care so Congress can make this transition easier for service members leaving the military. It will also research access for Veteran Service Organizations to military hospitals.
   * A modification of S.451, legislation previously sponsored by Snowe, was accepted as an amendment to the FY2005 Defense Authorization bill. Offered by Snowe with Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA), the amendment will raise the percentage of the retirement annuity received by survivors of military retirees over age 62 who participate in the military's Survivor Benefit Plan and will remove the current drop in annuity from 55 percent to 35 percent at age 62.
   * Enhancing access to health care for military personnel, the bill includes an amendment authored by Snowe and Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to ensure that military healthcare provides coverage for reproductive health services for servicewomen or other dependents who need them in cases of rape or incest.
   Small Business -
   * An amendment to require that, as part of pre-separation counseling, veterans receive counseling on procurement opportunities available to veterans and service-disabled veterans. It also permits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department Of Defense (DOD) to allow such counseling through the SBA, VA Outreach Centers, Small Business Development Centers, and other government agencies located on VA and DOD facilities. It also requires the General Accounting Office to conduct a new study to determine what improvements in veterans pre-separation counseling, including procurement counseling, will be needed to better serve the nation's veterans.
   * An amendment to better protect the interests of small businesses on the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's Advisory Panel on Review of Acquisition Law and Policy - which requires the panel to make recommendations on assuring competition and small business participation, and provides for review of its report by both the Senate and the House Small Business Committees. The amendment applies President Bush's Executive Order 13272 on consideration of small business interests to the formulation of federal procurement policy. "This amendment assures that the voice of small business owners who contract with the government will be heard," Snowe said.
   * An amendment to expand the DOD's Mentor-Protege Program to include service-disabled and HUBZone small business concerns - which will boost contract participation by these groups as DOD suppliers and subcontractors. The "National Defense Reauthorization Act" for FY 1991 established the pilot Mentor-Protege Program to provide incentives for major DOD contractors to furnish Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) with assistance to enhance their capabilities and increase their participation as subcontractors and suppliers on DOD contracts. Four years ago, Senator Snowe worked closely with Chairman Warner to extend the benefits of this successful program to women-owned small businesses.
   "This amendment shows that the Senate means business about contract opportunities benefitting veterans and residents of underdeveloped areas. Veterans who risk their lives for this country deserve the mentoring services and other tools for developing business with the Department of Defense," Snow said.
   * A Sense of the Senate amendment to protect, in any future adjustments for inflation, the dollar value of contract awards required to be reserved for small businesses to include those valued from $2,500 to $100,000. Existing law allows procurement officials to forego full and open competition on many contracts worth less than $100,000.
   * This amendment, which was cosponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), also directs the Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy to ensure that appropriate government-wide policies and procedures are in place to monitor data on purchases made by federal agencies using government purchase cards and to encourage the maximum practicable number of those purchases be made from small businesses. Provisions Congress included in the "Small Business Act," set a government-wide statutory goal of 23 percent of all prime contract awards to be awarded to small businesses.
   * An amendment to expand the Commission on the Future of National Technology and Industrial Base - by adding small business concerns for participation in and consideration by the Commission and to require that it study shortages of critical technologies and raw materials. This amendment, which was cosponsored by Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) and several members of the Senate Small Business Committee.
