SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH CONSTITUENTS TO DISCUSS EPILEPSY AWARENESS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met with Emily Rideout and her 4-year-old daughter Lynzi, of Winn, Maine, to discuss epilepsy awareness.  
 Lynzi recently got an implant that is supposed to decrease the frequency of her seizures. 
   "Epilepsy is an affliction that affects millions of Americans each year," said Snowe. "We must funnel more resources and energy into finding causes and cures for this debilitating and often inexplicable disorder. My conversations with Lynzi and her mother Emily have only strengthened my resolve to address this widespread but too often ignored issue." 
   Epilepsy is a neurological condition, which affects the nervous system. Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but most of the time the cause is unknown. The word "epilepsy" does not indicate anything about the cause of the person's seizures, what type they are, or how severe they are.
