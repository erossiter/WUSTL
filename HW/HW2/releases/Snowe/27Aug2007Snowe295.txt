SEN. SNOWE LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF SCHIP REAUTHORIZATION BILL
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, tonight praised the Senate passage of legislation that will reauthorize the State Children Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) for additional five years. Snowe commended her Senate colleagues for reaching a bipartisan consensus on legislation that would extend funding for the program, which is set to expire in September, by $35 billion to cover 3.2 million uninsured children. 
   "For more than a decade, SCHIP has been providing essential health care coverage for millions of children and it is critical that this program remains a top national priority in the years to come," said Senator Snowe. "This bipartisan legislation is vital to ensuring the federal government remains committed to covering the 6 million children already enrolled, while making it possible for states to reach out to those children that are eligible, but un-enrolled. There is no disputing the value of providing health coverage for America's children and I am so pleased to work with my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle to reauthorize this essential program."  
   "The bipartisan effort to reauthorize SCHIP today should send a clear signal to hardworking families of limited means that Congress will not sit idly by while they struggle to meet one of the most basic necessities of life," said Senator Snowe. "This critical legislation builds on the success states have experienced over the past ten years by explicitly allowing states to increase eligibility; revising the funding formula to reflect state projections on coverage; and creating incentives for states with demonstrated success in covering more low-income children." 
   The compromise bill contains a number of priorities included in S.1224, the "Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act," legislation Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Senator Snowe introduced in April. 
   These provisions include: 
   * Increasing income eligibility to families at 300 percent of poverty. This represents the right policy because it creates a broader safety-net that offers assistance to a greater number of families. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, fewer than half (47 percent) of parents in families earning less than $40,000 a year are offered health insurance through their employer--a 9 percent drop since 1997. 
   * Allowing states the option to cover pregnant women. While states can currently pursue a state plan amendment to offer pre-natal, labor, and delivery services, postpartum care is not reimbursable. Studies show that women who do not receive postpartum care are at a greater risk for a variety of health complications that make it difficult for a mother to properly care for her infant. In June, Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, Senator Lugar and Senator Bingaman and 15 additional Senators sent a letter to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley asking for inclusion of this policy. 
   * Expanding health quality reporting. The bill contains a new quality initiative within the Department of Health and Human Services charged with developing and implementing quality measures and improving state reporting of quality data. In addition, the bill includes the Lincoln/Snowe amendment on quality reporting on reducing the number of children born pre-maturely 
   * Combating childhood obesity. The bill includes a Snowe amendment authorizing a $25 million demonstration project and instituting measures to fight childhood obesity. Over 15 percent of children in our country are obese. This has dire consequences for their long-term health and will put a strain on health care resources in the future. 
   Also adopted was an amendment introduced by Senator Snowe and Senator John Kerry (D-MA) that would establish a Federal Interagency Task Force, including the SBA Administrator, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Secretary of Labor, to increase educational outreach and information to small businesses about the SCHIP program. The measure would establish a small business "hotline" for small business owners and employees to call with eligibility questions for the SCHIP program. The SBA Administrator will also establish web links on the SBA web page, detailing information on eligibility and enrollment requirements for SCHIP. 
   Senator Snowe, who has long championed efforts to cover America's uninsured voiced disappointment in the threat that the President may stand in the way of insuring children's health saying "quite frankly, any veto threats are in stark disregard of the wishes expressed by the American people who strongly and enthusiastically support this program."
