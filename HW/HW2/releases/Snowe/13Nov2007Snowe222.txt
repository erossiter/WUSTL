CONGRESS APPROVES FINAL VETERANS SPENDING, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL THAT INCLUDES SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS REQUEST FOR $29.1 BILLION FOR VETERANS' MEDICAL SERVICES
  The U.S. Senate has approved the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs spending bill that, at the request of Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, includes $29.1 billion for veterans' medical services, an increase of 14% above the enacted level for fiscal year 2007, and $9.7 million for a Consolidated Emergency Control Center at the Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  
   "We must remain vigilant in our support for the Nation's veterans. We are pleased that our colleagues in the U.S. Senate recognize how critical it is to support the medical facilities that serve our nation's veterans," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This bill provides funding that will enable Togus, as well as VA medical facilities throughout the nation, to meet the needs of their patients. We are also very pleased that this legislation includes $480 million for continued research and development for prosthetic technologies. 
   "We are proud that our calls for much needed funding for the continued modernization of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) have been heard. The legislation passed today includes $9.7 million for a Consolidated Emergency Control Center at Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. This new state-of-the-art facility will accommodate the shipyard's emergency response organization, greatly increasing the team's ability to direct and control the collection and evaluation of information, tp mobilize emergency responders, and to notify off-site organizations in the event of an emergency. The bill also includes $1.2 million for the planning and design of a Dry-dock Waterfront Facility at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. This funding will begin the planning to replace the current submarine support facility that is over 60 years old and in need of replacement, and allow the Yard's talented and dedicated workforce to further increase their exemplary efficiency."
