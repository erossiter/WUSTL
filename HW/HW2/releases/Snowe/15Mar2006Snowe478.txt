SEN. SNOWE AMENDMENT WOULD STRENGTHEN MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) have introduced an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Act that would strengthen the drug coverage offered to seniors under the 2003 Medicare prescription drug benefit. The amendment is based on the Medicare Enhancement for Needed Drugs (MEND) Act that Snowe and Wyden introduced last year. This legislation would directly address the crisis of skyrocketing drug costs by giving the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the specific authority to negotiate lower prices for drug purchases through Medicare.  
   "The rapidly escalating price of prescription drugs threatens to undermine the very drug benefit Congress passed to deliver real savings to seniors," said Snowe. "Our amendment manages costs in a commonsense way - harnessing the buying power of millions of seniors to give them a better value for their health care dollar. The fact is that negotiation will drive down costs, and we cannot sit idly by as the cost of the drug benefit continues to rise when we have the power to fix this problem now." 
   Snowe and Wyden's amendment permits savings to reduce the cost of the prescription drug benefit to Medicare if Congress passes a bill that lifts the "non-interference" language (the ban in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act on negotiations) and requires that the HHS Secretary negotiate with drug companies in at least two instances: (1) for fall back plans; and (2) if a private drug plan asks for help in negotiations.
