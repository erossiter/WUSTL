SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS WORK TO SECURE $3.4 BILLION IN LIHEAP FUNDING FOR NATION
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) today cosponsored legislation that would increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for fiscal years (FY) 2005 through 2007.  
 The Maine Senators are committed to having this legislation considered before the Senate adjourns for the year. 
   The legislation, introduced by Senator James Jeffords (I-VT), will increase LIHEAP funding from its current level of $2 billion a year to $3.4 billion for the next three fiscal years, and then as such sums as necessary through FY 2011. LIHEAP funding assists low-income families cover home heating costs through the winter months. 
   "LIHEAP provides vital assistance to our most citizens needy during our long and often hard winter months. Last year alone, 45,000 Maine households were able to meet their home energy needs with help from the LIHEAP," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We remain committed to protecting the long-term strength of this essential program and will work to ensure that these additional LIHEAP funds are considered prior to the Senate's adjournment." 
   Yesterday, Snowe and Collins announced that Maine would be receiving $20.8 million in LIHEAP funding as part of the Continuing Resolution currently funding FY 2005. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the funding. 
   LIHEAP provides a safety net against high energy costs for the nation's low-income households, disabled individuals and senior citizens living on fixed incomes. The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown since 1981, but the number of households served has declined, because of high fuel costs.
