SEN. SNOWE BACKS BILL PREVENTING FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AGAINST GUN MAKERS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) has joined as an original cosponsor of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (S.397), which would prevent unwarranted lawsuits against manufacturers or sellers firearms and ammunition for damages resulting from the unlawful use of their products.  
 This legislation was introduced today by Sens. Larry Craig (R-ID) and Max Baucus (D-MT). 
   "Manufacturers and sellers acting within the law should not be held responsible for the actions of criminals who misuse their products," said Snowe. "Firearms are legal products, and I do not believe gun makers and sellers should be subject to lawsuits that seek to shift the blame for crime off of criminals and onto legitimate businesses." 
   If enacted, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act will prohibit lawsuits against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm or ammunition, or a trade association, for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition. The bill would also require that pending lawsuits brought by shooting victims and municipalities under such legal theories be dismissed. The bill also ensures that valid lawsuits may still go forward against firearms manufacturuers, such as suits for knowingly providing a firearm for the commission of a violent crime or drug trafficking, willful violations of the law, defective design, and breach of contract or warranty.
