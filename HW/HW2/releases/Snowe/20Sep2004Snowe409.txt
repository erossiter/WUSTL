SEN. SNOWE NOMINATES MAINER FOR ANNUAL 'CONGRESSIONAL ANGEL IN ADOPTION' AWARD
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) has nominated Bette Hoxie of Old Town to receive the 2004 "Congressional Angel in Adoption" award for her work on behalf of child welfare and adoption advocacy.  
 President of Adoption & Foster Families of Maine, Hoxie has personally adopted eight children that she has fostered. 
   "Throughout her 27 years of service, Bette has exemplified the spirit of this award through her selfless commitment to bettering the lives of children. She has not only shared her home with those less fortunate; she has dedicated her life to assisting others in the adoption system," said Senator Snowe. "It gives me great pleasure to provide such well-deserved recognition to Bette Hoxie." 
   There are currently more than 535,000 children in foster care in the United States and an estimated 50 million orphans worldwide. The Congressional Angels in Adoption Program raises public awareness of the various ways that individuals can assist children and families through adoption and the foster care system. 
   This Thursday, Hoxie will join with other national recipients at a ceremony in Washington, D.C.
