SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS URGE COLLEAGUES TO STRENGTHEN STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM PROGRAM BY INCLUDING INCOME ELIGIBLE PREGNANT WOMEN
  In a letter, Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins urge members of the Senate Finance Committee to consider policies that will strengthen the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) as the committee debates legislation to reauthorize this important program. In particular, Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins urge the committee to consider granting states the option to enroll income eligible pregnant women.  
   "SCHIP reauthorization will be one of the most important issues for children that we will consider during this session of Congress," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We are committed to continuing our nation's great progress in covering more uninsured needy children and we believe it is especially important that Congress provide states the ability to include eligible expectant mothers in the SCHIP program." 
   Under current law, coverage of pregnant women is permissible only through a federal waiver. SCHIP regulations do permit states to cover unborn children, making reimbursement available for prenatal, labor and delivery services. However, medically necessary postpartum care is not reimbursable with federal funds in a fee for service arrangement. Studies show women who do not receive postpartum care are at a greater risk for a variety of health complications that make it difficult for a mother to properly care for her infant.
