SEN. SNOWE PRAISES COMPLETION OF SOFTWOOD LUMBER AGREEMENT BETWEEN U.S., CANADA
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today applauded the signing of the Softwood Lumber Agreement between the United States and Canada by the United States Trade Representative Sue Schwab. The agreement would replace U.S. import duties with a combination of Canadian border taxes and quotas. The signing of this corrective agreement by Schwab and Canadian Trade Minister David Emerson today in Ottawa will be the final step in the compromise that will effectively bring an end to decades of litigation over the unfair subsidizing of the Canadian lumber industry by the government. Both sides hope the terms of the agreement are in place by October 1st, 2006.  
   "The agreement signed today in Ottawa is the final step in bringing to an end the nearly quarter century dispute our nation has had with the Canadian government over softwood lumber. This compromise recognizes the adverse effect unfairly subsidized, artificially under priced Canadian softwood lumber has had on the U.S. lumber industry and the millions of Americans who depend on its continued vitality. I applaud both sides and Ambassador Schwab in particular for their willingness to work toward a successful resolution," Snowe said. 
   Canada's International Trade Minister, David Emerson, had previously requested that roughly 300 companies from the Canadian lumber industry state their position on the proposed deal by the close of business August 21st. Substantial industry support of the agreement was needed before legislation was submitted to the Canadian Parliament due to the agreement's requirement that Canadian companies withdraw legal challenges to the United States' corrective duties. The agreement also calls for the U.S. to return $4 billion of the $5 billion paid in duties since 2002.
