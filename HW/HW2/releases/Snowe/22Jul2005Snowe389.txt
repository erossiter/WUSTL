SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $300,000 IN FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY COUNSELING CENTER
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) today announced that Community Counseling Center in Portland has received a $297,600 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  
 The funds will be used toward the Greater Portland Trauma Assistance Network for substance abuse and mental health services. 
   "The Community Counseling Center in Portland is a leading provider of aid for individuals in the greater Portland area who are dealing with emotional difficulties," said Senator's Snowe and Collins. "The federal funding provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be useful in supporting their efforts within the Portland community." 
   The Department of Health and Human Services is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. HHS works closely with state and local governments and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.
