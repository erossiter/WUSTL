SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR NORTHERN MAINE DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Community Development Initiative has awarded $90,083 in grant funds to the Northern Maine Development Commission (NMDC) in Presque Isle. The Rural Development funds will be used to provide Digital Video Training Modules for Local Planning Boards to discuss issues on development projects within small rural communities in Aroostook County.  
   "To be competitive in a global community, we must help ensure that Maine has access to funding that will enable us to utilize the technology of the 21st Century," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This grant money will help the NMDC bridge the gap between information and technology as it works to attract new businesses and development to the County." 
   The NMDC was established in 1967 and is a nonprofit organization that provides regional planning, economic and community development, business loans and packaging, geographic information system services, and small business counseling services to the northern Maine region. It is one of five economic development districts in the state of Maine, and one of 320 nationwide. NMDC works with federal, state, regional, and local partners to implement services and programs for all of northern Maine that make the most of the area's resources to build a healthy and diverse economy. Its service area includes 71 communities and 137 unorganized townships throughout Aroostook county and parts of Washington, Piscataquis, and Penobscot counties.
