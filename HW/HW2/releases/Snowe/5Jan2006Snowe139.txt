SEN. SNOWE SECURES MILLIONS IN DOD APPROPRIATIONS BILL TO BENEFIT MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) voted late last night for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which provides equipment and weapons for our troops, contains $100 million in defense funding that directly benefits Maine, and funds essential shipbuilding programs. Yesterday, a cloture motion on the bill failed by a vote of 56 to 44 due to the inclusion of a provision authorizing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), which was later removed. The Senate passed the Defense Appropriations bill by a vote of 93 to 0.  
   "The Defense Appropriations Bill provides equipment, weapons, and pay for our troops, and it was crucial that the Senate pass this legislation before adjourning for the year." said Snowe. "Over $100 million in funding was awarded to Maine in the bill the Senate passed last night, underscoring the role our state plays in keeping our country secure. The $716 million allocated to continue work on the Next Generation DD(X) Destroyer will be essential to preparing our military to face 21st century threats and sustaining America's industrial shipbuilding base, including the men and women of Bath Iron Works." 
   The Defense Appropriations bill provides $8.8 billion for shipbuilding, a substantial increase to the $5.6 billion that the administration requested for four ships - half as many vessels as were ordered with funds appropriated for Fiscal Year 2005. In addition to the $716 million for the DD(X) program, this legislation includes $50 million for Bath Iron Works (BIW) to modernize DDG destroyers in an effort to reduce crew size. The bill also contains $576.4 million for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy's newest surface combatant. The Navy announced in October that it will release $223,262,430 million to BIW for detail design and production of one LCS. 
   The Defense Appropriations bill includes funding for cancer research programs Snowe has consistently advocated, including: 
   * $127.5 million for Breast Cancer research within the Department of Defense. 
   * $10 million for Ovarian Cancer Research Program with in the Department of Defense - The DoD Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OCRP) is making a significant contribution to the advancement of ovarian cancer research and the understanding of this terrible disease. This funding will be used to develop an important breakthrough in developing the first ovarian cancer screening test and further research into ovarian cancer more broadly. 
   * $10 million for prostate cancer research - This funding will be used to conduct prostate cancer research through the DOD's Medical Research Program for prostate cancer. The DoD Prostate Cancer Research Program (PCRP) mirrors the highly successful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency by awarding grants where unique opportunities present themselves - often falling beyond the reach of broad programs managed by other federal agencies. 127.5 million for Breast Cancer research within the Department of Defense, ovarian 10 million, prostate 80 million
