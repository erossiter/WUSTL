SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS FOR MAINE PRIORITIES IN DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today lauded Senate passage of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Defense Authorization bill, which includes critical funding for the state of Maine and in support of America's troops. The bill passed the Senate today by a vote of 96 to 0.
   "This defense authorization bill includes essential funding for the state of Maine," said Snowe. "I'm pleased that we have included $3.4 billion for the construction of two DD(X) Next Generation Destroyers that are critical to our national defense and the economic health of our state. I vow to do everything in my power to ensure that this funding is maintained when this legislation goes to conference with the House."
   The following is funding that Snowe fought for inclusion in the bill for the State of Maine: 
   * The bill fully funds the President's FY07 budget request of $3.4 billion for the DD(X) program: $2.6 billion in shipbuilding funding and $793.9 million in research and continued development funding. This allows the construction of the first two DD(X)'s to proceed at both Bath Iron Works (BIW) and Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi.
   * $840.0 million for the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program, which includes work for a construction team led by BIW. BIW is leading one of the two teams buiding the LCS ship. 
   * $25.0 million for BIW's DDG-51 Modernization Program
   * $9.6 million for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Drydock Waterfront Support Facility 
   * $12.9 million for the Mk47 Mod 0 Striker automatic grenade launcher and $5 million for the M2E2 Enhanced .50 Cal Machine Gun Kit for the Marine Corps produced at GD-Saco Defense of Saco.
   * The bill includes additional funding of $660 million above the President's budget request to allow the Air Force to purchase two additional C-17 Globemaster III aircraft and $2 billion for the F-22A Raptor aircraft. The North Berwick Pratt and Whitney plant builds the F119 engine for the F-22A aircraft and will perform some of the work on the C-17 engines. 
   * $5.0 million to Maine Marine Manufacturing of East Boothbay, Hodgdon Yachts of Boothbay Harbor, and the University of Maine to deliver the composite Mk V.1 craft to support the Special Operations missions.
   * $4.0 million to Applied Thermal Sciences (ATS) of Sanford for the advancement of the Small Watercraft Propulsion watercraft that could serve to safeguard ports and harbors against terrorist threats and provide escorts to large Navy ships during refueling and port operations. 
   * $3.0 million for New England Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative. This project assists small- and medium-sized manufacturers to successfully obtain contracts to supply equipment and products to the Department of Defense. 
   * $2.8 million for Global Relief Technologies of Portsmouth to implement the Rapid Data Management System capability for expeditiously disseminating information to deployed U.S. Southern Command personnel during specialized military or humanitarian relief missions. 
   * $2.5 million to Howe & Howe of North Berwick for the Unmanned Ground Vehicle weaponization program. This is the world's fastest dual-tracked vehicle that enables troops to find and remove Improvised Explosive Devices before being exposed to them.
   * $2.5 million to Portland Valve of South Portland to replace current relief valves on board Navy ships with Portland Valve's "smart" valve, which is highly accurate, responds quickly to demands, is reliable and durable, and resistant to harsh conditions. 
   * $2.4 million for Wilcox Industries of Portsmouth for procurement of the Helmet Mount Track System that enhances the current capability of the already-fielded Night Vision Goggles and helmet used by Naval special warfare forces. 
   * $2.0 million to the University of Maine for the University's Army Center of Excellence to design and test lightweight ballistic panel tent inserts made from composite materials that include ballistic fibers and wood elements, and to continue work on rigidified airbeam shelters and airbeam design manual. 
   * $2.0 million for the high performance brush program at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to accelerate the transition and installation of Metal Fiber Brushes in a wide-array of submarine applications, including ship service turbine generators in all classes of submarines.
   * $2.0 million for Vicus Technologies of Eastport for the Low Cost Avionics program to to demonstrate defense avionic system standards using proven commercial, open architecture design methodology.
   * $2.0 million for Technology Solutions Inc (TSI) of Brunswick for a Visually Integrated Bridge System for the integration of digital technology into all facets of a vessels bridge to enhance maritime navigation, operational security and harbor defense.
   * $1.5 million to Telford Aviation of Bangor for continued work on Lighter-Than-Air unmanned vehicle technologies in order to offer troops the ability to rapidly and reliably provide aerial support in areas with little or no transportation infrastructure.
    * $1.0 million for the Sorelle Group of Wells to develop a Pregnancy Recovery Education Program for military women and spouses about their physical recovery and potential serious illnesses they may encounter in the first year after giving birth.
   Snowe hailed components of the bill that are essential to the protection and care of our nation's fighting men and women and veterans. 
   For the protection of ground forces, the bill includes a $950.5 million increase, including $559.8 million for up-armored Humvees, and $100 million for vehicles to counter improvised explosive devices, the greatest cause of U.S. casualties in Iraq. It also sets aside $2.1 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund to advance development of new technologies and tactics, and $45.8 million for various IED countermeasure technologies.
   "I am pleased that the Senate included critical funding for one of the deadliest threats against our soldiers in Iraq - IEDs," said Snowe. "We must do everything in our power to protect our troops and believe this funding is one of accomplishing that goal."
   The bill also overturned unpopular Pentagon plans to increase TRICARE healthcare enrollment fees for many military retirees. The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to carry out a full audit of DOD health care costs, including comparisons of the Administration's proposed fee increases with increases in federal civilian health insurance fees.
   "At a time when more and more Americans have fought bravely for our nation, it would have been unconscionable if we in the Senate had maintained fee increases for TRICARE enrollment," said Snowe. "I'm pleased we did the right thing in this legislation by stopping these unfair increases."
   The bill repeals provisions of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) that require offset of military retirement annuity payments by amounts received for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, and authorizes acceleration of the effective date of the "paid up" provision from October 1, 2008 to October 1, 2006 for retirees who reach age 70 and have paid SBP premiums for 30 years. Sen. Snowe is a co-sponsor of the underlying bill, S. 185.
   Snowe also supported a provision to combat Traumatic Brain Injury, which is being called the signature injury of the Iraq war. The blast from improvised explosive devices can jar the brain, causing bruising or permanent damage. According to a recent USA Today story, almost 30% of the patients admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center have brain injuries. This amendment would add Traumatic Brain Injury to the post-deployment physical and mental health screenings that is mandated in the bill.
   "A survey by the Brain Injury Center shows that about 10% of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffered a concussion during their combat tour and doctors fear that thousands of others go undiagnosed," said Snowe. "I'm pleased that a provision has been included that I support for increased screenings against this tragic injury."
   Snowe also fought for the inclusion of several other critical provisions that were included in the bill:
   PURPLE HEART FOR PRISONERS OF WAR:
   Snowe also successfully fought for the inclusion of an amendment that would honor those American soldiers who have died in captivity. The provision requires the President to review the current circumstances establishing eligibility for the Purple Heart and advises Congress on modifications to the criteria for the Purple Heart award. It requires the Defense Department to report to the Congress on the advisability of modifying the criteria for award of the Purple Heart no later than March 1, 2007. 
   "In rightful honor of all our prisoners of war, I am that this amendment was accepted to the Defense Authorization bill to bestow the Purple Heart upon those Americans who perished while held in captivity," said Snowe. "These Americans fought for our nation and died at the hands of our enemy. They and their families have earned this honor. It is my strong belief that all prisoners of war who die in captivity should be eligible for the Purple Heart."
   FREE CREDIT CHECK/FRAUD MONITORING FOR VETERANS: 
   Snowe also cosponsored an amendment by Senator George Allen (R-VA) that was accepted to the underlying bill that would help provide free financial protection to the 26.5 million veterans and active duty military personnel whose personal data and Social Security Information was stolen from the home of a Veterans Administration (VA) employee in May of this year.
   "Four of the past five years, the VA has received an "F" from the inspector general for its security practices. As a direct result, the VA did nothing to correct the problem and has lost the personal information of 26.5 million veterans and 2.2 million active duty military, Guard and Reserve members," said Snowe. "Now the Congress is acting by protecting our veterans with the financial protections of those veterans whose personal information has been stolen from the VA. Our veterans have fought for our security, now we in Congress must be ever vigilant in protecting theirs."
   Under the provision, the VA will be required to contract with a private sector firm which will provide credit monitoring and data theft protection services to veterans and members of the armed forces, including members of the National Guard. In order to ensure that the government only provides coverage to those who are impacted by the loss of the VA data, veterans and military personnel will have to opt in to the service. It also gives the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the option to provide the credit services at a discounted low fixed price for veterans or the Secretary can choose to have the federal government pay for the service in total.
