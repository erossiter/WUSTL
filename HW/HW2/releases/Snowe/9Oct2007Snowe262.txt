SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES MAINE STATE SEN. PAULA BENOIT, 2007 RECIPIENT OF ANGELS IN ADOPTION AWARD
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met yesterday with Maine State Senator Paula Benoit of Phippsburg, this year's recipient of the Angels in Adoption Award. Senator Snowe nominated Benoit, who sponsored and successfully passed a bill in the Maine Legislature that allows adult adoptees to access their original unaltered birth certificate, making Maine the eighth state to enact such a law.  
   "As a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, I was truly honored to meet with State Senator Paula Benoit, and congratulate her on this well-earned accolade," said Senator Snowe. "Paula was rightly recognized for her sponsorship and bipartisan leadership of legislation, which is now the law in Maine, allowing adult adoptees access to their original birth certificate starting in 2009." 
   "The fact that State Senator Benoit spearheaded this landmark measure in only her freshman year in the state legislature speaks volumes about her dedication and skill as a public servant. Moreover, her actions represent an inspired combination of transparency and truth that together will profoundly improve and enrich the lives of Maine's foster children and orphans for years to come. This recognition is a fitting tribute to a most-deserving recipient." 
   Thursday evening, State Senator Benoit attended the 2007 Angels in Adoption Gala held at the Ronald Reagan Building where the 2007 award recipients were honored. 
   The "Angels in Adoption" program is the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Issues' signature public awareness program which provides an opportunity for Members of Congress to honor the good work of their constituents who have enhanced the lives of foster children and orphans.
