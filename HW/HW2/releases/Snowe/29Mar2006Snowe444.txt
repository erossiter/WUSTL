SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANDREW CARD STEPPING DOWN AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement today on Andrew Card stepping down as White House Chief of Staff:  
   Andy Card has served the President and our nation tirelessly and with great distinction through some of the darkest and most challenging days in American history. It is no wonder he nearly became the longest serving presidential chief of staff ever, and indeed he engendered the ultimate trust of two presidents during a tenure that exemplifies what is best about public service. 
   I have been privileged to call Andy a friend for over a quarter-century, and I wish him all the best as he prepares to embark on a new chapter in his life. He was always willing to listen and communicate, and he is an exceptional person who will be missed. 
   I look forward to working with Josh Bolton, who I have also known for many years, in advancing those issues that will make a difference in the everyday lives of Americans during these extraordinary and transformational times.
