CRITICAL TAX LEGISLATION PASSES CONGRESS
Late last night, the United States Senate passed tax legislation that is vital to America's working families. If the Congress had not acted in the final hours of this legislative session, these tax provisions would have expired at great expense to American tax payers. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, the committee that has jurisdiction over the nation's tax policy, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) pressed to have the New Markets Tax Credit, the $4,000 college tuition deduction and several energy conservation tax incentives included in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. 
 "In the closing hours of the 109th Congress, we passed a massive tax bill that includes several essential provisions for hard-working Americans. It is unfortunate it took this long to extend these critical tax provisions when we could have passed them this summer," said Snowe. "Yet, this bill includes several provisions that I have long championed that are important for Maine and America, including extending the $4,000 tuition deduction, the New Markets Tax Credit to help rural areas, and energy efficiency tax credits to lessen our reliance of foreign imported oil."  
 Below is a list of those tax provisions that Snowe authored that were set to expire: 
 * Snowe joined Senate Finance Committee colleague, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), in pushing to ensure that the above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses to allow families help defray the cost of college tuition was included in the bill. 2.7 million taxpayers in Maine and the country benefited from the $4,000 deduction in 2004. 
 * Snowe introduced the extension of new markets tax credit and modification for rural counties. The new markets tax credit's innovative approach uses the tax code to encourage long-term capital investments in downtrodden communities identified by the census as historically plagued by high unemployment, low levels of private investment and stifling poverty rates. In Maine, the NMTC has helped bring much needed investment dollars to struggling rural communities. The Credit, for example, enabled two pulp and paper mills owned by the Great Northern Paper Company in the Katahdin Forest area to stay in business and modernize, resulting in the direct employment of 650 people. 
 * Snowe also secured the extension of three energy efficiency provisions that she authored through 2008 that were set to expire at the end of 2007. An extension of deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings, a credit for new energy efficient homes and a credit for residential energy efficient property. These provisions were a part of the EFFECTER Act that Snowe authored with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that were included in the 2005 Energy bill. 
 Snowe also supported the following provisions: 
 * Extension of the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit and expansion to enhance alternative methods of determining the credit. 
 * Extension and expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for hiring individuals who face barriers to employment - and combination of the credit with the Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit in 2007. 
 * Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit for hiring individuals who have received public assistance for an extended period of time - and combination with the WOTC in 2007. 
 * Treating combat pay as earned income for purposes of the earned income credit calculation. 
 * Above-the-line deduction for out-of-pocket teacher classroom expenses. 
 * Expensing of brownfields remediation costs. In addition to the extension, the definition of a contaminated site is expanded to include sites contaminated by petroleum products.
