SEN. SNOWE'S BILL PROVIDES SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS REGULATORY RELIEF
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today introduced the Regulatory Flexibility Reform Act of 2005, which would provide small business owners needed relief from burdensome federal regulations. Currently, regulations apply universally to both small-scale and large-scale entities, often disproportionately impacting small businesses.  
   "Federal regulations do not exist in a vacuum - they have real world effects on small businesses and their employees," said Snowe. "We should not make rules without regard to the size of a business or the unique circumstances of the industry in which it competes. My legislation recognizes that federal regulations must take into account the diversity of America's 25 million small businesses and their limited ability to cope with sweeping regulations." 
   The Regulatory Flexibility Reform Act of 2005 (RFRA) would amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) to ensure complete analysis of the potential impacts on small businesses and provide these entities with much needed regulatory relief. Federal agencies have failed to recognize or address this problem in the past. The RFRA would spur Federal agencies to properly consider and execute their RFA obligations and responsibilities. 
   "Small businesses are the engine of our economy, so it is crucial that Federal agencies consider the economic impact of their regulations on this dynamic sector," said Snowe. "In the past, small businesses have been overlooked even when the negative effects of new rules were easily foreseeable - this bill will help ensure we do not make the same mistakes in the future." 
   The Regulatory Flexibility Reform Act would: 
   * Include "indirect" economic effects under RFA analyses. Regulations on a larger industry can eventually trickle down, ultimately and unintentionally impacting small businesses. This affects small businesses' viability and ability to compete in the marketplace. Indirect economic effects often bear a significant impact on a substantial number of small business owners, both in Maine and across the country. 
   * Require agencies to respond to comments filed by the Chief Counsel of the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. This reform would ensure that Federal agencies give the proper deference to comments submitted by the Office of Advocacy, and hence, to the comments and concerns of small businesses. 
   * Require agencies to conduct periodic review of existing rules that impact small business. Agencies would review all 10-year-old rules annually. This reform eliminates the confusion over which rules to review and when to review them. Annual regulatory reviews would help eliminate the barriers to economic growth faced by small business owners.
