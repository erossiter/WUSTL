SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $115,000 FOR JUSTICE PROGRAMS IN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $115,473 in total federal funding to two state justice programs including the gang resistance program implemented by the Lewiston Police Department.  
 These federal grants are awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice.
   "These federal funds are critical to providing adequate response and counseling to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Additionally, the ongoing efforts of the Lewiston Police Department to discourage youth participation in gang activity must have the necessary resources to be successful." 
   The federal grants were allocated as follows: 
   * $74,373 to the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault for the State Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Coalition Programs, which seeks to support member rape crisis centers through funding, training and technical assistance, and public awareness.
   * $41,100 to the Lewiston Police Department for their Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program, which is a life-skills competency program designed to provide students with the skills they need to avoid gang pressure and youth violence.
