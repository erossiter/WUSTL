WORLD'S LARGEST 'SNOWWOMAN' NAMED AFTER MAINE SEN. SNOWE
  In 1999, Bethel, Maine, set a Guinness World Record by building a snowman - named Angus King of the Mountain after former Maine Governor Angus King - that was 113 feet, 7 inches tall. This year, the town has broken its own record by building a 122-foot and one-inch SnowWoman that was officially named "Olympia SnowWoman" at a dedication held this morning in Bethel. 
   "I have to say I've joked that it's just my luck I'd have a world record breaking monument named after me - and it will be gone by summer," Senator Snowe said. "Yet another reason for me to keep up the fight against global climate change, I guess! Although, judging by the size of it, it might easily make it well into August!"
   Senator Snowe added, "In all seriousness, this SnowWoman is far more than just her impressive height with her many layers representing the layers of the community that has come together to create this extraordinary site. At a height of more than 122 feet, each layer is packed with collective inspiration that breaks all records. That's why it was necessary and critical that area businesses and local crafters alike forge a bond to help add just the right finishing touches to make the SnowWoman come alive - and certainly they have made that dream a reality."
