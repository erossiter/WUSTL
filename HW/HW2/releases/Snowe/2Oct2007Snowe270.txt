SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $2.1 MILLION IN FEMA FUNDING FOR CANTON
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded $2,157,678 in funding to assist Canton, Maine in acquiring and demolishing structures that repeatedly flood. The award is part of FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program. Canton was awarded $3.9 million by FEMA in 2005 for the acquisition and removal of 35 structures.  
   "This critical funding will help the flood-prone town of Canton prepare for and prevent damage in the wake of major flooding," said Senator Snowe. "I am pleased to see the Canton community receive this federal funding that will help our state prepare for future emergencies." 
   The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program provides funds to states, territories, Indian tribal governments, communities, and universities for hazard mitigation planning and the implementation of mitigation projects prior to a disaster event. Funding these plans and projects reduces overall risks to the population and structures, while also reducing reliance on funding from actual disaster declarations.
