SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $8.6 MILLION IN USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AND LOANS FOR MAINE PROJECTS
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development (USDA-RD) program has allocated more than $8.6 million in federal funding for projects in Maine. 
   "The USDA Rural Development program is helping us upgrade Maine's infrastructure, rebuild educational facilities, enhance public safety and improve local economic development," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This funding will be used to fund projects critical to improving the quality of life of thousands of Mainers."  
   The Senators announced USDA-RD funding for the following Maine projects: 
   * $350,000 in Direct and Guaranteed Loans for the York County Shelter Programs, Inc. 
   Rural Development will be leveraging $300,000 in direct loan funds and will be partnering with Kennebunk Savings Bank for the $50,000 Guaranteed Loan. The funds will be used to construct a two story, eight single room occupancy residential facility at 147 Shaker Hill Road, in Alfred. The facility will provide housing for eight single adults, a staff office, and a common living room. The requested assistance will allow for improved and expended services for the homeless. According to Rural Development, four new jobs created and thirty-five saved.
   * $1,000,000 in Direct and Guaranteed Loans for Northern Maine Medical Center 
   Funds will be used to construct a 10-bed addition to Forest Hill Manor for skilled nursing. There is a high demand for skilled rehabilitation in the area. Also included in the project is renovation of the kitchen and nurses station.
   * $50,000 Grant for the Fairbanks School Neighborhood Association 
   Rural Development funds will be used to help with the reconstruction of the Fairbanks School building that was destroyed by fire. The reconstructed building will be used for a community center and area food pantry. This grant will be for the additional costs associated with the project after the bid openings.
   * $127,000 Direct Loan to the Town of Franklin
   Rural Development funds will be used to replace existing water mains for the Town of Franklin serving 187 customers (171 residential). Leveraged funds are pending from Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) totaling $378,000. 
   * $6,500,000 Community Facility Direct Loan to the City of Brewer
   Funds will be used to construct a 30,000 square foot public safety facility that will house both the fire and police departments. The existing public safety building located on South Main Street was constructed in the 50's and is extremely undersized to meet the current public safety program. In addition, the new location on Parkway South will allow police and fire to respond quickly to all parts of the city. The City employs 41 people in their fire and police departments.
   * $100,000 in Community Facility Loan and Grant Funds for Three Rivers Ambulance Service in Piscataquis County
   A $56,000 direct loan and a $44,000 grant have been allocated to Three Rivers Ambulance Service for the purchase of a new ambulance. The ambulance is needed to provide reliable services to the citizens of Milo, Brownville, Lake View, Medford, Lagrange and unorganized territories in Piscataquis County. Six jobs will be saved. 
   * $545,000 Community Facility Direct Loan to Habitat for Humanity / 7 Rivers Maine, Inc.
   Rural Development funds will be used to purchase and renovate a facility at 108 Centre Street, in Bath. The building will provide the needed space for their growth in services, materials, administrative space, and program needs for the low-income families. Three new jobs are to be created and four saved.
