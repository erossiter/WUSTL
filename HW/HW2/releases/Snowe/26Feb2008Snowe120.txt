FINANCE COMMITTEE HEARING HIGHLIGHTS IMPACTS THAT NEW MEDICAID REGULATIONS WILL HAVE ON STATES
  The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing this morning examining "State Economic Conditions," that included testimony from Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano. U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a senior member of the Finance Committee, questioned Governor Napolitano about the impact that new Medicaid regulations could have on states. 
   "This is the wrong time to impose regulations that will shift additional financial burdens to states that cannot afford it," Senator Snowe noted. "Rather than identifying ways we can work more efficiently and better serve those who rely on Medicaid - including children in foster care and the disabled - I fear that the regulations will cause them to fall through the cracks."
   In responding to Senator Snowe, Governor Napolitano confirmed the broad impact that the new Medicaid regulations will have, declaring that "there is no state that those regulations do not harm." 
   In addition to the effect that the new regulations would have on beneficiaries, Senator Snowe expressed concern that the efforts of the Administration to eliminate Medicaid funding for training of physicians will compromise future access to care, noting that one in three Mainers rely on access to Medicare or Medicaid providers.
   "The impact of cutting Medicaid support for Graduate Medical Education (GME) comes on top of reduced Medicare GME support and simply exacerbates an erosion in access to care," Senator Snowe warned. "Rural states such as Maine are particularly vulnerable, as these programs are crucial not just to training, but also to recruiting new physicians to our state."
