SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITION TROOPS TO IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on the Pentagon calling up an additional 47,000 troops for deployment in Iraq:  
   "We must provide the commander on the ground, General John Abizaid, with the resources he requires to accomplish the mission of securing our forces while we transition sovereignty to the Iraqi people. Certainly our thoughts and most profound appreciation will go with those men and women who are answering the call. 
   "I understand these additional troops that Secretary Rumsfeld activated today will include replacements for those whose tours have been extended in Iraq. These troops have gone above and in their service to our nation. 
   "At the same time we remain committed to the mission in Iraq and provide the necessary military resources, we owe it to those soldiers serving overseas to bring them home as quickly as possible to let them enjoy the blessings of home and family that they have so rightly earned."
