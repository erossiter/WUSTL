SEN. SNOWE JOINS CONGRESSIONAL DAIRY FARMER CAUCUS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today joined the Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus. The purpose of the Dairy Farmer Caucus is to provide a bipartisan forum, involving both House and Senate members, to collaborate on issues of interest to dairy producers nationwide.  
   "I am excited to join the dairy farmer caucus in order to have a greater opportunity to communicate the concerns of the dairy industry to my colleagues," said Snowe. "As a longtime supporter of Maine animal agriculture, I have consistently kept the interests of dairy farmers in mind when crafting legislation. I pledge to continue my support for our nation's venerable dairy industry through my new position on this caucus."
   The Dairy Farmer Caucus is co-chaired by Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on the Senate side, and by Representatives Devin Nunes (R-CA), Collin Peterson (D-MN), Rick Larsen (D-WA), and Randy Kuhl (R-NY) on the House side. The Chairs are now seeking other members of the Senate and House to join the caucus to become more active on dairy issues. 
   The Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus seeks to build upon the unity that the U.S. dairy producer community has developed on many issues over the past few years. It provides an organized group to address issues of importance to dairy producers and dairy producer families, a goal that will be particularly important as Congress begins to write the next Farm Bill.
