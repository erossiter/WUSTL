SEN. SNOWE VOICES SUPPORT FOR DETAINEE LEGISLATION AGREEMENT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement today in response to the announcement that an agreement has been reached between the Administration and the U.S. Senate over proposed legislation that will govern the treatment and interrogation of terrorist suspects.  
   "Yesterday's agreement reached between the Senate and the Administration maintains the moral standing of the United States and simultaneously ensures our Intelligence Community has the tools it needs to effectively prosecute the war on terror. I supported Senators Warner, McCain and Graham's proposal last week because we cannot underestimate the impact our actions and standards of conduct have on the international community. What is accomplished in this agreement is in keeping with our international obligations as expressly outlined in the Geneva Conventions. This legislation gives our CIA. officers the guidance and protection they need to detain and interrogate terrorist suspects and ensures the safety of the American people while respecting and renewing our commitment to Common Article 3."
