SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS SEEK TO EXPAND AROOSTOOK COUNTY EMPOWERMENT ZONE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today introduced legislation that will modify the borders of the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone to include the entire county.  
   "Empowerment zones are critical to help ensure future economic prosperity in rural Maine and other struggling communities," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The current restriction that the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone be limited to 1,000 square miles prevents all of Aroostook's small rural communities from benefiting from this tremendous program. Including the entire County in the Empowerment Zone will guarantee that parts of it will not be left behind as economic prosperity returns to the area." 
   In 2002, Aroostook County was designated an Empowerment Zone based on its population losses and they formed the Aroostook Partnership for Progress to spearhead their Empowerment Zone strategy, initiatives and projects. Since its formation, the Partnership for Progress has steadfastly dedicated their time and resources to create a projected 1,500 new jobs and collaborated with other area economic development efforts to ensure Aroostook's continuing growth.
