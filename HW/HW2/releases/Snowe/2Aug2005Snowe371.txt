SEN. SNOWE EXPLORES WHETHER NAVY WOULD RESTATE CASE FOR BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION AT AUG. 10 HEARING
  During a phone conversation today with the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert Willard today, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) explored whether the Navy would consider restating the case against closure of the Brunswick Naval Air Station at the next Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission hearing that is scheduled to take place on August 10th in Washington, DC. 
   "Today, I spoke with Admiral Willard to explore whether the Navy would restate the case against the closure of the Brunswick Naval Air Station at the August 10th hearing in Washington. In fact less than two weeks ago, Admiral Willard rejected a closure argument when he testified to the BRAC Commission on July 19th," said Snowe. "I am pleased that Admiral Willard and I share the same conviction - Brunswick Naval Air Station is an essential component of our homeland security efforts. I appreciate his taking the time to speak with me today and that he reiterated that the Navy recognizes Brunswick's homeland security value today and is committed to maintaining it in the future." 
   On Wednesday, July 27th, Snowe also spoke with Admiral John B. Nathman, U.S. Fleet Forces Command Commander, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. During the conversation, Nathman told Snowe that the Fleet Forces Command (CFFC) supports Brunswick Naval Air Station's homeland defense role.
