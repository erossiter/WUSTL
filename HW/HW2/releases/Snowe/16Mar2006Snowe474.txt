SEN. SNOWE AMENDMENT WOULD GIVE SENIORS MORE TIME
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution with Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) which would give seniors more time to sign up for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit and provide more flexibility for beneficiaries to change plans. With more than 40 plans to choose from and significant problems with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's (CMS) signup services, seniors in Maine, Florida, and across the country deserve more time to decide what kind of prescription drug coverage is right for them.  
   "Seniors in Maine are concerned they might make the wrong decision in choosing a plan and that the drugs offered by their plan will not cover the drugs they need," said Snowe. "It is absolutely imperative that seniors who depend on Medicare prescription drug coverage do not end up paying premiums for plans that are not right for them. Our amendment represents an opportunity to alleviate much of their concern and make sure the new drug benefit starts on the right foot, and I encourage my colleagues to support it." 
   Snowe's amendment is based on the Medicare Drug Benefit Protections Act of 2005, which extends the initial six-month period for enrolling in a plan from May 15, 2006, to December 31, 2006, thus delaying late enrollment penalties until 2007 and giving beneficiaries all of 2006 to decide whether to enroll in a Medicare drug benefit plan. Once beneficiaries have enrolled in a plan, the bill provides a one-time opportunity during 2006 to change to another plan without penalty, should they wish to do so.
