SEN. SNOWE PROVISION REGARDING PROPER MANAGEMENT OF SURPLUS VESSELS INCLUDED IN COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION BILL
  A provision authored by U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) that would regulate legislative conveyance of surplus U.S. vessels to organizations outside of the federal government was included in the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2008 that passed unanimously out of Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Thursday.  
   Senator Snowe introduced the Vessel Conveyance Act (S. 1632) in June after learning of a situation in which Congress awarded two surplus Coast Guard ships to a California charity. The ships were supposed to be used for humanitarian purposes, but both were sold by the charity almost immediately because it couldn't afford to maintain them. Perhaps most troubling to Senator Snowe was that until this issue was raised in the media, the Coast Guard believed the ships were still owned by the charity and being used as the legislation intended. Senator Snowe's provision would create standards for legislative vessel conveyances, namely it would require the agency relinquishing the ship to acquire and keep records of the recipient's financial solubility; mandate that a vessel, once transferred from the federal government, could not be sold or used for any purpose other than what was intended without consent; and would establish civil penalties for improper use or unsanctioned sale. The provision would not impact vessels that go through the Federal government's standard, non-legislative process for disposing of surplus assets. 
   "There are instances in which it makes sense to turn over a vessel no longer needed by the Federal government to a worthy recipient. But the government is not in the business of singling out specific charities for cash donations, as was as was the result of the conveyance of the White Holly and the White Sage," Senator Snowe said. "By requiring Federal oversight of legislative conveyances both before and after they occur, we will close the loophole that allowed these vessels to be misused without repercussions." 
   The legislation also authorizes $8.4 billion for the U.S. Coast Guard in the 2008 fiscal year. This includes $998 million for renovations to facilities and acquisition of new aircraft and vessels. The measure increases the Coast Guard's operating budget by six percent. Additional highlights of the legislation are: 
   *Increasing criminal penalties to anyone who participates in the smuggling of illegal alien smuggling in the maritime environment; 
   * Requiring the Coast Guard to keep the LORAN-C navigation system operating until authorized by statute to cease operating the system; 
   * Improving the quality of life for servicemen and women through reimbursement of medical-related travel expenses, legal assistance, and emergency leave.
