SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS FOR PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today voted for legislation introduced by Sen.  
 Robert Byrd (D-WV) which would amend the FY 2006 Budget Resolution to include $1.4 billion in funding to preserve our nation's intercity passenger rail system. This amendment failed by a vote of 46 to 52. 
   "For states like Maine, where our rail system provides an economic link to other parts of the country, cuts to Amtrak funding could be devastating," said Snowe. "Although Amtrak's supporters lost this battle in the Senate today, the struggle to provide passenger rail service with adequate funding is far from over. I have long fought to ensure that Amtrak would expand its operations with increased service to Maine. As such, I am gravely concerned by these cuts and as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, vow to explore every means possible to restore the needed funding." 
   The existing budget includes just $360 million for Amtrak in FY 2006, down from the $1.2 billion appropriated last year.
