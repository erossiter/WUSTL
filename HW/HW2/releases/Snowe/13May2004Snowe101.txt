SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEC DECISION TO DELAY 527 RULING
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement on the decision today by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) to delay a decision on the status of 527 organizations under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA):  
   "Today's decision by the FEC to defer a final decision on 527 groups means that their illegal campaign activities will go unpunished in this year's election cycle. Delaying a ruling by 90 days would effectively give these groups a free pass from complying with federal election laws in the 2004 campaigns. 
   "BCRA places limitations and transparency requirements upon organizations whose major purpose is to influence federal candidate elections. Internal Revenue Code Section 527, which existed long before the passage of BCRA, allows organizations whose primary purpose is political to make many federal income tax deductions. The object of this, of course, is to get people more involved in politics. It was not intended to be used as a loophole to avoid federal election laws. 
   "The FEC's response to this flagrant disregard for federal law has been lackluster at best. The Commission's unresponsiveness and deferral to close this loophole must be immediately rectified. I am committed to continuing to press for immediate action to safeguard the intent of BCRA only two years after it passed and less than six months after the Supreme Court up held the law."
