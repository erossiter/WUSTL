   "As we celebrate our nation's 55th inauguration today, we heard the President of the United States set a resolute tone and lay out a bold vision for our nation's future. As America faces a host of challenges in a changed world, I am confident that we will continue to rise to meet those challenges and seize upon new opportunities. Today, President Bush spoke to how our nation has become and will remain the brightest beacon of freedom in the world. Under his continued leadership, the United States will remain the single greatest force to protect liberty and fight tyranny both at home and abroad. 
   "This inauguration is not just an opportunity to celebrate our democratic tradition and reaffirm our institutions, but also to honor the service of our armed forces. We must remember that we owe the freedoms we hold dear to the dedication of those who give so much to our nation. To our troops serving in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, we offer our most heartfelt gratitude."
