ENERGY BILL PASSAGE MAJOR VICTORY FOR SEN. SNOWE'S LONGTIME PURSUIT OF HIGHER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS
  The Senate passed energy policy legislation Thursday night that included language sponsored by Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) to increase fuel economy standards for all vehicles, establish a federal price gouging law and promote energy efficiency goals of reducing gasoline use in America by nearly half by 2030. 
   For the first time since 1975, the Energy Bill would raise the fuel economy standards for all cars, trucks, SUVs by to 35 miles per gallon on average by 2020. The basis for the final language was the "10-in-10" legislation authored by Senator Snowe. She has been strongly advocating for an increase in the standards for the last 6 years.  
   "This will move us towards finally making substantive changes in CAF? standards for the first time in a generation. That both parties would come together to chart a new energy policy is a landmark moment for this institution and frankly comes not a moment too soon," Senator Snowe said. "By increasing CAFE standards, our country is not only forming a foundation of energy security, but promoting a critical element in addressing climate change on the federal level. We've had the technology to make these advancements, but now we have the political willpower to finally achieve these goals and improve the future of our environment for generations to come." 
   The Energy Bill would also establish a federal price gouging law, setting civil penalties on those vendors who excessively raise prices for crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum products during a Presidential declaration of an energy emergency. 
   "This will once and for all establish a law that prevents the exploitation of consumers during a national emergency," Senator Snowe said of the language she cosponsored. "After Hurricane Katrina, we witnessed some instances of egregious injustice at the hands of vendors of gasoline. The action that occurred is unacceptable and this national price gouging law must be enacted to ensure that vendors will not take advantage of during future national disasters. I am pleased to have worked with Senator Cantwell to clarify the language to ensure that precisely defines price gouging and prevents honest small businesses selling gasoline from being subject to this statute." 
   The legislation also would improve energy efficiency standards for federal lighting and increases standards for all residential boilers, electric motors, refrigerators, clothes washers, and dishwashers. 
   "The Energy Bill recognizes that energy efficiency represents the most economical solution to our nation's energy crisis," said Senator Snowe. "As all Americans know, refrigerators, clothes washers, and dishwashers are indispensable and ubiquitous aspects of the fast-paced American life. Unfortunately, price increases for electricity has also been omnipresent in the United States, and especially acute in Maine. This measure will significantly improve the energy efficiency of our household appliances and keep more money in the pocket of America's households." 
   Senator Snowe, the Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, successfully added several provisions to the Energy Bill that are important for small businesses, including the many located in Maine. 
   The small business provisions would: 
   * Require the Small Business Administration (SBA) to implement within 90 days an energy efficiency program that was mandated in the 2005 Energy Policy Act; 
   * Allow small businesses conducting energy efficiency or renewable energy research and development to be given priority consideration in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs; 
   * Establish loans for small firms to invest in energy efficiency projects for their businesses; 
   * Create an audit program to increase energy efficiency using Small Business Development Centers; and 
   * Promote financing agreements between small businesses and utility companies to increase energy efficiency.
