SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR HOULTON BAND OF MALISEET INDIANS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded $125,242 to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for a Stop Violence Against Indian Women program.  
   "It is imperative that we do everything possible to end violence against women in our state," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "This grant will support a program that provides security, protection, and counseling to women in the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indian community." 
   The funds will be used for the STOP Violence Against Indian Women Discretionary Grant Program which assists Indian tribal governments in developing and strengthening tribal justice systems' responses to violent crimes committed against Indian women. The program creates strategies and innovative approaches to provide services to Indian women who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Its purpose is also to strengthen tribal law enforcement, prosecution efforts and tribal courts. 
   The United States Department of Justice aims to ensure fair and impartial administration, enforce the law, defend the interests, and promote justice for all Americans. They ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic and provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime.
