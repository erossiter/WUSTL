SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $175,000 FOR WEED AND SEED PROGRAM IN CALAIS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that $175,000 has been awarded to The Calais Weed and Seed site from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  
 They will be using the grant to build a collaborative aimed at coordinating resources to prevent, control and reduce violent crime, drug abuse, and gang activity. 
   "We are so glad that the DOJ was able to award this funding to help encourage community involvement in crime prevention," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The funds will also be used to improve and revitalize Calais neighborhoods, thereby making the city better for all residents." 
   During the duration of this project, community policing goals will create a collaborative of residents and law enforcement officials to raise the level of citizen involvement in crime prevention and increase positive interactions between the two groups. Prevention, intervention, and treatment goals will provide enrichment activities for youth, expand drug treatment options, and enhance prevention education. Neighborhood restoration goals will work towards the revitalization and improvement of the Calais physical environment. 
   The United States Department of Justice aims to ensure fair and impartial administration, enforce the law, defend the interests, and promote justice for all Americans. They ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic and provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime.
