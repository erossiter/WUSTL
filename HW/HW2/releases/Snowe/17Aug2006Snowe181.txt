SEN. SNOWE SPEAKS WITH NAVY SECRETARY WINTER ABOUT MAINTAINING ROBUST WORKLOAD AT KITTERY-PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD
  Citing the unrivaled workforce and performance at the Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (KPNSY), Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) urged the Secretary of the Navy Donald Winter to ensure that the workload is evenly shared across all of the nation's shipyards. Snowe spoke with Secretary Winter yesterday as part of an ongoing series of discussions she is having with the Secretary concerning Navy activities in the State.  
   "It is beyond question that the workforce at the Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is second to none. It is the most efficient yard in the country providing immense budgetary savings at a time of increasingly tight federal budgets," said Snowe. "That is the message I sent to Secretary Winter. It is in the best interest of the Navy and the nation to ensure a balanced workload across all of the Navy public shipyards. I asked Secretary Winter to personally assess the current and future workload at KPNSY, because it is the gold standard workers with their irreplaceable skills and talents that have driven the unrivalled performance of this yard."
