MAINE DELEGATION MEET WITH GOV. BALDACCI, COMMUNITY GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF MAINE'S MILITARY FACILITIES
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME), Rep.  
 Tom Allen (D-ME) and Michael Michaud (D-ME), and Gov. John Baldacci met today with representatives of community groups in support of Maine's military facilities, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) and Brunswick Naval Air Station (BNAS). 
   "Today's meeting was an opportunity for us to coordinate our efforts to advocate on behalf of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Brunswick Naval Air Station," said the delegation in a joint statement. "We will continue to educate Pentagon decision makers about both facilities' critical value to national security. Portsmouth is the most efficient, most productive and most innovative Shipyard in the nation as acknowledged by the Navy itself. Brunswick stands alone as the only remaining fully capable active-duty military airfield in the northeastern United States and near its coastal cities. With the announcement of the BRAC list coming within the next few weeks, we remain steadfast in our unified commitment to preserve both installations." 
   The delegation met with Paul O'Connor and Captain Bill McDonough of the Seacoast Shipyard Association supporting PNSY, Brunswick Task Force Chairman Rick Tetrev supporting BNAS, and Elmer Harmon of Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station (NCTS) Cutler.
