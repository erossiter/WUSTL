SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS TO REDUCE PHONE RATES FOR ARMED FORCES OVERSEAS
Critical legislation that Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) co-sponsored to reduce phone rates for Armed Forces personnel deployed overseas passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. The Call Home Act of 2006, introduced by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK), requires the Federal Communications Commission to evaluate, encourage, and seek ways to decrease the costs of calls made by our troops serving abroad. Sen. Olympia Snowe is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that has jurisdiction of over the nation's telecommunications industry.  
 "The courageous men and women fighting overseas should not be burdened with costly phone rates when calling home," said Senator Snowe. "The legislation, which unanimously passed the Senate, will make it easier for troops to call home to speak with their loved ones. It is the very least we can do to repay the tremendous sacrifice our servicemen and women and their families make everyday for our nation." 
 The Call Home Act of 2006 requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to do the following: 
 * Evaluate and analyze the costs to Armed Forces personnel of such telephone calls to and from American military bases abroad; 
 * Evaluate methods of reducing the rates imposed on such calls, including deployment of new technology such as voice over internet protocol or other internet protocol technology; 
 * Encourage telecommunications carriers to adopt flexible billing procedures and policies for Armed forces personnel and their dependents for telephone calls; 
 * Seek agreements with foreign governments to reduce international surcharges on such telephone calls. 
 The legislation would prohibit the FCC from regulating rates in order to reduce costs and replace similar legislation from 1992 that limited the FCC's efforts to reduce rates in specific countries.
