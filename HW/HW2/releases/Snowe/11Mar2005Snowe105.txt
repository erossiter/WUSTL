SEN. SNOWE PLEASED BY COMMERCE COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO SAFEGUARD OCEANS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, Chair of Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, believes that today's Commerce Committee action has placed four pieces of ocean-related legislation on the fast track for full Senate consideration to safeguard our oceans. The following legislation was passed out of the Committee today, including Snowe's Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act (S. 361), the National Ocean Exploration Program Act (S. 39), the Marine Debris Research Prevention and Reduction Act (S. 362) and the Tsunami Preparedness Act (S. 50). 
   "Our oceans are not only an ecological treasure, but an economic asset that contributes billions of dollars to our world's economies. If we do not take steps now to safeguard our oceans, future generations will be unable to enjoy and make their livelihoods from this most critical natural resource," said Snowe. "Today's quick action by the Senate Commerce Committee to report out four pieces of ocean-related legislation, including my Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act, is indeed good news for those of us who are committed to moving our oceans to the forefront of congressional action. With Chairman Stevens' full support, it is my hope that this legislation will come to the floor of the Senate in an expeditious manner."  
   Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act: 
   "As a representative of a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I want to ensure that the citizens of Maine, and all coastal states, have the tools they need to monitor and assess what is happening off their shores," said Snowe. "The State of Maine has a strong and proud history rooted in our connection to the sea, as do other coastal states, and our coastal communities are highly dependent on the fisheries resources, coastal habitats, tourist destinations, safe harbors, and other essential services connected to the sea. This legislation is essential to our understanding and our ability to adapt to changing ocean conditions." 
   Among its provisions, the "Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act" would: 
   * Develop and maintain an integrated marine data monitoring and management system that provides for comprehensive and continuous ocean and coastal observations; 
   * Facilitate timely warnings to coastal communities about potentially hazardous ocean conditions, such as harmful algal blooms, detected by coastal and offshore buoys, satellites, and other ocean observing instruments; 
   * Coordinate state agencies' regional ocean observing systems' efforts regarding data measurement requirements, standards and protocols for quality control, and data management and planning activities; and 
   * Establish a research and development program to study the relationship between ocean conditions and human activities, develop new observation technologies, enhance security at US ports, and improve public education. 
   The National Ocean Exploration Program Act: 
   "Establishing a national program for ocean exploration and research will provide the necessary resources to produce groundbreaking oceanic discoveries," said Snowe. "With so much of the underwater environment still unexplored, there is great opportunity to further develop oceanographic research and expand our knowledge of the world's oceans." 
   The Senate Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which would administer the new program. In carrying out the program, the administrator of NOAA would conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey little known areas of the oceans and give priority attention to deep ocean regions, with a focus on surveying deep water marine systems that hold potential for important scientific and medical discoveries, such as hydrothermal vent communities and seamounts. The bill builds on recommendations from the final report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for a more robust and coordinated U.S. ocean exploration program. 
   In addition, the National Ocean Exploration Act would require NOAA to convene an ocean technology and infrastructure task force to develop and implement a strategy to: 
   * Facilitate the transfer of new exploration technology to the program. 
   * Improve the availability of communications infrastructure (including satellite) to the program. 
   * Develop a data management information processing system for information obtained under the program. 
   * Encourage cost-sharing partnerships to assist in transferring exploration technology and technical expertise to the program. 
   Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act: 
   This bill would lead to much needed improvements in our ocean habitats and coastal communities through various national and international initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of trash and other debris in coastal areas. 
   "Our oceans are under assault from a wide range of human-induced threats, one of which is marine debris," said Snowe. "Garbage in the marine environment is not only unsightly - it also threatens fish and wildlife habitat as well as human health and safety. As a coastal state Senator from a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I fully support the goals of this bill, which will lead to much needed improvements in our ocean habitats and coastal communities." 
   Tsunami Preparedness Act: 
   "The Tsunami Preparedness Act will act to not only safeguard our own citizens, but actively works to encourage greater coordination and cooperation internationally to better share information which is paramount in saving lives," said Snowe. "This is legislation that I believe will help mitigate against a future cataclysmic event like the one that took the lives of over 250,000 people through out South Asia." 
   Below are details of the Tsunami Preparedness Act: 
   * This bill directs NOAA to operate regional tsunami detection and warning systems in the Pacific Ocean region, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico region. The system shall cover all areas of the Pacific Ocean and any area in the Atlantic and Caribbean that NOAA determines is at-risk of tsunami. The system shall utilize such components as deep ocean detection buoys and tide gauges, as well as cooperation and data sharing between NOAA and USGS. 
   * Included in the detection and warning system is the establishment of tsunami warning centers, including the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, and the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska, in order to monitor data from seismological, deep ocean, and tidal monitoring station, as well as evaluate earthquakes that may have potential to generate tsunami, and disseminate information and warning bulletins. 
   * The bill also authorizes NOAA to establish a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program to improve tsunami preparedness of at-risk areas. The bill establishes a coordinating community for this program consisting of representatives from NOAA, FEMA, USGS, NSF, and affected coastal states and territories. This program will improve inundation mapping, community outreach and education, and promote and integrate tsunami warning and mitigation measures, including rescue and recovery guidelines. 
   * The bill requires NOAA to establish, along with other agencies and academic institutions, a tsunami research program to develop detection, prediction, communication, and mitigation science and technology to support tsunami forecasts and warnings. 
   * The bill also requires NOAA to immediately repair, and ensure the deployment of existing deep ocean detection buoys and related components of the detection and warning system, and to notify Congress upon any equipment or system failures that will impair regional detection, and of significant contractor failures or delays. 
   * The bill requires NOAA, and the United States Interagency Committee to provide technical assistance and advice to international entities as part of an international effort to develop a fully functional global tsunami warning system. 
   * The bill authorizes $35 million to carry out this act.
