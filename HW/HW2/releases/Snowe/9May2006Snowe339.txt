SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN TO HEAD CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement on the President's nomination of General Michael Hayden to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA):  
   "General Hayden is a man with impeccable military credentials - from serving our nation on the National Security Council in the late 1980s to Deputy Director of National Intelligence today. During these transformational times for both the CIA and our Intelligence Community, there are fundamental issues that will be the focus of General Hayden's nomination, including maintaining the CIA's vital independence from the Defense Department, which strenuously resisted the reorganization of our intelligence apparatus and which continues to control almost 80 percent of our nation's intelligence budget. Furthermore, strengthening and reinvigorating an agency that has experienced years of difficult transition will prove central to the CIA's core mission of gathering critical human intelligence."
