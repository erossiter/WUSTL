SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $1.45 MILLION FOR MAQUOIT BAY IN CRITICAL SPENDING BILL
  Less than a month after Maquoit Bay was ranked first in the nation by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for federal funding from the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP), Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that they successfully secured $1.45 million in the Fiscal Year (FY) Commerce Justice State Appropriations bill that was reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday.  
   "Conserving 170 acres of forested land on Maquoit Bay is essential to enhancing public access to the waterfront and protecting significant wildlife habitat along southern Maine's coastline. We could not be more proud to announce this funding that will complete the protection of this critical land," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement.
   This funding would complete the protection of 170 acres along Casco Bay in the Town of Brunswick. In 2006, Snowe and Collins secured $550,000 from the CELCP program for the project. 
   Overseen by NOAA, the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program provides matching grants to state and local governments to acquire open space in a state's coastal zone and is intended to protect coastal areas with significant conservation, recreation, ecological, cultural or aesthetic value.
