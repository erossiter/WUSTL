SEN. SNOWE ACTS TO FIND IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO VACCINE SHORTAGE; COSPONSORS LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) tonight announced that she is cosponsoring legislation to immediately address the critical shortage of influenza vaccine. Currently, only half of the anticipated vaccine supply is available causing shortages around the country.  
   "Deaths from the flu are easily reduced by vaccines. Indeed, our nation has been fairly successful in highlighting the need for the public to get the flu shot. Now that we are confronted with critical shortages in vaccine, we are faced with the grim reality that needless fatalities will occur," said Snowe. "The situation in Maine is particularly troubling as it receives the vast majority of its flu vaccine from the Chiron Corporation, the manufacturer whose supply has recently been suspended causing this overall shortage." 
   "We have witnessed startling advisories directing only the most vulnerable like the elderly, the very young and the chronically ill to get their flu shots because of lack of supply. Something had to be done - and I am glad to say that Congress has not abrogated its duty and has found a real solution to a potentially catastrophic situation that not only causes panic, but directly effects people's lives. This legislation that I have cosponsored today is a pragmatic approach that will help ease this shortage around the country," said Snowe.
   Drafted by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass), this legislation gives the nation's health agencies the tools they need to protect the public health from the danger of influenza, and to maximize the value of our reduced vaccine stocks. The bill provides for the purchase of vaccine for use in high-risk populations from those who serve low-risk populations. It also provides the expedited approval and purchase of additional stocks of vaccine that have already been approved by regulatory authorities in Europe, Canada and Japan.
   Last year, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that approximately 36,000 people died in the United States from flu complications. This week the loss of approximately half of the U.S. supply of influenza vaccine was announced when British regulatory authorities suspended the license of one of two suppliers to the U.S., Chiron Corporation, due to bacterial contamination of the vaccine. Maine is particularly impacted as 123,000 of the 150,000 doses the State Government ordered came from Chiron. 
   Snowe is hopeful that the Senate will pass this legislation before going out of session. 
   Provisions of the Emergency Flu Response Act of 2004 include: 
   * Requires the Secretary of HHS to seek to purchase additional stocks of vaccine available from Europe, Canada or Japan, and approved by the regulatory agencies of those nations. Directs FDA to review vaccines from these sources using the flexible and expedited review provided under the BioShield legislation. 
   * Provides funding to states to develop plans for effective distribution of vaccine. 
   * Provides funding to increase the stockpile of antiviral medications, and conduct dilution studies of existing vaccine. 
   * Requires reporting of the availability of vaccine, so that reserve supplies can be directed to areas of shortage. 
   * Establishes a vaccine clearinghouse to facilitate the voluntary donation of vaccine from individuals or companies with employees at low risk of infection to individuals at high risk. Allows HHS to purchase vaccine from employers or wholesalers who wish to sell it. 
   * Requires Federal Departments and the Attending Physician of the Capitol to abide by CDC recommendations in determining who should receive vaccine.
   * Ensures that anyone complying with a recommendation or requirement to undergo quarantine does not suffer loss of employment or income.
   * Provides CDC with emergency authority to require vaccine to be distributed through health agencies if other measures fail to assure priority for the most needy patients.
