SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $22,500 TO LIMESTONE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security is awarding $22,500 in federal funding to the Limestone Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The awards are part of the "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program", or the FIRE Act. The grants will assist in fire operations and firefighter safety training.
   "It is critical that federal resources are allocated to better equip our firefighters which, in turn, will assist in their effectiveness to protect their communities," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement.
   FIRE Act Grants were created with strong endorsement from Senators Snowe and Collins. These grants are awarded to fire departments across the United States to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety programs and to purchase new fire equipment.
