SEN. SNOWE PLEDGES CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR MEMBERS, FAMILIES OF 94TH MILITARY POLICY COMPANY; CONCERNED BY CURRENT GUARD, RESERVIST POLICIES
  Following a meeting this afternoon with families of the 94th Military Police Company, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today pledged to continue pressing the Department of Defense to answer any and all questions and concerns the families continue to have with senior Pentagon officials. This meeting was convened by the ME-NH-MA congressional delegations with Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) joining Snowe. This morning families of the 94th met with Lieutenant General James R. Helmly, Chief of the Army Reserve, to discuss their concerns. 
   "Today's meeting was about ensuring that the families of the 94th will get the answers they seek and deserve considering their sacrifices on behalf of our nation. Indeed, it is the willingness to make such sacrifices that is the hallmark of America's greatness," said Snowe. "The soldiers and families of the 94th have experienced far too many frustrations and disappointments up to this point."
   The 94th Military Policy Company has already served over two-and-a-half out of the past four years deployed in combat theaters in Bosnia and the Middle East. Just 18 months prior to their assignment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 94th completed a 9 month tour in Bosnia. The unit deployed to Iraq in April 2003 and, in September 2003, was extended as part of the 12 month "Boots on the Ground" policy.
   "There remain several unanswered questions, most importantly when the soldiers of the 94th are coming home. We need to know whether a unit has been identified to relieve them or, whether a valid mission requirement for the 94th still exists. Considering that their return is already months overdue, I will make it my personal mission to get those answers, because the families of the 94th should not have to leave here with any outstanding concerns, questions or issues," said Snowe. "Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness David Chu personally assured me that if the questions I submitted to the Pentagon on the families' behalf weren't answered as an outcome of this meeting, he would personally speak with the families."
   Snowe has also written to the President and the Vice President to inform them of the status and concerns of the 94th.
   Snowe believes the Department of Defense needs to answer a series of critical questions, including:
   * Is it right to have the majority of military police and civil affairs units in the reserve component?
   * Should we be discussing the addition of constabulary troops to the active component?
   * How often and for what durations should our reservists and Guardsmen expect to be deployed?
   * How do we make sure that certain reserve and Guard units are not overextended?
   * How do we make sure that the equipment and materiel we provide to the reserve component is on a par with that we provide our active units?
   "I want the families of the 94th to know that my colleagues and I will continue to work and press on behalf of the soldiers - to make sure they have what they need to perform their mission, keep them safe and get them home as soon as possible," concluded Snowe.
