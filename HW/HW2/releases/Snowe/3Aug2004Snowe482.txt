  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $144,000 in federal funding to be shared by the University of Southern Maine and the Kennebec Valley Council of Governments.  
 Awarded by the Economic Development Administration, the federal grant will support the continuation and implementation of the district economic development planning program.
   "Arriving at a time when economic development efforts of communities within Kennebec Valley are gaining momentum, this funding is critical to reinforcing the recovery of the region," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "With the continuing efforts of the University of Southern Maine, recovering Maine communities will attract greater private investment that will assist in the short and long-term prosperity of local economies."
   The federal funding was awarded as follows:
   * $92,000 to the University of Southern Maine, to provide technical and applied research assistance to improve the economies of distressed areas throughout Maine.
   * $52,000 to the Kennebec Valley Council of Governments, to support continued implementation of the economic development district planning program to foster private sector investment and reduce poverty within the region.
   The Economic Development Administration is under the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Kennebec Valley Council of Governments provides a broad array of planning services and support for municipal officials, assisting member communities with the development and execution of local strategies.
