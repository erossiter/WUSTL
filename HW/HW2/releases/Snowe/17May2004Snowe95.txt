SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on the 50 year anniversary of the landmark Brown vs.  
 Board of Education decision by the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "The U.S. Supreme Court decision fifty years ago in Brown vs. Board of Education represented a basic, fundamental and long-overdue repudiation of a system of segregation, racism and violence that pervaded our nation. Because of this ruling, millions of Americans were awoken to the injustice and hypocrisy of a divided society where only a select group were granted the basic and fundamental rights of 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' As we celebrate this historic court case today, we must also honor and remember those who translated its message into action ensuring that our nation honored its promise of basic rights to all of its citizens."
