SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS SENATE APPROVAL OF AIR CARGO SECURITY AMENDMENT
  A longtime proponent of improved air cargo security, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, applauded the inclusion of an amendment she co-authored to the 'National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004' - legislation currently being considered by the Senate to restructure and reform the 15 agencies of the nation's Intelligence Community. Snowe praised the passage of the air cargo security amendment - including provisions she authored - which mirrors a previous bill that passed the Senate in May 2003.  
   "If we are to fulfill our obligations to confront the aviation security challenges we face in the aftermath of September 11th, we must remain aggressive," said Snowe, who is also a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. "As the Senate continues debate on reforming our national defenses and strengthening intelligence operations, we need a 'must-do' attitude, not excuses about 'what can't be done', because we are only as safe as the weakest link in our security chain. I'm pleased the Senate today passed this amendment, which will greatly improve our nation's air security." 
   Accepted by the full Senate by a vote of 96 to 0, the amendment offered by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and co-authored by Snowe includes the following provisions: 
   * Comprehensive Air Cargo Security Plan - The Transportation Security Agency (TSA) would be required to develop a strategic plan to ensure that all air cargo is screened, inspected, or otherwise made secure. Six months after enactment of the bill, TSA would be required to submit a comprehensive plan for screening or otherwise security all cargo loaded onto both passenger and all cargo planes. 
   * Increased Oversight of Shipping Licenses - The existing federal security program for Indirect Air Carriers (IACs) would be reviewed and assessed for possible improvements. IACs could have their certificates revoked if TSA finds that they are not adhering to security laws or regulations. 
   * Inspection of Aviation Shipping Facilities - TSA would be required to develop a system for the regular inspection of air cargo shipping facilities. 
   * Security Plans for All-Cargo Carriers - All-cargo carriers would be required to develop security plans that would be subject to approval by TSA. 
   * Regular Inspections for Foreign Cargo - TSA would be required to work with foreign countries to conduct regular inspections at facilities transporting air cargo to the U.S. 
   * Known Shipper Program Enhancements - A pilot program database would be established of known shippers in order to bolster the Known Shipper Program. Indirect Air Carriers (IACs) could have their certificates revoked if TSA finds that they are not adhering to security laws or regulations. The existing Federal security program for IACs would be reviewed and assessed for possible improvements. 
   * Cargo Screening Pilot Program - A pilot program would be established to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to test the various techniques for screening cargo being loaded onto passenger planes, including random physical screening.
