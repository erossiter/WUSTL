SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES MAINE POETRY OUT LOUD CHAMPION RIVA DUMONT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met today with Riva Dumont of Erskine Academy who is the Maine Poetry Out Loud State Champion. Riva is one of twelve national finalists to compete in a national competition this evening in Washington.  
   "I would like to congratulate Riva for her amazing achievement," said Snowe. "I was treated to a personal performance of her poetry recitation skills that made it clear why she is one of twelve national finalists. This is an incredible honor for Riva and I know she will represent Maine well at the National competition." 
   Riva will participate in the 2006 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Poetry Out Loud National Finals taking place at the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, D.C tonight. Poetry Out Loud is a national poetry recitation competition hosted by the NEA and the Poetry Foundation. Over 250,000 students have competed in Capital cities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia this year. The Poetry Out Loud national recitation contest was implemented to help students learn great poems, master public speaking skills and learn about their literary heritage.
