SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR WEST FRANKFORT FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that $143,529 in federal funding has been awarded to the West Frankfort Fire Department by the Department of Homeland Security as a part of the "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program," or FIRE Act.  
   "This federal funding is crucial for volunteer fire departments in rural Maine," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This grant will enable the West Frankfort Fire Department to equip their firefighters in order to properly serve and protect the community." 
   The funds distributed to the West Frankfort Fire Department are to be used for the Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program, which includes various equipment such as pumpers, brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, quints, aerials, foam units, and fireboats. 
   FIRE Act Grants were created with strong endorsement from Senators Snowe and Collins. These grants are awarded to fire departments across the United States to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety programs and to purchase new fire equipment.
