SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MEMBERS OF MAINE CREDIT UNION LEAGUE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met recently with members of the Maine Credit Union League.  
   "I was incredibly pleased to meet with members of the Maine Credit Union League," said Snowe. "I share many of the concerns that they discussed with me and look forward to working closely with them in addressing these concerns. The Maine Credit Union League is a valuable resource for credit unions throughout Maine and we must ensure that it continues to serve these institutions effectively." 
   The Maine Credit Union League was founded in 1938 as a non-profit trade association of Maine's credit unions. Over the years it has been a strong advocate for the state's credit unions on both a regional and national level. In recent years, the League has been instrumental in favorably influencing decisions on many important issues affecting credit unions and their members, from legislation to public opinion.
