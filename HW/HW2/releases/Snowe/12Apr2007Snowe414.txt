SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS FOR 'AIRLINE PASSENGERS' BILL OF RIGHTS' AT SENATE HEARING ON APRIL 12
  At a Senate Aviation Subcommittee Hearing on Thursday, April 12, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) stressed the importance of enhancing consumer protections for America's traveling public. Earlier this year, Sen. Olympia Snowe joined Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in introducing the Passengers' Bill of Rights, after airline customers across the country were stranded on planes for more than nine hours without access to food, water, or functioning restrooms.  
   "This past winter I was outraged to hear that men, women, and children were trapped on aircrafts for hours without access to basic needs like food, water, or functional restrooms," said Senator Snowe. "Our nation's airlines must be held accountable and I strongly believe the 'Passengers' Bill of Rights' legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced will ensure that air carriers live up to their responsibility to appropriately provide for their customers in good weather and in bad." 
   The Snowe-Boxer legislation requires airlines to provide passengers with necessary services such as food, potable water and adequate restroom facilities while a plane is delayed on the tarmac. The bill would also offer passengers the option of safely exiting a plane they have boarded after three hours that the aircraft has remained stagnant on the ground. 
   The 'Passengers' Bill of Rights' provides two exceptions to the three-hour option. The pilot may decide to not allow passengers to deplane if he or she reasonably believes their safety or security would be at risk due to extreme weather or other emergencies. Alternately, if the pilot reasonably determines that the flight will depart in an expeditious manner, he or she can delay deplaning option for an additional 30 minutes.
