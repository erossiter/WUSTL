MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE DELEGATION MEMBERS VISIT PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD, VOW TO FIGHT DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S CLOSURE RECOMMENDATION
  Appearing together at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Members of the Maine and New Hampshire Congressional Delegations today issued the following statement on the inclusion of Portsmouth on the Base Realignment and Closure list.  
 The Department of Defense has recommended the shipyard for closure: 
   "The Pentagon has given with one hand and taken with the other, awarding Portsmouth Naval Shipyard a Meritorious Unit Commendation a day before announcing the shipyard should be closed. This unreasoned decision marks the beginning of the next chapter of our fight for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and its unrivaled workforce," Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, New Hampshire Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu, Maine Representatives Tom Allen and Mike Michaud and New Hampshire Representatives Jeb Bradley and Charles Bass said in a joint statement. "Even as our delegation fought with everything we had to keep Portsmouth off the BRAC list, we were preparing for this possibility. Our effort from this point forward is an extension of what we have been doing - making the case for Portsmouth on its merits and on the criteria the BRAC Commission is bound to use to arrive at its ultimate decision. We must do absolutely everything in our power to ensure that the Commissioners do not make the same mistake the Pentagon has made."
