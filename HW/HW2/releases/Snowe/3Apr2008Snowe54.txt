SEN. SNOWE-BACKED MEASURES INCLUDED IN RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) joined Senators Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and John Ensign (R-Nev.) today in announcing a bi-partisan deal to extend billions of dollars worth of renewable energy and efficiency tax incentives - including provisions introduced by Senator Snowe in the Finance Committee. 
   "We must do more than pay lip service to alternative energy production and conservation," said Senator Snowe, the author of the 2005 energy efficiency tax incentives. "The landmark energy efficiency tax incentives we passed in 2005 cannot be allowed to expire just as we have started down the proper path. The future of our energy security and economic vitality is at stake. This legislation lays the groundwork for a partnership that will produce more jobs and realistic energy alternatives."
   Key Snowe-backed provisions that were included in the bi-partisan renewable tax incentive agreement included:
   The deduction for building energy efficient commercial buildings was extended for one year;
   The tax credit for consumers to make existing homes more energy efficient was extended for one year;
   The credit for utilizing more energy efficient technology when building new homes was extended for two years; and
   The credit for producing more energy efficient appliances was extended for three years.
