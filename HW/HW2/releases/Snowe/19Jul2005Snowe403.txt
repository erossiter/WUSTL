SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $180,000 TO MAINE FOR MEDICARE PROJECT
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced that the Maine Department of Health and Human Services has received $180,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging.  
 The funding is for the Senior Medicare Patrol Project, which offers programs to help seniors become better health care consumers by helping them identify and prevent billing errors and potential fraud in the Medicare program. 
   "This project is valuable to helping seniors throughout Maine protect themselves from errors and fraud in the Medicare program," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Medicare fraud has far reaching effects, and educating seniors is an important step in maintaining the integrity of Medicare for generations to come." 
   The Senior Medicare Patrol Project teaches beneficiaries how to treat their Medicare number as they would their credit cards, how to use journals to keep track of their medical services and health care instructions, how to read their Medicare notices, and how to get answers to billing questions they may have.
