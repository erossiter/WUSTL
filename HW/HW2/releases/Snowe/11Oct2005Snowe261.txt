SEN. SNOWE SECURES $131 MILLION IN FUNDING IN DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL TO BENEFIT MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced today that she has successfully secured $131 million in funding to benefit Maine in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. The Senate passed this legislation today by a vote of 97 to 0.  
   "Defending our country is the federal government's foremost responsibility. The funding awarded to Maine in the Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the Senate today underscores the role our state plays in keeping our country secure," said Snowe. "The money allocated to Bath Iron Works to build the Next Generation DD(X) Destroyer will be essential to preparing our military to face 21st century threats." 
   During consideration of this bill, Snowe voted for an amendment offered by Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) that would ensure that future funding for health care for veterans takes into account changes in population and inflation. Unfortunately, this amendment failed by a vote of 48 to 51. 
   "With so many men and women in our armed forces returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, we must prepare to address the future needs of our veterans," said Snowe. "We cannot allow this additional strain to compromise our commitment to those who have given so much in their service to our country. Although this amendment failed, I hope that the Senate will soon revisit this issue and provide our brave veterans the health care they deserve." 
   Snowe announced that she secured the following funding in this Appropriations bill to benefit Maine:
