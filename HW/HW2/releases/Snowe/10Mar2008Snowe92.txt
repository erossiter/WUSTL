SENS. SNOWE, CASEY RECOGNIZE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS EDUCATION AND AWARENESS MONTH
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced today a bipartisan resolution to recognize National Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Education and Awareness Month in March. 
   "I am pleased to introduce this Resolution which recognizes and reaffirms our commitment to combating Multiple Sclerosis," said Senator Casey. "By promoting awareness of its causes and risks and by promoting new education programs, supporting research and expanding access to medical treatment, we can work to find a cure. It is also my hope that this Resolution that Senator Snowe and I offer today will help us to more consciously recognize all Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis."
   "We live in an age of possibility, where all that stands in the way of curing our most degenerative illnesses is the will and commitment to do so," Senator Snowe said. "Too little is known about this disease that affects hundreds and thousands of Americans. In an age where technology and innovation have launched a new race for medical achievement, we have the opportunity and obligation to find a cure for M.S."
   The resolution introduced today states MS affects approximately 400,000 Americans of all ages, genders, races and ethnicities. Multiple Sclerosis is a disease in the central nervous system without a cure. It affects a patient's immune system and the cause is still unknown. The resolution also recognizes and reaffirms our commitment to combating MS by promoting awareness about its causes and risks by promoting new education programs, supporting research and expanding access to medical treatment.
