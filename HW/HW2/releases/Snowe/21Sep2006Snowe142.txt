SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ACTION NETWORK AMBASSADORS IN HER WASHINGTON OFFICE
  After meeting this afternoon with singer/songwriter Jewel about her breast cancer patient protection legislation, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met with Maine's Ambassadors to the American Cancer Society Action Network's Celebration on the Hill 2006 in Washington, DC. These Maine representatives gathered on the National Mall for a day-long event to celebrate cancer survivors and advocate for laws that will help fight disease. The rally's events included an array of speakers and performers, the official opening of the American Cancer Society Relay for Life Wall of Hope, and an opportunity for survivors from all over America to walk a lap around the Capitol Reflecting Pool.  
   "I was honored to meet with these dedicated Mainers today who are committed to fighting cancer and celebrating survivorship through this inspiring gathering on the National Mall today," said Senator Snowe. "The rally brought supporters from across the country, including Maine Ambassadors, to demonstrate our national commitment to finding a cure for cancer. It is through this type of collaboration and advocacy that changes can be made and hope can be inspired to once and for all put an end to a disease that has affected almost every American." 
   The American Cancer Society Action Network (ACS CAN) is a non-profit, sister advocacy organization of the American Cancer Society dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major public health problem through voter education and issues campaigns.
