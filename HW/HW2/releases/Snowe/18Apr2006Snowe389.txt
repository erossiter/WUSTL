SEN. SNOWE 'PROFOUNDLY HONORED' BY TIME MAGAZINE SELECTION AS ONE OF TOP TEN SENATORS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe has been selected as one of the nation's ten best Senators by Time magazine in this week's issue of the news magazine. Sen. Snowe is the only woman on the list.  
   "I am profoundly honored to receive this distinguished recognition from one of the world's most respected news organizations. This is an especially gratifying honor as Time magazine cited my efforts on behalf of the people of Maine, who are my highest priority in the Senate. Everything I work to accomplish is done through the prism of how I can help improve the lives of the people of Maine," said Snowe. 
   Calling her "The Caretaker," Time magazine wrote of Snowe: "Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington?But while Snowe, 59, is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents." 
   The other Senators on the list are: Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Carl Levin of Michigan, Richard Lugar of Indiana, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Richard Durbin of Illinois, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and John McCain of Arizona.
