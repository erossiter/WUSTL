SEN. SNOWE VOTES FOR CONSIDERATION OF IRAQ EXIT STRATEGY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted for legislation offered by Sen. John Warner (R-VA) and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) which calls on the White House to begin consideration of an exit strategy from Iraq. This amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense Authorization bill states that U.S. forces should not stay in Iraq any longer than required. This amendment passed by a bipartisan vote of 79 to19.  
   "Our brave troops and their families have made tremendous sacrifices to give Iraqis the opportunity to determine their destiny," said Snowe. "This legislation the Senate passed today will move us one step closer to the day when we can begin to bring home our honorable men and women in uniform, who have continued to serve at the highest level despite lengthy deployments. At the same time, at this juncture we should avoid setting specific dates for withdrawing, which could undermine progress in Iraq in both security and in governance, aiding the insurgency in the process." 
   This amendment requires the White House to deliver a report to Congress not later than 90 days after enactment, and finds that: 
   * Members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or have served in Iraq and their families deserve the utmost respect and the heartfelt gratitude of the American people for their unwavering devotion to duty, service to the Nation, and selfless sacrifice under the most difficult circumstances; 
   * It is important to recognize that the Iraqi people have made enormous sacrifices and that the overwhelming majority of Iraqis want to live in peace and security; 
   * Calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq; 
   * United States military forces should not stay in Iraq any longer than required and the people of Iraq should be so advised; 
   * The Administration should tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq, within the schedule they set for themselves; and 
   * The Administration needs to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq.
