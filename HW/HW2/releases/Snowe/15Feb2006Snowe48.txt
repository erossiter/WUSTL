SEN. SNOWE PLEASED BY SENATE COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING TAX RELIEF TO WORKING FAMILIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, is pleased that the Senate unanimously approved a Motion to Instruct Conferees to the tax reconciliation bill to make the child tax credit permanent. Snowe joined today with Sens. Jim Talent (R-MO) and Blanche Lincoln (D-AK) in putting forward this legislation. 
   "Today the Senate reaffirmed its commitment to providing lasting tax relief to working families by unanimously passing this resolution that would instruct the House and Senate conferees to the tax reconciliation bill to make the child tax credit permanent. I believe that if the Congress is going to enact significant tax legislation that will help primarily middle and upper-income people, then it is only right that we work to provide the same kind of relief to families struggling to make ends meet," said Snowe. 
   Snowe is a longtime advocate for the CTC and in 2001 she worked to ensure that it was made refundable. Unless the Congress acts, the child tax credit that currently is $1,000 will revert to $500 after 2010. To expand the reach of the 2001 tax bill, Snowe worked to ensure that the tax package doubled the $500 per child tax credit and made it partially refundable for those with incomes of more than $10,000.
