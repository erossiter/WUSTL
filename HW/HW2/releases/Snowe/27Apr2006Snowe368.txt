SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $365,000 IN E-RATE FUNDING TO IMPROVE MODERN TECHNOLOGY FOR MAINE SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICTS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that various Maine schools, libraries and Administrative Districts will share in $365,704.73 in funding discounts under the E-Rate program, which she and Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) authored as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. 
   "Access to advanced technologies is a critical necessity for today's students if they are to be prepared for the increasingly digital job market of the 21st century," said Snowe. "The E-Rate program gives schools and libraries the resources to purchase the most up to date telecommunications equipment available. The establishment of this program has proven critical to improving the technological options available to citizens throughout the country."

   The E-Rate program provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. This funding represents the discounts schools will receive for specific telecommunications services. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries. 
   The E-rate's first funding priority is for telecommunications services and Internet access, and the second funding priority is for internal connections and wiring at schools and libraries - beginning with the neediest applicants first - until the $2.1 billion fund is exhausted. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller gained the inclusion of their E-rate provision in the telecommunications reform bill by a single vote in the Senate Commerce Committee; successfully fought back an effort on the Senate floor to remove the provision from the bill; and defended the E-rate program during the two and one-half year implementation process at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) while ensuring it was implemented in a manner consistent with the language of the law and intent of the authors.
