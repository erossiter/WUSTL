SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $130,000 IN E-RATE FUNDING TO IMPROVE MODERN TECHNOLOGY FOR MAINE SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICTS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that various Maine schools, libraries and Administrative Districts will share $131,817.66 in funding discounts under the E-Rate program, which she and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) authored as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Today's announcement is part of wave five of the seventh year of E-Rate funding for schools and libraries in Maine.  
   "I am so pleased to announce this E-Rate funding because I firmly believe that access to advanced technologies is a critical necessity for students so they can compete on a level playing field in this increasingly technological world," said Snowe. "The most recent wave of E-rate funding will allow recipient schools and libraries in Maine to remain on the cutting edge and provide their students with an opportunity to work with advanced telecommunications technologies. Since the E-Rate program began, it has helped more than one million classrooms and libraries nationwide and it is my intention to make sure it continues to benefit students across the country for years to come.." 
   The E-Rate program provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. This funding represents the discounts schools will receive for specific telecommunications services. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries. 
   The E-rate's first funding priority is for telecommunications services and Internet access, and the second funding priority is for internal connections and wiring at schools and libraries - beginning with the neediest applicants first - until the $2.1 billion fund is exhausted. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller gained the inclusion of their E-rate provision in the telecommunications reform bill by a single vote in the Senate Commerce Committee; successfully fought back an effort on the Senate floor to remove the provision from the bill; and defended the E-rate during the two and one-half year implementation process at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) while ensuring it was implemented in a manner consistent with the language of the law and intent of the authors. 
   The Maine Schools, libraries and Administrative Districts receiving an E-rate funding commitment letter for the fourth wave of funding year 2005 are: 
   * Dresden Elementary School- $3,847.20 
   * Eastport School Department- $18,947.70
