SEN. SNOWE PRAISES MILESTONE IN LUMBER DISPUTE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today responded to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's announcement that his government will proceed with the submission of legislation that would replace U.S. import duties with a combination of Canadian border taxes and quotas. The American and Canadian compromise would also bring an end to decades of litigation over the unfair subsidizing of the Canadian lumber industry by the government. 
  "The nearly quarter century engagement with the Canadian government in defense of the U.S. lumber industry, and the American families it supports, from unfairly subsidized, artificially underpriced Canadian softwood lumber has been a difficult but necessary undertaking. Today's announcement marks a significant milestone in this ongoing dialogue, and I strongly support the continued efforts by the governments and industries of both countries to settle this dispute amicably," Snowe said.
  Canada's International Trade Minister, David Emerson, had requested the roughly 300 companies from the Canadian lumber industry state their position on the proposed deal by the close of business August 21st. Substantial industry support of the agreement was needed before legislation was submitted due to the agreement's requirement that Canadian companies withdraw legal challenges to United States' corrective duties. The agreement also calls for the U.S. to return $4 billion of the $5 billion paid in duties since 2002.
