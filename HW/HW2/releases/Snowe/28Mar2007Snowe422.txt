SEN. SNOWE STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF ENFORCING CHINESE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS AT SENATE HEARING
  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the economic relationship between the U.S. and China, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) on Wednesday, March 28, 2007, discussed the importance of enforcing Chinese trade obligations in order to protect Maine's economy, especially family-operated manufacturing businesses. Sen. Olympia Snowe also questioned a panel of experts and specialists on what steps need to be taken to improve Chinese environmental standards in the future.  
   "The economic relationship between the United States and China has expanded over the past several years and it is vital that our government enforces fair trade practices and demands tougher environmental standards of our trade partners," said Senator Snowe. "The state of Maine has been decimated by the outsourcing of jobs and the recent closure of Moosehead Manufacturing in Monson only furthers my commitment to enforcing these essential rules. As a leader in the global community, our country must ensure that nations like China meet their international trade obligations, rather than devastate the environment as an additional means of subsidizing cheap exports." 
   As a long time champion of combating unfair foreign trade practices, Senator Snowe introduced the Trade Complaint and Litigation Accountability Improvement Measures Act (Trade ClAIM Act) earlier this year. If passed, the bill would limit the United States Trade Representative's (USTR) ability to decline public petitions for relief from unfair foreign trade practices and make such negative determinations by USTR reviewable by the U.S. Court of International Trade.
