SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR AROOSTOOK COUNTY
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) applauded President Bush's decision to declare an emergency for the State of Maine due to a snowstorm that occurred in Aroostook County from December 25 to the 27, 2005. This declaration will trigger the release of federal funds to help communities pay for emergency protective measures that the county instituted to save lives, protect public health and safety, and property.  
   "Although Aroostook County deals with its share of storms during the winter, the blizzard that hit at the end of last year was overwhelming in its severity," said Snowe. "I applaud the President's decision to release emergency funds to the County to help strained local budgets deal with the after-effects of the storm. We also must ensure that they are able to adequately deal with any upcoming storms since winter is only half-over." 
   The blizzard brought 39 inches of snow to the area in a 48 hour period during the last days of December. In January, Snowe sent a letter to R. David Paulson, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) encouraging him to declare a disaster in Aroostook County.
