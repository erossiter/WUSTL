SENATE PASSES SEN. SNOWE RESOLUTION HONORING COAST GUARD
  Last night the U.S. Senate passed by unanimous consent a resolution introduced yesterday by Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) recognizing the extraordinary response of the U.S. Coast Guard and its servicemen and women to Hurricane Katrina. The resolution also notes the necessity of improving the Coast Guard's aging fleet of ships and aircraft, primarily through Deepwater, the service's recapitalization program for procuring new cutters, small boats, and aircraft. 
   "I applaud my colleagues in the Senate for recognizing the amazing efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard and its servicemen and women, and reaffirming the Senate's commitment to providing this service the resources it needs to continue its vital missions," said Snowe. "Thousands of children, senior citizens, and entire families are sleeping safely tonight as a result of the United States Coast Guard's unparalleled performance and operations responding to Hurricane Katrina. The bottom line is that the servicemen and women of the Coast Guard did not wait to be told to conduct their mission. They knew their mission, and they refused to let anything - including red tape - get in their way." 
   Senate Resolution 246 expresses the sense of the Senate that-- 
   (1) the United States Coast Guard should receive Congress's highest commendation for its tremendous and highly effective response to the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina; 
   (2) the United States Congress should commit to providing the Coast Guard with the resources it needs to modernize and maintain its fleet of vessels and aircraft; and 
   (3) the Administration should ensure that the Coast Guard receives sufficient funding to cover its unexpected operational and capital costs associated with Hurricane Katrina.
