SEN. SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, today introduced the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2005, legislation that would establish a national system for gathering real-time ocean data, based upon the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observation System (GoMOOS). The national data system would augment and integrate a loosely-knit network of regional observation systems currently established in coastal zones across the country, giving all those who count on consistent and complete ocean data access to real-time information.  
   As we saw with the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami only weeks ago, the oceans are alive and ever-changing, said Snowe. A While our nations coast escaped the direct impact of this recent tragedy, it reminds us that those who live near or along our nations 95,000-plus miles of shoreline need to be able to quickly assess ocean-based threats, including tsunamis, hurricanes, harmful algal blooms, and pollution. The information this system would provide is essential to marine science and resource management as well as maritime transportation, safety, and commerce. 
   This bi-partisan, science-based bill would authorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to establish and maintain an integrated network of ocean observing and communication systems around our nations coastlines. This system would collect instantaneous data and information on ocean conditions B such as temperature, wave height, wind speed, currents, dissolved oxygen, salinity, contaminants, and other variables. 
   As a representative of a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I want to ensure that the citizens of Maine, and all coastal states, have the tools they need to monitor and assess what is happening off their shores, said Snowe. A The State of Maine has a strong and proud history rooted in our connection to the sea, as do other coastal states, and our coastal communities are highly dependent on the fisheries resources, coastal habitats, tourist destinations, safe harbors, and other essential services connected to the sea. The people of this countrys livelihoods are directly linked to how well we understand and adapt to changing ocean conditions. 
   Among its provisions, the AOcean and Coastal Observation Systems Act would: 
   * Develop and maintain an integrated marine data monitoring and management system that provides for comprehensive and continuous ocean and coastal observations; 
   * Facilitate timely warnings to coastal communities about potentially hazardous ocean conditions detected by coastal and offshore buoys, satellites, and other ocean observing instruments; 
   * Coordinate state agencies regional ocean observing systems efforts regarding data measurement requirements, standards and protocols for quality control, and data management and planning activities; 
   * Establish a research and development program to study the relationship between ocean conditions and human activities, develop new observation technologies, enhance security at US ports, and improve public education. 
   Snowe gave the following tangible examples of how this nationwide integrated ocean observing system will benefit Maine and the nation: 
   * Natural Distasters B Ocean observing system would detect hazardous ocean conditions - such as harmful algal blooms, oil spills, tsunamis, and hurricanes - and enable marine scientists to predict, track, and warn coastal communities about their potential impacts. 
   * Port Security B Ocean observing system will help ports Apush out their borders. By detecting the presence of harmful chemicals and tracking their paths, it will be able to ascertain biological threats and it will be able to track vessels and determine any possible suspicious activity. 
   * Fisheries Science B Ocean observing system would provide the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with critical nation-wide environmental data to improve fisheries modeling and management, coastal planning and harmful algal blooms management and mitigation. 
   * Coast Guard B Ocean observing system would provide the Coast Guard with valuable real-time information on sea-state conditions to determine when and how to conduct missions, including search-and-rescue activities. 
   * Navy B Ocean observing systems would provide the Navy with detailed observations and a variety of capabilities to support core Navy missions, improve tactical and strategic information for battlespace environments, improve submarine and mine detection, and develop improved sensor technologies.
