SEN. SNOWE DISCUSSES SOFTWOOD LUMBER ISSUES AT PLEASANT RIVER LUMBER FACILITY IN DOVER-FOXCROFT
  While touring the Pleasant River Lumber Facility in Dover-Foxcroft this afternoon, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) discussed with the company's management officials key concerns regarding the future of the softwood lumber industry. The London Court of International Arbitration recently ruled that Canada violated the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) by failing to implement required export quotas on Canadian lumber during a "surge" in such shipments in early 2007. The arbitral panel also decided against the United States by finding that British Columbia and Alberta had not failed to pay sufficient surge export taxes on their lumber during that period. 
   "For months, Canada had been flooding cheap lumber into the U.S. market, blatantly disregarding provisions in our trade agreement," Senator Snowe said. "While the arbitration panel recently recognized Canada's failure to honor its trade commitments, they failed to hold the provinces responsible for the greatest portion of the problem accountable for their actions. In light of this, tougher enforcement action against Canada has never been more in need."
   In January of this year, Senator Snowe met with met with a coalition of lumber representatives, which included Luke Brochu, the President of Pleasant River Lumber, in Washington to discuss the softwood lumber agreement with Canada. Following that discussion, Senator Snowe sent a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative calling for an immediate resolution to the problem, and continues to press the Administration to require importers of Canadian lumber to certify that each shipment is in compliance with the SLA.
   Pleasant River Lumber produces 85 million board feet of spruce dimension lumber annually. It is a family-owned facility with four generations of experience in the forest products industry.
