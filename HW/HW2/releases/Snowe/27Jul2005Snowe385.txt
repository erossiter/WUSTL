SEN. SNOWE CELEBRATES 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the landmark law ensuring equal opportunity for persons with disabilities in employment, state and local government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and transportation.  
 Snowe cosponsored a resolution offered by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) recognizing the contribution that the ADA has made to our society and to the civil rights of people with disabilities. The Senate unanimously approved this resolution yesterday evening. 
   "Disabled Americans deserve basic protections in law and the opportunity to live full and rewarding lives," said Snowe. "The Americans with Disabilities Act has helped our country make great strides toward breaking down barriers for disabled Americans. I remain committed to the vision and intent of this historic legislation, and I am confident we will continue to make progress in assuring all of our citizens can realize the American Dream."
