SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES ROCKLAND-THOMASTON BUSINESS FORUM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, announced today that she is sponsoring a business development forum with the Small Business Administration (SBA).  
 The Rockland-Thomaston Business Forum will be held at Grape's Restaurant on Tuesday, September 28th from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. in Rockland. The forum is open to the public to explain how to access small business assistance through SBA, state and local programs. Members of Senator Snowe's staff will represent the Senator at the event. 
   "Maine's economic backbone is its tremendous small business community," said Snowe. "With over 90 percent of our state's business considered small, it is essential that business owners have access to useful information available to them at the federal, state, and local levels to help them thrive. I encourage anyone with an interest in small business opportunities to attend."
