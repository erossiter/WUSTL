SENS. SNOWE, DORGAN INTRODUCE BILL TO ENCOURAGE NEW CHARITABLE DONATIONS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced bipartisan legislation today that would allow taxpayers to make tax-free distributions from their individual retirement accounts as gifts to charities. This bill would encourage billions in new donations to charities that provide essential support and services in local communities, and encourage donors to keep giving without unfavorable tax consequences. 
   "IRA Rollovers will enable and encourage millions of Americans to support charitable organizations and nonprofit groups," Snowe said. "Generously giving to the less fortunate among us and caring for our neighbors and fellow Americans is ingrained in the character of this nation and we should do all we can to make charitable donations easier."
   "A recent survey suggests that this IRA rollover legislation will result in new, sizable donations to support charities, small and large, that depend on the generous gifts of individuals," said Dorgan. "I want Congress to encourage charitable giving, which helps charities strengthen our communities and provide assistance to families and individuals who need it most." 
   The Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007 would make last year's temporary provision a permanent part of the tax code, and expand the amount than an individual can donate. This bill would also permit taxpayers who have reached age 59 ? to make tax-favored, life-income gifts to charities from their IRAs. Life-income gifts help charities secure funding commitments now to help plan for their future needs, and also encourage additional charitable giving.
