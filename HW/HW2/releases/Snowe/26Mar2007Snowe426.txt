SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM FUNDING MEASURE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Monday, March 26, 2007, cosponsored legislation that would raise the federal tobacco products excise tax to fund the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Introduced by Sen. Gordon H. Smith (R-Oregon), the proposed amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget would increase the federal tobacco tax up to 61 cents (reaching $1.00 total) with all revenue dedicated to the reauthorization of State Children's Health Insurance Program.  
   "While we have made remarkable progress in enrolling eligible children into both Medicaid and SCHIP, we still have 21,000 children in Maine that are uninsured," said Senator Snowe. "States not only need sufficient federal funding to ensure that children currently enrolled in S-CHIP do not lose coverage; they also need additional funding to enroll more uninsured children. I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Smith's amendment that provides a down-payment on improving health coverage for low-income children." 
   If passed, the measure would allow the revenue from the increase in the tobacco tax to cover those currently eligible, but not enrolled. Senator Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, has been a long-time champion of the SCHIP program and has worked diligently on the federal and state level to ensure that the program remains beneficial for children in Maine and throughout the country.
