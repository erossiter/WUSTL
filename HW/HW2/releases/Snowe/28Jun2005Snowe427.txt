SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE HHS FUNDS FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded two grants totaling $753,131 to Central Maine Community College in Auburn and Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor.  
   "The federal funding that has been awarded to the Jackson Lab and CMCC from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be useful for advancing research on aging as well as for supporting health and science education," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The Jackson Laboratory of Bar Harbor has been awarded $720,001 from the National Institute on Aging, a component of HHS. The funds will assist a research program on aging at the lab. 
   Central Maine Community College of Auburn has been awarded $33,130 from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a component of HHS. The funds will aid the Undergrad Training Program that awards Associates Degree in Applied Science and Certificates in Occupational Health and Safety. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. HHS works closely with state and local governments and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.
