SEN. SNOWE: SUBPOENAS WILL BE ENFORCED
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised the issuing subpoenas by Sen.  
 Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) to obtain materials from the Department of Defense that are essential in evaluating their decisions to close or realign military facilities around the country, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, the Defense Financing Service Administration (DFAS) in Limestone, and the Brunswick Naval Air Station. Seventeen days after the Defense Department released its list of facilities for closure, Snowe believes it is absolutely essential that these subpoenas are fully enforced. 
   "The clock is ticking for affected communities through out Maine and the country to make the case for their military facilities to the BRAC Commission. What the Department of Defense has done is simply incomprehensible and reprehensible. By refusing to fully and completely release the supporting information that explains their base closing rationale, they are clearly flouting the intent of statute," said Snowe. "These subpoenas have put the Department of Defense on notice that we are prepared to utilize every tool in our arsenal to secure the information that is essential to our case before the BRAC Commission on July 6th in Boston. Let me make it abundantly clear - we will use whatever means necessary to ensure that these subpoenas are fully enforced."
