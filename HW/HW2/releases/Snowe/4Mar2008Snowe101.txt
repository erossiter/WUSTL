SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $500,000 LOAN AND $200,000 GRANT FOR TOWN OF NORTH HAVEN
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced today that the Town of North Haven will receive a water and waste disposal loan and grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program. Specifically, the town will receive a loan for $500,000 and a grant in the amount of $200,000. 
   "The island of North Haven faces unique challenges as it works to update and modernize its wastewater and sewer system," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "These rural development funds will help allow the community to replace about 1,500 feet of old clay sewer pipe, address environmental concerns, and will help ensure that the town is able to provide the quality service its residents depend on."
