SEN. SNOWE LAUDS NAVY'S RELEASE OF MORE THAN $223 MILLION TO BATH IRON WORKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that the Department of the Navy will release $223,262,430 to Bath Iron Works (BIW) for detail design and production of one Flight 0 Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy's newest surface combatant.  
   "This is yet another recognition that Bath Iron Works employs the best surface combatant designers and the most highly skilled workforce the nation has to offer," said Snowe. "I believe the Navy will be pleased with the results, and I commend the men and women of Bath Iron Works for their continued excellence." 
   The Littoral Combat Ship will take advantage of the newest generation hull forms, and tailored, modularized combat systems package designs to enable the LCS to defeat enemy littoral defenses, including mines, fast swarming small boats, and submarines, ultimately ensuring maritime access in any environment. 
   "The flexibility and adaptability in BIW's Littoral Combat Ship design will give the Navy the ability to not only support joint operations like transporting Marine Corps and special operations units to locations overseas, but also prosecute missions to protect our homeland, including drug and illegal alien interdiction," continued Snowe. "More importantly, this next generation ship will allow us to meet the emerging security challenges our nation will face in this new century." 
   As the Prime Contractor, BIW is responsible for program management, technical management, the production lead and overall responsibility for ship integration of core ship control and combat systems as well as the modularized mission packages. 
   Snowe has long advocated for the Littoral Combat Ship in requesting full funding of the program in defense authorization and appropriations bills.
