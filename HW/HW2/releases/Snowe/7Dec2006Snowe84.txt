SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT GATES AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement in support of Robert Gates' confirmation as Secretary of Defense. Mr. Gates was confirmed by the Senate today.  
 "Today marks a pivotal moment and an end of the status quo for American policy in Iraq with the overwhelming confirmation of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense and the release of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group's report. 
 "I voted to confirm Robert Gates today as Secretary of Defense, because at this critical juncture for our nation and our policy in Iraq , he will bring a new perspective and leadership to the Pentagon. His character, expertise, and straightforward approach he demonstrated in his testimony will serve our nation well during this time of historic challenges facing the United States and the Department of Defense. His appointment is a significant step toward achieving that goal and will serve as a signal to the Iraqi government that they must choose what is more important to them - an Iraqi nation, or their sectarian self-interests.".
