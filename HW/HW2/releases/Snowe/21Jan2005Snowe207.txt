SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS PRESS SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIALS FOR INCREASED DD(X) PRODUCTION
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins today held a meeting on Capitol Hill with U.S Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Secretary of the Navy Gordon England.  
 The Senators pressed the case for increased production of the Navy's next generation destroyer, the DD(X), and the importance of Bath Iron Works (BIW) to the nation's defense. Sens. Snowe and Collins also stressed to Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz and Secretary England the importance of maintaining the shipbuilding workload at the nation's shipyards. 
   "The preliminary Department of Defense budget request appears to jeopardize the advances that are already being made to modernize, expand, and strengthen our naval fleet. We intend to do everything we can, and press the case with every military official that we must continue to strengthen the fleet in order to counter current and future threats to our security," said the Senators in a joint statement. "It is also vital to the future health of our national security that we maintain our nation's shipbuilding industrial base. In this area, we are confident that Bath Iron Works is the best at producing the most advanced surface ships necessary to ensure the U.S. Navy is the strongest in the world." 
   In addition, the Senators emphasized to Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz and Secretary England the importance and the unique strengths of the Brunswick Naval Air Station and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, pointing out that the two facilities make important contributions to the nation's defense and to the local communities.
