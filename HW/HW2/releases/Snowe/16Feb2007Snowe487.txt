SEN. SNOWE WORKS TO RESOLVE MAINE PROPANE SHORTAGE
  Concerned about a potential shortage of propane gas in Maine due to both a strike at Canadian National Rail and a rough winter storm, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) called on all parties on Friday, Feb. 16, to work closely to restore the supply as soon as possible.  
   Propane is not only used in industry, but a number of Maine homes depend on it for heating and cooking. And although no homes have lost their supply, Senator Snowe says "that everything must be done to ensure that no Maine residents or small businesses are adversely impacted by this potential shortage." 
   Senator Snowe has been in contact with Canadian National Rail and is working closely with the Canadian Government, the Governor of Maine, and the Maine Emergency Management Agency to avert a potential shortage in the state. Officials say no residents who depend on the gas for heat are expected to go without, but the dwindling supply is causing concern, especially if the event that the railway strike and winter weather continues to slow shipments. Additional supplies are being delivered by sea, after stormy weather had complicated that delivery to a terminal in New Hampshire. It is hopeful that this delivery will buy time for Maine residents while efforts continue to resolve the railroad strike. 
   "This week's rough weather and heavy snowfall have made the resolution of this situation even more of an imperative for all parties involved. I'm hopeful that the dialogue that we initiated today will be productive and allow us to move quickly toward a solution," said Senator Snowe.
