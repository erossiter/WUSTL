SENS. SNOWE, HARKIN INTRODUCE EARLY HEARING DETECTION AND INTERVENTION ACT
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Tom Harkin (D-IA) on Friday, March 30, 2007, introduced bipartisan legislation to improve the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of hearing loss in young children. The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2007 builds on the success of legislation introduced in 1999 by Sens. Olympia Snowe, Tom Harkin, and former Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN). The "Newborn Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act of 1999," helped achieve major progress in screening young children for hearing loss, and today 69 percent of babies are screened for hearing loss before 1 month of age.  
   "With two to three of every 1,000 newborns suffering from partial hearing loss, and more than 12,000 infants suffering from permanent hearing loss, we must ensure that early hearing detection and intervention efforts are championed in Congress," said Senator Snowe. "As the most common birth defect in America , this legislation is vital to ensuring that children receive appropriate treatment to preserve their health and enhance their development." 
   The bill will: 
   * Targeting newborns and infants for universal screening. The legislation promotes programs to identify hearing loss early within newborns and infants. 
   * Supporting needed workforce development. The Act supports the recruitment, retention, education, and training of the qualified personnel and health care providers necessary to serving the needs of children. 
   * Assuring long-term follow-up. The bill institutes measures so that newborns and infants who are identified with a hearing loss through screening receive appropriate follow-up care.
