  Sens.Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded three grants totaling $2,097,925 to Native American tribes in Maine for housing assistance and community development.  
   "This HUD funding will facilitate housing improvements and community development among some of Maine's Native American tribes," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We are pleased to see federal support for such essential projects and worthy causes." 
   The funds are allocated as follows: 
   * $1,023,628 Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) to the Penobscot Tribe of Maine 
   * $714,897 Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) to the Pleasant Point Passamaquoddy Housing Authority

   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds private housing developments to assist in housing opportunities for low income residents. Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBGs) can be used for a variety of eligible affordable housing activities, including operating assistance, development of affordable housing (whether new construction, acquisition, modernization, or rehabilitation of rental or owner-occupied housing), housing services, housing management for low-income housing, crime prevention or model activities. The Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program for Indian Tribes and Alaskan Native Villages is a competitive assistance program, the primary purpose of which is the development of viable Native American communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.
