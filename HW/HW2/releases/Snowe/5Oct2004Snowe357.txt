SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES MAINE NOMINEE TO RECEIVE AMERICAN FFA DEGREE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today congratulated Erin Dwyer of Presque Isle for being nominated to receive the 'American FFA Degree' at the 2004 National Future Farmers of America (FFA) Convention in Louisville, Kentucky later this month.  
 Dwyer, a member of the FFA, was selected for her demonstrated leadership and involvement in her community, and for meeting certain eligibility requirements. 
   "I congratulate Erin on being nominated to receive the American FFA Degree - an honor rightly recognizing her dedication to her community in Presque Isle and to the Future Farmers of America. Erin is an accomplished young leader, embodying the principles of the FFA through her agricultural studies and local activities. I wish her the greatest success as she pursues future opportunities both in the agricultural sector and in her community," said Snowe. 
   FFA is part of the agricultural program that consists of classroom education, hands-on supervised agricultural experience (SAE) and active participation in the FFA. To be eligible for the American FFA Degree, nominees must have earned and productively invested $7,500 through a SAE program in which they start, own, or hold a professional position in an agricultural enterprise. Alternatively, a member may have productively invested at least $1,500 and worked 2,250 hours in excess of scheduled class time.
