SEN. SNOWE JOINS SENATE AMENDMENT OUTLINING CONDITIONS TO BRING U.S. TROOPS HOME
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe announced today that she is the lead Republican cosponsor of an amendment offered by her colleague Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Defense Authorization bill that would affirm the Senate's support of U.S. troops fighting in Iraq, and provide a path forward for bringing our troops home.  
   "Today, I am pleased to cosponsor an amendment by Senator Byrd that re-asserts Congress's constitutionally-mandated war power authority," said Snowe. "I believe this amendment is thoughtful and well-reasoned in its approach, and I hope it serves as a way of bringing members of both parties together to have a realistic debate on the most critical challenges facing our nation at this time. It lays out an explicit plan based on the conditions on the ground - not on timetables that empower the terrorists and leave our troops vulnerable to further attack. It also requires specific quarterly reports from the President to Congress and the American people with regard to the security situation in Iraq. This is critical because the message must be clear - our presence in Iraq is in no way indefinite, open-ended and unconditional. We have a responsibility in Congress to guide those objectives that will allow our troops to come home."
   The amendment: 
   (1) Affirms that it is the policy of the Congress that US forces in Iraq should be returned home at the earliest possible opportunity,
   (2) Sets forth the policy that the democratically elected government of Iraq should take over responsibility for security in Iraq, and that the President should develop and implement a strategy to bring U.S. troops home, consistent with national security interests; and 
   (3) Outlines the conditions under which the authority to maintain U.S. troops in Iraq would expire. Should any of the following conditions exist, the authority to use force under the original resolution would terminate: 
   * When the government of Iraq assumes responsibility for its own security; or 
   * If a multinational peacekeeping force (i.e. UN, NATO) assumes responsibility for security in Iraq; or 
   * If the President certifies that the U.S. has achieved its objectives in Iraq; or 
   * If Congress enacts a joint resolution to terminate the use of force authority. 
   (4) Requires quarterly reports every 90 days submitted to Congress on the security situation in Iraq. The report will describe the numbers, units and capabilities of Iraqi security forces in Iraq; the results of efforts to reduce the presence of U.S. military forces in Iraq; and the contribution of U.S. military forces in Iraq to the national security of the U.S., U.S. foreign policy interests in the Middle East, and progress toward national political reconciliation among all Iraqi political and ethnic entities.
