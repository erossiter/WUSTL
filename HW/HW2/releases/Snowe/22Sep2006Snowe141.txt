SEN. SNOWE JOINS SENATE COLLEAGUES IN PRESSING FOR RESOLUTION OF DETERIORATING SITUATION IN DARFUR, SUDAN
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today joined with a bipartisan group of her colleagues in Washington calling for meaningful and urgent act in response to the deteriorating situation in Darfur, Sudan .  
   Snowe issued the following statement today: 
   Since the conflict in Darfur began in 2003, more than 250,000 Sudanese people have been killed and two million more have been cast from their homes. The situation in southern Sudan is deteriorating rapidly, as the government in Khartoum brazenly prepares to carry out escalated attacks in violation of the May Peace Agreement. Ending the genocide in Sudan represents a humanitarian and moral imperative that must be acted on now by not only the United States , but also the entire international community. 
   I join my colleagues from both parties, gathered today under the leadership of Senator Brownback, in urging both houses of Congress, the President and the international community to immediately take the steps necessary to reverse the course of carnage in Darfur before it descends further into a state of chaos and unfathomable suffering. Congress must pass legislation authorizing funding and other assistance for the extension of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Sudan and directing the President to impose targeted sanctions against Sudanese officials determined to be responsible for human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The United States Government should also work urgently to support NATO and the United Nations in deploying well trained international forces to relieve the African Union troops, expanding and strengthening the mission they have bravely begun.
