SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS OPENING OF MAINE'S FIRST ETHANOL TERMINAL IN AUBURN
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement today after the opening of Safe Handling's new Auburn Biofuels Terminal, the first facility in Maine to import ethanol: 
   "I commend Safe Handling for opening what I trust is the first step in a prosperous renewable fuel industry. Mainers have long recognized that the energy status quo of foreign oil reliance is untenable for our budgets, and our environment. This is a critical development in Maine's renewable fuel infrastructure and I look forward to working with Safe Handling for additional steps in fostering renewable energy."
