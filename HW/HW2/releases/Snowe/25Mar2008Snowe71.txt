SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON REITERATES CALL TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF REAL ID
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today supporting Maine Governor Baldacci's request that Maine driver's licenses continue to be accepted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) following DHS's planned May 11th implementation of the REAL ID program: 
   "As Maine continues to work diligently to improve identification security, I urge Secretary Chertoff to grant the Governor's request for Maine IDs to continue to be accepted for federal purposes following the May 11th implementation of the REAL ID program. As the state and the nation continue to grapple with a sluggish economy and widespread budget shortfalls, this is the wrong time to force an undefined federal mandate on the state that, by all estimates, it cannot afford."
