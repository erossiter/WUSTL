   HUD's Housing Counseling Program supports the delivery of a wide variety of housing counseling services to homebuyers, homeowners, low- to moderate-income renters, and the homeless. The primary objective of the program is to expand homeownership opportunities and improve access to affordable housing. Counselors provide guidance and advice to help families and individuals improve their housing conditions and meet the responsibilities of tenancy and homeownership. Counselors also help borrowers avoid inflated appraisals, unreasonably high interest rates, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and eventually foreclosure. 
   Applicants funded through this program may also provide Home Equity Conversion Mortgage counseling to elderly homeowners who are looking to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, living expenses, or other expenses. 
   The following have been awarded funding under the Fair Housing Initiatives Program: 
   $220,000 to Pine Tree Legal Assistance, Inc. 
   The purpose of the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) is to increase compliance with the Fair Housing Act and with substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. The FHIP was established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 to provide funding to public and private entities formulating or carrying out programs or eliminate discriminatory housing practices.
