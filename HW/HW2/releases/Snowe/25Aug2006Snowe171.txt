SNOWE HAILS FDA APPROVAL OF PLAN B
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today hailed the approval of the emergency contraceptive pill "Plan B" for over-the-counter sale to women age 18 and over by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a positive step for the prevention of unwanted pregnancy.  
   "The long overdue approval of Plan B for over-the-counter sale is a milestone in the fight for reproductive rights, and significant step forward in the efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies," Snowe said. "After three years of frustrating delays, the availability of this emergency contraception without a prescription offers women a safe, effective birth-control option. It should be our goal to help women safely prevent unintended pregnancies through education, information sharing, and safe, effective birth control; the unrestricted availability of Plan B for women over the age of 18 is a sign of progress toward achieving that goal." 
   Senator Snowe has strongly supported the sale of "Plan B" (also known as the "Morning After Pill") without a prescription, and has repeatedly cosponsored legislation to require the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Homan Services to disseminate information on the use, safety, efficacy, and availability of emergency contraception. 
  Emergency contraception pills contain higher levels of a hormone found in standard birth control pills. If taken within 72-120 hours after sex, emergency contraception is up to 89 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. It is not related to RU-486, often referred to as the "abortion pill," which is used to terminate pregnancy up to eight weeks.
