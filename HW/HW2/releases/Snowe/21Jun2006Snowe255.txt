SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $742,500 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY GRANT TO GREENVILLE STEAM COMPANY
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has awarded $742,500 to the Greenville Stream Company to fund the Greenville Composite Biomass Project: Condensing Heat Recovery and Emissions Reduction Test Program. 
   "This funding from the Department of Energy will contribute immensely to the Greenville Steam Company's ongoing biomass energy efforts," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "It is essential that Maine continue to develop and utilize new energy technologies in order to manage waste amounts and keep costs reasonable for the people of Maine."
   The Greenville Steam Company is a highly efficient wood burning plant that produces electricity using only waste wood. Greenville Steam is one of the largest employers in the area and plans to expand in the future. In operation since 1985, they provide power to Central Maine Power Company. 
   The Department of Energy's overarching mission is to advance the national, economic, and energy security of the United States; to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission; and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex.
