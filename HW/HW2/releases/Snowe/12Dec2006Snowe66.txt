SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS INTRODUCE LEGISLATION CRITICAL TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced legislation in the Senate to promote economic development in Northern Maine. The Northern Appalachian Economic Development Act allocates financial resources for an economic development commission, made up of appointed representatives from the respective governors of Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont and a presidential appointee, to supervise $40 million in grants over five years to qualified projects that promote economic development approaches across the forest areas o the four states.  
   "Regional cooperation is one of the best means of fostering economic development in rural Maine. It makes sense that if all the states in northern New England share the goal of increased economic development and face common obstacles to achieving that goal, they should also share in the effort to find a solution," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "We believe that this bill a catalyst for economic growth by providing $40 million in competitive grants throughout the northeast region. This Commission joins the interests of the region to foster a more effective, more comprehensive strategy for improving the economy of each state and the region as a whole." 
   The Northern Appalachian Economic Development Act is the result of a collaborative regional effort to stimulate the forest products industry, rural economies, small business development, and job growth. Senators Snowe and Collins worked closely with the economic development community, state forest associations, state Forest Service directors, conservation groups, and other stakeholders in Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont who wish to encourage economic development while maintaining stability in the natural resource base of the region.
