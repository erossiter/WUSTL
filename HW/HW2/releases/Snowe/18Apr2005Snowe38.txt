SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM SOUTH BRISTOL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met Thursday with 8th grade students from South Bristol. 13 students, 5 parents, and 2 teachers attended.  
 They are visiting Washington, D.C. on a school trip and will spend five days exploring the city. After they met with Sen. Snowe, the students and chaperones went on a tour of the Capitol. 
   "Meeting with school groups that come to visit Washington is always the highlight of my day," said Snowe. "It is wonderful that these students from South Bristol have the opportunity to experience D.C. and learn about their government."
