  Sens. Snowe and Collins today announced that the full Senate has approved $7.86 million for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and $4.69 million for a project at Brunswick Naval Air Station.  
 Funding for these projects was included in the Senate's fiscal year (FY) 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 91 to 0. 
   "The projects at the Brunswick Naval Air Station and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard are valuable to our nation's overall defense," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "We applaud our colleagues for recognizing the importance of these projects by providing substantial funding for them." The FY 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill includes the following funding for Maine: 
   * $7.86 million for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for an acoustic test and calibration facility. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard acoustic testing and calibration facility is the only Navy testing and calibration facility certified to test, calibrate, and certify submarine and all other ship borne hydrophone/transducer equipment. The project relocates and constructs a new hydrophone/transducer test and calibration tank and test control center. 
   * $4.69 million for Brunswick Naval Air Station for a replacement weapons magazine. This project will construct three concrete high explosive magazines with high performance characteristics as applicable, blast protection, lightning protection, ventilation, lighting, earth cover, fire protection, intrusion detection, and communications equipment. Site work will include paving, drainage, and earth cover. The demolition of 15 magazines is included in the scope of this project. 
   The Senate-approved bill will now be reconciled by the House-Senate conference committee.
