SEN. SNOWE REQUESTS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOLLOWING DEVASTATING SNOWSTORM
  Sen. Olmypia J. Snowe (R-ME) has submitted a letter to President George Bush in support of a request for snow emergency assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and a request for declaring an emergency for Cumberland, Washington, and York Counties in Maine.  
   "The extreme weather conditions experienced by so many Mainers this winter have caused significant damage, and they certainly warrant emergency assistance," said Snowe. "It is critical that we supplement local and state resources while efforts are made to return these areas to pre-storm conditions. I hope that the President will carefully and promptly consider this request for federal assistance and respond to the State of Maine as soon as possible." 
   From January 22, 2005 to Sunday, January 23, 2005 a severe snowstorm swept through the states of Maine, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The winter event deposited as much as 23 inches of snow in 24 hours in Cumberland, Washington, and York Counties. Winter Storm Warnings and Blizzard Warnings were issued by the National Weather service all along Maine's coastline during this time period. Additional, high winds of up to 40 miles per hour were reported, with gusts of 72 miles per hour in Cumberland County, with wind chills of 33 below zero. This rapid snowfall, winds and dangerous wind chill factors crippled municipalities in these counties, causing both municipal and state snow removal activities to go into overtime, incurring greater costs for public safety personnel, equipment costs and sand and salt supplies than normal. A State Emergency Plan was executed on Saturday, January 22, 2005.
