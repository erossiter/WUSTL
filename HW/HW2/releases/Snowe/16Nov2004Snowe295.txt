SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNOUNCEMENT OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on President Bush's selection of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to replace Colin Powell as Secretary of State:  
   "I thank Secretary Colin Powell for his unwavering service to the President and the American people. His leadership over the past four years at the Department of State, during an extremely challenging time in our nation's history, has been nothing short of exceptional. His dedicated, myriad efforts will truly be missed. 
   "Serving as National Security Advisor over the past four years, Dr. Rice has continuously displayed the quality of character that has enabled her to become a respected and proven leader earning the trust and confidence not only of the President, but also the nation. I applaud the President for acting swiftly and decisively today in naming a person of Condoleezza Rice's caliber and stature to the position of Secretary of State."
