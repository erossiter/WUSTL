SEN. SNOWE, FORMER GOV. MCKERNAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF BENNETT KATZ
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe and former Governor John R. McKernan, Jr. today issued the following statement on the passing of Bennett Katz:  
   "We were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of this great Mainer who contributed incalculably to our state throughout his lifetime of service. In particular, he can truly be called the father of modern education in Maine, improving educational opportunities for all who seek them. Whether as a University of Maine System Trustee, or with his Chairmanship of the Joint Legislative Committee on Education or his service with more than ten different educational organizations, his stature as a leader and legislator galvanized people on this critical issue. 
   "Whether in public office or as a successful businessman, he was a positive force for a better Maine - and he had an exceptional, innate talent for bringing out the best in all those around him. A passionate advocate for the causes he believed were important, he was also a consummate gentleman, wonderful friend, and loving and devoted husband and family man. 
   "Our deepest sympathies and our thoughts and prayers go out to Bennett's extraordinary wife, Edith, and to the entire Katz family for this loss that is shared by so many throughout our state."
