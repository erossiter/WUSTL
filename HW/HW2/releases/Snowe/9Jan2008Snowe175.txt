SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FIREFIGHTERS ASSISTANCE GRANTS AWARDED TO MAINE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Assistance program have awarded $102,755 in operations and safety grants to two Maine fire departments. These awards aim to enhance first responders' ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of first-responder personnel, with respect to fire-related hazards. 
   "Nothing is more important than ensuring our fire personnel have the resources they need to keep our families and communities safe," Senator Snowe said. "These grants are essential for our local fire departments to train, equip and evaluate our fire personnel so they can prepare for future fire disasters."
   The Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program is an important component of a coordinated effort to strengthen the Nation's overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and fire-related hazards. Since 2004, with the Fiscal Year 2007 awards, AFG has provided a total of almost $2.2 billion to first-responder organizations to purchase response equipment, personal protective equipment, and vehicles.
   The grants were administered as follows:
   * $74,400 for the Oakland Fire Department 
   * $28,355 for the Sebago Fire Department
