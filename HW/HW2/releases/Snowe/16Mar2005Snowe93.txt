SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS FOR SHIPBUILDING
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today joined as a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Sen.  
 John Warner (R-VA) which would allow the Navy to use advanced appropriations for up to $14 billion a year for its Shipbuilding and Conversion (SCN) account. This legislation will be offered as an amendment to the FY 2006 Budget Resolution. 
   "Given the ongoing War on Terror and the uncertainty of where we will need to project American military power in the future, it is absolutely critical that we give the Navy the tools it needs to maintain robust shipbuilding programs," said Snowe. "If this legislation is adopted, I would strongly urge the Navy to use its new flexibility to provide stability to the DD(X) program and to maintain the current two-shipyard acquisition strategy." 
   Advanced appropriations means that budget authority becomes available one or more fiscal years after the fiscal year covered by the act. This offers the Navy a way to increase the ship-building budget in a way that is more affordable in the short term. Both Secretary of the Navy Gordon England and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark and have testified that tools such as advanced appropriations can help them stabilize the shipbuilding accounts.
