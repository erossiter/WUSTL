SEN. SNOWE SECURES ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY FUNDING FOR MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today successfully secured a significant increase in transportation safety grant funding for Maine in the Surface Transportation Safety Improvement Act of 2005 that passed unanimously out of Committee today. This bill is the safety component of the six-year surface transportation program reauthorization bill, officially named the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act.  
   "With passage of this legislation today, the people of Maine are one step closer to additional federal funding for safer roads. This is a marked increase - from $776,938 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003, the latest year for which complete statistics are available, to an estimated $1.082 million in FY 2006," said Snowe. "This grant funding has proven essential to helping states reduce injuries and fatalities on our roadways and this increase will help to better protect the people of Maine." 
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) provides grants and technical assistance to states and communities and requires each state to have a highway safety program to reduce traffic crashes and deaths, injuries and property damage. This grant funding, which supports the program, is known as Section 402 funding and is apportioned to states based on the ratio of state population to the national population and state public road mileage to the total national public road mileage. This grant funding program was set up by Congress to provide Federal leadership and assistance to state and community highway safety activities. 
   The Surface Transportation Safety Improvement Act includes a steady increase in safety grant funding for Maine: $1.082 million in FY 2006; $1.086 million in FY 2007; $1.147 million in FY 2008; and $1.173 million in FY 2009. Previous Section 402 funding for Maine was less: $776, 938 in 2003; $760, 000 in FY 2002; and $734,545 in FY 2001.
