SEN. SNOWE VOTES AGAINST OMAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) voted against the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement that was passed out of committee today. The full Senate is expected to take up this Free Trade Agreement later this week.  
   Snowe issued the following statement today: 
   "Today, I voted against the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement because it simply does not do enough to protect American workers from unfair and immoral labor practices. Just last month, it was revealed that goods produced in Jordan for sale in the U.S. were made by forced labor. The fact that we cannot prevent these practices from happening with a nation that we currently have a trade agreement is a broad indication that our model for Free Trade Agreements is seriously flawed. In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, it is imperative that we, as a nation, fight for a level playing field for our workers and our companies.".
