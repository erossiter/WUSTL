SEN. SNOWE RESPONDS TO RECORD HIGH COST OF OIL
  As the price of a barrel of oil broached the $100 mark today, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) marked the inauspicious milestone by demanding the release of emergency LIHEAP funds and renewing her call for the country to make drastic changes to its current energy policy.  
   "The escalation in energy prices has elevated the issue from a very troubling burden to a major crisis for many families in Maine and around the country. Heating a home is a basic necessity and the historic costs of heating oil will prove to be an unbearable burden for far too many Mainers. I will continue my efforts to increase funding through the LIHEAP program to reflect the acute rise in prices. Too many Mainers will require additional assistance to make it through this upcoming winter which is why I am calling on the President today to release the remaining emergency funds in the LIHEAP program. It is essential that we act now to provide this necessary assistance before prices rise any more. 
   "Furthermore, the milestone reached today should compel our country to reflect upon on our entire energy policy. It is baffling that Congress is having difficulty mustering the support for reviving our long dormant energy policy, increasing fuel efficiency, promoting energy efficiency, and investing in renewable resources. Finally, we must provide greater transparency of our futures markets. The recent spike in prices was a direct result of the massive speculation in energy, and we must provide oversight over the market that has such a tremendous impact on the price paid by consumers." 
   SNOWE'S EFFORTS ON ENERGY 
   * Advanced $7.2 million in LIHEAP funding in September to the State of Maine. The emergency release by the Office of Management and Budget came after Senator Snowe intervened and requested the funding in preparation of the coming winter. The funding was able to purchase a higher proportion of fuel than if the funding had been delayed. 
   * Worked with Senator Feinstein on the Energy Prevention off Fraud and Manipulation in Energy Act, which would greatly expand the oversight of "dark market" energy trades. Senator Snowe introduced similar legislation during the 109th Congress and requested a Government Accountability Office study on the issue. The report, released last month, reaffirmed what Senator Snowe stated when she introduced the Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act of 2007 that the expansion of energy traders was causing an upward pressure on energy prices. 
   * Included in the Energy Bill passed in June the first fuel economy increase by Congress since 1975. The bill is expected to save 1.2 million barrels of oil per day and saving consumers roughly $25 billion at the pump in 2020.
