  Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship ranking member Sen. Olympia J. Snowe today commended Mary E. McAleney, Maine District Director of the Small Business Administration, upon the announcement of her retirement effective June 30, 2007.

   "Over the years, I have enjoyed working closely with Mary on numerous issues affecting small businesses throughout Maine and the nation," said Senator Snowe. "Mary has been a tremendous advocate for those businesses and a true public servant to Maine and the nation. Her tireless efforts to serve Mainers will be sorely missed." 
   A native of Maine, McAleney grew up in Vanceboro and attended St. Joseph's Academy in Portland. She is a graduate of Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts. After serving as a teacher at Catherine McAuley High School in Portland, McAleney worked in the Maine Legislature and as a field organizer for the Maine State Employees Association before joining Senator Mitchell.
