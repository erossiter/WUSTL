SEN. SNOWE: SENATE APPROVES ERIC THORSON UNANIMOUSLY AS NEXT SBA INSPECTOR GENERAL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today issued the following statement after the Senate unanimously voted to approve the nomination of Eric Thorson as the Small Business Administration's Inspector General:  
   "Eric Thorson has worked in both the executive and legislative branches under Republicans and Democrats alike and has broad investigative experience that will serve him well in this vital position. The small business community must have a determined Inspector General committed to the proper administration of small business programs and laws, including oversight of SBA's business loans programs and the enforcement of government-wide contracting rules. The SBA Inspector General also confronts enormous challenges, such as the ongoing response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   "Therefore, it is imperative that the new Inspector General be aggressive and tireless. I expect Mr. Thorson to provide strong and steady leadership at this pivotal juncture on behalf of America's 25 million small businesses and their employees."
