SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS LANDMARK FISA BILL THAT INCLUDES NEW OVERSIGHT, UPHOLDS CIVIL LIBERTIES
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, announced today that the United States Senate passed bipartisan legislation to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). 
   "Today, the Senate adopted a broad, bipartisan renewal of FISA that balances the need to uphold critical constitutional protections while also securing our nation against future terrorist attacks," Senator Snowe said. "This bill imposes clear procedures to ensure that the privacy rights of Americans are protected and that the American intelligence community has the clear legal authority to conduct the complex and necessary operations to keep our nation safe from terrorism and other foreign threats."
   The FISA bill passed by the Senate explicitly mandates court approval and congressional oversight of government surveillance operations and ensures that for the first time ever, American citizens and permanent residents traveling abroad cannot be targets of surveillance without a court order. 
   Senator Snowe added, "I understand there are serious concerns surrounding this program, but this legislation ensures a rightful place for the courts going forward in evaluating surveillance measures in both the U.S. and abroad, while allowing the Intelligence Community to devote its full efforts to fighting the war on terror."
