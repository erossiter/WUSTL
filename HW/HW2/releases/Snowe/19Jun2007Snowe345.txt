SEN. SNOWE, GOV. MCKERNAN ISSUE STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CHARLES BRAGG
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe and former Gov. Jock McKernan issued the following statement today on the passing of Charles Bragg:  
   "Charles Bragg was a devoted father, husband, and friend - and his lifetime of civic leadership to Bangor and the state of Maine will never be forgotten," said Snowe and McKernan. "Whether he was dedicating himself to the viability and future of Bangor schools and libraries - or lending his vast intellect and resourcefulness to Healthcare Charities, Charles always placed a premium on advancing the common good and was an abiding inspiration to us all. His tremendous legacy of contribution and immense generosity of spirit formed the linchpins of his life and his legendary Maine family, and, gratefully, that sensibility of giving back has been passed on to the next generation. Like many in Bangor, our admiration for Charles was boundless. He will be greatly missed."
