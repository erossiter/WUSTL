SEN. SNOWE FIGHTS FOR PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today voted for an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution that would provide an additional $550 million for Amtrak in Fiscal Year 2007. This would bring Amtrak's total allocation up to $1.45 billion. The amendment, introduced by Sen. Santorum (R-PA), was defeated by a vote of 38-60.  
   "For states like Maine, where Amtrak provides an economic link to New England and the rest of the country, cuts in funding could be devastating," said Snowe. "While I am disappointed that the Senate did not pass this amendment, I remain committed to ensuring that our national system - including the Downeaster in Maine - receives the support it deserves." 
    Funding Amtrak at $1.45 billion in Fiscal Year 2007 would ensure continued operation of the national Amtrak system and will also fund ongoing capital investment in the Northeast Corridor and long-distance train fleet. Senator Snowe has long been a supporter of Amtrak, including the popular 'Downeaster' service offered from Boston to Portland.
