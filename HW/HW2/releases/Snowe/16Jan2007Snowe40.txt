SEN. SNOWE JOINS BUSH AT SIGNING OF LEGISLATION CRITICAL TO MAINE FISHERIES INTO LAW
  At an Oval Office ceremony on Tuesday morning, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Ranking Member of the Senate Fisheries and the Coast Guard Subcommittee, joined President Bush as he signed legislation critical to Maine and the Nation's fisheries into law. Sen. Olympia Snowe was joined at the ceremony by a bipartisan group of House and Senate members including Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK), and Reps. Richard Pombo (R-CA), Nick Rahall (D-WV), Don Young (R-AK), Jim Saxton (R-NJ), Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD), and Frank Pallone (D-NJ). 
   The reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act from Fiscal Year 2007 through Fiscal Year 2013 will, for the first time, prohibit overfishing in future fisheries management plans. It also contains provisions that would help improve international fishery management and conservation compliance, with an emphasis on strengthening controls on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Snowe has long fought for the reauthorization of the MSA and worked closely with both House and Senate Members to build consensus prior to its December 7th passage.  
   "The Magnusson-Stevens Act has traveled a long and often difficult road in the Congress to become law today. But, after years of discussion and debate on this critical issue, a framework for the national fishing industry has been created that strikes a thoughtful balance between marine environments and the importance of commercial fishing to coastal communities in Maine and throughout the nation," Snowe said. "I was proud to join the President today in the Oval Office as he signed this critical legislation into law. And I am especially proud that Members in both the House and the Senate continued to work toward a bipartisan solution in the final days of the 109th Congress to reach this bipartisan solution that will help both fish and fisherman." 
   The Magnuson -Stevens Act (MSA) reauthorization bill retains key provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) that was passed in 1996, while making adjustments to the legislation designed to improve national compliance with the Act. MSA, originally enacted in 1976, was most recently amended through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) of 1996, and establishes a national framework for conserving and managing marine fisheries within a 200-mile wide zone contiguous to the United States through eight Regional Fishery Management Councils. 
   Snowe successfully added provisions to the bill that are critical to Maine and New England in the legislation: 
   * Provisions that ensure that, at the end of any quota development process in New England, two-thirds of eligible fishermen would be required to approve the plan before it could be implemented. 
   * The bill directs fisheries managers to utilize economic and social data and assessment methods based on the best information available, analyze the cumulative impacts of management measures, and explore possible mitigation measures for minimizing the impacts of management plans, all of which are critical for ensuring management accountability to fishing communities. 
   * Language directing managers to consider steaming time, or the time it takes fishermen from different states to transit to distant fishing grounds, in their management plans, so that fishermen may not lose their fishing days-at-sea. 
   * In addition, this legislation contains language requiring the Secretary of Commerce to complete a comprehensive study of the economic and social impacts of regulations contained in Framework 42, the updates to Amendment 13. These rules, implemented in November 2006, require additional cuts in groundfishing effort in New England, and this study will ensure that the full range of impacts and mitigation measures are identified and addressed by regulators. 
   * Provisions requiring the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to make clearer rules for streamlining the criteria and approval of Experimental Fishing Permits (EFPs), or special permits to allow fishermen to test new gears or methods not otherwise allowed under fishing rules. New England groundfishermen have been applying for EFPs for several years; however, NMFS has been unable to approve most of these requests under their current management system, because of procedural and administrative technicalities. 
   * The bill authorizes a cooperative research study of herring in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem to help answer questions about stock size and distribution, which are necessary to effectively manage herring and other fisheries that depend upon herring. 
   * The legislation addresses stressed groundfish stocks, like cod. Right now, certain state-licensed fishermen in New England are harvesting cod, one of the most depleted species in the federally-managed groundfish complex. Language contained in this legislation would require NMFS to determine if state fishing is inconsistent with Amendment 13, and if so, to take action to correct it. 
   * Another provision allows for a waiver of the U.S. processing requirement for fisheries that can show historic practice of processing in other countries that have comparable food safety standards, which would allow Maine herring fishermen to continue using Canadian processors. To help new domestic processors get off the ground in places like Maine where a processing void exists for some fisheries, Snowe included a provision that directs the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Small Business Administration and other federal assistance agencies to facilitate U.S. investment in processing.
