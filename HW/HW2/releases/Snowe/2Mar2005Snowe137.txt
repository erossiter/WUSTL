SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDS TO MAINE FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $647,037 awarded to four fire and rescue departments in Maine from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding is provided through the "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program," or FIRE Act. 
   "It is essential to ensure that Maine fire departments have the proper training and equipment to protect the communities that they serve," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The grants awarded by the Department of Homeland Security go a long way toward preparing fire departments to respond most effectively in case of an emergency." 
   The following departments will receive funding: 
   * $225,000 to the North Yarmouth Fire Department for Firefighting and Vehicle Acquisition Program. 
   * $23,337 to the Yarmouth Fire and Rescue for Operations and Firefighting Safety Program. 
   * $209,700 to the South Hiram Fire Department for Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program. 
   * $189,000 to the LaGrange Fire Department for Firefighting and Vehicle Acquisition Program. 
   The Operations and Firefighting Safety Program consists of training, equipment, wellness and fitness as well as modifications to the fire station's facilities. The Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program provides various equipment, such as pumpers, brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, quints, aerials, foam units, and fireboats. 
   FIRE Act Grants were created with strong endorsement from Senators Snowe and Collins. These grants are awarded to fire departments across the United States to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety programs and to purchase new fire equipment.
