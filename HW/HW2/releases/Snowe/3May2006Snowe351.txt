  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) in the Department of Education has awarded the Canadian-American Center at the University of Maine, Orono a grant of $94,000 under the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships (FLAS) Program. The University of Maine Canadian-American Center, along with the Center for the Study of Canada at SUNY-Plattsburgh, comprise the Northeast Consortium for Canadian Studies which is a national leader in teaching, research, and outreach on Canada. The University of Maine will use this funding to further develop its Canadian and cross-border cartography initiative and to complete a professional review of all its programs.  
   "This funding from the Department of Education will bolster an exceptionally unique educational program at the University of Maine," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The Canadian-American Center, appropriately located in Maine, facilitates invaluable research, community outreach, and learning opportunities and deserves continued federal support of its programs." 
   The Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowships Program allocates fellowships to institutions of higher education or consortia of these institutions to assist meritorious students undergoing graduate training in modern foreign languages and related area or international studies.
