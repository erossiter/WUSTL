BRAC COMMISSIONER TO VISIT DEFENSE FINANCE, ACCOUNTING SERVICE CENTER IN LIMESTONE
  Today Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) announced that BRAC Commissioner Lloyd W. Newton will visit the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Center in Limestone.  
 The BRAC Commission has not yet set a date for this visit. Until today, it had been uncertain whether or not BRAC commissioners would visit DFAS in Limestone. 
   "We thank BRAC Commissioner Newton for making a commitment to visit the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center in Limestone. He will have the opportunity to see firsthand a facility that earned the "Heroes of Reinvention" award for its accomplishments in making government work through superior customer service. This facility stands head and shoulders above the rest, with low operating costs, a quality labor force, excellent service to customers, and the ability to provide a quality living environment for employees and their families. We look forward to showing Commissioner Newton why this superior facility should not be slated for closure."
