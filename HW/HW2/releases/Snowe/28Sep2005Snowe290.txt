SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $400,000 IN FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY POLICING IN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) announced that the Maine Community Policing Institute at the University of Maine at Augusta has been awarded a $400,000 grant from The U.S. Department of Justice of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS.)  
   "The Maine Community Policing Institute is able to provide community policing assistance around the State due, in part, to the continued support of the Department of Justice. Community policing is an innovative and effective tool in ensuring the safety of residents in communities throughout Maine," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. 
   The United States Department of Justice aims to ensure fair and impartial administration, enforce the law, defend the interests, and promote justice for all Americans. Every region of the U.S. has Regional Community Policing Institutes specializing in issues pertinent to that area. Community Policing increases public confidence and participation in law enforcement.
