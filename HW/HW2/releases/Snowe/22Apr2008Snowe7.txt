SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF GENETICS NONDISCRIMINATION BILL
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) called on the Senate today to once again pass the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The bill would protect individuals from discrimination in health insurance and employment on the basis of genetic information. GINA has twice unanimously passed the Senate, 98-0 in February 2005 (S. 306), and 95-0 in October 2003 (S. 1053). The House companion bill passed in April of 2007 by a 420-3 (H.R. 493) vote. 
   "More than a decade after we began the effort to protect Americans from genetic discrimination, the Senate is finally poised to see the fruition of those efforts," said Senator Snowe, the bill's author. "Utilizing genetic testing can improve health, reduce spending and lower health care costs. Yet our laws have not kept pace with emerging technology, and doubts about the misuse of genetic information are preventing Americans from getting tested."
   When the National Institutes of Health offered women genetic testing, nearly 32 percent of those who were offered a test for breast cancer risk declined to take it citing concerns about health insurance discrimination.
   Senator Snowe noted, "The federal government invested $3.7 billion to map the human genome. Yet its potential will never be unlocked if Americans fear discrimination in the workplace - or denial of health care. We must protect individuals against genetic discrimination. This bill is truly, as Senator Gregg called it, the first civil rights act of the 21st Century."
