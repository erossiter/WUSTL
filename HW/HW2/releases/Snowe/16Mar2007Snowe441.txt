SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ASK FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR FORMER MOOSEHEAD EMPLOYEES
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) on Friday, March 16, requested that the U.S. Department of Labor approve a National Emergency Grant for the 126 workers who lost their jobs after Moosehead Manufacturing closed two plants in Dover-Foxcroft and Monson in February.  
   Senators Snowe and Collins wrote a letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao requesting immediate approval of a grant for $395,678 for the employees, 90 of which were laid-off from their jobs immediately. The funding will be used to provide support for reemployment efforts, including recruitment, outreach, assessment, business outreach, job development, and placement for the affected workers. 
   "This National Emergency Grant is critical to helping the former employees of Moosehead Manufacturing receive the assistance that they need," noted Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "It is our hope that the Department of Labor can immediately approve this request for these workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own."
