 This federal funding is for projects focusing on the prevention of fire-related injuries to children.
   "This federal support will help fire departments improve training and safety procedures - helping assure the outstanding fire protection upon which the surrounding communities depend," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We are encouraged that FEMA remains committed to this program, which is so essential to providing adequate protection to Maine's rural and suburban communities."
   The federal grants were awarded to the following recipients:
   * $372,225 to the Oakland Fire Department
   * $37,927 to the St. Agatha Fire Department
