SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS PRICE GOUGING LEGISLATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today voted for legislation introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) to prevent price gouging on oil and gas products in the wake of future disasters. This narrowly tailored price gouging law, which does not preempt state laws, provides national protection without harming existing protections in Maine. The Senate defeated this amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill by a vote of 42 to 57.  
   "The high price of fuel is hitting Americans hard, especially in rural states such as Maine, where people have no choice but to drive long distances to and from work and to do their shopping," said Snowe. "Using a horrible disaster as an excuse to prey on these consumers and charge an outrageous price for gas is a despicable practice that should not be tolerated. Passing this amendment would have sent a powerful message to those who would profit from the misfortune of others." 
   The amendment contains the following provisions: 
   * Creates a new ban on price gouging during national energy emergencies declared by the President. This anti-gouging standard is based on the successful New York law. 
   * Gives the Federal Trade Commission, State Attorneys General and the Department of Justice the authority to levy civil and criminal penalties for proven price gouging of up to $3 million and five years in jail. 
   * On an ongoing basis, puts in place a new ban on market manipulation and giving false information about fuel prices to the government --based on provisions in the energy bill, related to electricity and natural gas. 
   * In addition to existing remedies available under the FTC Act, gives the FTC authority to levy fines of up to $1 million for violations of the market manipulation and false information prohibitions.
