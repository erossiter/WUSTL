SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE 'ASSETS FOR INDEPENDENCE' FUNDING FOR MAINE
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and U.S. Senator Susan Collins today announced that two Maine community programs will be receiving a combined $332,059 in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Assets for Independence Program to help low-income families purchase homes, capitalize a small business, or pursue post-secondary education. 
   "This funding will help many low-income families begin to build the assets that they will need in order to move toward greater self-sufficiency," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement.
   Specifically, the funding will be allocated as follows:
   Penquis Community Action Program Bangor $125,000
   The Residential Care Consortium Portland $207,059
   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, Assets for Independence (AFI) enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement and demonstrate an assets-based approach for giving low-income families a hand up out of poverty. AFI projects help participants save earned income in special-purpose, matched savings accounts called Individual Development Accounts (IDAs). Every dollar in savings deposited into an IDA by participants is matched (from $1 to $8 combined Federal and nonfederal funds) by the AFI project, promoting savings and enabling participants to acquire a lasting asset.
