SEN. SNOWE PLEASED BY REOPENING OF EASTERN GEORGE'S BANK TO FISHING
  As Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, and Coastguard, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today praised a National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announcement to reopen the eastern edge of George's Bank. Snowe has long fought for the interest of Maine's fishermen. This announcement will allow more fishermen access to vital fishing grounds. The area was closed prematurely due to concerns over by-catch issues. However, additional analysis by NMFS has shown that this fishing year's quota can be sustainably caught without exceeding by-catch limits.
   "Today's announcement by NMFS is welcome news for Maine's fishermen who have long struggled to maintain their way of life in the face of adversity," Snowe said. "With Amendment 13 in place, our state's fishermen need every possible opportunity for their industry to remain economically viable and with eastern George's Bank reopened, they now have the opportunity to do just that."
