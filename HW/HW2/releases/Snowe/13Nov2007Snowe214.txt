SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES AWARD OF NEARLY $142 MILLION TO PURCHASE MATERIALS, COMPLETE PRE-PRODUCTION WORK ON DDG 1000 DESTROYER AT BATH IRON WORKS
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that the United States Navy has awarded Bath Iron Works (BIW) in Bath, Maine nearly $142 million under a previously existing contract to purchase materials and complete pre-production work on the DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer. A portion of work under this contract is also being performed in Sanford, Maine.  
   "This is great news for the men and women of Bath Iron Works who have so nobly upheld the yard's centuries' old tradition of building the greatest military ships in the world," said Senator Snowe. "The Future of Bath Iron Works and the United States Navy depends on the successful construction of the next generation DDG 1000 destroyer and I am so pleased to see this contract awarded to such a remarkable and talented group of shipbuilders." 
   The DDG-1000 will operate as an integral component of the Navy's 21st Century Fleet, providing forward presence and deterrence in support of the ground campaign and contribute naval, joint, or combined battle-space dominance in littoral operations. The $141,999,995 being awarded is a cost-reimbursement type modification to a previously awarded contract.
