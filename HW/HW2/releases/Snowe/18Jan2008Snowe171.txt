SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT FOR TIMELY STIMULUS PACKAGE INCLUDING SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF
  In response to his principles for stimulating the economy, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was encouraged that President Bush stated the necessity of quickly passing an economic stimulus package to help hardworking Americans, including measures to help small businesses contribute to economic revitalization as Snowe advocated to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and in a letter to the President this week.
   " The President rightly recognized the seriousness of our economic situation," Senator Snowe said. "We must move quickly to pass a comprehensive stimulus package focused on helping those families and individuals who have been hard-hit particularly by job losses and soaring energy prices -- and will use the funds to pay for vital necessities. Certainly, having talked to many people in Maine , where oil and gas prices are so extraordinarily burdensome, we must act now. I'm also pleased the President supports the inclusion of small business measures in a stimulus package, as I've consistently said they are critical to stabilizing the economy given that small businesses comprise 99.7 percent of all employer firms." 
   Senator Snowe added, "Today's address is an important step in giving confidence to the American people that, above everything else, the President and the Congress will work together in a bipartisan, collaborative manner to address vital economic concerns for hardworking Americans. Both parties and both branches have a collective obligation to demonstrate we have the capacity to address the critical issues facing this nation," she continued.
   In a letter to the President sent Thursday, Senator Snowe called for an expansion of small business expensing and targeted tax incentives including the extension of the R&D Tax Credit.
   Specifically, Senator Snowe has urged the Administration to include measures:
   Increase Small Business Expensing to $200,000: Small businesses in 2008 may write-off the cost of up to $128,000 in new equipment. Senator Snowe has introduced legislation, S. 269, to permanently raise this figure to $200,000 to help spur new purchases. Increasing small business expensing would give qualifying firms the incentive to make job-creating investments in their plant and equipment.
   Lengthen Carryback Period of Net Operating Losses to Five Years: Businesses can generally carryback their net operating losses (NOLs) for two years. That is, if a taxpayer experiences a loss this year, but had profits in either of two previous years, that taxpayer can use the loss to offset prior-year gains and file for a tax refund. Extending the NOL carryback period to five years, through 2009, would provide taxpayers a longer period over which to offset current losses. This would help them get money today to sustain operations and continue to employ workers.
   Extend the Research and Development Tax Credit: The Research and Development Tax Credit, which has helped to spur innovation in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing and health care, expired at the end of 2007, as Congress was unable to clear an extenders package. Congress should early this year extend this incentive through at least 2009 to ensure businesses have the resources to invest in cutting-edge technologies that boost economic growth.
   Bonus Depreciation: Generally speaking, when businesses purchase equipment, they must recover the cost (depreciate) the cost of that equipment over a period of years. However, Congress could incentivize businesses to purchase equipment today (keeping factories in business and helping businesses to expand) by allowing businesses to write-off a significant portion of the cost of a purchase in the year it is obtained.
   Senator Snowe also discussed with Secretary Paulson other pending issues instrumental to helping to boost our economy that the Administration and Congress must work to expedite and pass, including:
   * Providing additional funding for the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program
   * Establishing small business health insurance plans
   * Improving small business access to capital
   * Ensuring sufficient funding for the Small Business Administration's (SBA) vital lending and business development programs
   * Reforming regulations for small businesses
   * Passing the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act co-authored by Senator Snowe which extends Trade Adjustment Assistance to workers in the services sector, fishermen, and those affected by "offshoring" to countries like China or India
   * Passing as part of the Farm Bill Conference Report the provision co-authored by Snowe along with Senator Dianne Feinstein to require oversight and transparency for exempt energy futures market trading - as the lack of current oversight in these energy markets is directly contributing to increased energy prices that consumers are paying.
