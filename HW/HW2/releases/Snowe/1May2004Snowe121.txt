SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ASCENSION OF REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS TO EUROPEAN UNION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement hailing the ascension of Republic of Cyprus to full membership into the European Union (EU).  
 Snowe is the first Greek-American woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress. 
   "While I was deeply disappointed that the efforts of U.N. Secretary General Annan and the international community to reunite the island of Cyprus failed, I remain optimistic that Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots will one day share one bond and one island." 
   "Today is a day of historic celebration. I join with Greeks around the world with sharing in the joy and pride of our Greek-Cypriot brothers and sisters as they ascend as full members of the EU. Their journey has been challenging, but their unwavering determination and abominable spirit have culminated in their rightful inclusion within the European Community."
   "As a Greek-American, I am honored that my heritage is cloaked in the rich history of the Greeks. I often find great personal strength rooted in the Greek culture, and reflect upon the inherent values that Greek children are raised with. It is with resounding pride that I proclaim my Greek-American identity."
