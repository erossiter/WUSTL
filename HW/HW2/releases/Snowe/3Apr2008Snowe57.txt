SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH HORATIO ALGER NATIONAL SCHOLAR
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with Horatio Alger National Scholar Ike Brochu from Alfred, Maine.

   "It was a sincere honor to meet with such a bright and dedicated young man," Senator Snowe said. "Ike's perseverance and aptitude will serve him well as a leader among his peers and I applaud the Horatio Alger Association for recognizing and rewarding this promising student."
   As one of the nation's largest need-based college financial aid programs, the Horatio Alger National Scholar Program specifically assists students who have experienced adversities or obstacles in their lives yet have persevered through hard work, strength of character, academic excellence, and a commitment to achieving a college education.
