  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice's Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART) Office awarded $63,000 to the Maine Department of Public Safety as a part of its SMART FY 08 Support for the Adam Walsh Act Implementation Grant Program.  
   These funds will be used to create an internet-based sex offender address verification program that will allow for the speedy and efficient transfer of information to the State Bureau of Identification sex offender registry and to updates its existing records. The grant also allots for the development of a mirror registry to be used by law enforcement agencies in the state of Maine. 
   "When Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act in 2006, it recognized that every community has an obligation to protect its children," Senators Snowe and Collins said. "The funds given by the Department of Justice to implement this critical legislation will help ensure that Maine has the most efficient and up-to-date resources to verify and monitor sex offenders while keeping its children safe."
