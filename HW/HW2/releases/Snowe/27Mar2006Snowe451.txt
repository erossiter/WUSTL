SEN. SNOWE CELEBRATES GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement on 185th anniversary of Greek independence:  
   "The history of the Greek people has left an indelible and lasting legacy on our world today. The cradle of democracy, the country of my ancestors, is the birthplace of all freedom loving peoples. Commemorating the 185th anniversary of Greek independence is an affirmation of not only of the strength of the Greek people, but also of their central role in fostering democratic societies in all corners of the world. 
   "I have always been proud of my forefathers and mothers of my family's home country. I am proud because modern Greece has had a lasting and significant relationship with the United States. In 1821 when modern Greece was founded, it was with the support of America. When the free world stood up against tyranny in the Second World War, Greece fought side by side with the United States and our allies. And when the people of Greece needed the American people to help fight against the tyranny of fascism or communism, our country stepped forward to support them through difficult and dark times. 
   "As a Greek-American and as a United States Senator, I believe that Greek Independence Day must be celebrated not just on the streets of Athens, but also in the streets of Washington and New York as well. Because ultimately, it is our shared values that rest firmly on the democratic legacy of ancient Greece that have propelled our two nations forward together, with an unwavering determination for a more prosperous, more free world."
