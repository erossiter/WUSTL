SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $143,661 IN FUNDING FOR MAINE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE RESOURCES
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and the Coast Guard, announced today that the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has awarded a grant of $143,661 to the Maine Department of Marine Resources in Augusta. This funding will be used to configure a fisheries study that will examine and evaluate multiple species of marine life in the Gulf of Maine in order to efficiently maintain and conserve these valuable resources. 
   "Since the days of colonization, the Gulf of Maine has supported the livelihoods of the people who dwell on its shores," Senator Snowe said. "As Mainers, we must pledge to be stewards of our beloved rocky coast and protect the marine life that inhabits its waters. The funds allocated so generously by the Department of Commerce will contribute to ensuring the strong future of both our coastal industries and the livelihoods our marine counterparts."
   The study assembled by the Maine Department of Marine Resources, titled the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Resource Monitoring Assessment, will conduct research on a variety of marine life, including American lobster, Atlantic Herring, Northern shrimp, sea urchins, halibut, green crab, and sea scallops. The findings of this research will enhance the management and protection of the Gulf of Maine's marine resources.
