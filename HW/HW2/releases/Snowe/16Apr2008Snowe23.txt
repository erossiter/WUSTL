SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW AIR TRAVEL MEASURES
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, issued the following statement today regarding the U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters' announcement that new aviation measures will be implemented to strengthen passenger protections, improve consumer choice and reduce congestion, including doubling the limits on compensation airlines must pay flyers bumped from oversold flights and establishing operational improvements to cut delays this summer: 
   "I am greatly encouraged by the proposals announced today by Secretary Peters, but there remains a considerable amount of hard work still required by the federal government and the airlines, as evidenced by the mass delays America's travelers experienced this week.
   "Given the obvious decline of customer service for our nation's traveling public, it is clear that there has never been a stronger need to enact a Passenger Bill of Rights. The industry has had almost a decade to follow through with basic commitments and they have failed. The time is long overdue for the airline industry to comply with a basic level of service commitments to their customers and if they won't comply, we should demand it."
