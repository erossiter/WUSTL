MAINE DELEGATION PRAISES FEMA'S DECISION TO PROVIDE DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR SIX MORE MAINE COUNTIES
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins and Reps. Tom Allen and Mike Michaud today praised FEMA's decision to provide federal disaster assistance for six more counties impacted by the Patriot's Day storm. Today's amended disaster declaration will release public assistance funds to Franklin, Hancock, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Somerset, and Waldo counties. Last week, President Bush declared that six Maine counties: Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Oxford, and York were eligible for public assistance.  
   "This is great news for the state of Maine and we are pleased that FEMA is currently reviewing incoming damage assessments to help restore our public infrastructure," said Maine delegation members in a joint statement. "This welcomed progress is a step in the right direction and we will continue to work towards helping those affected by the storm." 
   The public assistance funds will provide aid to state and local governments for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster damaged facilities. In addition, all counties in Maine are eligible to apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
   On April 18th, Senators Snowe and Collins and Representatives Allen and Michaud sent a letter to President Bush asking him to expedite the Governor's request for an emergency declaration. As a reminder, all Mainers should directly report property damage to their local emergency management offices.
