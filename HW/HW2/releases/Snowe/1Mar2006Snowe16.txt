  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) has awarded Maine two grants totaling $1,409,991.  
   "This funding from the Department of Health & Human Services will greatly benefit children of Bath as well as facilitate important medical research," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "This Head Start Project in Bath will be instrumental in preparing young children to enter our state's school system, and this upcoming research at Jackson Laboratory is another important step in our state's ongoing health care efforts." 
   The funding is allocated as follows: 
   * $1,157,991 to the Coastal Economic Development, Inc. in Bath for its Head Start Projects, which are part of DHHS's comprehensive child development program that serves children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. The program works to enhance children's self esteem and school readiness skills and supports parents as the primary teachers of their children. 
   * $252,000 to Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor for a research project, entitled "Characterization of the Y-linked Autoimmune Accelerator Yaa." 
   The Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The Department includes more than 300 programs, covering a wide spectrum of activities, and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.
