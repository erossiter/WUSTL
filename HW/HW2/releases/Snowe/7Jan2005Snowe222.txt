SEN. SNOWE PLEASED NMFS WILL OPEN HADDOCK FISHERY TO MAINE FISHERMEN IN OCT. 2005
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries and Coast Guard, today was pleased with a decision of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to allow access for Maine Fishermen to the Haddock Special Access Program (SAP) on Georges Bank in October of 2005.  
 This decision comes after Sen. Snowe urged NMFS to reconsider an earlier decision denying a New England Fishery Management Council request for access in 2004, and possibly 2005. 
   "While I am disappointed that NMFS did not grant the Council's initial request, I am pleased that the agency will allow access to the SAP in 2005," said Snowe. "Maine fishermen deserve access to this potentially lucrative fishery." 
   NMFS has agreed that the Council may re-submit the paperwork for Framework 40-A, which contains the Haddock SAP and that it would be approved for the this year's opening on October 1, 2005. 
   "It is especially encouraging that NMFS worked with the New England Fishery Management Council to reach a solution acceptable to all parties involved," said Snowe. "I hope that we can move forward in a spirit of cooperation as we ensure wise and fair management of New England's groundfish fishery." 
   Senator Snowe sent a letter to NMFS urging it reconsider its decision and strive to immediately identify and implement any remedial measures that could ease the economic burden of the negatively affected non sector fishing vessels. 
   More than eighty fishermen called for a partial approval of a non-sector vessel SAP last month. Many of these fishermen were harmed economically by NMFS' decision, because they have already outfitted their boats for haddock in anticipation of being granted access through the SAP.
