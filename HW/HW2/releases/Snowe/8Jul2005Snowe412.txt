   "Health and Human Services funds support such critical and diverse programs as trauma assistance and advanced nursing education," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This agency gives such programs, and many others, necessary grant money and in doing so contributes greatly to the health and well-being of Mainers across the state." 
   The funding will be allocated as follows: 
   * $297,600 to the Community Counseling Center for the Greater Portland Trauma Assistance Network 
   * $175,000 to the Maine Department of Human Services for a program on early hearing detection and intervention tracking

   The Department of Health and Human Services is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. HHS works closely with state and local governments and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.
