IN ABSENCE OF AGREEMENT SENS. SNOWE, HAGEL OBJECT TO ADJOURNMENT OF SENATE
  In a letter to Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Chuck Hagel (R-Nebraska) urged Senate leadership to postpone adjournment until a "mutually agreeable solution" is reached on how the Senate should debate the Iraq troop increase.  
   Text of the letter sent by Senators Snowe and Hagel is below: 
   February 16, 2007 
   The Honorable Harry Reid The Honorable Mitch McConnell 
   Majority Leader Republican Leader 
   S-221 United States Capitol S-230 United States Capitol 
   Washington, DC 20510 Washington DC 20510 
   Dear Harry and Mitch: 
   This past Wednesday, as you know, we wrote to inform you of our intention to object to any adjournment resolution agreement until the leadership of both parties in the Senate reached a "mutually agreeable solution" to bring the Warner resolution to a vote "in a manner that satisfactorily accommodates both majority and minority viewpoints on the conduct of the war." Two days later, a cloture vote has now been set on the motion to proceed to S. 574, which is the substantive equivalent of H. Con. Res. 63, the House of Representatives Iraq resolution. 
   Regardless of whether the motion to invoke cloture passes or fails, we believe that the Senate should not adjourn for the Presidents' Day recess until a "mutually agreeable solution" is reached on how the Senate should debate the Iraq troop increase. Tomorrow's vote is a step in the right direction. However, we believe it remains critical that you work together to reach mutual agreement on a procedure for debate and votes to accommodate the range of viewpoints within the Senate. Only by adhering to the great Senate traditions of comity and compromise will such a solution be reached. 
   Sincerely, 
   OLYMPIA J. SNOWE CHUCK HAGEL 
   United States Senator United States Senator.
