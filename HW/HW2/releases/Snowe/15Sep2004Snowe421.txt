SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS PRAISE FINAL HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING BILL WHICH INCLUDES PRIORITIES FOR MAINE, NATION
  With the strong support of Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, the Senate has approved the Fiscal Year 2005 (FY) Homeland Security Appropriations bill, totaling $33.8 billion, which includes a number of high priority programs to enhance national security.  
   "This funding bill rightly recognizes the high priority we all must place on securing our airports, ports and other transportation facilities," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The legislation - which constitutes a 9 percent increase over last year's bill - provides crucial funding for emergency preparedness to our first responders, significant federal resources for Border and Customs officials and the U.S. Coast Guard, and vital investments in research and development of advanced screening technologies." 
   The full Senate approved the spending bill 93 to 0. Among the Senators' top priorities included in the Senate-passed bill are: 
   Transportation Security 
   * $5.2 billion for the Transportation Security Administration. $4.386 billion of the funding is for aviation security measures, including $2.076 billion for passenger screening, which includes $161 million for aviation checkpoint security. Also included is $1.437 billion for baggage screening, which includes $210 million for explosive detection systems. $43 million of the total funding is for air cargo security activities, and another $75 million is included for air cargo security research and development. TSA will also receive $44 million for maritime and land security, which includes $15 million for rail security. 
   Borders and Security 
   * $5 billion for the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, including $126 million - a $25 million increase from FY 2004 levels - for expansion of the Container Security initiative, a cargo security program that stations CBP officers in foreign ports to target and pre-screen cargo containers before they are loaded on U.S.- bound ships. The bill also includes $115.1 million for radiation detection and non-intrusive inspection technology used in inspecting conveyances and cargo entering the country at ports of entry, and $37.8 million for the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) - a supply chain security program that engages participating private sector actors in securing their own supply chains. 
   * $3.4 billion for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including $1 billion for investigations and intelligence collection efforts, $663 million for federal air marshals, $340 million for the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program that incorporates biometrics and new technologies into the US VISIT program, and $268 million for air and marine operations. 
   Coast Guard 
   * $7.5 billion for the U.S. Coast Guard, including $5.2 billion for operating expenses. 
   * $776 million for the Deepwater project, included within the $1.1 billion for vessel acquisition, upgrade and maintenance. Deepwater is a 20-year project to recapitalize the Coast Guard offshore fleet of 93 cutters and 207 aircraft that operate more than 50 miles offshore. Completing the project in the shortest time frame possible will ensure that the Coast Guard and our nation have the resources to capably defend against maritime threats far out at sea. 
   Preparedness and Recovery 
   * $3.75 billion for state and local preparedness through programs made available to local units of government, including states, counties, towns, and other subdivisions of states. The funding includes $1.4 billion to be made available to states within 30 days of enactment of the Appropriations Bill through formula-based grants. 
   * $1.2 billion for urban area security initiative discretionary grants, including $150 million for port security and $150 million for rail and transit security. 
   * $750 million for the Firefighter Assistance program, to be kept in a separate account and managed in accordance with the existing FIRE Act. 
   Miscellaneous 
   * $69 million for grants allocated for university research programs. These competitive grants will continue to fund critical research initiatives within the University of Maine system. 
   * $224 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. 
   * $140 million for Citizenship & Immigration Services to fund backlog reduction activities - a $60 million increase - to aid in attaining a 6-month processing time for all immigration benefit applications by FY 2006. 
   * $33.6 million for high explosives countermeasures, including $23.9 million for rail security technology. 
   * $17.8 million for cyber-security technology and initiatives. 
   The spending bill will now be reconciled with the House-passed FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill in the House-Senate Conference Committee.
