SEN. SNOWE OPPOSES MOVING FORWARD WITH COASTAL DRILLING BILL
  Citing a lack of protection for Maine's coast and fuel conservation provisions, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted in opposition of proceeding with debate in the U.S. Senate of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. This legislation would expand the areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) available for drilling in search of oil and natural gas.  
   "I could not support legislation that would open the door to drilling off Maine's coast while also ignoring the need to address energy conservation diversification," Said Snowe. "Unfortunately, amendments that I supported that would have extended the moratorium on offshore drilling and addressed fuel economy standards in our automobile fleets were not allowed. Without these amendments, there are no assurances that Maine's coast will be protected when this legislation is reconciled with the House of Representatives. As such, I voted against proceeding with this legislation." 
  The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act would authorize drilling in Lease Area 181, a 3-million-acre area on the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida. Broader legislation passed by House in June would effectively repeal a 25-year-old federal moratorium on offshore drilling for oil and gas in many areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Deep Ocean Energy Resources (DOER) Act, which is not specific to Lease Area 181, was passed by the House 232-187.
