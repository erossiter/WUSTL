SEN. SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL STRENGTHENING CONTRACTUAL OVERSIGHT OF COAST GUARD PROCUREMENTS IN DEEPWATER PROGRAM
  As Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Wednesday, March 21, joined the Chair of the Subcommittee Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), in introducing bi-partisan legislation that would establish stricter procurement guidelines for the U.S. Coast Guard's Deepwater Program. "The Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act" prohibits the use of private sector entities as a "lead systems integrator" without the approval of an independent third party and ensures "full and open competition" in procurements in the Deepwater Program which include the National Security Cutter and other vital assets of the Coast Guard. 
   Deepwater-a partnership between the Coast Guard and a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, known as Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS)-is a 25-year, $24 billion initiative to replace the aging fleet of Coast Guard assets used in missions more than 50 miles from the coast. The program is plagued by cost overruns, debilitating design flaws, ships and technology that fall far short of contract requirements, and a contract structure that strips the Coast Guard of oversight and decision-making authority.  
   "Since the missteps, mistakes, and mismanagement of the Deepwater Program first came to light, I have been deeply troubled by the serious shortcomings of the procurement system used to purchase, build, and maintain the most vital component of the Coast Guard fleet. This legislation would strengthen the contractual oversight and enhance the financial discipline that is desperately needed to move this critical program forward," says Senator Snowe, Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard. The Committee has been investigating shortcomings in the Coast Guard procurement system in the Deepwater Program since last year. 
   If approved by Congress, the legislation introduced today would: 
   * Direct the Coast Guard to stop using a Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) on future Deepwater acquisitions. 
   * Allow the Coast Guard to use the LSI to complete any specific work for which a contract or order had already been issued. 
   * Allow the Coast Guard to use the LSI to complete the C130-J modifications, the C4ISR program, and also to complete procurements of the National Security Cutters (NSCs) and Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) already under contract for construction. However, the LSI must have no financial interest in subcontracts or have competed for the subcontracts. 
   * Allow the Coast Guard to use the LSI to complete all of the remaining NSCs and MPAs only after an analysis of alternatives has been conducted, and if the Coast Guard concludes that these procurements and use of an LSI are in the best interests of the federal government, that justifications for not competing assets under the Federal Acquisition Regulations are met, and that the LSI has no financial interest in subcontracts or has competed the subcontracts. 
   In addition, the measure require the Commandant of the Coast Guard to certify to Congress prior to issuing new contracts for specific proposed acquisitions that the proposed asset meets objective criteria on feasibility, maturity of design, and costs. A similar requirement applies to Department of Defense contracts. 
   "Our brave men and women in the Coast Guard currently operate the third oldest naval fleet in the world, which is a real travesty. In recent weeks, I have commended the Coast Guard for gaining control over elements of this program. This legislation, however, is needed to ensure that the interests of the American taxpayers are protected and that our Coast Guard has the latest, most technologically advanced systems to match the honor of its service to our nation," said Senator Snowe.
