SEN. SNOWE LAUNCHES INTERACTIVE FORUM FOR MAINE'S VETERANS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) continued her efforts to serve Maine's veterans on Tuesday, March 6, by launching an interactive forum on her website, www.Snowe.Senate.gov. The forum will offer Maine military veterans the opportunity to share their experiences with military hospital and recuperation facilities, as well as support services provided by the Veterans Administration.  
   "The recent revelations of the deplorable conditions of military hospitals and recuperation facilities treating our wounded warriors have justifiably left Americans aghast that those heroic servicemen and women who have so honorably risked their lives in service to our country are currently convalescing under absolutely unacceptable circumstances. Like every American, I believe these findings to be nothing less than disgraceful - and frankly disrespectful of all who so nobly wear our nation's uniform. 
   "Moreover, I want to hear the individual stories, the personal experiences that Maine veterans have to share - the successes, the failures, what works and what doesn't. That is why I am asking you to contact me directly and tell me your story. I want to know how our Maine soldiers, reservists, National Guard and veterans have been treated upon their return, especially those of you who required medical treatment, be it physical, spiritual or mental. If you know of a fellow veteran who does not have access to this site, please let me know how to contact them so I can hear their story as well. 
   Casework for Maine military veterans will continue to be handled by Senator Snowe's staff in all six district offices. Constituents should contact the representatives in the office closest to them to request an individual Congressional Inquiry:
