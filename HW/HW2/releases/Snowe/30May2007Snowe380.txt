SEN. SNOWE PARTICIPATES IN SENATE WOMEN FORUM ON DECLINING MAMMOGRAM RATES ON MAY 30
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today attended a forum hosted by the Dean of the Senate Women Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) to discuss a recent report citing the alarming drop in women getting mammograms to screen for best cancer. Sen. Olympia Snowe joined her Senate colleagues in questioning a panel of experts who recently authored a report by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the dramatic decline of mammogram rates.  
   "Today, when one woman in eight can expect to develop breast cancer in her lifetime, the change in direction from increased screening to reduced vigilance must be addressed," said Senator Snowe. "All women must be afforded the same access and opportunities to utilize prevention tools that help keep us healthy. I look forward to working with all my Senate colleagues to ensure that every American woman - regardless of economic status or location - has the resources necessary to preventing and treating cancer." 
   Senator Snowe was joined by Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Debbie Stabenow (D- MI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).
