SEN. SNOWE REACTS TO ADDITIONAL PENTAGON PICTURES DETAILING IRAQI PRISONER ABUSE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement after viewing additional pictures detailing Iraqi prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.  
 Snowe examined the images today in a classified viewing room on Capitol Hill set-up by the Department of Defense. 
   "I am deeply disturbed by the additional images I viewed today. Words fail to describe these images, which, in graphic detail, depict the deplorable and flagrant abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison." 
   "As we continue investigate the full extent these abuses, I firmly believe that Congress must vigorously fulfill its constitutional oversight role to ensure that our nation receives a comprehensive account for what went wrong to ensure this never happens again."
