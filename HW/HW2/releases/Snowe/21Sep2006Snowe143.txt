SEN. SNOWE, SINGER/SONGWRITER JEWEL DISCUSS CRITICAL BREAST CANCER PATIENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION
  This afternoon, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) met with Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter Jewel to discuss ways to move the bipartisan Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act that Snowe introduced with Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) through the Congress. Jewel's visit to Washington is part of Lifetime Television's "Stop Breast Cancer for Life" campaign. More than 12 million online petition signatures were delivered to Capitol Hill today urging Congressional action on Snowe's legislation that would end the practice of "drive through" mastectomies, where women are forced to leave the hospital sometimes just hours after the physically and emotionally difficult surgeries even if their doctors feel they are not ready to go home.  
   "For far too long, a breast cancer diagnosis has meant uncertainty and fear for too many women, and traditional health care coverage has failed to do enough to ease that fear or confront this pervasive and life-altering disease," said Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME). "The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005 that I have introduced in the Senate creates a set of crucial measures to ensure appropriate treatment and reasonable in-patient care for women who undergo invasive treatment for breast cancer. Confronting breast cancer should be done with comfort, care, and the information necessary to fight fear and uncertainty. As a woman and a member of the United States Senate, I pledge to continue working with my colleagues in Congress in concert with Lifetime Television and committed activists like Jewel to lead the charge and raise our nation's awareness about breast cancer." 
   The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005, which currently has 17 Senate co-sponsors and 179 House co-sponsors and, was introduced by Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA) in the Senate and Representatives Kelly (R-NY) and DeLauro (D-CT) in the House. The legislation, modeled after a 1996 law that banned "drive-through" baby deliveries, would: 
   * Guarantee a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for a woman having a mastectomy or lumpectomy, and 24 hours for a woman undergoing a lymph node removal; 
  * Require health plans to include notice of these benefits in their monthly mailing and yearly information packet sent to plan participants; and 
  * Require plans to provide full coverage of second opinions should the patient seek one. 
   The bill does not mandate a 48 hour hospital stay nor does it set 48 hours as a maximum amount of time a woman can stay in the hospital. It simply ensures that any decision in favor of a shorter or longer hospital stay will be made by the patient and her doctor.
