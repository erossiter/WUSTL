SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM NARRAGUAGUS HIGH SCHOOL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with members of the junior and senior U.S. Justice class at Narraguagus High School in Harrington.  
 Accompanied by their teacher Cindee Santomango, the group of 7 students discussed their questions about the U.S. government and the democratic process, while relating their concerns over various federal laws.
   "I enjoyed meeting with a group of Narraguagus High School students today who have taken an active role in understanding our nation's democratic process by visiting Washington. They articulated their thoughtful views and concerns - particularly with respect to politics, government and international affairs - with mature conviction, serving as a reminder that our younger generations are ready, willing, and able to assume their rightful role as tomorrow's leaders," Snowe stated.
