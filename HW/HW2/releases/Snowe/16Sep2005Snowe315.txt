SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE SUITS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that a contract of $27,984,750 has been awarded to Source for Native American Products (SNAP) of Eastport in partnership with Creative Apparel of Belfast from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to make chemical protective suits for the military. 
   "It is absolutely vital that the men and women serving in our armed forces have access to the most advanced protective gear possible so that they will be safe during combat," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We are proud that a Maine company has received this contract and that Maine can contribute to our national defense." 
   The companies, both owned by the Passamaquoddy Tribe Indian Township, will be using the funds to manufacture JSLIST Chemical Suits for Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The suits will also be manufactured at six other locations throughout the state in Belmont, Harmony, Dover Foxcroft, Princeton, and Fort Kent. 
   The Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology, or JSLIST, consists of a two piece garment designed to replace the Navy's existing Chemical Protection Over garment (CPO). The JSLIST garment features state-of-the-art chemical protective lining technology which provides increased chemical protection.
