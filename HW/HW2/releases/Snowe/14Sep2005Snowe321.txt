SEN. SNOWE RECEIVES NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AWARD FROM PREVENT CHILD ABUSE AMERICA
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today received a National Leadership Award from Prevent Child Abuse (PCA) America for her longstanding work to promote child welfare.  
   "It is indeed an honor to be recognized by Prevent Child Abuse America, an organization that has long been an advocate for abused and neglected children in our country," said Snowe. "The unconscionable act of mistreating a child has no place in our society, and we must work together to eliminate this devastating crime. Every child deserves to be treated with love and respect and I pledge to continue my work to make sure that children are given every opportunity possible to thrive and grow in a positive environment." 
   During the 108th Congress, Snowe introduced the "Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2003" along with Senator Jay Rockefeller. This legislation creates a grant program to promote collaborations among federal, state, and local public child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment agencies. She has also supported the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) and has taken the lead on including a $6 billion increase in childcare funds in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reauthorization bill. 
   Prevent Child Abuse (PCA) America is a national nonprofit with 40 state affiliates, including Prevent Child Abuse Maine. Founded in 1972, PCA America is the premiere organization working to prevent child abuse and neglect. In collaboration with their state affiliates, they work to promote and implement prevention efforts at the national and local levels.
