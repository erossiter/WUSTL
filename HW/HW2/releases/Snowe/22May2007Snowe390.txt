SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTANCE OF LAW OF THE SEA
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, (R-Maine), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation's subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, today recognized the Bush Administration's declaration that the United States Senate should accede to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a critical step in maritime jurisdiction. This measure is commonly referred to as the Law of the Sea Treaty and was agreed to by 160 nations, including the U.S. , in 1982, and entered into force internationally in 1994. The accord regulates activities occurring on or beneath the world's oceans including maritime boundaries, navigation rights, and minerals extraction.  
   "Our oceans drive our economy, regulate our climate, and harbor invaluable living and non-living marine resources," said Senator Snowe. "I am pleased that President Bush has lent his support for the Law of the Sea Treaty that I see as a critical step in protecting both the marine environment and our maritime sovereignty. I join his call urging my Senate colleagues to act quickly on accession to this landmark international agreement." 
   Senator Snowe noted that in addition to strengthening the U.S. position establishing an exclusive economic zone extending to 200 miles from its shores, the Law of the Sea Treaty will give the United States a seat at the negotiating table for future maritime decisions. These are likely to include determination of rights to potentially valuable mineral resources in the Arctic Ocean . 
   "Accession to the Law of the Sea Treaty will give the United States a strong foundation upon which we can further establish our leadership role in international ocean policy," Senator Snowe said.
