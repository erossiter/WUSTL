SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $50 MILLION FOR CALAIS BORDER STATION IN PRESIDENT'S FY 2006 BUDGET
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today praised President Bush for including in his Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Budget $50,146,000 for the construction of a new border station in Calais, ME.  
 Snowe has long fought to secure increased federal support for the Calais-St. Stephen, New Brunswick border crossing as it serves as essential economic link between Maine and Atlantic Canada. 
   "The President's budget includes some tremendous news for the people of Calais: over $50 million for the actual construction of the Calais border station. I thank the administration for recognizing its overall importance as the eighth busiest commercial crossing on the Canadian border to connecting Calais to St. Stephen. A new border crossing will not only dramatically increase trade efficiency between the United States and Canada, but it will also improve border security," said Snowe. 
   The current crossing in Calais is the 8th busiest commercial crossing on the Canadian border and has seen truck traffic double over the last ten years. 
   The General Services Administration is responsible for designing and constructing a new border station. The Maine Department of Transportation (MDOT) is responsible for American-side highway improvements and half the cost of a new international bridge, both of which are currently in the design phase. The Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill included $3.269 million in design and right-of-way acquisition funding for the Calais Border Station. Snowe has pledged to fight to secure additional funding on top of the President's $50 million request for the road and bridge portion of the project through the FY 2006 appropriations process and the upcoming highway reauthorization legislation.
