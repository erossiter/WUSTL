TOP SEN. SNOWE PRIORITIES PASS OUT OF COMMERCE COMMITTEE ON NOV. 5
  During an executive session of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation today, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe praised the committee passage of key pieces of legislation that are vital to improving consumer safety, expanding broadband technology, and extending the expiration of the do-not-call list. 
   Senator Snowe introduced an amendment to the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act of 2007 passed by the committee today that would more than triple the number of Consumer Product Safety Commission staff assigned to monitoring imports and foreign factories that produce consumer goods for the U.S. market. Snowe's legislation would require that the number of full-time import inspectors employed by the CPSC increase to no less than 50 over the next two years. Additionally, it would expressly authorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission to send such inspectors to examine the operations at overseas factories which manufacture consumer products destined for the United States.  
   "This legislation is critical when taking into account that an ever-increasing number of the consumer products sold on our shelves are manufactured in countries with appalling health and quality control standards, such as China," said Senator Snowe. "Nearly twenty percent of consumer goods sold in the U.S. are imported from China alone. I therefore applaud my Committee colleagues for supporting this legislation that will boost the number of Commission import inspection staff on the ground, who are the best defense we have against dangerous foreign products." 
   Senator Snowe praised the Committee passage of the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007, which would prohibit the Federal Trade Commission from incorporating an expiration date for telephone numbers registered on the `do-not-call' registry or a time limitation for telephone numbers to remain on the registry. Currently the Do Not Call registry has a five year expiration date for registered phone numbers. It is estimated that approximately 52 million phone numbers will expire before September 30, 2008. Senator Snowe is a cosponsor of this legislation and was an original cosponsor of initial legislation that established the Do Not Call Registry, which was enacted in 2003. 
   "Since its implementation in 2003, Americans have registered more than 145 million telephone numbers in the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call database, including 647,000 phone numbers in Maine," said Senator Snowe. "If the expiration date isn't removed, it is estimated that approximately 52 million phone numbers will expire and because of this, Americans are at risk to once again receive disruptive telemarketing phone calls or, worse, to potentially become victims of telemarketing fraud. I applaud my Committee colleagues for supporting this very beneficial legislation that will only strengthen one of the most popular and successful policy programs of Congress." 
   As a champion of expanding broadband access to Americans across the country, Senator Snowe cosponsored the Community Broadband Act of 2007, which would prohibit a State or local government from barring municipalities from offering advanced telecommunications services to its citizens. The legislation would also bar state and local government providers from abusing governmental authority to acts as a regulator or to discriminate in favor of itself or against any private competitors. 
   "While several states have either prohibited or restricted municipalities from offering broadband services, my home state of Maine was actually the first state to give municipalities explicit authority to offer there services," said Senator Snowe. "I strongly believe that in order to make headway toward the goal of universal broadband deployment, we must ensure that rural and underserved communities are no longer overlooked or bypassed by private companies who see no favorable return in investing in these areas. This legislation is critical to investigating opportunities that will better provide broadband access to every American and erasing the digital divide." 
   Specifically, the Act: 
   * Sets forth that no State regulation or requirement shall prevent a public provider from offering "advanced telecommunications capability, or services using advanced telecommunications capability"; 
   * Prohibits a municipality from using its position as regulator to discriminate against competing private providers; 
   * Requires a municipality offering high-speed Internet services to comply with Federal telecommunications law or regulation that applies to all such providers; 
   * Encourages public-private partnerships; 
   * Provides the public with notice and an opportunity to be heard on costs, benefits, and alternatives before a public provider may provide broadband to the public; 
   * Permits community broadband projects that currently exist or are at the advanced stages of development to proceed without providing public notice; 
   * Exempts from its provisions services not provided to the public, such as public-safety services, as well as services provided during emergencies. 
   The bills will now be referred to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate.
