SEN. SNOWE BACKS EFFORT TO HELP CONTROL MEDICARE COSTS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), today announced her support for legislation authorizing Medicare to cover Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for all diseases and conditions where treatment is reasonable, necessary, and cost effective.  
 Snowe signed on as a cosponsor of a bill introduced by Sens. Larry Craig (R-ID) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). 
   "Preventative treatments such as MNT make sense medically and economically," said Snowe. "By reducing chronic disease risk, slowing disease progression, and mitigating symptoms, MNT has the potential to both improve lives and save money." 
   Currently, Medicare beneficiaries can have access to MNT, but only for the care of diabetes and kidney diseases. This legislation grants the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the authority, using the National Coverage Determination process, to expand the MNT benefit. CMS reported to Congress last year that there are other conditions, such as hypertension and dyslipimedia, HIV/AIDS and cancer, where evidence supports the cost-effectiveness of MNT as part of the care plan.
