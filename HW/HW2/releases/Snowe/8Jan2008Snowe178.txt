SEN. SNOWE, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS TOUR MAINE-BASED SHIPBUILDING FACILITIES
  Following a tour with Admiral Gary Roughead, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Bath Iron Works (BIW), U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) made the following statement: 
   "Today, importantly, Admiral Roughead was able to witness first-hand the vision, enthusiasm and innovation that are embedded into the culture of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery and at Bath Iron Works. There is no substitute for seeing up close and in person the extraordinary workforce and the impressive investments that have made our facilities a gold standard in shipbuilding, maintenance and repair.
   "I am grateful that Admiral Roughead was able to take the time to come to Maine and learn about the exemplary and critical work being performed at our first-class facilities. The craftsmanship and adaptability of the workforce demonstrated at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Bath Iron Works is second-to-none."
