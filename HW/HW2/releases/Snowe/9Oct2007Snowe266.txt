SEN. PIPELINE SNOWE DEEPLY TROUBLED BY PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO VETO SCHIP EXPANSION
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement on President Bush's decision today to veto legislation that would expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The bipartisan legislation would expand the program by $35 billion to provide health insurance for four million American children and nearly 11,000 kids in Maine.  
   "I am deeply troubled that the President has decided to veto this legislation that is critical to ensuring that millions of American children receive healthcare. I believe this action seriously misjudges the genuine concern Americans have about access to care, particularly for children. 
   "Last week, Senators on both sides of the political aisle voted in favor of reauthorizing the SCHIP program telling the President loud and clear that the stakes could not be higher on such a monumental issue. S-CHIP has been the most significant achievement of the Congress over the past decade in legislative efforts to assure access to affordable health coverage to every American. Today, fewer than half of parents in families earning less than $40,000 a year are offered health insurance through their employer--a nine percent drop since 1997. 
   "S-CHIP has proven to be both a successful program and a saving grace for millions of American families who otherwise simply could not afford to pay for their children's health care. Compromise on both sides of the aisle helped us create this program ten years ago and it is disheartening that the President has vetoed this bipartisan legislation that is needed to provide vital healthcare services to America's children."
