SEN. SNOWE VOWS TO PROTECT MIDCOAST ISLAND AIR SERVICE
  In the wake of an announcement this week by Maine Atlantic Aviation to discontinue their flight operations to Maine's Midcoast islands, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today pledged to work with federal, state and local officials to secure air service to the area. Sen. Snowe is concerned that the island communities could be adversely impacted without a direct air connection. 
   "I have always believed that adequate, reliable air service in our nation's rural areas is not simply a luxury or a convenience - it is an imperative," said Snowe. "Maine's midcoast islands are a jewel in our state's coastal legacy. These communities need air service to keep them connected to the mainland for emergency medical care, mail delivery and timely transportation to and from the islands. I pledge to enlist the help of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Economic Development Administration, and other federal agencies to ensure that a viable replacement service is put in place as soon as possible." 
   The islands that would be affected by Maine Atlantic Aviation's decision are Vinalhaven, North Haven, Islesboro, Swans Island and Matinicus Island.
