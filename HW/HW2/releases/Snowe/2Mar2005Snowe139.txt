SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $198,820 IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO MILLINOCKET, MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that $198,820 in federal funding has been awarded to Millinocket Area Growth and Investment Council (MAGIC) by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) through the Employment and Training Administration (ETA).  
 The funds will be used to implement the Out-Migration Alumni Survey Pilot Project. 
   "It is essential that the State of Maine maintains local populations, a diversity of skills, and economic development in rural communities," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This funding will go toward research that will help Northern Maine achieve these goals." 
   The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) administers federal government job training and worker dislocation programs, federal grants to states for public employment service programs, and unemployment insurance benefits. These services are primarily provided through state and local workforce development systems. 
   The Out-Migration Alumni Survey Pilot Project will contact former residents in the Millinocket area to inform them of recent positive changes in the area, determine their level of desire to return, and obtain information about the real and perceived barriers that are hindering those residents from returning.
