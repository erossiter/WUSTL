SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $140,000 IN FUNDING TO FIGHT CRIME IN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the city of Portland and the Lewiston Police Department two grants totaling $142,180. The city of Portland will receive $97,189 and the Lewiston Police Department will receive $44,991 as a part of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG).  
   "JAG program funding is essential to localities across the nation and especially in Maine ," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The areas of Portland and Lewiston will be offered critical support for law enforcement activities that will help keep our communities safe." 
   The city of Portland will use its JAG funds to continue its ongoing technology improvement efforts by enhancing its photography and audio/visual recording capabilities with the eventual goal of converting to digital systems. 
   The Lewiston Police Department will use the funds to purchase in-car video cameras and tasers. The cameras will help record field activity in video format for investigations and information sharing with other departments and agencies. The tasers will be used for less-lethal options when dealing with suspects and would further enhance officer security.
   The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) allows states, tribes, and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. Grant funds can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice.
