SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES BANGOR AIR NATIONAL GUARD UNIT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today met with representatives from the 101st Air Refueling Wing from Bangor International Airport who are the recipients of the 2006 Air Force General Thomas D. White Environmental Quality Award. The Air National Guard Unit will be honored Thursday evening in a ceremony at the Pentagon Conference Center.  
   "I was honored to meet with the magnificent men and women of the 101st Air Refueling Wing during their trip to Washington, DC," said Senator Snowe. "I commend these servicemen and women for their tireless devotion to implementing projects that safeguard the environment while continuing to set standards in the support of their critical Air National Guard mission. Their leadership in this effort is truly remarkable and I congratulate them on this well-deserved achievement." 
   The Air National Guard members were recognized for their significant contributions to the Air Force environmental program. Members of the 101st Air Refueling Wing illustrated their commitment to the environment through projects such as the phased installation of a de-icer control system, which helped reduce runoff by over 60,000 gallons while maintaining support of the wing's mission. The members also reduced their ratio of hazardous waste to pounds of JP-8 fuel delivered by over 25%, diverted 545,000 pounds of solid waste stream through enhanced recycling, and reduced their aerosol propellant usage by 30%.
