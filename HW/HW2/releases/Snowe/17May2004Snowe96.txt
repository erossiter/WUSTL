  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today released the following statement regarding the suicide bombing that killed Iraqi Governing Council President Izzedine Salim:  
   "Today, the Iraqi people lost a true champion of their freedom and future with assassination of Izzedine Salim. His mission to restore hope will not be vanquished by those who seek to undermine a free and peaceful Iraq. The Iraqi people must repudiate this violent hijacking of democracy as their nation fast approaches the official transfer of sovereignty."
