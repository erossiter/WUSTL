SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE ALMOST $67,000 IN FUNDING TO FIGHT CRIME IN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded $66,955 in funding to the Maine Department of Public Safety in Augusta. As a part of the 2006 Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), the funding will be used to reduce gun crime by providing local programs with the necessary tools to keep communities safe.  
   "It is important to provide our law enforcement agencies with the necessary tools to keep Mainers safe and fight crime across the state," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The PSN funds will be greatly utilized to reduce gun crime and create safer neighborhoods." 
   The State of Maine will use the PSN funds to continue supporting its two PSN violent crimes task forces, the Central Maine Violent Crime Task Force in Lewiston and the Eastern Maine Violent Crime Task Force in Bangor . 
   Project Safe Neighborhoods is a nationwide commitment utilized to reduce gun crime by networking existing local programs that target gun crime and providing those programs with the tools needed to succeed. PSN seeks to achieve heightened coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement, with an emphasis on tactical intelligence gathering, more aggressive prosecutions, and enhanced accountability through performance measures.
