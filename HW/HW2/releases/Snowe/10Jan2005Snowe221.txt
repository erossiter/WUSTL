SEN. SNOWE PRAISES BUSH FOR ESTABLISHING TAX ADVISORY PANEL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, praised President Bush for establishing a bipartisan panel, lead by former Sens. Connie Mack (R-FL) and John Breaux (D-LA), charged with providing Treasury Secretary John Snow with ways to reform the nation's tax code.  
   Snowe issued the following statement today: 
   "Our overly burdensome and complicated tax system is in desperate need of reform. Anyone who's lived through April 15 knows that the IRS code is difficult to navigate and imposes a drag on our economy and families. Some estimates put the drain of tax complexity on the economy at about $150 billion - when our precious resources could be channeled into more productive uses. What's worse, this complexity affects the lower-and middle income workers most acutely, because while the wealthy can afford an accountant or tax attorney, that expense is a great sacrifice to a lot of working families. What is clear is that it needs to be simplified and improved. 
   "I commend the President for rightly establishing a bipartisan tax advisory panel, lead by two of my former colleagues - Senators Connie Mack and John Breaux - whose knowledge and ability to bridge the partisan divide will prove invaluable in coming up with innovative solutions to reform the tax code. 
   "The bottom line is that with 2.8 million words in the internal revenue code, solutions will not come quick, nor will they be easy, but they certainly are necessary. As a member of the Finance Committee, I will remain engaged in any effort to create a tax system that is fairer for all families, more efficient for job creation and business growth and enhances the competitiveness of U.S. companies, while protecting the interests of Mainers during the process."
