  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded Maine $1,329,283 in federal funding.  
 The grants will be used for health programs and research in Maine. "Health and Human Services grants are critical to Maine communities and institutions," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "These funds enable health care services to provide accessible and affordable health care as well as allow organizations to continue progressive research on various diseases and disorders." 
   The following entities will receive funding: 
   * $585,872 to the Jackson Laboratory for Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Research. 
   * $195,406 to the Jackson Laboratory for Clinical Research Related to Neurological Disorders.

   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. HHS works closely with state and local governments and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.
