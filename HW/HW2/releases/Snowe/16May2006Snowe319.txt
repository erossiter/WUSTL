SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $74,540 IN FUNDING TO FIGHT CRIME IN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Bureau of Justice Assistance in the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the Augusta Police Department and Kennebec County law enforcement a grant of $18,290 for the acquisition of two police canines and tasers for deputies. They have also awarded the Maine Department of Corrections $56,250 for delinquency prevention programs. These programs intend to reduce the risks and enhance protective factors to prevent at-risk youth from entering the juvenile justice systems and to intervene with first-time and non-serious offenders to keep them out of the juvenile justice system.  
   "This funding from the Department of Justice will facilitate essential additions to the Augusta Police Department and Kennebec County law enforcement, as well as support programs to prevent juvenile delinquency," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "It is critical that Maine's law enforcement entities receive the funding necessary to keep our state safe and secure, and we are pleased to see such federal support for their efforts." 
   The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) allows states, tribes, and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. Grant funds can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice for any one or more of the following purpose areas: (1) law enforcement programs, (2) prosecution and court programs, (3) prevention and education programs, (4) corrections and community corrections programs, (5) drug treatment programs, and (6) planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.
