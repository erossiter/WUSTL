SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR REASSESSMENT OF STRATEGY IN IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement calling for a reassessment of the United States strategy in Iraq.  
   "As conditions in Iraq continue to worsen, there must be no question among the Administration, the Congress and the Iraqi unity government that staying the course is neither an option nor a plan. I am in agreement with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner who, after returning from Iraq this past week, called for a reassessment of our strategy in Iraq. 
   "Last December, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment by Senator Warner calling 2006 the year of transition for the United States in Iraq. Yet, with fewer than three months remaining, I am deeply disturbed that 2006 has become a period marked by increased sectarian violence, as opposed to an increased ability of the Iraq government to secure its own nation. The message must be loud and clear: the Iraqi government does not have unlimited time to seize control of their country and their security by firmly confronting the sectarian violence and disarming the militias before their country reaches a point of no return. They must understand that the patience of the Congress and the American people is finite and our presence there is neither unlimited nor unconditional. 
   "The Congress and the administration must be open to considering alternative plans for the future role of the U.S. in Iraq. We must be willing to reassess and re-chart our future military presence in Iraq and seriously consider input from all groups, including the bipartisan Iraq Study Group headed by former Secretary of State James Baker. That could include convening an international body - or "summit" - of regional and major international stakeholders to delineate a path forward in Iraq. 
   The bottom line is if Iraq is not going to transition as the Congress has called for, then our strategy must undergo a transformation."
