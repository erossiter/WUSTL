  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) lauded Senate passage last night of a resolution they introduced in May honoring the life and contributions of His Eminence, Archbishop Iakovos, former archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America. Archbishop Iakovos passed away at the age of 93 on April 10, 2005 in Stamford, Connecticut.  
   "The Senate has officially recognized a man who devoted his entire life to serving God and his fellow man," said Snowe. "His Eminence advanced the cause of human rights and dignity in this world, and it is fitting that the Senate honor his enormous achievement and legacy. Archbishop Iakovos remains a personal example to me as a leader of my faith and a paragon of compassion, integrity, and a creative commitment to justice." 
   "Archbishop Iakovos leaves a distinguished legacy of promoting understanding and respect among people of all ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds," added Senator Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD). "Passage of this resolution is a lasting tribute to his leadership of the Greek Orthodox Church and to his efforts to preserve our religious beliefs and institutions. I thank my Senate colleagues for their endorsement of this resolution and to Senator Snowe for spearheading this effort to honor Archbishop Iakovos' remarkable life and contributions."
