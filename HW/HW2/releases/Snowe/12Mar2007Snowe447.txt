SEN. SNOWE CELEBRATES 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED STATES SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) attended a reception Wednesday evening on Capitol Hill to honor Maine delegates from the United States Senate Youth Program. Sen. Olympia Snowe met with Samuel Inman of Albion and Chelsea Rita St. Onge-May of Bridgton, who are participating in the annual Washington Week Program in our nation's capital.  
   "As this year marks the 45th anniversary of the United States Senate Youth Program, it is important to recognize the outstanding leadership and academic accomplishments of the students who make this program so remarkable," said Senator Snowe. "I enjoyed meeting with Samuel and Chelsea and congratulate them on their participation in this exceptional program that truly exemplifies their achievements as student leaders." 
   Each year the William Randolph Hearst Foundation sponsors a scholarship for two student leaders from each state and the District of Columbia to visit Washington, D.C. During the visit, students engage in a series of seminars and briefings with Senators and members of the House of Representatives and meet with officials from the executive and judicial branches of government.
