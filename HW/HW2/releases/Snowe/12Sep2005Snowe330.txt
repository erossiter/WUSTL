SEN. SNOWE MARKS FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement on the fourth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001:  
   "Today we remembered those who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and reaffirm the resiliency and resoluteness of the American people. We put aside our differences, our arguments and our individual concerns to contemplate the beginning of a new era that began four years ago. 
   "We remember the human lives lost, including Maine's victims: Anna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Robert Norton, Jacqueline Norton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families in Maine and throughout the Nation who lost loved ones in the atrocity of 9-11. 
   "On this anniversary, we remember how that one day in September not only changed America and the world, but also reminded us of what really matters, the principles we value and the character of our people. Firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, our troops - seemingly ordinary Americans who rose to heroism when faced with the horrible reality of that day. 
   "By continuing their work today, we are honoring the more than three thousand people who lost their lives on September 11th, and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country in the war against terror. Their sacrifice will resonate throughout the world for years to come, and we will always remember."
