WOMEN DESERVE BETTER
  At some point in their lives, nearly every American will have a family member or friend who must battle breast cancer. Today, a woman in the United States has a 1 in 7 chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime and this year over 216,000 women will receive a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American women, excluding skin cancer and it is second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Yet current standards of health care coverage are inadequate to deal with this pervasive and life-altering disease. Most importantly, thousands of women each year undergo mastectomies needlessly and women have even undergone breast cancer surgery as an outpatient - the "drive through mastectomy" as it has been called - being sent home without critical support for their recovery.
   There is a solution to this problem. I recently introduced legislation to increase the standards of care for women with breast cancer. It will ensure that all breast cancer patients receive appropriate medical treatment and are given options when making decisions that will affect their health. The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005 would improve access to second opinions, lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and inpatient care so that women are not forced to undergo medically unnecessary mastectomies or settle for insufficient treatment.  
   This legislation empowers women and their doctors to make treatment decisions based on what is medically prudent, not simply what will achieve short-term savings. The stress of a cancer diagnosis is debilitating. To compound that stress, to leave a woman with the knowledge that she must undergo a disfiguring procedure due only to her financial position, or to undergo surgery without proper hospitalization, is absolutely unconscionable.
   The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005 addresses these problems through creation of a set of crucial measures to ensure appropriate treatment. The legislation assures that reasonable inpatient care will be provided when a woman undergoes invasive treatment for breast cancer. It further removes the coverage inequities which cause many women to undergo surgery that might not be the most appropriate for them. 
   This bill achieves three important objectives. First, it assures a patient of a second opinion for any cancer diagnosis. A cancer diagnosis simply must be reliable. Otherwise, women may be forced to worry needlessly about their health and seek treatments that they may not even need.
   Second, this legislation assures a patient of a reasonable minimum length of hospital stay for invasive treatment of breast cancer. A health care provider cannot limit hospital stays for mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery to less than 48 hours. Many of us have heard of women receiving outpatient mastectomies, being sent home without the necessary support. This legislation establishes a 48 hour minimum stay assurance for mastectomy and lumpectomy. I must point out that this assurance does not require a woman remain hospitalized that long if she and her doctor concur that she should go home earlier - nor does it prevent a longer hospitalization if her medical condition warrants it. However, this provision will protect women from that small fraction of insurance plans which will not allow such reasonable treatment. This assurance is offered regardless of who regulates the patient's plan because no woman should be forced to undergo such invasive treatment on an outpatient basis. 
   Finally, this legislation does more than simply ensure a patient of reasonable hospitalization; it assures her of support in making the best choices about her treatment. For example, it provides support for lumpectomy treatment because it requires coverage for radiation therapy for patients undergoing lumpectomy. Together with the assurance of inpatient care, this Act removes the economic incentive for a woman to select mastectomy simply to reduce the immediate cost of treatment. 
   This bill will not only provide a higher standard of care, but will achieve long term savings in women's health- both mental and physical- as well as cost savings. Lumpectomy followed by radiation is the preferable treatment for most women with early-stage breast cancer - but many women have undergone mastectomy because a lack of coverage - yet the costs of breast reconstruction are often not considered. In fact, the finding that breast implants often entail additional surgeries and may pose health additional risks demonstrates one reason why long term costs are greater for mastectomy. Yet thousands continue to be subjected to unnecessary surgeries. This legislation will remedy this problem, and ensure women receive the most appropriate treatment to preserve their health. 
   As a woman and a member of the United States Senate, I pledge to continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and lead the charge to raise our nation's awareness about breast cancer. Working together and with the support of breast cancer advocates, we should at last achieve for American women the protections they so deserve.
