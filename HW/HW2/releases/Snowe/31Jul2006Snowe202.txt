COASTAL SENATORS PUSH FOR MORE OFFSHORE DRILLING PROTECTIONS
  In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), a bipartisan group of senators called for a vote on a key amendment that would protect coastal states from oil and gas exploration off their shores. The amendment - sponsored by Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) - would extend the outer continental shelf oil and gas drilling moratorium until the year 2022. 
   "Without this amendment New Jersey is left vulnerable to speculation and drilling off our shores," Menendez said. "The Jersey Shore is one of the most ecologically sensitive and economically important parts of the Garden State. We cannot let this Senate bill be conferenced with a House bill that shows such flagrant disregard for our coast and shores. I will do everything in my power to protect the New Jersey economy and environment" 
   "To ensure the interests of all coastal states are represented and protected, the Senate must be allowed to consider an amendment to extend the moratorium on Pacific and Atlantic coastal drilling," said Snowe. "Legislation passed in the House of Representatives could lead to drilling off of Maine's shores and, unless we in the Senate are allowed to act, we have no guarantees that the will of the people of Maine and other coastal states will be heard."
   "Californians are nearly united in their opposition to drilling off their coast. Thirty-seven million Californians deserve to be heard on this issue," Feinstein said. 
   "We are not only being denied a vote on this important amendment, but we are about to pass a bill that could be conferenced with a House bill that could gut the ban on drilling off our coasts." 
   The amendment would be added to the Gulf of Mexico Energy bill, a measure the full Senate will consider next week. Senators joining Menendez, Snowe and Feinstein in writing Frist, include: Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Joseph I. Lieberman (D-CT), John F. Kerry (D-MA), Christopher J. Dodd (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).
  The full text of the letter to Senator Frist follows.
  Dear Majority Leader Frist:
  We are writing to voice our support for continuing the long-standing outer continental shelf oil and gas drilling moratorium not touched by S.3711 and to urge you to allow the Senate to vote on our amendment to S. 3711, which would extend the moratorium off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the continental United States until the year 2022.
   Our beaches and coastline are economic and environmental treasures for each of our states. They are the homes for millions, and they protect the homes of millions more. They are the foundation of thriving tourist economies, provide habitat and shelter for countless species of wildlife, and support a robust commercial and recreational fishing industry. They are where the residents of our states live, work, and play, and every year we welcome countless visitors from across the nation and around the world to share in their beauty.
   But they are also exceptionally fragile, and we are committed to fighting to protect them. A single oil spill could lay waste to huge sections of coastline, fatal both to wildlife and a state's economy. Each year we fight to continue the moratorium against oil and gas drilling off our shores, but we see this moratorium under repeated attack in the House of Representatives, which has recently passed a bill, H.R. 4761, that would eliminate it completely. 
   We are particularly concerned that if S. 3711 passes, it will be subject to a conference with H.R. 4761, where many of the most onerous provisions in that bill could be included in a conference report. The elimination of the long-standing coastal moratorium is something that none of us would be able to allow, and we believe that the only way to reliably protect our coasts is to enact a long-term legislative moratorium. 
   We therefore respectfully urge you to allow us to offer and vote on the Menendez-Snowe-Feinstein amendment to S. 3711 and to prevent any weakening of the outer continental shelf moratorium in a conference committee with the House of Representatives. Thank you for your consideration of these requests. 
   Sincerely,
   ROBERT MENENDEZ
