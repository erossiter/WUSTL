SEN. SNOWE LEADS BI-PARTISAN EFFORT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is leading a bi-partisan effort to increase funding for the Social Security Administration (SSA). Joined by Senators John Kerry (D-Mass.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), Snowe, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, has asked the Senate Budget Committee to provide $350 million above what the President proposed for SSA funding for next year. 
   "We have cases where people are waiting more than three years for their claims to be processed by the SSA," Senator Snowe said. "These delays are creating serious financial hardships for the applicants and their families. The only way to alleviate this backlog is to provide the SSA with the manpower they need to process the vast number of claims they get every year."
   As of January 2008, nearly 751,000 cases are awaiting a hearing on an appealed claim, compared to 312,000 cases at the beginning of 2000. Nearly 300,000 of these appeals are more than a year old. Approximately 91,000 veterans have their hearings still pending.
   "Under the Administration's budget proposal, the SSA backlog wouldn't be reduced until 2013," Senator Snowe noted. "For anyone seeking disability assistance, that's far too long to have to wait to receive the support that has been promised to them. We have no right to break that promise and should instead provide the resources necessary to live up to our commitments to our seniors and veterans."
   A copy of the letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee is attached.
