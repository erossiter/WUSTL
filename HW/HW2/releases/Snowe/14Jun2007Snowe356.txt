SEN. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $200,000 TO UPDATE PLANS AT AIRPORTS IN MACHIAS, LINCOLN
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that two Maine airports will be receiving a combined $191,514 from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of continued work to update master plan studies at various airports. 
   "It is important that we continually invest in and improve Maine's airports, both big and small, so that we may enhance and maintain critical infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted operations at all of these airports," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement.
   Funding will be allocated as follows:
   * $150,000 to the Town of Machias . This project is a follow on to a site assessment study which identified a number of physical and environmental constraints that preclude necessary improvements to the runway and other airfield facilities at the airport's current location.
   * $41,514 to the Town of Lincoln . This supplement to the master plan will evaluate land use and identify potential property acquisitions for future development.
