SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO PROTECT AMERICAN FLAG FROM DESECRATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted in support a Constitutional Amendment that would protect the American flag from desecration. The amendment failed to garner the requisite two-thirds of the Senate or 67 votes required for passage.  
   Snowe issued the following statement today:
   At this time when Americans are fighting and, tragically, perishing under the flag of the United States, it is long overdue that we pass a constitutional amendment to protect that very symbol of American ideals from acts of desecration. Because our most beloved emblem, a symbol of the world's greatest democracy, our American flag is not just another piece of cloth. It is not just another banner or logo or emblem. It is our cherished symbol of freedom and democracy. Whether our flag is flying over a military base, a school, or on a flag pole on Main Street, the stars and stripes represent the ideals and values that are the foundation of this great Nation. Our flag has come to not only represent the pride we have for our Nation's past glories, but also to stand for the hope we all harbor for our Nation's future. I am disappointed this amendment failed to pass the Senate today.
