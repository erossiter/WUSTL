SEN. SNOWE LAUDS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION BILL
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today lauded the Senate Finance Committee's passage of legislation that would reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program for an additional five years and invest $35 billion to cover 3.3 million children currently not covered by the program. As a staunch supporter of SCHIP, Senator Snowe has worked since the program's inception to ensure that America's children get the coverage they need to stay healthy. 
   "This bill marks significant progress toward investing in the health of America's children and I voted in favor of SCHIP reauthorization to ensure our country moves forward in our promise to cover nine million children who remain uninsured today," said Senator Snowe. "This legislation will reward states that demonstrate progress in covering more children instead of maintaining the status quo, which is imperative to providing reassurance to those families who struggle to afford health insurance. The storied success of this program in my home state of Maine alone proves its essential worth and I am so pleased that we were able to reach a bipartisan consensus on how to move forward in covering more children in the future."  
   The bill, which passed by a vote of 17 to 4, contains a number of priorities included in S.1224, the "Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act," legislation Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Senator Snowe introduced in April. 
   These provisions include: 
   * Increasing income eligibility to families at 300 percent of poverty. This represents the right policy because it creates a broader safety-net that offers assistance to a greater number of families. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, fewer than half (47 percent) of parents in families earning less than $40,000 a year are offered health insurance through their employer-a 9 percent drop since 1997. 
   * Allowing states the option to cover pregnant women. While states can currently pursue a state plan amendment to offer pre-natal, labor, and delivery services, postpartum care is not reimbursable. Studies show that women who do not receive postpartum care are at a greater risk for a variety of health complications that make it difficult for a mother to properly care for her infant. In June, Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, Senator Lugar and Senator Bingaman and 15 additional Senators sent a letter to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley asking for inclusion of this policy. 
   * Expanding health quality reporting. The bill contains a new quality initiative within the Department of Health and Human Services charged with developing and implementing quality measures and improving state reporting of quality data. In addition, the bill includes the Lincoln/Snowe amendment on quality reporting on reducing the number of children born pre-maturely 
   * Combating childhood obesity. The bill includes a Snowe amendment authorizing a $25 million demonstration project and instituting measures to fight childhood obesity. Over 15 percent of children in our country are obese. This has dire consequences for their long-term health and will put a strain on health care resources in the future. 
   Senator Snowe and Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) sought to improve the quality of dental care through the provision of an assured dental benefit for all SCHIP-covered children. Although the bill also includes a $200 million grant program for dental grants, Senators Snowe and Bingaman plan to introduce an amendment on the floor mandating coverage of dental benefits, as well as allowing states to provide a supplemental, wrap-around benefit for children who have medical insurance, but lack dental insurance. For every child who lacks health insurance, 2.6 children lack dental insurance. 
   The program will expire on September 30th. CBO predicts that nearly one million S-CHIP-covered children will become uninsured over the next five years without additional funds above baseline.
