SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLAR
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with Presidential Scholar Allyson Ettinger of Camden. Allyson is one of only 121 students nationwide to be named to the 42nd class of Presidential Scholars. 
   "It was a sincere honor and joy to meet such an intelligent young woman and I would like to again congratulate Allyson for her well-deserved recognition," said Snowe. "In our meeting, Allyson displayed a confidence and poise beyond her years and it is evident she has a bright future as a leader."
   As part of the United States Department of Education, the Presidential Scholars Program invites high school students around the nation to apply for recognition based on outstanding College Board SAT or ACT assessments as well as high school reports, transcripts, and extracurricular activities. The Presidential Scholars annually honor one young man and one young woman from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, plus a number of "at-large" Scholars for their scholarship and service.
   Allyson was in Washington as part of the Presidential Scholars National Recognition Week and was able to meet with government officials, educators, authors, musicians, scientists, and other accomplished people. During the week, scholars have the opportunity to visit museums and monuments, and to attend recitals, receptions and ceremonies. To commemorate their achievement, the Scholars are awarded the Presidential Scholars medallion at a ceremony sponsored by the White House.
