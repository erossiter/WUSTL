SENS. SNOWE, SALAZAR URGE ARMY TO FIX BODY ARMOR SHORTFALL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) on Friday, Feb. 16, joined Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) in introducing legislation that would increase certain benefits of the Guard and Reserve components of our Armed Forces to match those of active duty forces. The "Total Force G.I. Bill" would ensure that mobilized members of the Selected Reserve are rewarded for their increased service overseas by providing better education benefits.  
   "At a time when members of our Selected Reserves are making increasing sacrifices in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress should take steps to ensure that upon their return home, these brave men and women receive the educational benefits they have earned and rightly deserve," Snowe said. 
   Members of the Guard and Reserve components of our Armed Forces continue to make an essential contribution to support our missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere around the world. Although more than 500,000 of these brave men and women have been called up since September 11, 2001, and more than 70,000 have pulled two or more tours of duty, they are denied educational benefits that are commensurate with their service. Despite our nation's increased reliance upon our Selected Reserve, the value of their standard Montgomery G.I. Bill (MGIB) benefits has fallen over the last 20 years from 47 percent to 29 percent of Active Duty benefits. In addition, they continue to be the only benefits that members of the Selected Reserve who serve activated duty in the Global War on Terror cannot access once they separate from service. 
   The Total Force GI Bill would do the following: 
   * Consolidate the Active Duty and Selected Reserve MGIB programs under one authority by transferring them into the jurisdiction of the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Veterans Administration. This would provide a cleaner, simpler arrangement of MGIB benefits that would put an end to inconsistent and inequitable structuring of benefits. 
   * Ensure that Selected Reserve MGIB benefits would rise in proportionality with Active Duty MGIB rate increases. This would help address the growing inequity of benefits between the two. 
   * Provide a 10-year portability for Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) benefits for mobilized members of the selected reserve. Unlike Active Duty servicemen, members of the Selected Reserve must forfeit all of these benefits, which are earned on activated duty in the Global War on Terrorism, once they separate from service. 
   * Provide an accruable month per month Active Duty rate for mobilized members of the Selected Reserve. Individuals can accrue Active Duty MGIB benefits up to the maximum allowable in law (36 months at $1,075 per month, currently).
