SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM CERTIFICATION FOR MOOSEHEAD MANUFACTURING WORKERS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins are pleased to announce that Moosehead Manufacturing Company, Inc. has received certification from the U.S. Department of Labor that Moosehead Manufacturing workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. 
   Moosehead Manufacturing Company, a family-owned business based in Monson, is a manufacturer of hardwood household furniture. The company was founded in 1947 and currently employs over 150 workers.
  The purpose of the TAA program is to aid workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages decrease as a result of increased imports. As a part of the TAA program, Moosehead Manufacturing workers will be eligible for employment training in another job or career, income support, job search allowance, and relocation services for individuals who obtain jobs outside of their normal commuting area.
   "TAA will greatly assist the Moosehead Manufacturing workers get the services they need to maintain employment," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Domestic furniture manufacturers are facing extreme, and often unfair, foreign competition and it is only right that supplemental assistance be offered to counteract this problem. We are pleased to see dedicated Maine workers eligible for these employment opportunities."
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is a federal program established under the Trade Act of 1974. States serve as agents to the Labor Department in administering the TAA program.
