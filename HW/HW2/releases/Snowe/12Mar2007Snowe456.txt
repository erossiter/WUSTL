SEN. SNOWE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ENSURE CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT
  To reverse a wrongheaded provision included in the Deficit Reduction Act signed into law in 2006, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Monday, March 12, introduced legislation that would ensure states receive matching funds for enforcing child support orders. S. 803, introduced by Sen. Olympia Snowe along with Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Howard Kohl (WI-D) John Cornyn (R-TX), and Norm Coleman (R-MN) would increase child support collections by $11 billion over the next decade.  
   "The fact is that child support collection programs are absolutely necessary and the current system works," Snowe said. "It was wrongheaded to include this provision in the Deficit Reduction Act last year, and it is a mistake we should take immediate action to correct. We must do our part to ensure single parents struggling to make ends meet receive the assistance and the support they deserve and depend on to provide for their children." 
   The Child support program collected $23 billion in private child support payments for approximately 16 million children in 2005. For every dollar invested in child support enforcement, $4.58 was collected in child support payments. 
   Sixty percent of all single parent families participate in the child support program, and participants are primarily former welfare families or working families with modest incomes. It is proven that the child support program directly increases self-sufficiency and that families receiving child support are more likely to leave welfare and less likely to return.
