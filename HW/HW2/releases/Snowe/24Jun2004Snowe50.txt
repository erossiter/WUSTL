SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH CUMBERLAND-NORTH YARMOUTH GIRL SCOUT CADETS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with the Cumberland/North Yarmouth Girl Scout Cadet troop.  
 Led by Trooper Leader Margaret Mary Pisini, the troop toured the U.S. Capitol complex prior to meeting with Snowe during their visit to Washington, D.C.
   "I am always excited to visit with Girl Scout Troops from Maine. For generations, the Girl Scouts of America has positively impacted the lives of countless young girls, instilling a greater sense of self-worth, social responsibility, and community," said Snowe. "I am confident that these young cadets will succeed not only in their commitments to the Girl Scouts, but in their lives beyond."
   Donning their official uniforms, the troop of cadets discussed with Snowe the historical significance of the "searsucker suit" - which Snowe wore for "Searsucker Thursdays." Organized by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), all 14 women Senators wore a searsucker suit today in comradery with their male colleagues.
   "Today, the Senate demonstrated a shared voice - and wardrobe - in saluting 'Searsucker Thursdays'. It is my hope that, unlike our always fashionable searsuckers, this Senatorial unity will not be hung away deep in the closet after today," said Snowe.
   Each cadet arrived with a copy of "Nine and Counting" - the biographical book co-authored by Snowe about the role of women Senators in the Congress. Per the intentions of the women Senators when penning the book, 100 percent of the profits from "Nine and Counting" are donated to the Girl Scouts of America foundation. Snowe personally autographed each cadet's book.
