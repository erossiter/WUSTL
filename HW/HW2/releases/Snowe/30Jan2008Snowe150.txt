SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FIREFIGHTERS ASSISTANCE GRANTS AWARDED TO MAINE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Assistance program have awarded $138,564 in operations and safety grants to two Maine fire departments. These awards aim to enhance first responders' ability to protect the health and safety of the public and provide fire departments with additional resources. 
   "Ensuring our local fire departments have the equipment and resources they need is critical to the success of fire personnel," Senator Snowe said. "These grants are essential for our local fire departments to train, equip and evaluate our fire personnel so they can prepare for future fire disasters."
   The Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program is an important component of a coordinated effort to strengthen the Nation's overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and fire-related hazards. Since 2004, with the Fiscal Year 2007 awards, AFG has provided a total of almost $2.2 billion to first-responder organizations to purchase response equipment, personal protective equipment, and vehicles.
   The grants were administered as follows:
   * $47,500 to the Corinth Fire Department for Operations and Safety - Grant Contact - Scott Bragdon (207) 285-3303 
   * $91,064 to the Naples Fire Department for Operations and Safety - Grant Contact - Christopher Pond (207) 693-6850
