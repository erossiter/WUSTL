SEN. SNOWE, GOV. MCKERNAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT TWITCHELL
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe and former Governor John R. McKernan, Jr. today issued the following statement on the passing of long-time Maine state lawmaker and former Norway town manager, R. Donald Twitchell. Senator Snowe and Governor McKernan served with Twitchell in the Maine State Legislature from 1973 to 1977: 
   "We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our former colleague R. Donald Twitchell. His devotion to public service and love of Norway made him one of Maine's most well-respected and revered public officials. Don's character and ideas were matched only by his good nature and spirit. He was the living embodiment of a people's representative, more interested in getting something done than engaging in partisan politics. We feel extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to serve with Don and learn from his example. His wife of 53 years, Florence and the entire Twitchell family are in our thoughts and prayers."
