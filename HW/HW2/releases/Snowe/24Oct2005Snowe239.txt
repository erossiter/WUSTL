SEN. SNOWE AMENDMENT HELPS BANGOR FLIGHT SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES
  Working to assist employees who could lose their hard-earned retirement as operations at Bangor's flight service station are handed over to Lockheed Martin, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today successfully included a provision in the Transportation and Treasury Appropriations Bill which would allow any flight service station employee who is within two years of retirement to remain employed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), thereby retaining their federal benefits and pension. These employees could be loaned to Lockheed-Martin and continue to work at a flight service station, but they would remain on the FAA's payroll. The Senate passed the Transportation and Treasury Appropriations bill Thursday night by a vote of 93 to 1. 
   "Although I remain convinced that closing Bangor's flight service station and consolidating its workforce is the wrong decision, I am pleased that this provision - which protects career employees from losing their hard-earned pensions and benefits - was included in the Senate's Transportation and Treasure Appropriations Bill," said Snowe. "I will be in close contact with the House and Senate conferees, who will hammer out the differences between the two chambers' bills, to ensure that this vital legislation becomes law." 
   On October 4, the FAA began turning functions of Flight Service Stations over to Lockheed-Martin. Bangor International Airport's flight service station is included in the plan, and turning over operations there to Lockheed Martin would result in the loss of nearly 30 positions.
