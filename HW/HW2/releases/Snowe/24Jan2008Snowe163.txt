SEN. SNOWE: ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE MUST HELP SMALL BUSINESSES
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Committee on Finance and Ranking Member of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, introduced legislation this afternoon aimed at helping small businesses by utilizing targeted tax incentives and expanding small business expensing. Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Chairman John Kerry (D-MA) is a co-sponsor of Senator Snowe's measure. 
   "The burden of re-energizing our economy cannot fall on the shoulders of working-class Americans alone," Senator Snowe said. "The economic engine that drives our economy is small businesses. Any economic stimulus package we consider must meet the unique needs of America's small businesses." 
   The legislation was offered by Senator Snowe this afternoon and would: 
   * Increase the amount of investment small businesses are able to write off immediately each year to $200,000 freeing up capital to be used for creating jobs 
   * Lengthen the carryback period of net operating losses to five years to provide small businesses a longer period over which to offset current losses and obtain immediate tax refunds 
   * Extend the R&D Tax Credit, which expired at the end of 2007, to spur innovation in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing and health care, so that the economy will have cutting-edge technology to lead a recovery 
   At a Senate Finance Committee hearing held this morning, Senator Snowe continued to underscore the importance of producing an economic stimulus package that would immediately bolster consumer confidence and spur business investment. 
   "Both parties are working expeditiously to address the downturn in our economy," added Senator Snowe. "As congressional leaders search for a middle-ground to build consensus, we must make certain that the stimulus package we pass provides a tangible boost for working families who are living paycheck-to-paycheck." 
   Congressional leaders announced earlier today that they had reached an agreement on an estimated $150 billion economic stimulus package that would include rebates between $300 (for low-income workers) and $1200 (for couples) with an additional $300 per child as well as proposals to increase small business expensing similar to Senator Snowe's legislation.
