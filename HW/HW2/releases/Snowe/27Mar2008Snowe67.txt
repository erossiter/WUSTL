SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $250,000 IN FUNDING FOR TOWN OF ST. AGATHA
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program has awarded $250,000 to the town of St. Agatha for the completion of the Cleveland Road/Pelletier Island sewer extension project. Specifically, these funds include a grant of $187,000 and a loan of $63,000. 
   "As many communities throughout Maine experience aging and failing infrastructures, it is vital that we allot the necessary funds to counteract this process and afford quality public services," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "With the extension and completion of the Cleveland Road/Pelletier Island project, 89 new users in the town of St. Agatha will have access to the expanded sewer system and previous users will benefit from much-needed upgrades and improvements."
