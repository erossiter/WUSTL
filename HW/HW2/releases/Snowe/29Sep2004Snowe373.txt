  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security is awarding a total of $190,170 in federal funding to Maine communities and fire departments.  
 The awards are part of the "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program", or the FIRE Act. The grants will assist in fire operations and firefighter safety training. 
   "It is critical that federal resources are allocated to better equip our firefighters which, in turn, will assist in their effectiveness to protect their communities," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. 
   The following departments will receive federal funding: 
   * $90,000 to the Gardiner Fire Department. 
   * $69,480 to the Guilford Volunteer Fire Department. 
   * $30,690 to the Sebec Volunteer Fire Department. 
   FIRE Act Grants were created with strong endorsement from Senators Snowe and Collins. These grants are awarded to fire departments across the United States to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety programs and to purchase new fire equipment.
