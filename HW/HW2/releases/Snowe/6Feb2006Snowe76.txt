SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON JOINT OCEAN COMISSION INITIATIVE U.C. OCEAN POLICY REPORT CARD
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, hopes that a report card issued by the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative will serve to provide significant impetus to allow both the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass significant fisheries management reform this year. In December, the Senate Commerce Committee agreed on consensus, bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act - the landmark fisheries management law.  
   "I hope this report card issued today by the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative serves as the critical impetus to ensure that the Congress - both the House and the Senate - acts quickly this year to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Management Act," said Snowe. "Clearly, we must do more as a nation to preserve our oceans. Given their economic impact, it only makes sense that we take the lead to harness the resources of the federal government, better coordinate conservation efforts between federal, state and local governments, and take a global leadership role in being a responsible steward of this invaluable natural resource." 
   The Joint Ocean Commission's report card rated the United States progress on ocean policy on the following areas: National Ocean Governance Reform; Regional and State Ocean Governance Reform; International Leadership; Research, Science and Education; Fisheries Management Reform; and New Funding for Ocean Policy and Programs. 
   As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Snowe has worked with Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Daniel Inouye (D-HI) on the following pieces of legislation to improve the health of our oceans:
