SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON CALL UP OF INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement regarding the Department of Defense preliminary call up of 58 Mainers as part of approximately 5,600 Individual Ready Reserve troops to be deployed overseas.  
 Snowe also reaffirmed her position opposing any reinstatement of the military draft.
   "Clearly, our military is stretched thin with deployments being extended, stop-loss orders being implemented and now the most recent call up of the rarely-utilized pool of Individual Ready Reserve troops. The time has come for the Defense Department to be forthcoming in both its assessments of troop strength for both Iraq and Afghanistan and any planned future deployments. The people of this nation deserve nothing less than an accurate understanding of what the future commitments of our service men and women will be as our nation remains engaged overseas.
   "However, I remain resolute that reinstating the draft is not a solution, as such I voted last week to increase to size of Army active duty forces by 20,000. Additionally, it is also time for our allies, particularly those under the NATO flag, to increase their military participation in combating a global war on terror that affects all freedom loving peoples.
   "Our military is the best-trained, best-equipped, best-prepared fighting force in the world today, and that is in part because we have an all-volunteer military. Indeed, thousands of Maine citizens have stepped forward over the past 30 years, most recently as we have seen so honorably and courageously in Iraq and Afghanistan, to undertake the noble mission of serving our nation."
