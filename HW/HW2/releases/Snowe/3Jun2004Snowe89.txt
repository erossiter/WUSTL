SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON CIA DIRECTOR RESIGNATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement today on the resignation of Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet: 
   "George Tenet has been a steadfast and dedicated public servant who made wide-ranging contributions to our vital U.S. intelligence community under two administrations. He presided over the intelligence community at a time of unprecedented challenges and fundamental shifts in the threats faced by our nation, he worked to rebuild human intelligence capabilities that had been decimated, and he was an unfailing supporter of those who perform the critical work of intelligence gathering and analysis. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee I will be working with Acting Director John McLaughlin as we continue to identify and implement meaningful structural changes designed to improve our intelligence community."
