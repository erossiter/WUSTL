SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS EFFORT TO RESTORE SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R- Maine) has cosponsored legislation that would restore the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to its previously scheduled 10 months after 80 percent of Iraq reconstruction funds have been expended. The bill, S. 4046, was authored by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Russ Feingold (D-Minn). The recently enacted Defense Authorization bill contained a clause that set an October 1, 2007 expiration date for the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction's authority.  
   "It is entirely inappropriate that the Special Inspector General for the Iraq Reconstruction was dissolved in the Defense Authorization bill. This office works on behalf of the American taxpayers to guard against fraud and waste in Iraq and he must be permitted to continue his work," Snowe said. "The oversight performed by the Inspector General is essential to the successful reconstruction of Iraq and to date has uncovered and halted billions of dollars in waste, mismanagement and fraud. I'm pleased to join with Senator Collins and Senator Russ Feingold to restore the Special Inspector General to exert to appropriate oversight over the billions of dollars we as a nation are spending in Iraq.".
