SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $303,981 FOR MAINE FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security has awarded five fire departments in Maine a total of $303,981 to support emergency preparedness.  
   "Firefighters and emergency services personnel are some of the true heroes of our communities but it is impossible for them to do their jobs effectively if they lack adequate equipment and support," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The recent Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program grants will allow more of Maine's fire and ambulance departments to respond quickly and adequately to emergencies and make our communities safer." 
   The funds will be allocated as follows: $123,025 to the Yarmouth Fire/Rescue Department $28,880 to the Bucksport Fire Department $41,325 to the Bethel Ambulance and Rescue Service $91,803 to the Franklin Fire Department $18,948 to the Vinalhaven Ambulance Department 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. For the fiscal year 2005 program, Congress appropriated $650 million in direct assistance to firefighters to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
