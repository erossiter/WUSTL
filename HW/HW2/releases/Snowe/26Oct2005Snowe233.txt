SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO SUPPORT FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe voted for an amendment sponsored by Edward Kennedy (D-MA) that would have increased the total possible amount of Pell grants awarded to individuals by $200- from $4,050 to $4,250.  
 The amendment was defeated by a vote of 48 to 51. 
   "In order to ensure that all American students have access to higher education, we must do all that is within our power to give them the support they need," said Snowe. "All too often, students are deterred from pursuing a college degree because of prohibitive costs. The Federal Pell grant program can help relieve some of the burden and it is a mainstay of many students' financial aid packages. I am disappointed that the Senate defeated this amendment, but I pledge to continue in the fight to make higher education more accessible and affordable for everyone." 
   Senator Snowe has long supported the Pell grant program. In May of 2005, she signed a letter to appropriators requesting a $450 increase in the Pell grant awards. Additionally, she voted for a Pell grant funding increase as part of a larger education spending amendment during the fiscal year 2006 budget debate. 
   The Pell grant program is the largest federal grant program and provides assistance to eligible undergraduate students based on financial need. Pell grants are useful for students because unlike loans, they don't have to be repaid. They are generally only awarded to undergraduate students who haven't yet earned a bachelor's or graduate degree and are a foundation of federal student aid, to which aid from other federal and nonfederal sources can be added.
