SEN. SNOWE SPEAKS WITH NORTHCOM COMMANDER ON BEHALF OF BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today spoke to Admiral Timothy Keating, Commander, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to acquaint the Admiral with the capabilities present at Brunswick Naval Air Station that can assist Northern Command in completing their mission now and in the future.  
   "My discussion today with Admiral Keating was productive," said Snowe. "It was a great chance to update him on the state-of-the-art facilities at Brunswick Naval Air Station and its unique capabilities. Brunswick is the only remaining airfield in the Northeast, and it is the cornerstone of the nation's defense in the Northeast quadrant." 
   In her role as Chair of the Senate subcommittee that oversees the Coast Guard, Snowe discussed the Coast Guard's homeland security challenges. Keating acknowledged that one of NORTHCOM's major tasks is to work with the Coast Guard to develop maritime domain awareness capabilities for the nation, a task in which Snowe believes BNAS can be of great assistance.
