MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS REACT TO BRAC COMMISSION HEARING
  Maine and New Hampshire's governors and congressional delegations today issued the following statement on the BRAC Commission hearing today:  
   "We have been very clear and have succinctly argued that at this time, none of the four public shipyards should be slated for closure due to pressing national security needs and the current force structure," said Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, New Hampshire Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu, Maine Representatives Tom Allen and Mike Michaud and New Hampshire Representatives Jeb Bradley and Charles Bass in a joint statement. "Our extensive analysis has shown that there is no excess capacity and it is critical to retain the four public shipyards. By the points that several of the Commissioners made at today's hearing, it is obvious that the Pentagon has not convinced them of the need to close Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and they, therefore, will look deeper into the matter. Furthermore, after our conversations with some of the Commissioners yesterday, in addition to the visit by other Commission members to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the regional hearing earlier this month in Boston, we continue to feel that we are making the strongest, absolutely fact-based case to the Commission. We believe they are hearing our concerns and recognizing the fact that our nation needs the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to stay open."
