SEN. SNOWE SADDENED BY PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today mourned the loss of Coretta Scott King.  
 Snowe issued the following statement: 
   "Today, our nation has lost a civil rights patriot, a passionate defender of freedom and fundamental rights, and a truly great American. Coretta Scott King was a civil rights icon with a blazing allegiance to the cause of equality of opportunity and to what David Halberstam has called "elemental dignity" for all people. Indeed, more than forty years after her husband told the world he dreamed of a day when his own children would be judged "not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character", Coretta Scott King continued to fight to bring hope and empowerment to millions in America, and throughout the world. 
   "She led a life dedicated to ensuring America will one day "make good" on that promissory note that this nation made to all people regardless of race, creed or color. She worked ceaselessly carrying her husband's message and the legacy of those unimaginably brave civil rights champions who faced violence armed not with guns or knives, but with faith and courage. Indeed, it was a tremendous privilege and honor to share the stage with and introduce Coretta Scott King at the Portland NAACP dinner in 2004. 
   "In a life filled with victories and tragic loss, it did not take long before the song Coretta Scott King began singing so many years ago as a student in Boston became a national symphony - a work of beauty and harmony that moved all of us who heard her message of hope."
