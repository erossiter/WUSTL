SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $5.6 MILLION IN ESSENTIAL FUNDING FOR LAND, CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN MAINE
  Senators Snowe and Collins announced that the Interior Appropriations bill includes funding for the following Maine projects: 
   * $492,000 for the Penobscot River Restoration Trust, Dam Purchase
  This funding will be used for the purchase and removal of the Great Works Dam and the Veazie Dam on the Penobscot River.
   * $295,000 for the Presque Isle Sewer District, State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG)
  This State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) funding will help fund the construction of a 24" diameter pipeline to redirect waste water from the Presque Isle Stream to the Aroostook River.
   * $295,000 for the City of Ellsworth Wastewater Treatment Plant Project
  This STAG grant funding will help the City of Ellsworth acquire land and construct a new wastewater treatment plant.
   * $541,000 for the White Mountain National Forest/Maine Access/Haystack Notch Trailhead
   The White Mountain National Forest/Haystack Notch Trailhead property is located in Mason Township in western Maine, where a large amount of timber company lands are being disposed and turned over to development and subdivision. This acquisition would ensure access to trails and trailheads that could be lost if the tract is sold to another private entity and the property is subdivided. The property provides important wildlife values and has natural wetlands and two key perennial streams, the West Branch of the Pleasant River and Miles Brook, which are tributaries of the Androscoggin River, along with several intermittent streams.
   * $3.25 million for the Lower Penobscot Forest Project
   The Lower Penobscot Forest Legacy project links four disconnected conservation areas and creates permanent land and aquatic linkages that will conserve a total of 65,473 acres. According to the U.S. Forest Service, these forests represent some of the most threatened areas from development.
   * $590,000 for Acadia National Park Land Acquisition -- Pooler Farm/Northeast Creek Watershed
   Maine Coast Heritage Trust and Friends of Acadia have partnered to hold 148 acres of land at the former Pooler Farm in the Northeast Creek watershed until such time as Acadia National Park is able to purchase them for permanent protection as part of the Park. This is one of approximately 150 in holdings inside Acadia's congressionally established boundaries. An estimated $1.5 million is needed to enable the Park to complete this purchase. Friends of Acadia and Maine Coast Heritage Trust will invest the proceeds of the friendly sale to the Park in a revolving land conservation fund dedicated to holding other key properties for Acadia until future Land and Water Conservation Fund appropriations become available.
   * $295,000 for the University of Maine: Northeastern States Research Cooperative
   The Northeastern States Research Consortium, authorized by Congress in 1998, supports research on ecosystems, economic development, forest products and conservation efforts to benefit the Northern Forest. Funding for research is needed to improve forest management in the Acadian forest. Doing so will promote greater growth and yield for forest products through projects like the development of the disease resistant white pine. Continued promotion of this research will foster more productive Maine forests.
   In addition, the omnibus spending bill includes $2.1 million for the Water Environment Research Foundation to fund quality research grants for which Maine will be eligible to apply. The bill also provides $7.6 million for the National Rural Water Association for rural and small water system technical assistance programs, of which part of the funding would benefit Maine.
