SEN. SNOWE CONTINUES AS SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE CHAIR
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today announced Republican committee memberships for the 109th Congress. Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe will remain Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. 
   "I am excited to begin another two years as Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee," said Snowe. "One of my primary goals in the 109th Congress will be to keep the lines of communication open between government and small businesses, so they have the tools and resources to succeed. Given that small businesses represent more than 99% of all employers and create 75% of net new jobs, it is vital that Congress remain responsive to, and advocate for the changing needs of this invaluable sector of the American economy." 
   Senator Snowe has served for two years as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. The committee oversees the Small Business Administration (SBA) and researches and addresses problems encountered by small businesses. 
   Senator Snowe will also continue to serve on the Committee on Finance, the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
