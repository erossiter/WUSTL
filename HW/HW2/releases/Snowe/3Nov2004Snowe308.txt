SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON RE-ELECTION OF BUSH
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement on the re-election of President George W. Bush:
   "The American people have spoken and I congratulate President Bush on his well-deserved victory. At an unprecedented time with the worst attack ever on our soil, our President displayed extraordinary determination, leadership and resolve when history was thrust upon him and the United States. At the same time, I believe his landmark accomplishments in the areas of education, prescription drug coverage and reducing the tax burden for working Americans have left a positive and lasting impact on the landscape of our nation. 
   "As the President prepares for a second term, it will be vital that he work to reach across party lines to help bridge the country's ideological divisions and develop the consensus-driven solutions the American people expect and deserve. The President has rightly said that a new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the entire nation, and that when we work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America. I am also hopeful that Republicans in Congress - and particularly in the Senate, where consensus remains critical - will work to build the bipartisan support that is necessary if we are to face the challenges of our times and achieve results on the issues that matter most to Americans. In that light, people are clearly concerned about our future engagement in Iraq, and I believe the President must be unrelenting in working to bring our allies to bear in ensuring a stable Iraq in which the Iraqi people will take control of their own security and destiny.
   "Finally, I also thank Senator Kerry for his unflagging dedication to public service, and for his gracious concession speech in which he talked about the danger of division, and pledged to help bridge the partisan divide."
