SEN. SNOWE: CHANGE TO DEPLOYMENT POLICY WRONG HEADED AND DEVASTATING TO STATE'S NATIONAL GUARD
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate National Guard Caucus, on Tuesday, Jan. 16, released the following statement in response to a Department of Defense proposal to change deployment policy for National Guard units in Maine. To meet the demand of a troop level increase ordered by President Bush earlier this week, the DOD has proposed eliminating the policy that previously prohibited National Guardsmen from servicing more than 24 months of active duty over any five year period.  
   "Maine's National Guardsmen have done their duty and served their country courageously in both Iraq and Afghanistan over the past five years. I am deeply troubled by the Department of Defense's plans to make hundreds of Maine Guardsmen eligible for involuntary redeployment to meet the demands of a troop level increase in Iraq which I do not believe will addresses the fundamental causes of violence in that country," Snowe said. 
   "Our National Guard is comprised of citizen soldiers with families, jobs, and small businesses that depend on them. This wrong headed change in eligibility policy would have a devastating effect on the lives of many courageous men and women, the state's economy, and the Maine National Guard. I strongly oppose any mobilization of Maine units that have served in Iraq or Afghanistan in the past 5 years and will take every step available to ensure these brave servicemen and women are not forced to return to active duty ahead of schedule. Our National Guard serves voluntarily and their dedication to the security of our nation should be commended, not abused."
