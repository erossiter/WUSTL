SEN. SNOWE HAILS NATIONAL HONOR FOR MACHIAS RIVER PROJECT
  A longtime supporter of conservation efforts, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) hailed the Machias River Corridor Coalition which was honored today with a "National Wetlands Award" from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services (USFWS).  
 The Coalition has successfully protected more than 4,200 acres of wetlands and adjacent riparian habitat, including preserving critical habitat for the federally endangered Atlantic salmon. 
   "I applaud the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services for rightly recognizing the extraordinary efforts of the Machias River Corridor Coalition in protecting the rich natural resources of the Machias river and its tributaries. This premier example of a successful federal-state, public-private partnership speaks to a trend throughout the Northern Forest that blends sustainably managed forests with special ecological places and habitats in need of preservation and restoration," said Snowe. "Working in conjunction with the Coalition partners, I echo their dedication and determination to protect these vital forests, wetlands and waterways for future generations in Maine." 
   Snowe has been instrumental in securing $4 million in federal funding for the conservation project, including $2 million in the Forest Legacy Program fund within the fiscal year 2004 Interior Appropriations. The Machias River Project is a joint effort with former landowners, International Paper, and the Nature Conservancy, the Atlantic Salmon Commission, the Maine Department of Conservation, and the Machias River Watershed Council.
