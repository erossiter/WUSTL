SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER AND REMEMBRANCE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today joined in the observance of the National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  
 Snowe issued the following statement: 
   "Today and every day, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the Gulf region, especially those who lost loved ones to Hurricane Katrina. An entire nation stands with you in your time of loss and we will continue to bring relief to those who have suffered so much. 
   "And it will take an entire nation to accomplish the tasks before us. As President Bush said, we must be committed to giving the relief operation and the rebuilding of New Orleans and the gulf region anything and everything that is needed to ensure success. 
   "In addition to providing relief to the Gulf region and assisting the recovery of the affected communities, the most pressing concern of the federal government must be ensuring that the response to future disasters does not follow the model of our response to Hurricane Katrina. We were forewarned days in advance that a storm of such magnitude would hit. Improving our ability to respond quickly and effectively to major disasters - whatever its cause - simply must be one of our top priorities." 
   On Monday, September 19th, Snowe will be traveling to the region with Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Tom Collins.
