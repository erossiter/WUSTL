SEN. SNOWE PRAISES RESOLUTION TO CAPE WIND ISSUE WITHIN COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, praised a resolution to a disputed provision surrounding the Cape Wind project that led to a months long impasse that blocked the conference report to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 Coast Guard Authorization bill from coming to a final vote in both houses of Congress. The Cape Wind project is a proposed wind farm that would be built off the coast of Cape Cod. 
   The provision that was initially included in the Conference report would have given the Governor of Massachusetts final veto authority over any off-shore wind farms. Snowe opposed that provision. The agreement reached would give the Coast Guard the ability to evaluate whether an off-shore wind farm poses a threat to safe navigation.
   "For months, final consideration of the Coast Guard authorization bill was derailed by the inclusion of a provision that the full Senate never considered to allow the Governor of Massachusetts to have the final say over the building an off-shore wind farm. This should never have been included in this bill," said Snowe. "I am pleased, however, that we have come to a reasonable resolution, so we can once and for all move forward with passing the Coast Guard authorization bill."
