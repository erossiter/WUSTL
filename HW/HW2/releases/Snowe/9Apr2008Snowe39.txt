SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $59,700 FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that the Washington County Emergency Medical Services Authority will receive a grant of $59,700 from the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development Program. These funds will be used to purchase six new Lifepak 12 Cardiac Monitors for the county's ambulance service. 
   "As the Washington County Emergency Medical Services Authority provides ambulance and EMS services to a mostly coastal and rural region of eastern Maine, it is critical that these first responders be equipped with the most effective and up to date medical tools for the safe and quick transport of cardiac patients," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "These funds will help ensure that the citizens of Washington County have access to the quality emergency medical care they need and deserve."
   The Washington County Emergency Medical Services Authority provides emergency medical care to all 33,941 citizens in Washington County. The new equipment purchased by the USDA grant will be compatible with the other equipment used in the county's ambulances and hospitals.
