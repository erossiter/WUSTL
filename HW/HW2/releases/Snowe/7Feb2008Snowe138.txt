SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, released the following statement today after the Senate successfully passed an economic stimulus package that included relief for 21.5 million seniors, 250,000 disabled veterans and the widows of veterans: 
   "We live in a world of doing what we can, when we can. The bill we passed today will extend tax relief to the people in this country who need it the most and were left out of the House-passed economic stimulus package.
   "The stimulus package we just passed casts a wider economic net that will benefit millions seniors who are living on a fixed income, our military veterans and their widows.
   "While this bill falls short in some areas, it is still better than the House-passed bill that left seniors, veterans and their widows behind.
   "Those who have given there all for this country certainly deserve to be included in this economic stimulus package and I am proud that Senator Blanche Lincoln and I were able to get this provision in this bill.
   "What's most important is that we do not suspend our efforts to provide relief to the unemployed and heating assistance to low-income families. The work of the United States Congress if far from over and I will continue to actively fight to ensure that these critical challenges not included in this package are considered expeditiously."
