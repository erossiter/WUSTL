SEN. SNOWE ATTENDS PENOBSCOT COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE RESOURCE FAIR, BBQ IN OLD TOWN
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today attended the Penobscot Community Health Care Resource Fair and BBQ in Old Town. The festivities commemorated the expansion of Old Town Family Practice into the newly renovated Helen Hunt School. The day-long resource fair provided information about services available to the community, particularly those affected by the recent closure of Georgia Pacific.  
   "I deeply appreciated today's opportunity to celebrate the transformation of the Helen Hunt School into a state of the art healthcare facility," said Senator Snowe. "While I remain committed to the re-opening of the Georgia Pacific Mill, we should continue to utilize other resources to strengthen the Old Town community during these tough times. The expansion of Old Town Family Practice will not only help serve the healthcare needs of residents, but will also create jobs and restore hope - all of which is cause for celebration."
   Last month, Senator Snowe supported a request by the Maine Department of Labor for $755,338 in National Emergency Funding from the U.S. Department of Labor. The request would provide support services to the unemployed workers at Georgia-Pacific and would support general administration and project monitoring, staffing, and operating expenses to meet the additional demand that is being realized by the re-employment and assistance efforts.
