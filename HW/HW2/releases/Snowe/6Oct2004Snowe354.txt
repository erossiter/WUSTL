SEN. SNOWE: NOAA'S DECISION TO CLOSE NEW ENGLAND FISHING WATERS COULD HURT COUNTLESS FISHERMEN
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries and Coast Guard, today voiced her concern that a decision by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to close hundreds of square miles of fishing grounds off of Cape Cod could economically hurt fishermen throughout New England.  
   "I am gravely concerned by NOAA's sudden and unanticipated decision to close hundreds of miles of fishing grounds east of Cape Cod impacting the livelihoods of countless fishermen throughout New England," said Snowe. "I have contacted NOAA's Regional Administrator for New England to express my extreme displeasure not only in their decision, but in the manner in which they notified the fishing community of this action. At a time when our fishing communities are struggling to recover from years of economic uncertainty due to strict fishing rules, it is incumbent on NOAA to be forthcoming with any decisions that could adversely affect their future." 
   NOAA's ruling came about as a result of a new bilateral agreement between the United States and Canada limiting American and Canadian fishermen's access to parts of Georges Banks to fish haddock, cod, and yellowtail. NOAA contends that their decision came about late last week as a result of American fishermen hitting their yellow tail cap. The yellowtail fishing season began on May 1. Fishermen will not be permitted to groundfish for the rest of the season, but will be allowed to catch other fish. 
   Snowe has contact NOAA's Northeast Regional Administrator Pat Kurkul to voice her displeasure in how the decision was handled and the agency's lack of action to avoid this early closure. She will continue to press the agency on ways to mitigate and correct the effects of closing these fishing grounds.
