SEN. SNOWE COMMEMORATES VETERAN'S DAY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today commemorating Veteran's Day:  
   "On this day of remembrance, a grateful nation pauses to commemorate and celebrate the service and sacrifice of America's veterans. Never has one nation owed so much to so many living and fallen heroes. All the blessings of liberty we cherish today - the security of our families and the strength of our democracy - are a direct inheritance from those who have worn the uniform in our nation's defense. Their uncommon commitment and valor has kept the flame of liberty burning brightly for us and generations to come. 
   "As our brave servicemen and women are on duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the globe, they and their loved ones at home are in our hearts and prayers. Today, we salute their continuing service in the finest tradition of America's veterans."
