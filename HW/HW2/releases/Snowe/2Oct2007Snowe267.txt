SEN. SNOWE NOTIFIED BATH IRON WORKS TO BUILD FIRST NEXT GENERATION NAVAL DESTROYER
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) received a call from Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition Dr. Delores Etter Tuesday morning to notify her that the Navy has decided to issue the first set of Mission Systems Equipment for the Navy's DDG-1000, a next-generation destroyer designed for advance land and sea operations, to Bath Iron Works. In practical terms, this decision means that Bath Iron Works will be the first shipyard to begin construction on the DDG-1000 as part of the dual lead ship acquisition strategy for this new class of destroyers. Northrup-Grumman Ship Systems in Pascagoula, Mississippi will build the other ship.  
   "This is fantastic news for BIW and for Maine," Sen. Snowe said. "The Future of Bath Iron Works and the United States Navy depends on the successful construction of the next generation DDG 1000 destroyer. This will allow the great men and women of BIW to demonstrate what they do best - build the best military ships anywhere in the world." 
   The DDG-1000 will operate as an integral component of the Navy's 21st Century Fleet, providing forward presence and deterrence in support of the ground campaign and contribute naval, joint, or combined battle-space dominance in littoral operations. The Navy awarded BIW with the nearly $197 million contract to support the detailed design and construction of the lead DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer in June.
