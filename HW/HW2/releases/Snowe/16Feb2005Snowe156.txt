SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF CHERTOFF AS SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on the confirmation of Michael Chertoff, by a vote of 98 to 0 in the U.S. Senate, to replace Tom Ridge as Secretary of Homeland Security:  
   "Michael Chertoff has proven himself eminently capable of holding the post of Secretary of Homeland Security," said Snowe. "He has had a distinguished career in law and public service and I am sure he will continue to use all of his talents to keep the United States safe. President Bush has selected a competent and intelligent leader in Michael Chertoff and, given his solid record of service and achievement, I applaud the Senate for confirming him today as the next Secretary of Homeland Security. 
   "I also extend my gratitude to Secretary Ridge for his dedicated service to our country and his pioneering efforts in serving as the first Secretary of Homeland Security. I have known Tom Ridge since we served in the House of Representatives together, and his exemplary leadership over the past three years at the newly created Department of Homeland Security is exactly what I expected of him. Secretary Ridge will be truly missed by all who had the pleasure of working with him."
