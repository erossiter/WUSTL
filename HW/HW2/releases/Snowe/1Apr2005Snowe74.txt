HEALTHY LIVING
  HEALTHY LIVING
   Public health advancements, continuing scientific discoveries and new treatment options are enabling Americans to live increasingly longer and more productive lives. Average life expectancy in the U.S. is now at a record 74 years for men and 78 years for women. However, there is still much more we can do for aging Mainers to improve their quality of life. 
   While Americans are indeed living longer lives, that doesn't necessarily mean that those lives are any healthier or happier than in previous decades. Many don't follow medical recommendations to stay as strong and healthy as possible throughout their lives leading to chronic diseases like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease. These are often preventable diseases if confronted through basic lifestyle changes, including exercise, a healthy diet, and regular visits to their physician. 
   This year we celebrate National Public Health Week from April 4-10 with the goal of empowering Americans to live both stronger and longer not only this one week, but throughout their lives. The facts make it clear that Americans could do more to promote personal health and decrease the negative effects of aging. While eighty percent of older adults suffer from at least one chronic condition and the average 75 year old has three chronic conditions and uses five prescription drugs:
   * Nearly one in four older adults skips doses of medication or do not fill prescriptions because of cost, missing the full benefits of modern drugs. 
   * About 60 percent of older adults take their prescriptions improperly and thousands of lives are lost as a result. 
   * Over 80 percent of seniors have a diet that is poor or needs improvement. 
   * Few older adults get optimal physical activity - this could reduce direct medical costs by as much as $77 billion annually. 
   * Both dementia and Alzheimer's disease have been associated with smoking. 
   In order to combat the problems and complications often associated with aging and encourage Americans to live healthier lives, the American Public Health Association (APHA) has identified the three P's- Prevent, Protect, and Plan. Mainers can prevent many common health problems that hinder the enjoyment of later years by adopting a healthy lifestyle. People who are physically active, eat a healthy diet, avoid tobacco products, and practice other healthy behaviors reduce their risk of chronic diseases and have half the rate of disability of those who do not.
   Older Americans continue to suffer from chronic diseases that can be treated if they are detected in time. In order to protect themselves, it is imperative that people get necessary screenings and follow treatment and medication plans recommended by their health care providers. The national average for people who have received all the recommended preventive services from Medicare is 34.4% for men and 33.4% for women - that number is disturbingly low. In Maine, 41.6% of men and 33.4% of women 65 and older are getting the selected preventive services provided, recommended, and covered by Medicare.
   By carefully planning for the future, we all can live longer, healthier lives. Creating and following an action plan for minimizing health risks can make a large difference in cutting down on potential health risks with our families playing a critical role. In 1997, approximately 22 million households in the United States (nearly one in four) were caring for someone age 50 or older. That number is expected to rise to 39 million households by 2007. 
   Our health needs to be a topmost priority for all Americans. Everyone must do their part. With some effort and the help of family and physician, each of us can adopt a healthier lifestyle to live a bright future.
