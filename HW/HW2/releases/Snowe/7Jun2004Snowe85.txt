SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON DEATH OF FORMER WATERVILLE MAYOR
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on the death of former Waterville mayor Cyril M. Joly, Jr.: 
   "This past weekend was indeed a sad occasion with the passing of a cherished mayor of Waterville. Cyril Joly, Jr. was a respected and resounding voice in public service and in the Republican party, rising to the office of Assistant to the Secretary in what today is the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, in the Eisenhower Administration.
   "A man of great dignity and deeply held beliefs, Cy served the citizens of Waterville with honor for two elected terms. Devoted to elevating the quality of life for every person, Cy would often volunteer his time to feed those at local soup kitchens and to entertain countless children during the holiday season. His generous spirit will be his legacy.
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to Cy's friends and family during this difficult time."
