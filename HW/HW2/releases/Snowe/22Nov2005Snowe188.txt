SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO FUND COMMUNITY SERVICES
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) voted for $636.8 million in funding for the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Program, the level at which it was funded last year. This amendment to a temporary spending measure, offered by Sen.Tom Harkin (D-IA) was defeated by a vote of 46 to 50. Communities across the country use CSBG funding to assist low income individuals and families to become self-sufficient through services like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) Program, child health and development, job training, literacy, and food and shelter assistance.  
   "Community Service Block Grants fund some of the most critical programs for the poor in Maine, including the administration of the LIHEAP Program," said Snowe. "We should not cut back on these services and abandon those among us who are most in need of assistance." 
   A continuing resolution the Senate passed today will fund programs administered by the Departments of Health and Human services, Labor, and Education through December 17th at the levels proposed by the House or the Senate for Fiscal Year 2006 or the current FY 2005 level, whichever is lower. For CSBG that means that CSBG will be funded at $320 million, because the House funded the program at $320 million. 
   In Maine, CSBG helps fund the following services: 
   LIHEAP - offering rural assistance for clients to apply for benefits (home visits for clients with no transportation). 
   Family Partnerships - assists families to move toward self-sufficiency through delivery of intensive assessment and support. 
   Law Project - offering Legal assistance to low income Domestic violence individuals and families. Housing Services - development of low income and workforce housing. 
   Health Services - Community outreach and education, Maine Breast & cervical Health program, Family life education.
