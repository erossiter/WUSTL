SEN. SNOWE HAILS PASSAGE OF HEALTH IT BILL
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) hailed Senate passage of the Wired for Health Care Quality Act as an important first step in improving the quality and lowering the cost of health care. The bill includes key privacy provisions authored by Snowe and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI).  
   "With an estimated 98,000 deaths per year resulting from medical errors caused by the continuing use of outdated technology, it has become obvious that we must bring American medicine up to speed," said Snowe. "This legislation lays the groundwork necessary to bring technology online quickly to save lives, improve health care delivery, and ultimately reduce costs. It also contains privacy requirements that will protect patients' control over their health records." 
   The privacy provisions in the bill include a requirement that, for grant programs established by the bill, a patient be informed if their personal health record is inappropriately disclosed. The bill also calls for a new GAO study to examine a requirement for notifying any patient when such a disclosure occurs. 
   Snowe and Stabenow are lead sponsors of a bill that would provide more than $4 billion in grants and tax incentives to help health care providers make the necessary investments in information technology software, hardware, and services. "The Health Information Technology Act of 2005" would provide a variety of incentives including tax advantages, adjustments in Medicare payments, and grants, and give priority to providers serving high percentages of Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP patients. 
   An agreement between the original cosponsors of the "Wired for Health Care Quality Act," the Senate Majority Leader, and Senators Snowe and Stabenow will ensure that the issue of funding for implementation of a nationwide health IT system will receive a hearing sometime in 2006.
