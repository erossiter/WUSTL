SEN. SNOWE BACKS RETRAINING ASSISTANCE FOR WORKERS AT OSRAM SYLVANIA PLANT IN WALDOBORO
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is asking Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao to support the petition by 122 workers at Osram Sylvania's facility in Waldoboro for certification for job retraining assistance under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.  
 The displacement of the workers will occur over the next 10 months. Osram Sylvania manufactures light bulb filaments at its Waldoboro facility. 
   "I strongly urge immediate assistance for the workers at Osram Sylvania's facility in Waldoboro. I am deeply concerned by the lack of alternative opportunities for these workers, who will require immediate help with job training, searches for new jobs, relocation and other employment services," said Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. "The closing of the plant will be a real blow to the Mid-Coast region, and I ask your assistance in speeding immediate help that can aid these workers, their families, and residents of the small towns and neighboring communities in Lincoln County who may be affected." 
   "I urge you to carefully investigate this petition and approve it as quickly as possible so that these workers may have the opportunity of planning ahead in dealing with these layoff activities," Snowe said in her letter to Secretary Chao. 
   To determine eligibility to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance, the Department of Labor will examine the workers' petition and determine the impact foreign competition has had on the job losses. A favorable finding by the Secretary will pave the way for certification, which in turn permits federal funding of job retraining and other assistance for laid-off workers.
