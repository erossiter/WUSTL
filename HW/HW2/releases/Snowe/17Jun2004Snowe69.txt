SEN. SNOWE: FEDERAL CHANNEL INTO WELLS HARBOR TO BE DREDGED THIS WEEKEND
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today hailed the final approval by the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct maintenance dredging on the outer federal channel leading into Wells Harbor. 
   "I applaud the decision of the Scientific Review Panel to approve the maintenance dredging at Wells Harbor. This news is certainly welcomed by the thousands of Mainers - fishermen and recreational boaters alike - who use Wells Harbor each year," said Snowe. "The regular dredging of our state's harbors and waterways is critical to ensuring the safety of the vessels and its passengers, and expanding sea commerce opportunities. It is also vital to maintaining the environmental integrity of existing coastal habitats and the promotion of our coastal communities."
   As early as Friday, June 18, the Army Corps will be utilizing the dredging vessel, the CURRITUCK, within the harbor's waters to remove sediments, which have accumulated at the bottom of the channel, thus ensuring adequate depth for use by shipping vessels, fishing boats, and recreational vessels. Snowe facilitated ongoing discussions with the Army Corps, the Town of Wells, and federal and state regulatory agencies to secure the approval of the Scientific Review Panel, the authoritative body who examines the economical and environmental cost to proposed dredging.
   This dredging of Wells Harbor will be similar in size and scope of the successful harbor maintenance dredge conducted in 2002. Prior to dredging, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal and state regulatory agencies completed reviews and rendered supportive findings for the project. The Town of Wells and the Harbormaster were notified of the final approval earlier today.
