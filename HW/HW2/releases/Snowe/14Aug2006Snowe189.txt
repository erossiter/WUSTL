SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR RENEWED EFFORT TO COMBAT TERRORISM IN WAKE OF FOILED UK PLOT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement today calling for a renewed effort to combat terrorism in wake of the foiled terrorist plot in the United Kingdom : 
   "As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am regularly briefed by the intelligence community on the various threats posed by Islamic extremists. I believe that the sophistication and scope of this foiled plot exceeds anything we have seen since 9/11. It demonstrates that the face of our enemy is ever-changing and their will is unwavering. They will use whatever means necessary to test our resolve and change their tactics to take advantage of any potential vulnerabilities. We must recognize the significance of these homegrown British terrorists, and understand that this is an ominous sign for those nations committed to defeating extremists dedicated to committing indiscriminate mass murder. This development signals the continued evolution of al Qaeda to an inspirational force for potential terrorists around the globe. 
   "I believe it is imperative that we remain vigilant and committed to winning the war on terror. If this group in the UK understood that liquid explosives are difficult to detect then we must adapt our security measures and anticipate the methods of our enemy to ensure they evolve more quickly than the plans of the terrorists. This means that we have to continue to evaluate and improve the protection of our airports, our ports, our rail system, our roadways, and our critical infrastructure. We must not lose sight of the evolving threat of Islamic extremism, which has not diminished. The American people are resolute and resilient; we can and will endure."
