SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS PLEDGE SUPPORT FOR WORKERS AT MOOSEHEAD MANUFACTURING
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins on Friday, Feb. 9, expressed their concern and pledged their support for the workers who will lose their jobs at Moosehead Manufacturing Company, Inc. in Monson.  
   Officials at Moosehead Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of hardwood household furniture, announced today that the company will cease operations. 
   "Our domestic furniture manufacturers face extreme, and often unfair, foreign competition. It is always troubling when workers lose their jobs through no fault of their own. This is a tough blow to the families who are directly affected and to the entire community," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. 
   "We will do everything possible to assist the workers during this difficult time. We expect to work together with state and community agencies to create a local transition team that would help provide job training and support services. In addition, we will support any effort by the company to obtain federal emergency funds to provide workers who are losing their jobs with Trade Adjustment Assistance."
