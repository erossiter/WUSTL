SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS PRAISE EDA HIRING OF ALAN BRIGHAM AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR MAINE, N.H., MASS.
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) today commended the Economic Development Administration (EDA) for hiring Alan Brigham of Windham, Maine, as the new Economic Development Representative for Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Brigham's position will be based in Portland, Maine.  
   The Economic Development Administration is an agency under the U.S. Department of Commerce and works to generate jobs, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth. Last May, working in conjunction with the Maine Economic Development District Association, Senators Snowe and Collins advocated strongly for the creation of this crucial position. In a letter to Assistant Secretary of Commerce Sandy Baruah, the Senators underscored the importance of filling this position, specifically asking that it be based in Maine. 
   "Alan brings a wealth of economic development knowledge and experience to the position having served in the McKernan, King and Baldacci administrations," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Alan will be a tremendous advocate for Maine who will work tirelessly to advance Maine's economic development efforts."
   Alan Brigham most recently worked in the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services as Transportation Service Center Director. He previously worked as the Business Development Coordinator for Central Maine Power Company and as a policy director with the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development under Governors McKernan, King and Baldacci. He is a former naval officer and commercial pilot. He holds degrees from the University of Alabama and the University of Southern Maine, and an economic development graduate certificate from the University of Oklahoma.
