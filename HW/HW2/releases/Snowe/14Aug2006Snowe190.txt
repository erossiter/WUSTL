SEN. SNOWE HONORS VIETNAM VETERANS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised the opening of the Dignity Memorial Wall in Portland, Maine. The Dignity Memorial Vietnam Wall is a three-quarter-scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. that lists the names of the 58,249 soldiers killed or missing in action during the 16-year conflict.  
   "The Dignity Memorial unveiled in Portland today reminds us all that the blessings of liberty we cherish are a gift from those who have worn the uniform in our nation's defense. We are reminded that just as they performed their duty, we must perform ours. We must remain forever vigilant in fulfilling a promise made to our veterans to remember their sacrifice and their steadfast commitment to defending our freedom and the freedom of future generations," said Snowe. "We should also thank those who have brought this wonderful memorial to Maine and given us the opportunity to honor all of our Nation's veterans and Maine's more than 150,000 veterans." 
   The replica was created by the Dignity Memorial funeral, cremation, and cemetery providers to give millions of Americans who are unable to visit the nation's capital an opportunity to see the Memorial. The exhibit is displayed in a number of cities and towns throughout the United States each year, allowing millions of visitors to see and touch the 240 foot long and eight foot high black, mirror-like, the faux-granite replica.
