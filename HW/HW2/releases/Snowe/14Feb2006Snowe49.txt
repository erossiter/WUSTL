SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING AWAY OF LARRY MAHANEY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today expressed her sense of loss at the passing last night of Bangor's Larry Mahaney. Snowe issued the following statement:  
   "Jock and I are profoundly saddened by Larry's passing, and we offer our most heartfelt sympathy to his entire family in their time of mourning. All of us have lost one of Maine's greatest champions, whose unparalleled and unrelenting generosity was equaled only by his capacity for compassion and friendship - and Jock and I could not have been more fortunate and privileged to have Larry as a cherished friend. 
   "Larry led his life with passion and integrity - not only living the American dream, but also in sharing it with others. From his coaching days to his remarkable leadership in building Webber Oil, everyone knew and loved Larry, whose commitment to Maine was matched only by his dedication to his own family. His philanthropy lives on at the University of Maine, Thomas College, St. Joseph's college, and countless places throughout our state - and also in the hearts of all those whose lives he touched and forever improved. Kind and giving, thoughtful and proud of his roots, Larry's is a legacy that will forever be treasured, and always remembered."
