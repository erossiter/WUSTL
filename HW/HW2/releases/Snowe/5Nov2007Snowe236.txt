SEN. SNOWE VOTES IN FAVOR OF STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE BILL
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe released the following statement today after voting in favor of legislation that would reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program: 
   "I think all of us - Republicans and Democrats alike - must realize that if we are going to successfully reauthorize this program there has to be some conciliation. At the same time, a series of concessions have already been made in order to produce the strong bipartisan support that has been demonstrated thus far, therefore radical changes seem hardly in order. While today's vote certainly won't be the last vote on the S-CHIP reauthorization, I am encouraged that members on both sides of the aisle, House and Senate, continue to talk though their differences."
   The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 64-30.
