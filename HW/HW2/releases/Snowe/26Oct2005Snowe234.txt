SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF ROSA PARKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement on the passing of Rosa Parks, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996:  
   "Rosa Parks was a woman of inspiring conviction who fought for decades against the oppression of African-Americans in this country. By igniting the modern civil rights movement in the United States, Rosa Parks set in motion the great and ongoing march toward equality in America. All who value human rights and dignity, and who yearn to see them realized, mourn her passing and pay homage to her enormous achievement." 
   In Montgomery, Alabama in December of 1955, Rosa Parka refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger. She was arrested and convicted of violating a local ordinance. Her defiance fomented a citywide boycott of the bus system that lasted more than a year and eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation on city buses. Over the next four decades, Rosa Parks helped raise awareness of the struggle for racial equality.
