SEN. SNOWE REQUESTS NOAA BRIEFING ON RED TIDE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, today requested a briefing from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the current red tide outbreak, which has forced the closure of shellfish beds from Bar Harbor to Martha's Vineyard.  
   "This year's devastating red tide outbreak threatens Maine's coastal communities and economies. We must gain an understanding of the situation on the ground so we can undertake steps to mitigate its effects," said Snowe. "I've asked NOAA to explain the ecological and economic ramifications, offer a forecast as to how long this condition will persist, outline what they are doing to work with states and pursue a coordinated response, what federal programs are available to help, and what federal legislation is needed to authorize assistance." 
   A date for the briefing has not yet been set.
