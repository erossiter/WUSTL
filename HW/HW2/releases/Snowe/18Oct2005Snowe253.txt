SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES SACO FACTORY WILL PRODUCE M2HB MACHINE GUNS, BARRELS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today announced that Saco Defense has been chosen to produce 526 M2HB machine guns and 2,000 barrels for General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products. General Dynamics was awarded $10.6 million to perform this work.  
   "Saco Defense is a world-renowned gun factory and it is only fitting that they were entrusted with the job of producing these world-class armaments," said Snowe. "We must ensure that our troops are well-armed and prepared with adequate ammunitions and I am proud that Maine can contribute to this effort." 
   General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products has received three orders totaling $10.6 million from U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command for the production of 526 M2HB machine guns and 2,000 barrels. The M2HB, a crew-served 12.7 mm machine gun, features a rate of fire of more than 450 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of 2,000 yards. Its high level of lethality and versatility has made it the work standard in its class. The M2HB is in the military inventories of over 30 countries, including the United States. 
   Production work will be performed at General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products' Saco, Maine facility, which has manufactured the M2 family of machine guns since 1979. Saco Defense is one of the world's leading producers of small and medium caliber machine guns, cannon barrels and complementary equipment. It is the sole producer of the MK-19 40mm automatic grenade launcher for the U.S. armed forces, and is in the final stages of development of a next-generation automatic grenade launcher called Striker. Saco Defense products are in the inventories of more than 40 countries; they complement the high-rate-of-fire Gatling-type weapons produced by General Dynamics Armament Systems.
