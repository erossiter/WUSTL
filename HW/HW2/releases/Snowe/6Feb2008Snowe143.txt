SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FIREFIGHTERS ASSISTANCE GRANTS AWARDED TO MAINE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Assistance program have awarded $222,657 in vehicle acquisition and operations and safety grants to two Maine fire departments. These awards aim to enhance first responders' ability to protect the health and safety of the public and provide fire departments with additional resources. 
   "We can never take for granted the challenges that our fire safety personnel face every day," Senator Snowe said. "These grants have become an integral component of our local firefighters' ability to get the training and equipment they need to keep our communities safe."
   The Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program is an important component of a coordinated effort to strengthen the Nation's overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and fire-related hazards. Since 2004, with the Fiscal Year 2007 awards, AFG has provided a total of almost $2.2 billion to first-responder organizations to purchase response equipment, personal protective equipment, and vehicles.
   The grants were administered as follows:
   * $23,157 to the Penobscot Nation Fire Department for Operations and Safety - Grant Contact - Joe Loring: (207) 817-7397 
   * $199,500 to the Wilton Fire Department for Vehicle Acquisition - Grant Contact - Birdell Dunham III: (207) 645-2211
