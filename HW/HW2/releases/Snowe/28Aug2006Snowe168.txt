SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $100,000 IN FUNDING TO PEOPLE'S REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM IN PORTLAND
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Corporation for National and Community Service has awarded the People's Regional Opportunity Program in Portland $113,558 in Programs of National Significance funding (PNS). PNS is a special Senior Corps program that focuses on assisting individuals with chronic and debilitating illness and providing care to developmentally disabled adults who reside at home in community-based settings. 
   "This funding will help expand services in the Portland area for many elderly individuals who desperately need it," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "Community service programs such as these greatly enrich the lives of those being served, but also promote goodness in the lives of our volunteers."
   The Corporation for National and Community Service was established in 1993 to connect Americans of all ages and backgrounds with opportunities to give back to their communities and their nation. It merged the work and staffs of two predecessor agencies, ACTION and the Commission on National and Community Service. In addition to Senior Corps, the Corporation for National and Community Service also administers grant competitions in its AmeriCorps and Learn and Serve America programs.
