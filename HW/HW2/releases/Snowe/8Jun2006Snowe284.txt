  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today announced that U.S. Department of Labor is releasing $1,323,330 in National Emergency Grant (NEG) funds for employment-related assistance for Jordan-Sanmina employees.  
   "We have long fought to help Maine people gain the skills to have the necessary skills to allow them to have a job to provide for their families. Today, we are pleased to announce over $1.3 million in essential job training funding for Jordan-Sanmina employees," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. 
   Those targeted for assistance, include 320 participants of the 565 workers who were dislocated from the Jordan Meats plant in Portland, and the Sanmina-SCI facility in Westbrook.
   This funding is the second and final portion of funding that will be released by the Department of Labor to allow the 320 participants in this NEG program to complete their training. This will bring the total NEG funds awarded under this project to $1,798,574.
