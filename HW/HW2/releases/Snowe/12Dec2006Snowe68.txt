SEN. SNOWE THANKS FALL INTERNS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) expressed gratitude for three students who interned in her Washington D.C. office throughout the fall season. Interns in Sen. Olympia Snowe's office helped complete administrative tasks, answered constituent phone calls, and gave guided tours of the United States Capitol.  
   "I deeply appreciate the diligent effort and committed service that Amanda, Sara, and Kyle contributed to the office and the state of Maine this fall," said Snowe. "I hope they enjoyed their experience in the nation's capitol as much as we enjoyed having them, and I wish them the best of luck in the future."

   * Sara El Hashem, originally from Thomaston, is a senior at American University studying political science.
