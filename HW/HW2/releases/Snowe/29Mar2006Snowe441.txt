SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY WEINBERGER
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement today on the passing of former Reagan Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger early this morning near his home in Mt. Desert, Maine:  
   Today, with the passing of former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, we have lost a great American patriot. He was a man of tremendous intellect and conviction whose unwavering commitment to President Reagan's vision of a strong national defense ultimately helped lead to the downfall of the Soviet Union and an end to the Cold War. He left an indelible mark on the course of our country's history that will be remembered for generations to come. 
   My husband Jock and I first met Cap Weinberger when we served in the House of Representatives in the 1980s and he served with distinction at the helm of the Defense Department. Over the years, we became more than just colleagues; we became friends spending time together in Maine. Jock and I send our deepest condolences to Cap's friends and family - most especially his loving wife Jane, his son Caspar, Jr., and his daughter Arlin - during this most difficult time.
