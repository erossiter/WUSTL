SEN. SNOWE JOINS EFFORT TO REIGN IN TAX BREAKS FOR OIL COMPANIES
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) joined Sen.  
 Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in offering legislation repealing unnecessary tax breaks in the Energy Bill intended to encourage oil exploration and development. The Senate defeated this amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill by a vote of 48 to 51. 
   "Oil companies continue to rake in enormous profits while consumers face record-high fuel prices," said Snowe. "Given these huge profits, special tax breaks for the oil industry are unnecessary and inappropriate. I agree with President Bush - now is not the time to shower the oil and gas industry with favors it does not need. I am disappointed this amendment failed, but I hope the Senate will revisit this issue in the future." 
   Currently, firms engaged in the exploration and development of oil, gas or geothermal properties can expense intangible drilling and development costs such as fuel, labor, repairs to equipment and supplies. This tax credit is largely claimed by integrated oil and gas producers. Integrated oil companies are allowed to expense 70% of their drilling costs up-front, then the next 30% over the course of five years.
