SEN. SNOWE VOTES AGAINST SENATE SPENDING REDUCTION BILL
  Citing a lack of essential funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted against the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Reconciliation bill. The Senate passed this bill by a vote of 52 to 47. 
   "This vote was not an easy one for me, because it was my sincere hope that we could produce a reasonable bill," said Snowe. "Ultimately, I felt compelled to vote against a bill that regrettably does not serve the interests of Maine or America. Over the past several days I worked tirelessly to have essential funding for the low income heating program included in this bill. With record fuel prices in Maine and across the country, the message I hope to send with my vote today is that we must help our most vulnerable citizens keep warm this winter." 
   During negotiations, Snowe repeatedly insisted that she would not support any plan that saves money by targeting those in need. She successfully ensured that the $10 billion in savings over five years in the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the bill do not cut any benefits to Americans enrolled in these vital programs.
