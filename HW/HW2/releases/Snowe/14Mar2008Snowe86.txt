SEN. SNOWE PASSES SNOWE-SPONSORED AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE LIHEAP FUNDING FOR FY-2009
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) announced today that the United States Senate voted last night to include a Snowe-co-sponsored amendment that increased LIHEAP funding in the FY-2009 budget from $2.5 billion to $5.1 billion. 
   "Maine's families are struggling to heat their homes and with record energy prices soaring by the day, we need to provide more support for low-income families," said Senator Snowe. "The proposed FY-2009 budget fell far short of providing the kind of relief Maine's families need to overcome a struggling economy and rising energy costs. At a time when energy prices seem to have no limit we must provide emergency funding for this winter while simultaneously making preemptive measures to mitigate the burden for next winter. No family should ever go without the capacity to heat their homes and the recent spiral in prices is making that harder every single day. Last night, the Senate took decisive action and recognized that energy assistance must increase and provide additional resources for those who need it the most."
