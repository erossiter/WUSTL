SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS REQUEST ASSISTANCE FOR IRVING MILL EMPLOYEES
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today requested that the U.S. Department of Labor approve a Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition filed on behalf of the 36 employees who will lose their jobs tomorrow when Irving Forest Products Inc. closes. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins sent a letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao requesting timely review of the petition recently filed by the Maine Department of Labor on behalf of the workers directly impacted.  
   "This assistance is critical to helping the Irving Mill workers get back on their feet and survive any difficult periods of financial instability," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Far too often our dedicated workers are losing jobs because of the impact of foreign competition. We will continue to support the Mainers impacted by the Mill closure and make sure they get the aid and resources they need." 
   The purpose of the TAA program is to aid workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages decrease as a result of increased imports. If the TAA petition is approved, displaced Irving workers will be eligible for employment training in another job or career, income support, job search allowance, and relocation services for individuals who obtain jobs outside of their normal commuting area.
