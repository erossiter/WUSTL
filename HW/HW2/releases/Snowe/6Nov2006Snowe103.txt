SEN. SNOWE 'MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR PROSPERITY AND SUCCESS'
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today released the following statement in response to the completion of a purchase and sale agreement with Georgia-Pacific for the company's Old Town mill site. Red Shield, a biorefinery company, will generate power at the site and to the power grid, expecting to employ 250 workers. The first two tenants of the Old Town Mill site, Hallowell International, Limited Liability Company, and Lamtec Inc., are expected to eventually employ another 250 workers as well.  
  "Today's announcement marks the beginning of a new opportunity for prosperity and success for the Old Town community and the hundreds of Mainers whose lives have been affected by this long and difficult struggle," said Senator Snowe. "The Old Town community and local officials, local and state representatives, the State's Congressional delegation, and the Governor have worked hand in hand for the more than six months to meet this challenge head on, and we will continue that partnership as we work toward achieving our ultimate goal of putting Mainers to work. The challenge before us now is capitalize on the progress that has been made and build for the future. I will continue to support every effort to bring jobs to Old Town and do all I can to advance the redevelopment of the Old Town Mill. " 
   Since March, negotiations have centered on conversations with prospective buyers in order to facilitate a settlement for the sale and purchase of the former Georgia-Pacific Old Town mill. Senator Snowe has worked closely with officials from both Georgia-Pacific and Koch Industries to reach an agreement that would employ as many Mainers as possible.
