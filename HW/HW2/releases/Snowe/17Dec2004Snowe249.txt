SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR CANCER PREVENTION, TREATMENT
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced that Medicare will support new demonstration projects to improve the early detection and treatment of cancer and reduce health disparities among minority Medicare beneficiaries, including American Indians.  
   "Breast cancer strikes over 200,000 American women each year, affecting 1 in 7 women at some point in their lifetime," said Snowe. "Nearly all Americans know someone who has been afflicted with this disease - or have experienced it themselves. I am glad that Medicare is reaching out to underserved groups, and I encourage any organization in Maine that may be eligible to apply." 
   The demonstration will focus on three components of cancer services: screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Four cancers are targeted: breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate. Through participation in these demonstration projects, beneficiaries should receive more timely cancer screening tests, diagnoses, and treatments, recognize an overall improvement in access to this care, and should increase their satisfaction with the healthcare system. 
   Medicare is inviting participation from chronic care management organizations, health insurers, physician group practices, coordinated care services providers, provider-sponsored organizations, academic medical centers, comprehensive cancer centers, special population networks, community clinical oncology programs, community-based health organizations, community health centers, federally qualified health centers, and minority institutions.
