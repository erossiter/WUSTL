SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $197 MILLION CONTRACT TO SUPPORT DETAIL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF DDG 1000 DESTROYER AT BATH IRON WORKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that the United States Navy has awarded Bath Iron Works (BIW) in Bath, Maine a contract valued at more than $197 million to support the detail design and construction of a lead DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer.  
   "This is great news for the men and women of Bath Iron Works who have so nobly upheld the yard's centuries' old tradition of building the greatest military ships in the world," said Senator Snowe. "The Future of Bath Iron Works and the United States Navy depends on the successful construction of the next generation DDG 1000 destroyer and I am so pleased to see this contract awarded to such a remarkable and talented group of shipbuilders." 
   The DDG-1000 will operate as an integral component of the Navy's 21st Century Fleet, providing forward presence and deterrence in support of the ground campaign and contribute naval, joint, or combined battle-space dominance in littoral operations.
