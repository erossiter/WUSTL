SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS PLEASED DISASTER RELIEF FUNDING FOR MAINE FARMERS INCLUDED IN FY 2005 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) today announced that an amendment to provide critical relief for Maine's farmers has been included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report that passed both the House and Senate this weekend.  
 The provision authorizes the Farm Service Agency to distribute federal relief for crops adversely impacted by weather.
   "American farmers and ranchers across our nation experienced tremendous weather-related losses in recent years. In Maine, our potato, blueberry and apple farmers are struggling, Their crop yields are reduced with an increased incidence of crop pests and diseases," Snowe and Collins said in a statement. "We are pleased that this provision has been included in the 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill, so our farmers will get the support they so desperately need to get them back on track to produce some of the finest agricultural products in the nation."
   Under the Senate-adopted amendment, Maine farmers could receive up to $9 million in disaster relief under two of the three programs in the legislation:
   I. Crop Disaster & Quality Loss Assistance - Maine to receive approximately $8.1 Million ($2.464 Billion Estimated for the U.S.)
   * Potatoes - Maine farmers to receive approximately $6.5 Million
   * Blueberries - Maine farmers to receive approximately $1.1 Million
   * Hay - Maine farmers to receive approximately $500,000 
   II. Tree Assistance Program - Maine to receive approximately $ 1 Million ($20 Million Estimated for the U.S.) 
   * Provides compensation to producers for the loss of apple trees as a result of weather related disasters. Snowe and Collins previously wrote the United States Department of Agriculture to request funding for Maine apple farmers under the Tree Assistance Program.
