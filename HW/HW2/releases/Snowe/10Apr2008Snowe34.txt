  U.S. Senators Olympia J.

The funds will be used to assist newly-released prisoners re-enter their communities through job training programs, mentoring, and other transitional services. 
   "The tendency for released inmates to relapse back into crime is a detriment to our correctional institutions and a danger to our communities," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The funds given to the Maine Department of Corrections will help counteract this adverse trend. Supporting prisoners through job training services and counseling will strengthen Maine's ability to truly rehabilitate its criminals so that upon re-entry to society, they can become gainfully employed and reclaim their future."
