SEN. SNOWE CONTINUES COMMITMENT TO SAVING GEORGIA-PACIFIC MILL IN OLD TOWN
  As part of her ongoing efforts to save the Georgia-Pacific's (GP) Old Town mill, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today spoke with senior Georgia-Pacific's officials, urging them to reach a deal to sell the mill to a party that will keep it operational.  
   "While the permanent closure of the GP mill would be a major blow to Old Town and the surrounding communities," said Snowe, "I am pleased that negotiations are continuing and I will do everything I can to ensure that these jobs are not lost. I am doing everything in my power to keep the possibility of saving the mill alive, working side by side with Governor Baldacci. I had a constructive conversation with senior Georgia-Pacific officials today, because it is essential that we see this deal through for those affected workers, their families, and Maine." 
   GP officials plan to meet on Wednesday of this week to discuss details of the sale of the mill to a particular buyer. State officials are optimistic that concerns on both sides can be resolved, and they are working to bring all parties together on Wednesday of this week to discuss resolving outstanding issues. 
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. announced on March 15, 2006 that it will be shutting down its Old Town Pulp and Paper mill that employs 400 people, leaving the mill maintained for a period of 60 days under the WARN Act, making May 15, 2006 the deadline for a sale before the mill is shut down.
