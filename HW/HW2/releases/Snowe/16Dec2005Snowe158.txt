SEN. SNOWE PARTICPATES IN MARKUP OF MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT REAUTHORIZATION
  Senate Fisheries and the Coast Guard Subcommittee Chair Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today participated in a full Commerce Committee markup of the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which she has co-sponsored. The Magnuson -Stevens Act (MSA), originally enacted in 1976, was most recently amended through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) of 1996, and establishes a national framework for conserving and managing marine fisheries within a 200-mile wide zone contiguous to the United States through eight Regional Fishery Management Councils. 
   "A thoughtful and fair reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is essential to the economies and marine environments of coastal communities in Maine and throughout the nation," said Snowe. "It has always been my strong belief that, whether we are talking about a 300 year-old fishing village in Downeast Maine, or remote fishing outposts in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, we must always be bound by a commitment to sustain both fish and fishermen. I am confident that the bill the Commerce Committee has marked up today accomplishes these goals."  
   In 2005, Senator Snowe conducted a series of Listening Sessions in Maine on reauthorization of the MSA in order to hear Maine's fishermen and other interest groups' concerns. Snowe successfully added to the bill several provisions critical to Maine and New England in the markup today. These provisions, which were not in the original bill, allow New England to use a range of fisheries management tools to satisfy total allowable catch rules and ensure that, at the end of any quota development process in New England, two-thirds of eligible fishermen would be required to approve the plan before it could be implemented. 
   Snowe also included language directing managers to consider steaming time, or the time it takes fishermen from different states to transit to distant fishing grounds, in their management plans, so that fishermen may not lose their fishing days-at-sea simply to transit. Another provision allows for a waiver of the U.S. processing requirement for fisheries that can show historic practice of processing in other countries that have comparable food safety standards, which would allow Maine herring fishermen to continue using Canadian processors. To help new domestic processors get off the ground in places like Maine where a processing void exists for some fisheries, Snowe included a provision that directs the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Small Business Administration and other federal assistance agencies to facilitate U.S. investment in processing. 
   "We must establish a common framework that achieves the goals of sustaining fish and the fishing industry while still providing our Regional Councils with the flexibility and tools they need to address their unique local challenges," said Snowe. "Our fisheries law must also accommodate scientific uncertainty, recognize that fisheries ecosystems are highly complex, and ensure that our management system can adapt to ever-changing marine environments. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to preserving the marine resources of our coastal communities." 
   The MSA reauthorization bill retains key provisions of the SFA, while making adjustments to the legislation designed to improve national compliance with the Act. The bill, which reauthorizes the MSA from Fiscal Year 2006 through Fiscal Year 2012, also contains provisions that would help improve international fishery management and conservation compliance, with an emphasis on strengthening controls on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. 
   Several provisions impacting Maine were previously included in the MSA reauthorization bill at Senator Snowe's request: 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service must make clearer rules for streamlining the criteria and approval of Experimental Fishing Permits (EFPs). In an effort to find new fishing opportunities and test out new fishing gear, New England groundfishermen have been applying for EFPs. However, NMFS has been unable to approve most of these requests under their current management system, because of procedural and administrative technicalities. The bill directs managers to utilize economic and social data and assessment methods based on the best information available, analyze the cumulative impacts of management measures, and explore possible mitigation measures for minimizing the impacts of management plans, all of which are critical for ensuring management accountability to fishing communities. 
   Authorize a cooperative research study of herring in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem to help answer questions about stock size and distribution, which are necessary to effectively manage herring and other fisheries that depend upon herring. 
   Address state fishing on stressed groundfish stocks, like cod. Right now, certain state-licensed fishermen in New England are harvesting cod, one of the most depleted species in the federally-managed groundfish complex. This language would require NMFS to determine if this state fishing is inconsistent with the Federal plan, and if so, to take action to correct it. 
   Other highlights of the underlying bill include: 
   Preserves and Strengthens the Regional Fishery Management Councils 
   * Establishes a Council training program open to both new and existing Council members designed to prepare members for complying with legal, scientific, economic, and conflict of interest requirements applicable to the fishery management process. 
   * Strengthens and clarifies the MSA's conflict of interest and recusal requirements. 
   * Ensures that Council members disclose any financial arrangements with any other individuals who may have a financial interest in activity over which the Council has jurisdiction, as well as disclose any other sources of compensation the Council member may receive. 
   Mandates the Use of Allowable Catch Levels to Prevent Overfishing and Preserve Sustainable Harvest 
   * Mandates that every fishery management plan contain an annual catch limit set at or below the optimum yield of the fishery, based on the best available scientific information. 
   * Directs the Councils to consult with the Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSCs), or other appropriate scientific body, in setting catch limits. 
   * Requires that harvests in excess of the annual catch limit be deducted from the limit for the following year 
   Establishes National Guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs 
   * Establishes national guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) for the harvesting of fish. The LAPPs include Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs), and are expanded to allow for allocation of harvesting privileges to fishing communities or regional fishery associations. 
   * Only fisheries that have been operating under a limited access program for at least a year would be eligible for consideration for a LAPP. All LAPPs would be developed by the Councils and be subject to review by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). 
   * Does not provide for the establishment of a separate Processor Quota, but processors would be eligible to hold LAPPs to harvest fish, pursuant to current law, and any decision to allocate privileges to processors would be made in the Council's normal allocation decision making process. 
   * Provides for a five-year administrative review of each program's compliance with the goals of the program and the MSA. 
   Improves the Uniformity of Decision Making for Fishery Management Plans and Aligns them with the NEPA Process 
   * Authorizes the establishment of a Coordinating Committee comprised of Council Chairs, Vice Chairs, and Executive Directors as a forum to discuss issues relevant to all Councils. 
   * Directs the Secretary, with public participation and in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Regional Fishery Management Council, to develop one, uniform fishery management-specific environmental review process that conforms National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, analysis, and public input schedules to the timelines appropriate for fishery management decisions under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The intent is to establish one consistent, timely, and predictable regulatory process for fishery management decisions.
