SEN. SNOWE WORKS TO KEEP INTERNATIONAL PAPER JOBS IN MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today spoke with International Paper President Rob Amen about the company's plans to sell its paper mills in Bucksport and Jay.  
   "I discussed with Mr. Amen the excellence of the workforces at the facilities in Jay and Bucksport, and how essential these mills are to the surrounding communities," said Snowe. "I will continue to work with International Paper to preserve these mills that are so vital to Maine and its economy." 
   The Bucksport mill was started in 1930 and employs over 1050 people operating four paper machines. The Androscoggin mill in Jay was started in 1965 and employs over 1200 people operating five paper machines.
