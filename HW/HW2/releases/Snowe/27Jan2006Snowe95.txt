SEN. SNOWE DEMANDS ROLE FOR CONGRESS, STATES IN ANY NATIONAL GUARD RESTRUCTURING
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today joined as an original cosponsor of a bipartisan Senate Resolution calling on the Pentagon to consult with lawmakers at the state and federal levels regarding any plans to cut National Guard troop levels. The resolution also calls on the Pentagon to fully fund National Guard equipment and replace gear damaged or destroyed during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  
   "This Senate Resolution sends a clear message to the Pentagon: there is too much at stake at the state and local levels not to consult with legislators and governors when formulating any change in National Guard force structure," said Snowe. "I hope Pentagon officials take this message to heart, and I look forward to working with them to keep the National Guard strong and ready. The Guard simply must have the personnel and equipment it needs to respond to disasters and crises at home and abroad." 
   On February 6, the Bush Administration sends its Fiscal Year 2007 budget request and an accompanying Quadrennial Defense Review to Capitol Hill. In its budget request, the Army is expected to ask for enough money to pay for only 333,000 Guard troops, 17,000 below the end-strength level authorized by Congress. The Air Force also is expected to trim thousands from its Guard force as part of a wider effort to cut its payrolls.
