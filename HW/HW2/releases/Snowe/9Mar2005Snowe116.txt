SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $250,000 IN CONSERVATION FUNDING FROM NPS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced $250,000 in funding from the National Park Service (NPS). $200,000 has been awarded to the State of Maine, Bureau of Parks and Lands and $50,000 has been awarded to the Town of Fairfield.  
   "Funding for community development projects such as these is of paramount importance in keeping Maine towns and cities modern and constantly improving," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "The National Park Service has been instrumental in many similar projects around the state and we commend its work and the positive impact it has had." 
   The grants were awarded under the Land and Water Conservation Fund program of the National Park Service. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Program is a partnership program that provides matching funds to states and local communities for acquisition, development, and conservation of parks and open space. The program is administered by NPS in partnership with state governments. 
   The grant awarded to the State of Maine, Bureau of Parks and Lands will go toward building a Two Lights State Park Comfort Station. The construction will include a comfort station, septic system, underground power line, accessible pathway, and to renovate a pre-existing vault toilet building. The fully-accessible day-use unisex comfort facilities will be part of a 41 acre State Park unit that addresses the goals of the agency relating to Outdoor Recreation and Smart Growth initiatives. 
   The grant awarded to the Town of Fairfield will help in the development of a restroom facility and an observation deck. The proposed project is on approximately six acres of property overlooking the Kennebec River. The purpose of the project is to enhance existing recreational opportunities at the park by having support facilities that meet ADA accessibility standards.
