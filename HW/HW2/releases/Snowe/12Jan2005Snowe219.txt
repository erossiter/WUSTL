SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR U.S. POSTAL SERVICE DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN SCARBOROUGH
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today announced funding for the site acquisition, design, and construction of a 428,951 square-foot U.S. Postal Service processing and distribution center for Southern Maine in Scarborough and the renovation of the existing facility to serve as the Portland, Maine Post Office.  
   "I am pleased that this project is finally able to move forward," said Snowe. "Not only will it greatly increase the efficiency of the postal service in Southern Maine, it will also be of great benefit to the local economy." 
   This $65 million dollar project was recently approved by the Postal Service Board of Governors. The project will rank among the state's largest buildings - operating constantly, with 760 employees getting out the mail on a schedule that includes 20 different shifts. 
   Postal workers who currently sort and distribute mail from the Portland plant on Forest Avenue and postal annexes will move to staff the Scarborough center. This will keep more than 800 jobs in the State. 
   "Keeping these 800 jobs and $55 million payroll in Southern Maine is vital to promoting a healthy economy and maintaining our standard of living," said Snowe.
