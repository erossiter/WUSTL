SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $185,000 FOR PEAKS KENNY STATE PARK
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that Peaks Kenny State Park will receive a $185,000 grant from the National Park Service's Land and Water Conservation Fund.  
 The grant will allow for construction of a new comfort station and group shelter.
   "Our State Parks provide a natural wonderland for Maine's residents and her visitors," said the Senators in a joint statement. "Improvements to the park greatly benefit each person who spends time at our state's priceless assets."
   The funding provided by the National Park Service will allow the state to develop and construct a new comfort station and group shelter. This project will replace an existing day use bathhouse with a modern, unisex, fully ADA accessible comfort station. Improvements will also include a septic system, underground power system improvements, and construction of a new picnic shelter.
   The Land & Water Conservation Fund assists in the development of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities. The program is intended to create and maintain a nationwide legacy of stimulating non-federal investments in the protection and maintenance of recreation resources across the United States.
