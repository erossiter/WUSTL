SEN. SNOWE PRESSES SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION TO EXPLAIN INADEQUATE HURRICANE RESPONSE
  At a Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship hearing this morning, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) called on Small Business Administration (SBA) Chief Hector Barretto to explain the SBA's woefully inadequate response to the needs of small businesses in the Gulf region that have been devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  
   "I wish it were unnecessary to hold this second hearing to examine the Small Business Administration's management of disaster loans and the SBA's overall disaster response. Regrettably, it is clear that strong and specific measures must be taken immediately to rectify the unacceptably slow service the SBA has been providing to small business owners in desperate need of assistance - in a region that cannot afford to have its economic recovery held hostage to the plodding processes of paperwork. The recent Hurricanes are repeatedly and appropriately described as disasters of unprecedented proportions. The SBA therefore has a responsibility to provide a response of unprecedented proportion," said Snowe. 
   Snowe believes the SBA's initial disaster response plan was not comprehensive and flexible. In September, Snowe chaired a similar oversight hearing to determine how the Congress could help the SBA achieve its mission of providing immediate relief to small businesses in need of disaster loans and to improve the SBA's contracting to include more small businesses. Since that hearing, however, Snowe has been concerned that the SBA has not been able to approve a sufficient number of disaster loans to help the small business communities of the affect Gulf States recover. 
   Of the more than 225,000 loan applications received by the SBA, both from individuals and small businesses, only 38,000, or 17 percent, have been "resolved" by being denied, approved, or withdrawn. Thus, 187,000 applications remain unresolved and pending. Only 5,728 applications have been approved. As of yesterday only 10.1 percent of applications from small businesses had been resolved and only 3 percent of business applications had been approved. Of the 28,540 small businesses that have requested loans, only 840 have been approved. 
   Over the last 20 days the SBA has received about 5,400 applications per day, and has resolved only about 1,235 per day, which means that each day about 4,100 more applications have been received than settled. 
   Snowe (R-Maine), working in conjunction with the Committee's leading Democrat, Senator John Kerry (D-MA), introduced the Small Business Hurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act of 2005, S. 1807. This legislation has been passed by Unanimous Consent by the Senate, but is being blocked by the Administration. 
   "Incredibly, the SBA continues to oppose the bill I have introduced that would give the SBA broader authority and flexibility to assist small businesses devastated by these hurricanes. What the SBA fails to mention - or even recognize - is the fact that the Agency's own objections to the bill have hampered our ability to rebuild the Gulf region. As the primary Federal agency providing loans to individuals and businesses after a disaster, the Small Business Administration plays a key role in disaster response and recovery efforts. It is absolutely vital that assistance is delivered quickly and effectively," concluded Snowe. 
   Today, Snowe offered a list of short-term recommendations to the SBA, including: 
   * Hire 1,000 additional employees for the Ft. Worth processing center, including business loan officers and data entry staff to meet the current demand. 
   * Hire 450 additional Loss Verification Officers to analyze damaged homes and businesses. 
   * Streamline credit tests for disaster loan applications to make them less burdensome. 
   * Hire at least five additional full-time Procurement Center Representatives and five additional full-time Commercial Market Representatives, as well as leverage existing personnel and expertise to help small businesses with prime and subcontracting opportunities. 
   * Increase one-on-one business counseling and services to small businesses affected by a disaster. 
   * Enhance its disaster loan computer system, the Disaster Credit Management System, to make it more efficient and effective for future disasters, and expedite implementation of on-line loan applications. 
   Appearing before the Senate Small Business Committee today were Representative Bennie G. Thompson (D- Miss.), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security; Hector Barreto, head of the Small Business Administration (SBA); Major General Ronald Johnson, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Gregory Rothwell, Chief Procurement Officer at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; David Cooper, Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management at the General Accounting Office (GAO); and Walter Isaacson, Vice Chairman of the Louisiana Recovery Authority.
