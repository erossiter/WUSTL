SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS LEGISLATION TO PREVENT PRISONER ABUSE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is supporting an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill that will set uniform standards for military treatment and interrogation of enemy combatants.  
 The amendment was introduced by Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. 
   "It is absolutely vital that we pass this measure setting the standards for the interrogation and treatment of prisoners," said Snowe. "Currently, there are too many loopholes and no clear cut guidelines, and such vagueness in the law may have led to the horrendous abuses at Abu Ghraib- abuses that must not be allowed to happen again. We owe it to our courageous troops who are serving in difficult conditions overseas to make it very clear what is and is not permissible under the law." 
   This amendment would establish the Army Field Manual as the standard for interrogation of all detainees held in DOD custody. The Manual has been developed by the Executive Branch for its own uses, and a new edition, written to take into account the needs of the war on terror and with a new classified annex, is due to be issued soon. This amendment would not set the Field Manual in stone - it could be changed at any time.
