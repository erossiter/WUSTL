SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN TO BE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DIRECTOR
  Today the U.S. Senate confirmed General Michael Hayden to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by a vote of to. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, voted in favor of General Hayden's nomination. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement:  
   "Today, the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed General Hayden to serve at the helm of the CIA. His breadth and depth of knowledge will be essential to restructuring and rebuilding the CIA, restoring morale, and revitalizing our nation's human intelligence collection capability. Over the past several years after overseeing some of the nation's worst intelligence failures, the Agency lost its preeminent status in our intelligence community often ceding authority to the Department of Defense. It is my hope that General Hayden will bring strong, independent leadership working in concert with the Director of National Intelligence to reinvigorate the CIA to be our best first line of defense against a dangerous and committed enemy. 
   "Furthermore, the future success of the CIA will be dependent on General Hayden's ability to foster a strong, cooperative relationship with Congress so that we can truly exercise our oversight responsibility as a co-equal branch of government. Checks and balances do not weaken our nation, they strengthen it - and by respecting this founding principle of our Republic, we will restore Americans' confidence in those who work to protect them."
