SEN. SNOWE TO HOST FORUMS TO HELP BUSINESSES SELL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
  Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Chair Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and her staff will present seven HUBZone educational programs the week of November 29th. These forums are designed to encourage small business owners, located in HUBZones, to seek certification and utilize the Federal program.  
   "This is an opportunity for Maine small business owners, located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones to learn how they can take advantage of federal government contracts," said Snowe. "This program is designed to stimulate economic development and create jobs in urban and rural communities by providing Federal contracting preference to small businesses." 
   The purpose of the HUBZone program is to provide Federal contracting assistance to qualified small business concerns located in historically underutilized business zones to: 
   * Increase employment opportunities 
   * Stimulate capital investment in those areas 
   In Maine HUBZone areas are: Franklin, Oxford, Somerset, Piscataquis, Washington and Aroostook Counties, six Indian Reservations, and 23 specific census tract areas in 5 counties.
