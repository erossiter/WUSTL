SEN. SNOWE COSPONSORS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION EXPANDING FEDERAL FUNDING OF STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) joined Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and a bipartisan group to introduce S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act on Thursday. This legislation would expand federal support for stem cell research and lift a ban put in place by President Bush in 2001 restricting federal funding to only those stem cell lines that were already in existence. Originally passed in the Senate on July 18th of last year by a vote of 63 to 47, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act was later vetoed by President Bush.  
   "The promise of stem cell research is in its unlimited potential to treat countless devastating diseases that affect the lives of millions of Americans," Snowe said. "The American people overwhelmingly support the expansion of federal funding for stem cell research that adheres to strict ethical standards and guidelines; the Senate should again heed their call to action and pass this vital legislation. We have an opportunity and an obligation to invest in the health of future generations and ease the pain of those suffering today by expanding the resources available for ethical medical research." 
   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 30 Senators.
