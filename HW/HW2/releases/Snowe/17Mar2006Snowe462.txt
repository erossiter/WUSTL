VOTES TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today voted for an amendment by Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Senate Budget Resolution that would increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $3.318 billion up to its authorized level of $5.1 billion. The amendment passed the Senate today by a vote of 51 to 49.  
   "Today the Senate passed an amendment that would finally bring funding for the LIHEAP program up to its authorized level of $5.1 billion," said Snowe. "For too long the Congress has underfunded a program that is so essential to low income Americans. I'm pleased that we are moving toward fully funding LIHEAP so our most vulnerable citizens won't be faced with the impossible choice of paying for their food or heating their homes." 
   Snowe has long fought to increase funding for the LIHEAP program. Just last week, the Senate approved a bill by Sen. Snowe that would increase funding for the LIHEAP program by $1 billion for FY 2006. The House of Representatives is currently considering Snowe's legislation.
