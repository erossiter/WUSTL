SEN. SNOWE PRAISES BUSH ADMINISTRATION DECISION TO ENHANCE DEATH BENEFITS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe today praised a Department of Defense decision to propose a major increase in the death gratuity to families of U.S. troops killed in combat in Iraq, Afghanistan and future combat zones.  
 This decision mirrors legislation Sen. Snowe cosponsored last week, which was introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). 
   "The men and women who put their lives on the line for our country must know they have our full and unwavering support," said Snowe. "I am confident this decision is supported by the American people, who are grateful for the sacrifices our troops and their families make in defense of freedom. I applaud the work of Senators Sessions and Lieberman for leading the charge to expand death benefits for America's military personnel and their families." 
   DoD's proposal would raise the gratuity to $100,000 in government payments to families. In addition to the higher gratuity, DOD would substantially increase life insurance benefits. The current $250,000 coverage offered to all service members at a subsidized rate under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program would be raised to $400,000. For troops in a combat zone the government would pay the premiums on the extra $150,000 coverage. The higher death gratuity would be retroactive to Oct. 7, 2001, the date of the invasion of Afghanistan in response to 9/11.
