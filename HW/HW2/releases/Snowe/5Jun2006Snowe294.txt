SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN TO BE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DIRECTOR
  Today the U.S. Senate confirmed General Michael Hayden to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by a vote of 78 to15. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, voted in favor of General Hayden's nomination. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe issued the following statement:  
   "Today, the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed General Hayden to serve as the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. His breadth and depth of knowledge will be essential to restructuring and rebuilding the CIA, restoring the morale of it workforce, and revitalizing our nation's human intelligence collection capability."
   "To avoid the catastrophic national security lapses of the past, General Hayden will need to bring unprecedented, independent leadership to the CIA to reclaim the resources and missions that are so essential to its role with in the Intelligence Community. While overseeing a major internal reorganization, General Hayden must also protect the CIA's congressionally-mandated domain against any encroachment from the Department of Defense. 
   "Furthermore, the future success of the CIA depends on General Hayden's ability to foster a strong, cooperative relationship with Congress. Checks and balances do not weaken our nation, they strengthen it - and by respecting this founding principle of our nation, we will restore Americans' confidence in those who work to protect them."
