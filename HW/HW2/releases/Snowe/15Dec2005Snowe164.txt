SEN. SNOWE CONTINUES FIGHT AGAINST CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S FLAGRANT DISREGARD FOR FAIR TRADE PRACTICES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, responded to the Commerce Department's announcement today that the U.S. trade deficit has reached an all-time high:  
   "Despite overwhelming evidence that the Chinese government deliberately manipulates its currency at the expense of American manufacturing jobs, the Treasury Department has adamantly refused to take action. If we don't confront this pattern of indifference our trade deficit is unlikely to improve. That is unacceptable. 
   "Small business owners in Maine and across our nation are fighting to remain competitive with countries such as China that flagrantly disregard fair trade practices. Congress has endured enough rhetoric and enough reports that have repeatedly failed to force China to honor its international trade obligations. I urge the Treasury Department to take action immediately and get tough with China's continued currency manipulation. Without such action, American jobs and our job creation potential will remain in jeopardy." 
   In May, Senator Snowe introduced "The Fair Currency Practices Act of 2005" (S. 984), legislation to force nations to live up to their international obligations and stop undervaluing their currencies. It has three key provisions. The first would alter the criteria by which the Treasury Department is required to enter into negotiations with foreign countries that it labels as currency manipulators. The second would further clarify the working definition of manipulation under the Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1998. Finally, the Fair Currency Practices Act would instruct Treasury to undertake an extensive examination of China's trade surplus, with particular attention paid to China's suspect trade data, and report on its findings.
