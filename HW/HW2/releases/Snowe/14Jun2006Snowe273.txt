SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $50,000 IN FUNDING FROM NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced today that the National Park Service has allocated $50,000 from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to the City of Gardiner, Maine for the creation of a downtown waterfront park.  
   "Many of Maine's historic downtowns draw much of their beauty and vitality from one of our state's great rivers," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "These funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be instrumental in improving the public's ability to enjoy the splendor of the Kennebec River."
   The funding will be distributed as follows:
   * $50,000 for Gardiner Downtown Waterfront Park. The funding will be used to develop a public accessible waterfront park for passive recreation and solitude. The site will have parking, a gazebo, a boardwalk, carry-in boat access, and a picnic area overlooking the Kennebec River.
   * The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a partnership program that provides matching funds to states and local communities for acquisition, development, and conservation of parks and open space. The program is administered by NPS in partnership with state governments.
