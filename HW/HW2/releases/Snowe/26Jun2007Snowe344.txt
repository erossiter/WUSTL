SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT RULING IN WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE V. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
  Responding to this morning's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Wisconsin Right to Life, Ind. v. Federal Election Commission, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement:  
   "I am tremendously disappointed by today's Supreme Court ruling. Unlike the dissent, which would have upheld the law, the majority did a profound disservice by focusing only on the particular advertisements in question and not appropriately considering the wide-ranging and deep-seated problem that a bipartisan Congress worked years to solve with the provision addressing sham issue ads. 
   "If the Court had paid greater attention to the damaging, real-world matter of unregulated money in politics and the skewing effect it can have in generating cynicism in our citizenry, I'm convinced they would have come to a different conclusion - as Congress did in passing the measure I co-authored to clamp down on campaign ads masquerading as issue ads. The Court has regrettably taken a giant step backward by opening a significant loophole for those who wish to blur the lines between issue advocacy and campaigning in order to unduly influence our federal elections."
