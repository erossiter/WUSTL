SEN. SNOWE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE HEALTH OF OUR NATION'S AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY
  Last week, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) introduced legislation that is critical to protecting and improving the health of our nation's aquaculture industry, including shellfish, finfish, and salmon hatcheries in Maine. The National Aquatic Animal Health Act of 2007 will begin the process of creating a national infrastructure that will attract investment to our aquaculture industry, protect the valuable stocks of aquaculture farmers from disease, and create a flexible partnership between the federal government, state agencies, and industry groups that monitor seafood stocks.  
   "My home state of Maine greatly depends on and benefits from the 3,500 miles of coastline that has served as an ideal incubator for the expansion of our state's aquaculture industry," said Senator Snowe. "Last year, the total economic activity generated from the industry state-wide was over $130 million, providing more than 1,000 jobs for hard-working Mainers. In order to preserve this vital industry, it is imperative that Congress institutes health standards that will prevent widespread disease and outbreak in our aquatic animals. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will not only help safeguard and monitor against disease, but also invest in the future of our nation's aquaculture industry." 
   The National Aquatic Animal Health Act of 2007 will create a program that is modeled after similar animal monitoring programs already in place at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The program will involve a shared partnership between willing states and industry groups, overseen by APHIS and a governing body made up of representatives from federal, state, and industry groups. 
   The funding for this program, set at $15 million a year for the first two years, will include an account for possible indemnity payments to industry forced to eliminate their stocks, as well as funding for administrative, testing, and operational costs. 
   Included are key components of the legislation: 
   * Federal - state - industry partnership, all participating in a larger oversight body known as the General Advisory Council (GAC). 
   * An opt-in program, with each state making a decision about whether to participate. 
   * USDA - APHIS will be lead federal agency. 
   * The majority of the work and the expenditures will happen within sub programs that address one or more specific diseases. Terms and structure for each of the sub programs will be negotiated between the partners, as determined by the GAC. 
   * Half of the funding pool in the first two years would be dedicated for indemnity funding with industry match as appropriate for each program. Indemnity funds would be held in a non-lapsing fund to accumulate from year to year, and be available in the case of losses due to stock eradication orders. The indemnification schedule would be negotiated among the partners. 
   * As each program is established, Best Management Practices would be established and participating entities would be required to abide by them to qualify for funding. 
   * Half of the funds would be focused on veterinary services, testing costs, research, and other professional services to aid the development and operation of on-the-ground control, eradication, and certification programs as well as education and outreach programs. 
   * APHIS would determine, in consultation with states and industry, which disease programs to initiate.
