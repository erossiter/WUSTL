SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $25,000 IN E-RATE FUNDING TO IMPROVE MODERN TECHNOLOGY FOR MAINE SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICTS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that various Maine schools, libraries and Administrative Districts will share in $25,652.51 in funding discounts under the E-Rate program, which she and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) authored as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Today's announcement is part of wave four of the seventh year of E-Rate funding for schools and libraries in Maine.  
   "I am so pleased to announce this E-Rate funding because I firmly believe that access to advanced technologies is a critical necessity for students," said Snowe. "This wave of funding will allow recipient schools and libraries in Maine to stay connected to the internet as well as provide current technologies to students that otherwise might have had to go without. Since the E-Rate program began, it has helped bring exciting new technologies to more than one million classrooms and libraries nationwide. With the help of this funding, Maine schools and libraries will be able to improve their telecommunications options and better prepare students for the global job market of the 21st century." 
   The E-Rate program provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. This funding represents the discounts schools will receive for specific telecommunications services. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries. 
   The E-rate's first funding priority is for telecommunications services and Internet access, and the second funding priority is for internal connections and wiring at schools and libraries - beginning with the neediest applicants first - until the $2.1 billion fund is exhausted. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller gained the inclusion of their E-rate provision in the telecommunications reform bill by a single vote in the Senate Commerce Committee; successfully fought back an effort on the Senate floor to remove the provision from the bill; and defended the E-rate during the two and one-half year implementation process at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) while ensuring it was implemented in a manner consistent with the language of the law and intent of the authors. 
   The Maine Schools, libraries and Administrative Districts receiving an E-rate funding commitment letter for the fourth wave of funding year 2005 are: 
   * Bristol Elementary School $ 1,722.00 
   * Kents Hill School $2,885.70
