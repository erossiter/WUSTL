SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE VISA FOR LULU YEN
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins announced today that the American Institute in Taiwan granted Lulu Yen a tourist visa to return to the United States.  
 The U.S. Department of Justice refused Ms. Yen readmittance to the United States from Taiwan in January of 2004. 
   "Today, we are pleased to announce that Lulu Yen, an adopted Mainer from Taiwan, will be allowed to return to the United States. As life-long Mainers, we certainly understand the attraction that our state holds for people near and far. It is no small wonder that Lulu would want to return to enjoy the wealth of beauty that Maine offers. We are pleased that this has worked out for the best - for both Lulu and those who advocated for her return. We welcome her back and thank the American Institute in Taiwan for their help on her behalf," the Senators said. 
   Snowe and Collins have been working since January to secure a visa from the Department of Justice through the American Institute in Taiwan. 
   Yen has written newspaper columns about her experiences that have been printed by the Franklin Journal.
