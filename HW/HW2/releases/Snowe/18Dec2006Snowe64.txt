SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $1.7 MILLION IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR SANFORD
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration has awarded $1,175,000 in funding to Sanford for the Oxford Aviation project. The funding will be used to construct a state-of-the-art hangar at the Sanford Airport, which will accommodate large jets and corporate aircraft. The land will be leased to Oxford Aviation International and create approximately 200 jobs.  
   "We are pleased that the town of Sanford is receiving this significant investment that will develop and expand the facilities at Oxford Aviation and the community," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "An undertaking of this magnitude should spur a welcomed boost in economic development, job creation, and business expansion." 
   U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration investments are focused on locally-developed, regionally-based economic development initiatives that achieve the highest return on the taxpayers' investment and that directly contribute to economic growth.
