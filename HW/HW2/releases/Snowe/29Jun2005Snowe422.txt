SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $3.3 MILLION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR MAINE COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that $3,240,497 in funding has been awarded to several Maine communities from U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Project.  
   "Small community projects often make a huge difference to communities in Maine," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "That is why it is so important that federal funding is made available to rural areas that otherwise might lack funding for community enhancement projects. We applaud the recent financial allocations by the USDA and are sure that the loans and grants will be put to good use improving the quality of life of rural Mainers." 
   The funds have been allocated as follows: 
   * $500,000 loan and a $1,210,597 grant to the Caribou Utilities District to construct new wells, a water treatment pumping station, transmission main extension, and upgrade the existing water system. 
   * $800,000 loan to Jack's Jewelry of Bar Harbor. The funds will allow the 30-year old business to continue to occupy its current property. 
   * $117,000 grant to Androscoggin Valley Council of Governments to assist in educating personnel on new disposal, recycling, solid waste, safety regulations, and management opportunities and information; 
   * $104,000 grant to Northern Maine Development Commission to provide public education on universal waste. 
   * $44,600 grant to Hancock County Commission to provide technical assistance to increase recycling and composting. 
   * $67,500 to Kennebec Valley Council of Governments to provide public education to municipalities about the new laws, regulations and grant opportunities as well as implementation of a household hazardous waste program. 
   The USDA Rural Development mission provides guaranteed loans, approved loans, and approved grants. Rural Development is committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America. The loans and grants are used for community programs, which seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
