SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNOUNCEMENT OF REP. GOSS TO HEAD CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement today on President Bush's selection of Porter Goss to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency: 
   "I have known Representative Goss since he first came to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988, where I served with him for six years. He is a man of unimpeachable integrity with a probing mind and a thoughtful approach to the issues.
   "I expect that with Porter Goss's depth and breadth of experience in national security matters - most especially as Chair of the permanent House Select Committee on Intelligence, where he has led the charge in the House to determine what intelligence failures occurred leading up to the September 11th attacks - our intelligence community should be well served during this challenging and pivotal time.
   "There is no question our intelligence gathering and analysis must form a vital front-line of defense for our security here and abroad - now more than ever. The importance of the role of the next CIA Director cannot be overstated. I applaud the President for acting today at a time when our nation continues to be threatened by a determined enemy, and I look forward to hearing directly from Porter Goss when the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence convenes confirmation hearings. I also reiterate my call for timely, concrete and meaningful reform of the Intelligence Community before Congress adjourns this year."
