SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES LOUISIANA-PACIFIC ON MILL EXPANSION IN NEW LIMERICK
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today congratulated Louisiana-Pacific Building Products on their plant expansion in New Limerick, Maine. Louisiana-Pacific Building Products broke ground Wednesday on the expansion of its current facilities into an oriented strand lumber manufacturer.  
   "I would like to extend my deepest congratulations to Louisiana-Pacific and the many workers who will benefit from the oriented strand lumber expansion," said Senator Snowe. "This expansion could have been placed anywhere, and I believe Louisiana-Pacific recognized the extraordinary work ethic and innovative spirit of workers in Northern Maine when choosing New Limerick." 
   Louisiana-Pacific's current plant, which has been in New Limerick for over 20 years, has 124 employees and currently produces oriented strand board.
