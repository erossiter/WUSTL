SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS SECURE $200,000 FOR PREBLE STREET RESOURCE CENTER IN 2007 SPENDING BILL
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have secured $200,000 in funding for the Preble Street Resource Center. The funds were approved as part of the Senate fiscal year 2007 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill and will help with construction of a housing project for women. 
  "Preble Street will expand its services with the planned opening of Florence House, a comprehensive center for homeless women. Florence House will offer a safe environment for homeless women in the Portland area and help eliminate the need for women to spend nights in the shelter or on the streets," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement.
  The Senate bill includes $200,000 for this important project. Senators Snowe and Collins said they will work to ensure that the Senate spending level is adopted rather than the House figure of $100,000.
  The funding appropriated would support the expansion of the Preble Street's "Home for Good" project, which assists chronically homeless individuals to achieve permanent housing and stability. Preble Street's first "Home for Good" effort, Logan Place, provides 30 units of permanent housing apartments for chronically homeless individuals in the City of Portland. It has been open since March of 2005.
