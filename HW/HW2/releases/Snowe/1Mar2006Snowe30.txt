SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES PORTLAND OBSERVATORY DESIGNATED AS NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today announced that the National Park Service has designated the Portland Observatory as a National Historic Landmark. Fewer than 2,500 places across the U.S. bear this distinction.  
   "The Portland Observatory has played a critical role in Maine's history and in our shipping industry," said Snowe. "Before the days of technological communication, this observatory allowed ships to communicate with the shore in order to make informed decisions about loading and unloading cargo. As the only surviving example of a maritime signaling station, it has rightfully been designated a National Historic Landmark."
   The Portland Observatory is the only known surviving example of a maritime signaling station that provided for visual communication between ship and shore before the vessel reached port. With this system, merchants and the ship owners could send and receive messages so that the ship owner could redirect his vessel to another port if the cargo had been sold and decisions could be made about labor needed to unload and reload vessels. 
   A National Historic Landmark designation is an official recognition by the Federal government of a historic property's national significance. The National Park Service nominates new landmarks and provides assistance to existing landmarks through its National Historic Landmarks Program. National Historic Landmarks are places where significant historical events occurred, where prominent Americans worked or lived, that represent those ideas that shaped the nation, that provide important information about our past, or that are outstanding examples of design or construction.
