SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS STRONG NAVY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today voted for legislation introduced by Sen.  
 John Warner (R-VA) which would keep the current number of active aircraft carrier battle groups at 12 until at least 180 days after the release of the next Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Sen. Snowe cosponsored this amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief for 2005FY, which passed by a vote of 58 to 38. 
   "As our nation continues to fight the global War on Terror, now is clearly not the time to erode our critical military capabilities by diminishing the Navy's fleet size," said Snowe. "Our national security absolutely requires a strong Navy, and reducing the number of carrier groups would directly impact the Navy's ability to project power anywhere in the world." 
   The QDR is an analysis of the threats, risks and opportunities for U.S. national security which reviews U.S. defense strategy and programs, including force structure, infrastructure, readiness, intelligence, modernization and people.
