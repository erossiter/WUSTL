   "The United States Department of Labor funding will allow the Maine Community College System the opportunity to expand the efforts currently underway by Maine's North Star Alliance Initiative," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We are pleased to see continued federal support for Maine's ongoing effort to provide for future opportunities for advanced technology training and education. This is fantastic news for Maine's growing composites industry, and the entire economy of the State of Maine." 
   The grant will be used by the Maine Community College System to create the Maine Composites Technology Training Initiative.

This grant will leverage at least $1 Million in Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development (WIRED) training dollars, as well as an additional $1.7 Million from other partners, and deliver training to Maine's composites industry.
