SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS WORK TO SECURE AGRICULTURE FUNDS FOR MAINE
  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved Sens. Snowe and Collins' request for over $7 million for agricultural projects in Maine.  
   "Agriculture is an important pillar of Maine's heritage and economy. It is crucial that we support programs that help us sustain healthy agricultural industry for generations to come. We are pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has recognized the value of these programs to Maine," said the Senators in a joint statement. 
   * $3.615 million for the ARS National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center in Franklin. Funds would be used for construction of facilities at the Aquaculture Center and for aquaculture research programs. Senators Snowe and Collins explained that as the harvesting of wild fish stocks is restricted, the support of our Nation's aquaculture industry is becoming increasingly important. 
   * $236,000 for Wild Blueberry research. Grant dollars would be available for research into how Maine's blueberry farmers in the economically depressed Downeast region of Maine can maximize their crops, produce higher quality crops and minimize reliance on pesticides. 
   * $2.2 million for the USDA-ARS New England Plant, Soil, and Water Laboratory in Orono. These funds would support research related to cropping systems, efficient use of nutrients and water, and control of pathogens, insects and weeds-all of which would be of particular benefit to Maine's potato industry. These funds would also support $238,440 for expanded potato Late Blight research. 
   * $864,000 for the Wood Utilization Research Program at the University of Maine. Senators Snowe and Collins successfully secured a total of $6.5 million, $864,000 of which would be directed to the University of Maine. The goal of the project is to generate new technologies that are necessary to balance the sustainable use of our Nation's forest resources with the need to maintain a competitive, domestic forest products industry. 
   * $175,000 for Potato Variety Development Research for Maine. These funds are supported by the National Potato Council and the Maine Potato Board and would be used for critical research into new potato varieties that combine excellent quality with high yields and pest resistance. 
   * $180.148 billion for the Hatch Act and $21.742 million for the McIntire-Stennis Act - These programs make available vital dollars for research in agriculture, forest resources, fisheries and aquaculture, and rural economic development. More than 100 scientists in Maine participate in these programs, benefiting a wide range of agriculture industries. 
   * $12.5 million for Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC). These programs provide funds for economically depressed communities to implements economic growth plans. Lewiston is an example of a community that has recently benefited from EZ/EC federal funds. 
   * $2 million or organic programs. The organic food industry is the fastest expanding sector of American agriculture. These funds will support related research programs to allow this trend to continue. 
   Sens. Snowe and Collins also requested continued funding for the annual Potato Objective Yield (POY) survey, which evaluates potato crops nationwide. In addition, they will seek funding in the final version of the bill for funds to establish the Maine Rural Community Innovation Center, a project of the University of Maine Cooperative Extension and the Maine Rural Development Council. 
   The Agriculture Appropriations bill must now be considered by the full Senate.
