SEN. SNOWE REACTS TO BRUTAL SLAYING OF AMERICAN CITIZEN IN SAUDI ARABIA BY AL QAEDA
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement today on the reported beheading of an American civilian - Paul Johnson - allegedly at the hands of Al Qaeda: 
   "The brutal slaying of Paul Johnson further demonstrates al Qaeda's flagrant and willful disregard of human life. I am horrified by these brutal acts of cowardice by terrorists who hide behind masks. This heinous murder should serve as a reminder to us all that we must persevere in our fight to remove the threat of terrorism from the face of the earth.
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to the Johnson family, who must endure this terrible tragedy."
