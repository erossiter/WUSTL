SEN. SNOWE CONTINUES TO MONITOR PROPANE SHORTAGE
  Maine residents and businesses facing shortages of propane received welcome news on Monday, March 5, as the state's propane industry announced further shipments into the state including those delayed by a rail strike in Canada.  
   According to Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) who has been conferring today with the Canadian Embassy, the Governor's Office and Maine Emergency Management Agency, "the additional shipments certainly will help to ease potential shortages throughout the state, but we won't be completely out of the woods until the supply of propane is fully resumed." 
   The growing shortage of propane has been compounded by bad weather and an on-going rail strike by Canadian National Railway which transports more than half of Maine's propane into the state. Last week, Senator Snowe first talked directly with the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson about the urgent need to resolve the labor dispute which has hampered rail shipments of the energy source used in everything from home heating, to industrial use. "I found the Ambassador to be completely understanding of the seriousness of our situation and the urgent need to find a solution to get rail shipments moving once again into Maine from Canada," said Senator Snowe. 
   Those talks continued through the weekend and today, Senator Snowe was informed that up to 75 cars of propane were expected to arrive into two separate Maine facilities through February 26. Although those shipments will help ease the current shortage, Maine's propane industry will continue to be selective about deliveries, giving priority to homes, hospitals, health care facilities and other critical buildings. 
   "Today's announcement of additional shipments is certainly welcome, but I join the Governor in urging residents and businesses using propane to conserve energy over the next few weeks until this crisis is fully resolved." said Senator Snowe.
