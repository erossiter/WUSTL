SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $2 MILLION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development program has awarded $1,925,052 in funding to Coastal Enterprises, Inc., the town of Searsport, and Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation.  
   "Targeted funding of rural development funds is incredibly useful for small towns in Maine because it allows them to undertake necessary projects that they might otherwise have been unable to fund," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "This recent wave of grants and loans allocated by the USDA will support programs that contribute to the health and economic well-being of Mainers." 
   The funds have been allocated as follows: 
   $1,178,252 in loans to Coastal Enterprises, Inc. for a Rural Intermediary Re-Lending Program and to provide low-interest loans to public and non-profit organizations 
   $175,00 loan and a $175,000 grant to the town of Searsport to make improvements on waste and water facilities 
   $396,800 Rural Business Enterprise Grant to Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation 
   The USDA Rural Development mission provides guaranteed loans, approved loans, and approved grants. Rural Development is committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America. The loans and grants are used for community programs, which seek to construct or improve community facilities for health care, public safety, and public services.
