SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $27,000 FOR PROP'S FOSTER GRANDPARENT PROGRAM IN CUMBERLAND, YORK COUNTIES
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Corporation for National and Community Service has approved a $27,000 grant to the People's Regional Opportunity Program (PROP) for its Foster Grandparent Program in Cumberland and York Counties.  
   "PROP has done a great job through its Foster Grandparent Program of matching seniors in the community with children who could really benefit from a mentor, a positive role model, and a guiding hand," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "This program fills a void for students in Cumberland and York Counties who need extra help with tutoring or who have a learning disability, and may not otherwise be able to access these important support services." 
   PROP's Foster Grandparent Program offers diverse opportunities for seniors, 60 and over, to volunteer with children and families with special and exceptional needs. The program provides support to children at more than fifty locations, including child development centers and Head Start programs, public school classrooms, long-term residential programs and Maine Medical Center and homes with children with special needs. 
   The People's Regional Opportunity Program will assign foster grandparents to mentor and tutor children in foster care in a fast growing area outside Portland that is comprised of 5 towns and the MSAD 57 school district. Due to the low cost of housing and available land and the resulting population increase, this school district's population of enrolled school children who are in foster care has grown from one child a few years ago to 60 children. The volunteers will mentor and tutor 25 children K-12 who live in this rapidly growing area over the course of the school year.
