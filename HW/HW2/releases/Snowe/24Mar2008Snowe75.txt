SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON REAL ID DECISION
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) expressed disappointment today regarding the Department of Homeland Security's decision to reject Maine's request for a REAL ID implementation waiver. 
   "At a time when the state of Maine is addressing a significant budget shortfall, this is the wrong time to impose a federal mandate that will adversely impact Maine's ability to achieve financial solvency," Senator Snowe said. "At a time when the economy is slowing, job growth is declining, and unemployment is rising, it is irresponsible to impose additional financial burdens on our state. I intend to appeal to DHS Secretary Chertoff in hopes that he will reconsider today's determination to deny Maine a REAL ID implementation waiver."
