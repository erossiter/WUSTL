SEN. SNOWE AMENDMENT TO BOLSTER STATE'S SHARE OF HOUSING PROGRAM FUNDING PASSES SENATE
  An amendment introduced by U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was accepted as a part of the housing stimulus legislation passed today by the Senate. Her amendment would provide small states like Maine with an increased share of the additional Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program funding authorized in the housing stimulus legislation. MRBs are tax-exempt bonds that help fund below-market-interest-rate mortgages for first-time qualifying homebuyers. The allocation and distribution of MRBs are based on population - meaning larger populous areas receive a greater percentage of MRB funding. The program does have a small state funding block to ensure smaller states receive access to the MRBs. 
   The Senate's housing stimulus legislation provides an additional $10 billion in MRB's for first-time homebuyers and at-risk borrowers. This package is allocated only based on state populations. The accepted Snowe amendment provides an additional $930 million of MRBs in order to "true up" the amount small states would have otherwise received if there had been a $10 billion allocation with a small state minimum. Maine goes from receiving $43 million to $90 million - an increase of 110 percent.
   "Americans throughout the country have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn and the housing crisis, so our efforts to curtail these problems must be as widespread and definitive as possible," Sen. Snowe said. "For Maine, passage of this amendment would result in a 110% increase in the state's additional MRB allocation. While this amendment represents a very small portion of the bill's overall funding, its effects to states like Maine is pretty substantial."
