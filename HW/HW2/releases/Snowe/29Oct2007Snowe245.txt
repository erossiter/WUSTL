SEN. SNOWE EMPHASIZES IMPORTANCE OF TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE REAUTHORIZATION TO PRESIDENT BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
  During a closed-door meeting of the Senate Committee on Finance this morning, U.S. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) emphasized to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and United States Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab the importance of reauthorizing Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). 
   "Reauthorizing TAA is of critical importance not only to my home state of Maine, but to communities across the country," Sen. Snowe said. "Workers have relied on TAA benefits to ease their transition after losing their jobs, and we must work to bring about a timely extension of this valuable program." 
   Sen. Snowe believes that TAA reauthorization should take place before any additional free trade agreements are considered by Congress. 
   This summer, Sen. Snowe joined Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus in introducing the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2007. This legislation would reauthorize and expand the TAA program to four new categories of beneficiaries: U.S. service workers and firms, fishermen, those who have lost their jobs due to trade with WTO member countries such as China and India, and communities which have suffered the loss of key industries. 
   Since 2000, America has lost approximately 3 million, or 17%, of its manufacturing jobs while Maine has lost over 21,000 jobs, representing more than 26 percent of its manufacturing workforce. 
   "Our legislation will bring parity to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program - and a more inclusive TAA will help workers transition to expanding industries," Sen. Snowe said. "Maine, among other states, has been hit hard by job losses in recent years, and workers deserve assistance in coping with losing their job through no fault of their own."
