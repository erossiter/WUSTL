SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS RESOLUTION HONORING GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) joined as an original cosponsor of a Senate Resolution designating March 25, 2006 as "Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy." Sen. Snowe cosponsored a similar resolution which commemorated last year's anniversary as well.  
   "As a Greek-American I am very conscious of Greece's many contributions to American life," said Snowe. "The resolution that I have cosponsored is an appropriate tribute to Greece and the country's role in our nation's domestic heritage as well as a celebration of the special bond between our two countries." 
   The U.S. Senate has sponsored Greek Independence Day for the last twenty years. March 25, 2006 marks the 185th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire.
