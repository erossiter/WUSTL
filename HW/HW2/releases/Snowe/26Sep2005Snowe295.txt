SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR UNIVERSITY OF MAINE'S FOGLER LIBRARY
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) has awarded the University of Maine's Fogler Library a National Leadership Grant of $249,689.  
   "The University of Maine Orono is one of our state's hallmark educational institutions," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Because the University's facilities are accessible to students and community members alike, this recent grant to enhance library services will benefit everyone in the region." 
   The University of Maine's Fogler Library, in partnership with the Department of Spatial Information Science and Engineering, will research the requirements for an open source Commons of Geographic Data (CGD) System. The CGD System will ultimately provide a means to capture and make available the rich but currently largely invisible geographic information resources generated by local nonfederal sources. The research will engage users and potential users of such information, including teachers, students, and community organizers, in identifying system requirements and developing design specifications. 
   National Leadership Grants help libraries and museums to enhance learning in families and communities, sustain cultural heritage, build the skills needed for success in the 21st century, and provide opportunities for civic participation.
