SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON HISTORIC IRAQI ELECTIONS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement on today's historic elections in Iraq to establish a democratically-elected government:  
   Today marks a defining moment for the future of Iraq and the Middle East. For the third time in less than a year, millions of Iraqis have taken another brave step forward by defying terrorists and voting for the future of their nation. Those who cast ballots today have demonstrated to the world that they desire to exercise the responsibilities of self determination. 
   With truly representative participation in today's election, the Iraqi people have found a legitimate and sovereign voice that will empower a new Iraqi government to assume responsibility for their own country over the course of 2006. 
   The success of this election also marks a significant turning point not only in bringing Iraq a step closer to self-government, but also in moving America a step closer to allowing our brave troops to come home. From supporting positions across Iraq, the U.S. military again today showed their tremendous courage and professionalism as they have over the course of this conflict.
