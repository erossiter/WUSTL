SEN. SNOWE WELCOMES EMBRY RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY TO NAVAL AIR STATION BRUNSWICK
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement today after it was announced that Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University has signed a letter of intent to establish a permanent campus location in Brunswick following the closure of NASB in 2011: 
   "The pedigree and partnerships that Embry-Riddle brings to NASB couldn't be a better reflection of what we hope this facility will become in the near future. The addition of Embry-Riddle puts in place the type of partnership that we can build NASB's redevelopment around."
   Embry-Riddle currently is engaged in providing training programs in partnership with companies such as Pratt & Whitney, Net Jet, AirTran and JetBlue.
