SEN. SNOWE VOICES SUPPORT FOR RALLIES IN LEWISTON, WASHINGTON PROTESTING VIOLENCE IN DARFUR
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today praised those participating in rallies in Maine and in Washington, D.C. to protest the ongoing violence in Darfur, Sudan. The rallies will take place at the Lewiston Multipurpose Center in Maine and on the National Mall in Washington, D.C on Sunday.  
   Adam Zuckerman, a senior at Deering High School in Portland, has raised $6,000 to bring a busload of Reform Jews and Sudanese immigrants from Maine to the rally in Washington, D.C. The 'Stop Genocide' rallies are planned in 18 cities across the nation. 
   "The current situation in Darfur is a crisis of immense magnitude and horrific proportions," said Snowe. "It can no longer be ignored by the world community at large. I commend those in Maine and throughout the nation who are rallying to protest the violence in Darfur and appreciate their commitment and desire to speak out on this critical issue." 
   "Speaking out for those with no voice is a moral imperative. I would like to specifically thank Adam Zuckerman for his hard work, dedication and vision in bringing people together to denounce the atrocities taking place in Darfur; he is truly a leader for humanitarian rights. To all of those who are participating in the rallies, I wish you much success as you proceed on behalf of the people of Darfur," continued Snowe. 
   The rally in Washington, D.C. was organized by the Save Darfur Coalition, which is an alliance of over 100 faith-based, humanitarian and human rights organizations whose mission is to raise public awareness and to mobilize an effective unified response. 
   Humanitarian agencies have reported that the Darfur crisis is the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world today. Some estimate that as many as 400,000 lives have been lost and over 2 million people have been displaced in Darfur and neighboring Chad.
