SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON RETIREMENT OF REP. THOMAS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today issued the following statement on House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas' (CA-22) announcement that he will retire at the end of the 109th Congress. Sen. Snowe and Rep. Thomas served together in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1978 to 1994: 
   "Bill and I both began serving in the House in 1978, and I have had the pleasure of knowing him as a friend and colleague ever since. Chairman Thomas' intelligence and amazing depth of knowledge in tax and budget issues have made him an invaluable asset to his fellow members of Congress and his committee. Congress - and the people of California's 22nd District - will remember his leadership and I wish him continued success in the years to come."
