FEMA PROVIDES MORE THAN $1.1 MILLION TO ASSIST KENNEBUNK NEIGHBORHOOD
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided a $1,127,906 grant to the Town of Kennebunk. The funds have been made available from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) as a result of the Patriot's Day storm that caused extensive damage to much of New England. 
   The funding will enable the community to assist residents in flood prone areas by purchase and demolishing three properties and elevating several others in hopes of limiting the potential of flooding. The homes are located in areas along the Mousam River that have experienced flooding several times in recent years. 
   "It's hard to imagine what it's like to have your home threatened by a natural disaster, but I want all Mainers to know that they will never have to face that threat alone," said Senator Snowe. "Even when the worse-case scenario unfolds, our communities will have every resource available to recover and rebuild from the effects of these devastating floods."
   "The residents of Kennebunk have been resilient in rebuilding after previous floods," said FEMA Regional Administrator Art Cleaves. "These funds will help mitigate damages from future floods and help these citizens have a safer and more secure future."
   The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program provides grants to States and local governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major disaster declaration. The purpose of the HMGP is to reduce the loss of life and property due to natural disasters and to enable mitigation measures to be implemented during the immediate recovery from a disaster.
