SEN. SNOWE JOINS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO PRESERVE AND IMPROVE RURAL AIR SERVICE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today joined Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Ben Nelson (D-NE) in introducing bipartisan legislation that would preserve and expand rural air service. The Rural Aviation Improvement Act of 2007 would enhance vital components of the Essential Air Service program to increase access to commercial air service for passengers in rural parts of the country, like Maine. 
   "A robust transportation network is critical to the economies of rural states like Maine and it is imperative that Congress works to bridge the transportation gap by improving access to commercial air service for these areas," said Senator Snowe. "This legislation is a vital component of that goal and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure that the Essential Air Service program is not only retained, but better developed so that our state has the same economic development opportunities that other urban areas already do."  
   As a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees our nation's air service, Senator Snowe has been a staunch supporter of the Essential Air Service Program and has worked diligently to increase rural air service to guarantee that Maine is connected to the nation's transportation network. Maine currently has four EAS airports: Augusta State Airport, Hancock County - Bar Harbor Airport, Knox County Airport in Rockland and Northern Maine Regional Airport in Presque Isle. 
   Key provisions of the bill include: 
   * Repealing a provision put in place by the 2002 FAA Reauthorization requiring a community to pay a portion of the cost (up to 20%) to keep its limited commercial air service. Annual Congressional action has prevented this provision from being enacted with an amendment to the Transportation-Housing Appropriations bill. 
   * Modifying an existing provision that caps the EAS subsidy at $200 per passenger for communities within 210 miles of a medium or large hub airport. The cap was set in 2000 and has never been adjusted for inflation or increases in airline costs. The bill includes an annual increase in the cost cap to reflect inflation. 
   * Allowing a community or state where the subsidy has exceeded the per passenger cost cap in Section 3 to pay the difference in the per passenger cost and thus retain its essential air service. Under current law, a community's commercial service is terminated if the statutory cap is exceeded. 
   * Allowing a community or state to pay the difference in cost for a individually determined 'preferred level' of commercial air service above the minimum level provided for by EAS or to pay the difference in cost of a preferred air carrier above the low-cost bidder. 
   * Requiring the Department of Transportation to calculate distances to the nearest hub airport (see Section 3 for the importance of such mileage) by using the most commonly used route instead of the shortest route available. 
   * Establishing an Office of Rural Aviation within the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. The office will be changed with the development of a uniform 4-year contract for EAS (the current contract length is 2 years), develop a uniform set of metrics and a mechanism to fairly compare applications from all air carriers bidding to provide essential air service to communities, and to select air carriers from among air carriers applying to provide essential air service. 
   * Extending through 2011 the authority to make grants to communities under the Small Community Air Service Development Program. 
   * Including incentives for airlines to participate and stay in the EAS program by requiring subsidy payments to be adjusted to reflect changes in operating cost, such as the cost of fuel. 
   * Requiring FAA to include passenger boardings on charter flights departing from EAS communities to be included in total the passenger boardings used to calculate an airport's annual apportionment for the Airport Improvement Program, which is currently delineated by a 10,000 enplanement threshold. If you are below that threshold, you are eligible for $150,000. If above, $1 million. Currently, charter enplanements are not counted as part of the 10,000 enplanement threshold which determines this apportionment. 
   * Retaining the mandatory $50 million annual appropriation from the overflight fund. Re-establishes a mandatory additional $50 million annual appropriation from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Raises the total annual authorized funding to $133 million from the current $127 million to assure a more secure source of federal funding for all eligible EAS communities and any new communities.
