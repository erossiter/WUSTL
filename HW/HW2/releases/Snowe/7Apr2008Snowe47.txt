SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RURAL HOUSING PROGRAMS
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) today led a bi-partisan coalition requesting additional funds for USDA Rural Development housing programs that experienced significant cuts or were removed from the Administration's Fiscal Year 2009 budget proposal. Along with 22 of their Senate colleagues, Senators Snowe and Schumer sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies imploring the inclusion of many crucial rural housing initiatives. 
   "In many rural communities throughout Maine and the nation, the housing crisis has left our most vulnerable citizens out in the cold," Senator Snowe said. "Cutting these crucial programs would be devastating for the many families and seniors who depend on rural housing assistance. I encourage my colleagues to re-examine these funding cuts and shortages and pledge their support for the hard-working people of rural America."
   The coalition is requesting funding for the following USDA Rural Development housing programs:
   * Section 515 Rural Rental Housing- Section 515 provides affordable housing to low-income families and senior citizens living in rural areas. Congress established the 515 Program in 1962 to provide for the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, and operation of rental or cooperative housing for low and moderate income residents of rural areas. The coalition requests a funding level of $150 million for Section 515.
   * Section 502 Direct Loan Program- Section 502 provides affordable credit to the nation's poorest rural families to obtain home ownership. These funds can be used to build, repair, or renovate a home and are available to households with low to very-low incomes. Section 502 has been cut from the Administration's budget and is requested to be restored with $1.5 billion in funding.
   * USDA Self Help Housing- This USDA Rural Development program is aimed at helping low-income families construct their own houses and increasing minority home ownership. The letter requests funds of $60 million in order to renew grants that expired in FY08 and FY 09.
   * Rural Community Development Initiative- This program assists intermediary organizations develop their abilities to undertake housing, community facilities, and community development and economic projects in rural areas. This program was cut from the budget and needs $10 million in funds to effectively fun this program.
