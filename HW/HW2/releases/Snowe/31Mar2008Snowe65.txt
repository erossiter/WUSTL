SEN. SNOWE SEEKS SOLUTION TO REAL ID WAIVER ISSUE
  As today's deadline for states to request a waiver delaying implementation of REAL ID approaches, U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) has been working diligently with state officials and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that Maine driver's licenses will continue to be accepted by DHS following their planned May 11th implementation of the REAL ID program. 
   "Throughout the weekend and this morning, I have been working with Governor Baldacci and DHS on a resolution to the outstanding issues between the state's request that Maine's driver's licenses continue to be honored for federal purposes, and DHS' criteria for delaying implementation of REAL ID," Senator Snowe said.
   This morning, Senator Snowe discussed the situation with Governor Baldacci and has been working with DHS officials on a mutually acceptable solution to the outstanding issues.
   Senator Snowe added, "What's most important is that Maine's request be given the same consideration as those of other states which have expressed opposition to REAL ID but have been granted an extension - so that Mainers are not unfairly burdened beginning in May."
