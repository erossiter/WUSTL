SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR INCREASED YOUTHBUILD FUNDING
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) has asked the Senate appropriations committee to support $90 million in funding for the Youthbuild program in the Fiscal Year 2007 appropriations bill. 
   "I met recently with YouthBuild participants from Maine and was impressed by their maturity and their obvious dedication to the program. Congress absolutely must ensure that the program has adequate funding to continue its impressive tradition of education and service," said Snowe.  
   Since its founding in 1990, YouthBuild USA has guided the development of an expanding national network of more than 225 local YouthBuild programs. YouthBuild USA orchestrates advocacy for public funding; guidance and quality assurance in program implementation; leadership opportunities for youth and staff; research to understand best practices; and grants and loans to YouthBuild affiliates. YouthBuild USA also contributes to the broader youth and community development fields in order to diminish poverty in the United States and internationally.

   Senate Appropriations Committee 
   Dear Chairmen Bond and Specter and Ranking Members Murray and Harkin: 
   We are writing to urge you to ensure that YouthBuild does not fall through the cracks this year. Bipartisan legislation moving YouthBuild from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the Department of Labor (DOL) that is supported by the Administration is being introduced in Congress but has not yet become law. Thus, it is critical that funding is set aside in both HUD and DOL to cover YouthBuild's funding needs. As you know, the funding could be redistributed after it is clear which department will house the YouthBuild program. 
   For the past five years, a majority of the Senate has called for an increase to $90 million for HUD's Youthbuild program. We are again requesting $90 million for this important program, whether it remains in HUD or whether legislation is passed prior to the completion of the appropriations process to authorize it in DOL. 
   The President's Budget includes $50 million for YouthBuild in DOL. Unfortunately, this level of funding does not sustain the investments already made and will result in progressive closing of local YouthBuild programs even as young men and women are lining up at their doors. 
   YouthBuild has demonstrated outstanding ability to bring the most disadvantaged urban and rural youth, who have dropped out of high school or been adjudicated, into productive employment, higher education, and civic engagement It has contributed significantly to local communities: since YouthBuild's inception 60,000 youth have built over 15,000 units of affordable housing. The $600 million that has been appropriated through HUD since 1993 has leveraged over $1.5 billion of additional public and private investment at the local level due to the resourcefulness of local leaders and the high demand for YouthBuild programs. Over 1,000 local organizations have applied for HUD funds to bring YouthBuild to their communities. 
   YouthBuild has earned strong bipartisan support due to its great success in local communities. As you know, YouthBuild is a uniquely comprehensive full-time non-residential community-based program that offers at-risk youth an immediately productive role rebuilding their communities. Students spend half their time attending basic education classes and half their time receiving job skills training in the construction field. They also receive personal counseling from respected mentors, work in a supportive peer group with positive values, help build assets through the YouthBuild National Individual Development Account program, a savings program for students and graduates. At the same time, these young people address the need for affordable housing by building houses for homeless and low-income people while earning their GED or high school diploma. 
   Today there are over 226 YouthBuild programs in 43 states engaging 8,000 young adults, and the number of programs could easily be expanded. Last year alone, 260 communities were denied YouthBuild funding. The demand is equally great from young people-in 2003 local programs turned away over 10,000 applicants solely for lack of funds, and in 2004 they turned away 12,000. The 20% cut suffered for FY'06 could cause the closing of 25 local programs; if the funds are restored and expanded, some of these closings can be averted. 
   We call for an increase even in times of fiscal austerity because expanding YouthBuild will help address critical national problems that cost society dearly. Over 32% of America's youth are dropping out of high school with no prospect of becoming gainfully employed contributing members of society -tax-payers and in inner-city communities, that percentage rises toward 50. States are spending $36,000/year/person to house 365,000 16 to 24 year olds, 65% of whom have dropped out of high school. In addition, the construction industry is short 80,000 workers. Furthermore, in the aftermath of Katrina, the need for construction workers is increasing, and YouthBuild programs are a resource in the Gulf, sending trained crews to Mississippi to rebuild homes as part of their service to the nation. 
   YouthBuild is also on the cutting edge of education reform for drop-outs and effective re-entry for offenders. Forty YouthBuild programs have now been chartered by their states or authorized by their superintendent of schools to provide high school diplomas and to receive public funds as successful public schools reclaiming high school drop-outs. In several states, the criminal justice departments are now supplementing HUD funds to expand capacity of YouthBuild programs as successful re-entry programs for ex-offenders. To maximize the investment already made in YouthBuild as a resource for education of drop-outs and re-entry of ex-offenders, it is imperative to keep the foundation of its federal funding strong. 
   Research on 900 YouthBuild graduates, several years after they had completed the program, showed that more than 75% of them were either employed at an average wage of $10/hour or attending college and were positively contributing to their communities. Of those who had committed felonies, the recidivism rate was a strikingly low 15% and all studies to date have shown a recidivism rate below 20%, strikingly lower than the 60% recidivism rate for most prison systems. 
   We respectfully request that you provide $90 million to support and expand the YouthBuild program for FY'07.
