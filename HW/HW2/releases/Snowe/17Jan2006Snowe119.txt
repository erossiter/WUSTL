  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) issued the following statement upon the passing of Passamaquoddy Tribal Governor Melvin Francis: 
   "The loss of Melvin Francis was tragic and unexpected, and his leadership will be missed not only by the Passamaquoddy nation at Pleasant Point, but across the State of Maine.
