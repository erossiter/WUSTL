SEN. SNOWE RECEIVES CHAMPION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AWARD
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe received a 'Champion of Affordable Housing' award from the Maine State Housing Authority for her commitment to affordable housing programs.  
   "I would like to thank the Maine State Housing Authority for presenting me with this award," said Snowe. "Housing issues have been among my highest priorities throughout my tenure in Congress and I would like to stress that I will not waver in my long-standing commitment to ensuring that the neediest Mainers have access to homes and shelter. Affordable housing is scarce in Maine, and that is why I have supported numerous efforts to address the housing needs of middle and low-income families, with a special focus on our vulnerable population of elderly, the homeless and the disabled residents.".
