SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS WELCOME FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO WORKERS OF NATIONAL STARCH & CHEMICAL COMPANY IN ISLAND FALLS
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins released the following statement today after the U.S. Department of Labor approved the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition filed on behalf of 23 workers at National Starch and Chemical Company in Island Falls, Maine, who were displaced as a result of a significant drop in demand of its products due to competition with foreign countries. 
   "This crucial assistance from the federal government will ensure that the hardworking employees at National Starch & Chemical Company, who recently lost their jobs through no fault of their own, will get the necessary resources they need to get through this difficult time," noted Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "In receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance, these fine workers and their families will be one step closer to rebuilding their livelihoods, although much more remains to be done to help them fully recover."
   The purpose of the TAA program is to aid workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages decrease as a result of increased imports. Now that the TAA petition is approved, displaced National Starch & Chemical Company workers will be eligible for employment training in another job or career, income support, job search allowance, and relocation services for individuals who obtain jobs outside of their normal commuting area.
   In a joint letter sent following the layoff announcement, Senators Snowe and Collins urged U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to expedite the review of the TAA application to ensure that the workers receive the assistance they need to get back on their feet and to help reduce the negative effects this layoff will have on their financial stability.
