SEN. SNOWE RECEIVES DISTINGUISHED COMMUNITY HEALTH CHAMPION AWARD
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe received a '2006 Distinguished Community Health Champion' award from the National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc. for her leadership and dedication to community health centers and for enhancing access to quality health care for America's uninsured and medically underserved.  
   "I would like to thank the National Association of Community Health Centers for giving me this prestigious award," said Snowe. "I have long been a proponent of community health centers as they are often the only source of health care in our rural and medically underserved areas. Community health centers are also cost-effective since they tend to reduce their patient's needs for emergency, hospital, and specialty care. I applaud the essential work undertaken by NACHC and pledge to continue to work closely to them in order to ensure that Americans continue to have access to quality health services." 
   Founded in 1970, the National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc. (NACHC) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to enhance and expand access to quality, community-responsive health care for America's medically underserved and uninsured. In serving its mission, NACHC represents the nation's network of over 1,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which serve 15 million people through 5,000 sites located in all of the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
