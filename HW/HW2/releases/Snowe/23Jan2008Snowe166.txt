  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced today that the Northern Maine Medical Center has been awarded $1,000,000 of loan funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program. Specifically, the hospital will receive a loan of $600,000 and a conditional commitment for a guaranteed loan of $400,000. The funding will be used to construct a 10-bed addition to the Forest Hill Manor in Fort Kent. 
   "Assisted care will be increasingly needed as our population ages," noted Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We must ensure that our health care system is well-prepared and equipped to meet the needs of Maine's seniors. Our state's seniors have given so much, and we owe it to them to provide quality care that is affordable and accessible"
