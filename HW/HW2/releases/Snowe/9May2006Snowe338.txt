SEN. SNOWE MOURNS DEATH OF MAINE NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today expressed her deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Staff Sergeant Dale James Kelly Jr. of Richmond, Maine and Staff Sergeant David Michael Veverka, a student from the University of Maine, Orono whose hometown is Jamestown, Pennsylvania. The two members of B Company, 3-172 Infantry Battalion, Maine Army National Guard were killed in an attack in Iraq on May 6, 2006.  
   "My thoughts and prayers are with both of these grieving families, and I will assist them in any way I can," said Snowe. "Their sons gave everything they had for their country, and for that they will forever be remembered. Our brave troops sacrifice so much day after day as they face danger overseas, and we all owe them a debt of gratitude that is impossible to repay."
