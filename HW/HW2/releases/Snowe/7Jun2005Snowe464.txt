BRAC COMMISSIONERS VISIT PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD
  Today BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi and BRAC Commissioners Lloyd W. Newton, James H. Bilbray and Philip Coyle visited Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  
 Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, New Hampshire Sens. Judd Gregg and John Sununu, Maine Reps. Tom Allen and Mike Michaud and New Hampshire Reps. Jeb Bradley and Charles Bass issued the following statement: 
   "We extend our deepest thanks to BRAC Commission Chairman Principi and Commissioners Newton, Billbray and Coyle for coming to the Shipyard with open minds, and for their willingness to see firsthand the strengths and unique value of Portsmouth. It is our hope that seeing this base, its facilities, and the world=s finest Naval shipyard workers will prove to them that there is no way to reasonably conclude that we should discard this indispensable, irreplaceable shipyard. 
   "Today marks another step in the process of laying out our arguments to the BRAC Commission. The facts are on our side - Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is the most efficient, highest-performing shipyard in the country. To recommend it for closure was a colossal mistake which the BRAC Commissioners now have an opportunity to rectify."
