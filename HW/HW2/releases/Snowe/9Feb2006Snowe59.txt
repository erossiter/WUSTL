SEN. SNOWE SEEKS TO GUARANTEE SENIORS DON'T LOSE COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today joined with her colleague Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in introducing bipartisan legislation to prevent Medicare prescription drug plans from ending coverage of drugs that were available when seniors enrolled in the plan. 
   "The way the drug benefit is set up is weighted against seniors - insurers are able to make changes in coverage throughout the year, but seniors are only allowed to change plans during the annual open enrollment period," Snowe said. "It is unreasonable to ask seniors to accept unexpected changes to their plans after they have spent so much time and effort choosing one that suits their needs. The drug benefit should work for seniors, and our bill will ensure that they have coverage for the drugs they need throughout the year."  
   Specifically, the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act would guarantee seniors that the prescription drugs covered by their plan will continue to be covered the remainder of the calendar year in which they enrolled. For example, seniors who enrolled in a plan in January would be guaranteed access to specific prescription drugs would remain consistent until the following year. Likewise, seniors who become eligible to enroll for the benefit later in the year--say in July or September--would be guaranteed that their prescription drug coverage would be the same until January. Seniors would then have the option of changing plans the next year if the company stopped covering a drug they need. 
   Under current law, prescription drug plans can change which drugs they cover as many times as they want throughout the year, so long as they give advance notice to their enrollees. However, seniors have no recourse other than going through an appeals process which may or may not result in them getting their medicines if their drug plan suddenly drops their medicines. Seniors are required to wait until the next open enrollment period which may be as much as nine months away. 
   What the Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act does: 
   * If a senior signs up for a plan in January, the drugs covered by the plan will continue to be covered the rest of that year; 
   * If a senior become eligible for Medicare during the year, for instance he or she turns 65 in May, and signs up for a plan, the drugs covered by the plan when at the time of enrollment will continue to be covered the rest of that year; and 
   * If at the end of the year during the open enrollment period, a prescription drug plan wants to change its formulary, it can do that. The plan must then notify its enrollees of the formulary changes and seniors can then decide whether to stick with that plan or switch to a different plan. 
   Exceptions when a plan can change its formulary during the year: 
   * A generic alternative is introduced in the market; 
   * A brand name drug loses its patent protection; 
   * The FDA Commissioner removes the drug from the market or imposes a restriction on the use of the drug; or 
   * The drug is deemed to be ineffective. 
   In each of these instances, the plan must notify the Health and Human Services Secretary, affected enrollees, physicians, and pharmacies of the change.
