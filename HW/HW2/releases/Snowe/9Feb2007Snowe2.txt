SEN. SNOWE ADDRESSES KEY ISSUES FACING NATION'S EMEREGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
  At a Commerce Committee hearing on Friday, Feb. 9, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) addressed two key issues facing our nation's emergency communications system; the lack of radio interoperability among various public safety agencies and how best to modernize our communications infrastructure for the 21st Century. Sen. Olympia Snowe questioned public safety and wireless industry officials on our country's ability to implement these tools to keep our nation safe.  
   "The shortfall of public safety communications interoperability is not a new problem. Hurricane Katrina, 9/11, and the Oklahoma City bombing have clearly demonstrated the need for public safety organizations at all levels of government to communicate with one another," Snowe said. "While working to ensure radio interoperability, we should also consider how Internet-based technologies can enhance public safety's ability to share essential information during these crucial times. Congress has an opportunity and an obligation to improve emergency responders capabilities in a thoughtful and effective way to ensure these brave men and women have the resources they need to save lives." 
   Last year, Snowe supported legislation that freed up an additional 24 MHz of electromagnetic spectrum for public safety use. Furthermore, Congress was able to secure $1 billion in grant funding for interoperable radio equipment. Last month, Snowe co-sponsored the Interoperable Emergency Communications Act, introduced by Senators Inouye (D-Hawaii) and Stevens (R-Alaska), which would direct how to utilize the $1 billion in funding to improve the ability of public safety branches to effectively communicate during emergencies.
