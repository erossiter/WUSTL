SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $354,000 FOR MAINE MUSEUMS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that three Maine museums will receive grants from the 2006 Museums for America program. The Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay, the University of Maine's Hudson Museum in Orono, and the Maine State Museum in Augusta will utilize the funds to strengthen projects to better serve the community.  
  "The funding from Museums for America offers museums throughout our state the opportunity to develop various artistic projects," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Residents and visitors of Maine should take time to enjoy the unique attractions that are symbolic of Maine's heritage and culture."
   The funding is distributed as follows:
   * $107,624 to the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay. The funding will support the project Plants, People, Place: Interpreting the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens, which will provide visitors with a better understanding of gardening and horticulture.
  * $96,265 to Hudson Museum, University of Maine in Orono. The funding will assist the project Gifts from Gluskabe: Documenting Maine Indian Material Culture, which will document artistic traditions represented in the museum's material culture collections.
  * $107,624 to the Maine State Museum in Augusta. The funding will support the project, Maine Science Collections Curatorial Assessment (MaineSCCA), which will provide a statewide assessment of science collections held by state-funded institutions, including universities, to gain control over these materials.
   The Museums for America is the largest grant program for museums, providing millions of dollars each year to sustain cultural heritage and to support lifelong learning. Projects eligible for funding include supplemental programs, research, and high priority activities that enhance community involvement.
