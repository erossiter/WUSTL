SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF SEN. THOMAS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) made the following statement this morning after learning of the passing of longtime friend and colleague Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyoming):  
   "I was deeply saddened to learn that one of our nation's great patriots and an exceptional friend and colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, passed away last night. I had the distinct honor of serving with Craig for more than 17 years in the House and the Senate - where we were fellow members of the Class of 1994 and served together on the Finance Committee. Craig was a caring person who served the best interests of the people of Wyoming with tirelessness, integrity, thoughtfulness, and compassion. His passing is a loss for both the Senate and this country, but his legacy of a lifetime of contributions will always be remembered and forever deeply cherished. My heartfelt condolences go out to Craig's wife Susan, his children, and all of his family and friends."
