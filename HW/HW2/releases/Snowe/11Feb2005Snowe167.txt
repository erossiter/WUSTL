SEN. SNOWE HOSTS THREE OF MAINE'S INDIAN TRIBES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) hosted members of the Passamaquoddy, Mic Mac, and Penobscot Nations this week to discuss varied opportunities to improve the lives of tribal members throughout the State of Maine.  
   "I am pleased that Maine's three tribes - the Passamaquoddy, Mic Mac, and Penobscot Nations - made the journey to Washington, D.C. this week," said Snowe. "Maine's tribes are an essential component of our state's identity. By traveling to Washington, they have ensured that their concerns are heard by lawmakers on Capitol Hill. I pledge to continue to work to address the concerns of all three of Maine's tribes." 
   The issues discussed were wide ranging and include tribal economic development, health care, ways to improve quality of life, among other issues.
