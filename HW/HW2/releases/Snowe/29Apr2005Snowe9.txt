SEN. SNOWE INTRODUCES 'CLEAR ACT' WITH SEN. HATCH TO INCREASE USE OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS, ADVANCED CAR TECHNOLOGIES
  Working to increase consumer acceptance of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, recently joined Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to introduce "The Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies Act" (The CLEAR Act), which would offer tax incentives to offset the costs associated with energy-saving technology.  
   "As energy prices continue to rise at an alarming rate and air pollution plagues our cities, it is becoming increasingly obvious that we must step up our efforts to achieve greater energy independence in an efficient and environmentally conscious way," said Snowe. "This legislation offers incentives to help lower the cost barriers to making alternative fuels and the next generation of vehicles more available and attractive to consumers. Increasing the use of alternative fuels makes us less reliant on foreign oil, improves air quality, and supports energy producers here in America." 
   Summary of the CLEAR ACT of 2005 (Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies) 
   Overview 
   The primary purpose of this bill is to enhance national energy security and promote cleaner air by reducing the consumption of petroleum and advancing alternative fuels. Transportation accounts for nearly 2/3 of all oil consumption and is almost 97% dependent on petroleum. 
   This legislation will set the stage for a consumer-based and technology-led transformation of the transportation marketplace. All major vehicle manufacturers are introducing new technology and alternative fuel vehicles into the marketplace. These new technologies reduce petroleum consumption and improve air quality as a result of breakthrough improvements in fuel economy or from the use of non-petroleum alternative fuels. Accelerated acceptance by consumers of these new technologies is needed to increase production volumes and make them cost competitive with conventional vehicles. 
   Providing tax incentives for a limited time to consumers will help offset the higher costs associated with new technology and alternative fuel vehicles. As the vehicles gain consumer acceptance and production volumes increase, the cost differential between these and conventional vehicles will be reduced or eliminated. 
   Key Components of the CLEAR ACT 
   Tax incentives for new technology and alternative fuel vehicles under this legislation go directly to the consumer. These incentives are based both on technology and performance. 
   * Fuel Cell Vehicles. Fuel cell vehicles are the most promising long-term technology offering breakthrough fuel economy of up to 3 times today's levels with zero emissions. The CLEAR ACT offers a $4,000 base credit along with an additional credit of up to $4,000 depending on fuel economy performance. These credits are available for ten years. 
   * Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Electronics that integrate electric drive with an internal combustion engine offer near-term improvements in fuel economy. The CLEAR ACT offers a credit of up to $1,000 for the amount of electric drive power along with an additional credit of up to $3,000 depending upon fuel economy performance. These credits are available for 6 years. 
   * Dedicated Alternative Fuel Vehicles. Vehicles solely capable of running on alternative fuels promote energy diversity and significant emissions reductions. Natural gas, LPG, and LNG are the most commonly used fuels for dedicated alternative fuel vehicles. The CLEAR ACT provides a base credit of up to $2,500 with an additional $1,500 credit for vehicles certified to "Super Ultra Low Emission" (SULEV) standards. "Flex-fuel" vehicles are not eligible since they can operate on either gasoline or E85 (ethanol) and are available in the market without any incremental cost. 
   * Battery Electric Vehicles. Vehicles that utilize stored energy from "plug-in" rechargeable batteries offer zero emissions and are not dependent upon petroleum-based fuels. The CLEAR ACT offers a base credit of $4,000 and an incremental credit of $2,000 for vehicles with extended range or payload capabilities. 
   * Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicles. Medium and heavy duty applications of the same vehicle technologies utilized for passenger vehicles offer similar benefits related to energy efficiency, diversity, and emission reductions. The CLEAR ACT offers credits for individual weight categories and amounts vary with the largest vehicles over 26,000 pounds receiving up to $40,000 for fuel cell or battery electric, $32,000 for alternative fuel, or $24,000 for hybrid applications. 
   * Alternative Fuel Incentives. Alternative fuels such as natural gas, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, B100 (biomass) and methanol are primarily used in alternative fueled vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. To encourage the installation of distribution points to support these applications, a credit of 50 cents for every gallon of gas equivalent is provided to the retail distributor. This credit is available for 6 years. 
   * Alternative Fuel Infrastructure. Complimentary to the credit for the fuel itself, the CLEAR ACT extends the existing $100,000 tax deduction for 10 years and also provides a credit for actual costs of up to $30,000 for the installation of alternative fuel sites available to the public.
