PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD GETS VITAL WORK FROM VIRGINIA CLASS SUBMARINE
  In a decision that will once again establish Portsmouth Naval Shipyard as the premier planning activity for submarine maintenance, Sens. Judd Gregg, Olympia J. Snowe, Susan Collins, John Sununu and Rep. Tom Allen on Monday, March 5, announced that the Navy has decided to assign work related to the VIRGINIA class submarine to the shipyard. Specifically, the Navy has designated Portsmouth as the Ship Availability, Planning, and Engineering Center (SHAPEC) for the VIRGINIA class. Sens. Judd Gregg, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and John Sununu joined Rep. Tom Allen in advocating that the vital work on the submarine be performed at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and were notified this week of the Navy's decision.  
   In a letter to the Senators and Rep. Allen, Navy Vice Admiral P.E. Sullivan, Commander of the Naval Sea Systems Command wrote, "I have directed my Deputy Commander for Logistics, Maintenance, and Industrial Support and The VIRGINIA Class Submarine Program office to execute the necessary paperwork to formalize the designation of PNSY as the SHAPEC for the VIRGINIA Class Program." 
   In a joint statement, the Senators and Congressman stated that, "Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has a long and distinguished record of performing the highest of quality work at costs that are efficient for the Navy. Its work on the LOS ANGELES Class Submarine Program was extraordinary, and we know that same high standards and quality of work will be carried out on the VIRGINIA Class. This announcement is very good news for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and its skilled workforce."
