SEN. SNOWE BACKED LEGISLATION TO PROTECT SENIORS FROM ABUSE PASSES OUT OF COMMITTEE ON AUG. 4
  Legislation cosponsored by Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) to protect seniors from abuse and mistreatment unanimously passed out of the Senate Finance Committee today. The bill, (S. 2010) The Elder Justice Act, contains three main components to safeguard the security of seniors nationwide: first, national coordination of elder justice activities and research; second, increased support for elder justice programs; and third, collection of data and dissemination of information and studies. This legislation awaits action by the full Senate.  
  "Elder abuse can take on a variety, but equally damaging forms: physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial exploitation and fraud, abandonment or neglect. What's most troubling is how often it goes unreported," said Snowe. "The Elder Justice Act that I am proud to have cosponsored takes real, concrete steps to prevent this abuse by providing state grants aimed at improving adult protective services, giving incentives to retain experienced health care workers and expand training opportunities for those working at nursing homes, and collecting and disseminating critical data to inform the public when there is a problem. I'm pleased that the Finance Committee unanimously passed this legislation and I hope for the sake of our nation's millions of seniors that the Senate takes up and passes this legislation as quickly as possible."
  There are three main types of elder abuse: abuse and neglect in homes and domestic settings; abuse and neglect in institutions and other types of residential care; and financial fraud and exploitation. Further, instances of abuse and neglect fall in the following categories: physical, sexual, emotional or psychological, neglect, self-neglect and financial exploitation. 
  According to a 2004 survey on elder abuse conducted by the National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA), self-neglect was the most common category of substantiated reports of elder abuse. This is particularly salient for seniors in Maine as Maine ranks 3rd among all states for the percentage of residents age 65 and older who are living alone.
  It is estimated that 12,000 incidents of abuse occur in Maine annually, often times due to a pattern of domestic violence that continues as victim ages, dependence of abuser on victim, or substance use of abuser. Sadly, approximately 75-85% elder abuse in Maine goes unreported. With 78.2 million baby boomers aging, this problem will only continue to grow if left unaddressed.
  Below are the main components of the Elder Justice Act:
   1. National Coordination of Elder Justice Activities and Research
  An Elder Justice Coordinating Council will coordinate activities of HHS, Department of Justice (DOJ) and other relevant federal agencies. An Advisory Board will ensure a high degree of expertise and advice to the Coordinating Council from private sector experts. The Coordinating Council will be chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and co-chaired by the Attorney General. This section is authorized at $28 million over 5 years.
   The bill also awards $26 million in grants over 5 years to establish stationary and mobile forensic centers and to develop forensic expertise pertaining to elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. If a senior falls or has bruising, it is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of those circumstances. In the past, this section was included under Judiciary provisions but now will be run through HHS. Forensic centers will help law enforcement determine what to look for when confusing symptoms are present. 
   2. Elder Justice Programs
   New Elder Justice programs are established at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of this legislation. These programs will provide programmatic, grant-making, policy and technical assistance functions relating to efforts to address all types of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. 
   The bill provides state formula grants totaling $400 million within HHS aimed at providing adult protective services and carrying out projects to employ workers having caseloads of elders alone. In addition, the bill authorizes $25 million for targeted demonstration grants that test training modules and detection and prevention of financial exploitation.
   Nursing Home Compare is a feature of the Medicare.gov website to provide a searchable database for consumers with detailed information about the past performance of every Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing home in the country. This bill contains a requirement that crimes at nursing homes be reflected on Nursing Home Compare as well as crimes that are committed "off-campus" that still relate to elder justice issues. The bill also contains a study on creating a national nurse aide abuse registry.
   Nursing Home Staffing: The national shortage of health care workers heightens the risk of elder abuse. Annual staff turnover rates in nursing homes are very high-- in some cases exceeding 100 percent for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs). This is often due to low pay, limited advancement, and high risk of injury due to manually lifting and turning residents. Certified Nursing Assistant is a career path that TANF recipients are often steered. The average wage for a CNA is approximately $8.16/hr. The Elder Justice Act requires the Secretary to carry out activities that provide incentives for individuals to train for, seek, and maintain employment in long-term care facilities and authorizes $20 million for FY 2007, $17.5 for FY 2008, and $15 million for FYs 2009-2010.
   It addresses LTC staffing problems by establishing incentive grants to:
  * Attract qualified staff - with new, creative approaches, such as encouraging welfare-to-work and TANF recipients to train and seek employment as direct care providers,
  * Retain staff - through grants to develop innovative career ladders and wage and benefit programs,
  * Train staff and management - to enhance the ability to retain staff, and
  * Create an informatics systems grant program - to off-set costs of purchasing, leasing, developing and implementing standardized clinical health care informatics systems to improve patient safety.
   3. Collection of Data, Dissemination and Studies
  The Elder Justice Act creates a method of promoting uniform collection, maintenance and dissemination of national data regarding elder abuse, neglect and exploitation to be implemented in 3 phases in the states. 
  * Phase I - develops forms and screening tools (authorized at $10 million in the 1st year)
  * Phase II - pilot tests the tools in six states (authorized at $30 million in the 2nd year)
  * Phase III - provides incentive grants to the states to begin collecting the data (authorized at $100 million annually for each of FYs 2009 and 2010) - each state would receive 50% of its allotment as determined by the Secretary and the rest when it properly reports the require data.
   A Long-Term Care Consumer Clearinghouse, authorized at $13 million over 5 years, will provide much-needed information on how different types of facilities are defined, the level of services they offer, criteria for admission and discharge, elements included in the price and standards of care, and oversight and enforcement provisions. In particular, the clearing house will inform consumers of:
   * Options for residential long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing facilities, group homes and other residential facilities, including assisting living, board and care, congregate care, home health care provides and other long-term care providers)
  * Benefits available through Medicare and Medicaid
  * Links to other federal and state websites that describe care options
   Reporting of Crimes in Federally-funded Facilities: The Elder Justice Act requires 1) immediate reporting to law enforcement of crimes victimizing residents; and (2) 60-days advance notice of nursing facility closures and assurance of the proper relocation of all residents. The Chairman's mark would require reporting to law enforcement officials of crimes occurring in federally funded long-term care facilities that receive $10,000 in federal funding during the preceding year. Covered individuals (owner, operator, employee, manager, agent, or contractor of an LTC facility) must report the suspicion of a crime that results in bodily injury immediately, but not later than 2 hours. If the event does not result in bodily injury, the individual must report the suspicion not later than 24 hours. 
   Penalties for non-reporting: If a covered individual does not report a crime within these timeframes, the individual is subject to a penalty of $200,000 and may be unable to receive federal funds for up to 3 years. If the covered individual does not report the suspicion of a crime and that exacerbates bodily harm, or results in harm to another person, the penalty goes up to $300,000. In addition, if a long-term care facility retaliates against an employee for making a report, it can result in a civil penalty up to $200,000 and may be barred from participation in any federal health care program for a period up to two years.
