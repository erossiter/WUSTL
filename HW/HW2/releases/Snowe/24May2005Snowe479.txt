SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $35,000 FOR SALT MARSH RESTORATION
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that $35,000 has been jointly awarded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and FishAmerica Foundation to help implement two salt marsh restoration projects in the Scarborough Marsh Wildlife Management Area.  
   "Salt marsh restoration and preservation is essential to maintaining healthy oceans and ecosystems," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "The funding awarded to the Scarborough Marsh Wildlife Management Area will play a crucial role in restoring and maintaining the ability of the marsh to perform its vital ecologic functions." 
   On behalf of locally-based Friends of Scarborough Marsh, Gulf of Maine Coastal Program staff successfully applied for these funds that will provide partial funding for the restoration of the Nonesuch River section of the Marsh and for Phragmites management and control operations throughout Scarborough Marsh. Both projects will benefit native salt marsh plants and animals, including furbearing mammals, migratory, feeding and roosting waterbirds, and fish ranging in size from mosquito-eating mummichogs and sticklebacks to sport fish like striped bass and American shad.
