SEN. SNOWE EXPECTS RETURN OF 94TH MILITARY POLICE COMPANY FROM IRAQ ON JULY 28
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today lamented a reported mechanical delay with the aircraft carrying the soldiers of the 94th Military Police Company, which were expected to arrive at Fort Drum, NY today from Kuwait and Iraq. Snowe is looking forward to the safe return of the 94th, which has been deployed over two-and-a-half years out of the past four years in combat theaters. 
   "The enduring patience of the members and families of the 94th has truly been tested, but I fully expect that their exhaustive wait will pale in the celebration of the troops' return. With bravery and honor, the servicemen and women of the 94th have proudly represented the United States - for nearly three years and through two extensions - in their tour of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom," said Snowe. "I join with all Mainers in extending our sincerest 'welcome home' to these valiant men and women."
   The 94th Military Policy Company has served two-and-a-half out of the past four years deployed in combat theaters in Bosnia and the Middle East. Just 18 months prior to their assignment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 94th completed a 9 month tour in Bosnia. The unit deployed to Iraq in April 2003 and, in September 2003, was extended as part of the 12 month "Boots on the Ground" policy. The most recent extension came in mid-April 2004 when DoD announced they would be extended the 94th's deployment in Iraq for yet up to another 120 days.
   On June 7, Snowe and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) held a meeting in Washington with the families of the 94th after the families attended a meeting with Defense Department officials arranged by the Senators.
