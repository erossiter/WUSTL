SEN. SNOWE RENEWS CALL FOR CONGRESS TO PASS NATIONAL PRICE GOUGING LEGISLATION
  With national meteorologists predicting a heavy hurricane season, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) renewed her call today for Congress to establish a national price gouging standard that would protect consumers from unscrupulous vendors looking to capitalize on a national emergency. The concern comes as consumers face record gasoline prices at the pump heading into the heavy summer travel season.  
   "With the hurricane season anticipated to more active than normal, it is essential that Congress act quickly and pass legislation establishing a national price gouging standard," Senator Snowe said. "After Hurricane Katrina, we witnessed egregious exploitation of consumers nationwide. This was unacceptable and a national price gouging law must be enacted to ensure that vendors will not take advantage of consumers during national disasters. With hurricane season approaching, I am pleased that the Commerce Committee, of which I am a Member, passed a price gouging bill and I will do what I can to see this measure be successful on the Senate floor." 
   Senator Snowe recently cosponsored the bipartisan legislation (S.1262) that was introduced by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Washington). The bill would protect consumers from price gouging during natural disasters by doing the following: 
   * Giving the President the authority to declare a temporary national energy emergency in instances where the President determines that a threatened or existing disruption of oil or petroleum supplies constitutes a danger to the health, safety, welfare, or economic well-being of the citizens of the United States . This is similar to the emergency authority provided to Governors under many individual state statutes; 
   * Upon declaration of an energy emergency, trigger a prohibition on price gouging, punishable by federal civil and criminal penalties. This provision is modeled after state anti-price gouging legislation on the books in at least 30 states; and 
  * Empowering state Attorneys General with the authority to bring civil action on behalf of citizens for price gouging during an emergency period. 
   "This bill as currently drafted is not perfect, but it's a great start and I have worked closely with Senator Cantwell to improve this legislation to emphatically and concisely protect consumers," Senator Snowe said. "We need to send a strong message that price gouging is unacceptable. It's time for the federal government to stand up for consumers."
