SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES MAINE OLYMPIAN
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe congratulated Seth Wescott of Farmington for winning a gold medal in the Snowboard Cross (SBX) competition during his Olympic debut at the 2006 Winter Olympics. This year's Olympics are being held in Torino, Italy from February 10th-26th. 
   "I would like to congratulate Seth on his tremendous Olympic victory," said Snowe. "Being chosen to compete in the Olympics is a huge honor reserved for just a few elite athletes and by winning a gold medal, Seth has proven that he is the best of the best. He has represented Maine to the rest of the world in spectacular fashion and we are all proud of his great accomplishment." 
   Seth Wescott started snowboarding on Sugarloaf Mountain as a young boy and graduated from the Carrabasset Valley Academy near Sugarloaf. He won the gold medal at the 2005 Snowboard Cross World Championship in British Columbia and is a four-time U.S. National Champion in SBX (2000-2003), and a seven-time X Games SBX medalist. 
   Snowboard Cross makes its Olympic debut in the 2006 Olympic games in Torino, Italy. The Olympic gold medal goes to the rider who finishes first so there is no judging involved in Snowboard Cross.
