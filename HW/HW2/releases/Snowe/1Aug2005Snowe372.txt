SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO PREVENT FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AGAINST GUN MANUFACTURERS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (S. 397) to prohibit lawsuits against firearm or ammunition manufacturers or sellers, or a trade association, for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition.  
 Snowe is a cosponsor of this bill, which the Senate passed by a vote of 65 to 31. 
   "I believe gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the criminal, illegal use of their product when they have properly followed the laws and regulations governing their industry," said Snowe. "This legislation passed by the Senate today is a commonsense, rational approach to ending junk lawsuits against a law-abiding, responsible gun manufacturers." 
   Certain civil cases are exempted from the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act: (1) actions against persons convicted of knowingly providing a firearm for the commission of a violent crime or drug trafficking; (2) negligent entrustment or negligence per se; (3) knowing and willful violations of law; (4) breach of contract or warranty; and (5) defective design or manufacture where the gun is used as intended. 
   Snowe has been a long-time supporter of reasonable, effective approaches to the nation's firearms laws, including instant background checks and enforcing existing gun control laws. As such, she voted to add an amendment to the bill to require that trigger locks or similar safety devices be sold along with every purchase of a handgun, which the Senate adopted by a vote of 70 to 30. This amendment makes exceptions for law enforcement and antique guns.
