SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS RECOMMEND CHARLIE SUMMERS TO HEAD SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION FOR NEW ENGLAND
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins announced today that they have recommended to President Bush that Charles E. Summers, Jr. of Scarborough, Maine be appointed to serve as the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Regional Administrator for New England.  
 If selected by the President, Summers would replace the late Jeffrey Butland who passed away earlier this year. 
   "Given Charlie's exceptional record and superb qualifications, we are delighted to forward Charles E. Summers, Jr. as our recommendation for SBA Regional Administrator for Region I. With our collective knowledge of the SBA, coupled with both having known Charlie for many years, we feel that he is a wonderful choice to be Regional Administrator. He is a dedicated professional and respected entrepreneur with extensive business experience," the Senators said in a joint statement today. 
   Senators Snowe and Collins selected Summers based on recommendations of an advisory committee they formed to vet qualified candidates for the position of SBA Region I Administrator. 
   The President will review the Senators' selection and will thereafter announce his choice.
