SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES FIREFIGHTERS ASSISTANCE GRANT AWARDED TO BERWICK
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) announced today that $700,000 has been awarded to the Berwick Fire Department from the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Assistance program. The grant was a part of the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program which aims to enhance the ability of grantees to attain and maintain 24-hour staffing and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. 
   "It is a critical that our local fire departments have the staffing resources they need to service our communities." Senator Snowe said. "The SAFER program has been a tremendous resource in our fire personnel's efforts to attract and retain the next generation of fire responders."
   The SAFER program provides approximately $115 million in competitive grants to fire departments and statewide or local firefighter interest groups. Ultimately, it is hoped that the recruitment and retention activity will create a net increase in the number of trained, certified, and competent firefighters capable of safely responding to emergencies likely to occur within the fire department's geographic response area. The primary focus of this activity is to enlist and/or retain volunteer firefighters who are trained in the operations of firefighting and emergency response. 
   The grant was administered as follows:
