SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM LEAD POISONING
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) recently signed onto a letter to encourage adequate funding for protecting children from lead poisoning.  
 In a letter to Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and HUD Chairman Christopher Bond (R-MO) and Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA), Snowe and her colleagues requested support for initiatives to protect at-risk children from lead poisoning and other health hazards in their homes. Specifically, they requested at least $185 million in funding for HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. The President's budget request proposes a $48 million cut below FY 2005 levels. 
   "Federal funding is vital to helping cities and states achieve the national goal of ending childhood lead poisoning," said Snowe. "It is unconscionable that lead poisoning still exists. Therefore we must fully fund programs that are instrumental in keeping children safe from lead poisoning." 
   Senator Snowe and others are requesting $95 million for lead hazard control grants, $50 million for the High Lead Area Removal Initiative, $20 million for the Healthy Homes Initiative, $10 million for Operation LEAP, and $10 million for technical assistance. Such funding levels are vital to maintaining and building momentum for protecting children at highest risk for lead poisoning and asthma. 
   Increasing grants for healthy homes and lead safety will help build capacity to develop and disseminate cost-effective maintenance and remodeling practices. These investments in preventing disease will reap enormous benefits for America's families, schools, and economy.
