SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $17.8 MILLION CONTRACT FOR BATH IRON WORKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today announced that Maine's Bath Iron Works (BIW) has received a $17,897,742 Navy contract for the completion of the Post-Shakedown Availability (PSA) for the USS Farragut (DDG 99). The Farragut is an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer in the U.S. Navy and was laid down on January 9, 2004 at BIW in Bath.  
   ""BIW is the nation's premium shipyard and has a rich history of excellence," said Snowe. "The Navy's $17.8 million contract award to BIW is a clear recognition of the shipyard's reputation and the craftsmanship of the men and women of this world class ship-building facility." 
   The Post-Shakedown Availability (PSA) is an industrial availability assigned to newly built ships following the ship's post delivery shakedown period. Work performed during the typically 3 to 4 month duration includes class upgrades and modifications that were not incorporated during new construction as well as the correction of deficiencies noted during the shakedown period.
