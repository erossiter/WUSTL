SEN. SNOWE MEETS MAINE INDUCTEE INTO NATIONAL TEACHER'S HALL OF FAME
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today met with Maine's first National Teacher's Hall of Fame Inductee Barbara Kelly.  
 Recently retired, Kelly was one of five teachers nationwide selected to receive the annual award. Snowe congratulated Kelly on her honor and thanked her for more than two decades of service to the students of the Vine Street Elementary School in Bangor.
   "I congratulate Barbara on her well-deserved honor in the National Teacher's Hall of Fame. This national award not only highlights the first teacher from Maine to be inducted, but it also recognizes the quality of dedicated teachers like Barbara who positively impact the lives of countless students year after year," Snowe said. "For nearly three decades, Barbara has served the students of Vine Street Elementary with enthusiasm and pride, and today, I join with the nation in thanking her for her selfless commitment."
   Kelly served 28 of her 29 year teaching career in the Vine Street Elementary School as a physical education teacher until retiring to North Carolina this year with her husband, a former special education teacher in the Maine school system. Kelly is also the only teacher ever to Chair of the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards.
   The National Teacher's Hall of Fame annually selects 5 teachers nationwide to be honored. For 2004, Kelly's inductee class includes John Sullivan from Barnstable High School (Hyannis, MA), Jane Koszoru from Broward Community College (Davie, FL), George Wolfe from Wilson Memorial High School (Rochester, NY), and Melanie Hocking from Indian Creek High School (Wintersville, OH).
