SEN. SNOWE LEGISLATION WOULD IMPROVE VETERANS' ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) introduced yesterday S. 2639, the Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, a bipartisan measure that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to designate annual health care funding as mandatory, meaning the funding would not be contingent on congressional action. Although the President's VA budget request for Fiscal Year 2009 calls for increased discretionary funding of $47.2 billion, concerns have been raised as to whether the FY09 budget accurately accounts for the increase of nearly 40,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who will seek care from the VA in 2009, along with additional enrolment increases that may be imminent. 
   "Our veterans deserve to have access to both timely and cost-effective health care that is not subject to the limitations of discretionary funding that leaves our military heroes shortchanged time and time again," said Senator Snowe. "At a point in time when an increasing number of new veterans are transitioning into the VA system and an aging veterans' population that continues to require acute medical and long-term-care services, there couldn't be a more critical time to pass this legislation."
   In order to avoid potential funding shortfalls, under this legislation, the VA medical budget would be based around a mandatory funding formula, which calculates the number of veterans in the system and the total cost of providing the necessary care. Senator Snowe has been a long-time supporter of mandatory health care funding for veterans, as she most recently cosponsored S. 331, the Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act during the 109th Congress.
