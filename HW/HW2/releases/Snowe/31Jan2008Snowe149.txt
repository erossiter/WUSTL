SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE CONTRACT AWARD TO BIW FOR JOINT HIGH SPEED VESSEL DESIGN
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced today that the Department of the Navy has awarded Bath Iron Works with a $3 million contract for preliminary design of a Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV). Work is expected to begin immediately with a period of performance of 180 days. 
   "The Joint High Speed Vessel will be a state-of-the-art ship that will help our Army and Navy face the new challenges of the 21st Century," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "Once again, Bath Iron Works is at the cutting-edge of new efforts to modernize our military forces."
   Joint High Speed Vessels will be used for fast intra-theater transportation of troops, military vehicles and equipment. Once preliminary design is complete, the Navy will receive detail designs and construction proposals from the three teams. The Navy intends to award a single Phase Two detail design contract with construction options in late 2008 to one of those teams. The current program of record calls for five JHSVs procured by the Army and three procured by the Navy and Marine Corps. The first ship, an Army vessel, is intended to be delivered in 2011.
