SEN. SNOWE: CRITICAL PORT SECURITY LEGISLATION PASSED
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that shares jurisdiction over transportation security, voted early this morning for passage of critical port security legislation that will help secure the nation's ports that, a long standing homeland security risk. The legislation awaits the President's signature to become law.  
   "Improving the security of our nation's ports is critical to ensuring the safety of the American people and the strength of our economy," Snowe said. "This comprehensive legislation addresses many of our long standing vulnerabilities by increasing cargo container inspections. We have built on the foundation of maritime security legislation passed in 2002, and taken steps to properly fund, implement, and enhance security measures to counter emerging threats around the globe." 
   Senator Snowe sponsored the following provisions included in the bill: 
   * Extension of Gulf of Maine Research Institute Bulkhead Replacement: 
  A provision extending the deadline for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute to replace the bulkhead located on the Coast Guard property in Portland. The previous deadline of 2006 has been extended to the end of 2008. 
   * Port Security Worker Training Requirements: 
  A provision addressing the requirements included in the 2002 Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), which requires port and terminal operators to provide security training regimes for employees of these ports, by allowing for forming training partnerships, including public safety entities and academic institutions, between port operators and these partners to provide training. This would permit the Maine Maritime Academy to contract with port operators around the country to provide port workers security training. 
   The Port Security Act also includes provisions that: 
   * Mandate unannounced inspections of port facilities reflecting which is meant to address the concerns you had about the CG announcing its inspections ahead of time. 
  * Create an interagency operation centers on a national scale that you championed in the original maritime security act. 
  * Increase domestic radiation detection capabilities as you have called for.
