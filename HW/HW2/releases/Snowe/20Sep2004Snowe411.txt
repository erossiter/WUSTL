SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $11 MILLION FOR LAND & WILDLIFE PROJECTS IN MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins announced that $11,608,000 in federal funding has been approved for land and wildlife projects in Maine as part of the Fiscal Year 2005 Interior Appropriations Bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee has unanimously approved $20 billion in funding for the Department of the Interior and related agencies nationwide. The bill must now be considered by the full Senate.  
   "We will continue to advocate in the Senate for funding for these projects, that are among some of the most important land and wildlife conservation efforts in the state. If we are to preserve Maine's valuable natural resources for future generations, we must support programs that serve to protect, preserve, and expand them," said the Senators in a joint statement. "This funding is crucial to ensure the success of conservation programs that rely so heavily on public support." 
   Senators Snowe and Collins announced that the Interior Appropriations bill includes funding for the following Maine projects: 
   * $2 million for Atlantic Salmon Conservation & Preservation Projects in Maine through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Grants will be awarded to state and local conservation agencies, watershed councils, non-profit conservation organizations, and industry groups to help meet recovery and delisting goals for the Atlantic Salmon species. 
   * $1 million for the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership/Forest Stewardship Program for the conservation and purchase of development rights for the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership. The 342,000 acres comprising Downeast Lakes is the largest collection of lakes, wetlands, and rivers in eastern Maine, and is part of a one million acre international trans-boundary conservation initiative. 
   * $1 million for the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge in York County. This funding comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the addition of 185 acres to the Refuge from Biddeford Pool to Upper Wells, along Maine's heavily populated southern coastline. This acquisition includes tidal pools, grassland habitat, high quality wetlands, and breeding and nesting for a variety of shorebirds. 
   * $4.5 million for the Katahdin Forest Legacy Project to design a conservation easement adjacent to Mt. Katahdin as a sustainably managed working forest. The goal is to ensure a steady wood supply to local mills, promote sustainable forestry management, ensure continued public access and traditional recreational uses, and meet public values. 
   * $500,000 for the Hancock/Sebago Lands Forest Legacy Project to protect thousands of acres in Southern Maine under a conservation easement. This would preserve land in a part of the state that is experiencing great development pressures. 
   The FY05 Interior Appropriations Bill that was approved also contains $1.95 million to fund a wastewater treatment compliance project at the Craig Brook National Fish Hatchery. It also includes $658,000 for a wastewater treatment compliance project at the Green Lake National Fishery.
