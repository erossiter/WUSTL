SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $680,906 IN REEMPLOYMENT AND ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT GRANTS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has awarded Maine $680,906 in Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment (REA) grants.  
   "This grant money will allow the State to provide critical services to those Mainers who have unfortunately lost their jobs," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "It will be used to fund programs to help those in need search for employment as well as provide an array of other necessary services." 
   The Department of Labor has awarded a total of $18 million to 21 states. The funding will be used to implement systems to provide reemployment and eligibility assessment services to unemployment insurance claimants. This is the first year that DOL has awarded REA grants. 
   The grant guidelines require that these funds be used to conduct in-person assessments in One-Stop Career Centers. The REA must include an unemployment insurance eligibility review, the provision of labor market information, development of a work-search plan and referral to reemployment services and/or training, as appropriate. The state workforce agencies have agreed to participate in a DOL-funded study of this initiative.
