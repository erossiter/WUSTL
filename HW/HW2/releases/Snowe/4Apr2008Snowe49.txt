SEN. SNOWE LEADS EFFORT TO BOLSTER STATE'S SHARE OF HOUSING PROGRAM FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today that she introduced an amendment to housing stimulus legislation to increase the small states' share of the increase authorization the legislation provides for the Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program. MRBs are tax-exempt bonds that help fund below-market-interest-rate mortgages for first-time qualifying homebuyers. The allocation and distribution of MRB's are done by population only, but there is a small state set-aside element.  
   The housing stimulus legislation being considered on the Senate floor provides an additional $10 billion in MRB's for first-time homebuyers and at-risk borrowers. This package is allocated only based on state populations. The Snowe amendment would provide an additional $930 million of MRBs in order to "true up" the amount small states would have otherwise received if there had been a $10 billion allocation with a small state minimum. Maine goes from receiving $43 million to $90 million - an increase of 110 percent.
   "The downturn in our economy has produced a significant effect that has impacted Americans from large and small states," said Senator Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee. "Our efforts to jumpstart the economy and help those adversely impacted by the housing crisis must not be limited to large or small populations, but should instead be as widespread and definitive as possible."
   "For the state of Maine, passage of this amendment would result in a 110% increase in the state's additional MRB allocation," Senator Snowe added. "While this amendment represents a very small portion of the bill's overall funding, its effects to states like Maine is pretty substantial."
