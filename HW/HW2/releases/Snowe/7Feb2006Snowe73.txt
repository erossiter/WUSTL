SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUDGET'S IMPACT ON SHIPBUILDING AT BATH IRONWORKS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today commented on the President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 $10.8 billion shipbuilding budget for seven ships.  
 The request includes $957 million for two Littoral Combat Ships and $2.6 billion to begin construction on two DD(X) ships. Maine's Bath Iron Works is involved in either the planning or the construction of both of these programs. 
   Snowe issued the following statement today:
   "I am encouraged by an $11 billion shipbuilding budget and a plan to build seven ships, including 2 Littoral Combat Ships and the first two new next generation destroyers, the DD(X). It is no small wonder that Maine's Bath Iron Works is intricately involved with both programs, given the quality and skill of America's premiere builder of surface combatants. Indeed, it is because of BIW's exemplarity workforce that the Navy has the most advanced ships in the world. While this year's request is tremendous improvement over last year's budget, we must continue to expand the Navy's shipbuilding accounts in order to reach a 313 ship Navy. I will continue to work with my colleagues, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg, to further emphasize the need to continue to stabilize our nation's shipbuilding and requisite industrial base. As Congress considers the President's budget for our Armed Forces, we must work to find common ground with preserving our national security as our primary concern."
