SENATORS VOW SUPPORT TO IMPACTED WORKERS
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) released this statement following the announcement by San Antonio Shoe (SAS) in Pittsfield that 140 to 150 people will be losing their jobs beginning the week of April 14th: 
   "Employees affected by this layoff now face an uncertain future, through no fault of their own. We will make every effort to ensure that they receive every available resource they need to help them move forward and become gainfully employed once again.
   "Our district staffs have already contacted both the Maine Department of Labor and Pittsfield Town Officials and will stand ready to assist so that workers can begin the process of finding a new job when the time is appropriate, and access community resources to help them through their employment transition.
   We want to help SAS employees access the current employment services offered by the Maine Department of Labor. During this difficult period, we encourage every worker to take advantage of the services that are already in place at their nearby Maine Department of Labor Career Centers."
