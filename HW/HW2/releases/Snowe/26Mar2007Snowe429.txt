SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO APPROVE '08 BUDGET RESOLUTION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Monday, March 26, 2007, voted to support the $2.9 trillion dollar Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2008 that she calls "vital for so many hard-working families and small businesses throughout Maine and our nation." The budget outline passed the Senate by a vote of 52 to 47. 
   "While today's Budget resolution did not provide the perfect blueprint for the needs and wants of every American, I supported this resolution for its proposed ability to sustain and enhance programs that are vital to America's families, veterans, and small businesses," said Senator Snowe. "The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and New Markets Tax Credit program are critical investments that now have the necessary funding to improve the health and economic well-being of families in Maine and across the country. I also commend Congress for its decision to increase discretionary funding for education, community oriented policing (COPS), and the Amtrak system, which services southern Maine ."  
   The budget also increases resources of the Small Business Administration. As the Ranking Member of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Snowe constantly works to enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of SBA to the nation's small businesses through a variety of important programs and put forth an amendment representing 21 percent increase over the Administration's proposal and adds funding for microloans, contracting assistance, Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, veterans outreach programs, and technical assistance programs, among others. 
   In addition, Senator Snowe pointed to the budget's pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) provisions which has been one of her top priorities and was central to the Congress balancing the budget in the 1990s. The measure requires that all tax cuts and new direct spending to be offset even if those policies were assumed in the budget resolution. "I have stated since the start of this budget debate that restoring and enforcing pay-as-you-go was essential to the sound fiscal discipline that we desperately need in the face of skyrocketing deficits," said Senator Snowe. 
   During the budget debate, Senator Snowe supported a host of amendments that protect and enhance the programs that she has long championed including: 
   * Providing tax relief to middle class families and small businesses and to expand health insurance coverage for children; 
   * Extending the $1,000 child tax credit and extending refunding portion of the child tax credit; 
   * Affirming commitment to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The budget would provide up to $50-billion for SCHIP over five years. 
   * Affording the opportunity for a five-year reauthorization of the New Markets Tax Credit that is a vital program that encourages the infusion of much-needed capital into low-income and rural communities through a federal tax credit through a Snowe-Rockefeller amendment.. 
   * Extending provisions allowing veterans to qualify for low interest mortgages; 
   * Making permanent the tuition tax credit through the Bayh-Snowe admendment 
   * Increasing funding for the Violence Against Women's Act; 
   * Providing the Veterans Administration with more resources to meet a large claims backlog causing hardships for veterans and their families; 
   * Establishing a death tax exemption of $5-million per estate, indexed for inflation and setting the top death tax rate at no more than 35% beginning in 2010; 
   * Increase the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $703 million in FY 2008 for a total LIHEAP level of $3.2 billion. 
   "This budget and the debate that shaped it, protects the most vulnerable in our communities and ensures that all Americans have more access to healthcare, education, small business assistance, as well as other valuable programs while at the same time, finding comfort that Congress is attempting to instill fiscal discipline that all individuals and families must show in their own lives," said Senator Snowe.
