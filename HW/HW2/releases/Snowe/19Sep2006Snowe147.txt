SEN. SNOWE PRAISES FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF TWO DDG 1000 DESTROYERS IN 2007
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised Senate and House conferees who have agreed to fund the construction of two DDG 1000 Navy Zumwalt Class destroyers, formerly known as the DD(x) destroyer program. The agreement to authorize $3.4 billion to simultaneously construct two ships was reached during reconciliation of the 2007 Defense Authorization Bill between the Senate and the House of Representatives. Maine's Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi will each be responsible for the construction of one destroyer beginning next year.  
   "The future of Bath Iron Works and the United States Navy depends on the successful construction of the next generation DDG 1000 destroyer," Senator Snowe said. "The decision to maintain the Senate position to fund the construction of two lead ships beginning next year is a watershed moment for Bath Iron Works, the state of Maine, and the U.S. Navy. I will continue to fight in Congress for the funding of the DDG program, and I know the hardworking men and women at BIW are ready to serve their country and do what they do best best, build the greatest ships in the world. Today, they are one enormous step closer to getting started."
