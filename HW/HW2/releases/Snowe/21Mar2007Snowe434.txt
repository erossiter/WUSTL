SEN. SNOWE HONORED BY MAINE PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Wednesday, March 21, was presented with the 2007 National Association of Community Health Centers Champion Award during a meeting with representatives from Maine health centers in her Washington, DC office. Sen. Olympia Snowe met with representatives from the Maine Primary Care Association, including Executive Director Kevin Lewis, and representatives from the Katahdin Valley Health Center and Health Reach Community Health Centers. Sen. Olympia Snowe was honored for her continued efforts to support and develop health centers in Maine and across the country. 
   "Community health centers form a vital part of the primary care safety net in our country," said Senator Snowe. "These centers provide cost-effective quality care for millions of Americans - including uninsured and under-insured residents in Maine. I am honored to receive this award and I pledge my continued commitment to helping these health centers get the funding they need to make a difference."
   Snowe recently introduced the Health Centers Renewal Act of 2007 with Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to help provide additional funding for Community Health Centers throughout the country, particularly in under-served areas.
