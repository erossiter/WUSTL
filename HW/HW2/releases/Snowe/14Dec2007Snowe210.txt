SEN. SNOWE COMMENDS SENATE PASSAGE OF HOUSING TAX RELIEF PACKAGE
  Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today hailed Senate passage by unanimous consent of H.R. 3648, the "Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007," as amended by the Senate. The House bill as amended provides a three-year mortgage debt forgiveness for a primary residence, extends the tax deduction for mortgage insurance premiums, as well as expands the definition of a co-operative housing corporation. The Baucus-Grassley amendment to H.R. 3648, which Senator Snowe cosponsored, also provides tax relief for full-time students in the form of a low income housing tax credit.  
   "The holiday season is not a time for America's homeowners to be worrying about their mortgages, and the passage of this amendment is a tangible victory for them," said Senator Snowe, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Finance. "This legislation will pass tax savings on to those who need them the most, while doing so in a fiscally responsible manner. Given the troubles facing homeowners due to the subprime mortgage crisis, we must do everything in our power to mitigate the myriad of problems facing homeowners nationwide."
   Senator Snowe is also an original cosponsor of S. 1394, the "Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act of 2007," introduced by Senator Stabenow, which was incorporated as part of this legislation.
