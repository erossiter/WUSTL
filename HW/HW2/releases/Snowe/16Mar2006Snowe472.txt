SEN. SNOWE WORKS TO KEEP FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY PROGRAMS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted for an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution she offered with Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) to increase funding for the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program by $1.3 billion, bringing the total funding to $4.3 billion. The Senate passed this amendment by a vote of 60 to 38. The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 budget proposes 25% in cuts to the CDBG program.  
   "CDBG funding empowers communities to provide affordable housing and other services to low-income people across our nation," said Snowe. "Cutting funding for this program by 25 percent would be irresponsible, and it would leave struggling families out in the cold. I am pleased that the Senate today demonstrated its commitment to addressing the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens by fully funding CDBG." 
   Last week, Snowe sent a letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Ranking Member Kent Conrad (D-ND) urging them to oppose the budget proposal to cut funding for the CDBG Program. Instead, they asked the Committee to $4.3 billion for CDBG. 
   The CDBG program provides billions of dollars in flexible funding to states, localities, and other community organizations for economic development and public works projects. Maine's CDBG program provides funding and technical support for projects that achieve local community and economic development objectives, while principally benefiting Maine's residents with low-to-moderate income. These programs are only available to Maine towns, cities and counties for the benefit of Maine residents. 
   Since 1998, Maine communities have received $23.4 million in funding for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects and over that same time nearly 3,800 jobs have been created through CDBG funding. Regardless, Maine's CDBG allocation was cut from $31.7 million in 2005 to $28.9 million in 2006. 2007 funding is expected to be reduced to $21.7 million which would equate to a loss in Maine of $10 million in funding from 2005 to 2007.
