SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ALLEGED ABUSE AT ABU GHRAIB PRISON IN IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on the investigation into abuses of the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq: 
   "I am outraged by the abuses reported at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. These actions were reprehensible and have profound repercussions for American credibility in Iraq as well as internationally. Tragically, this is the case - even while those heinous actions of a few do not reflect the overwhelming majority of our troops who have performed superbly - nor do they reflect our values as a nation. 
   "This clearly cannot be allowed to go unaddressed. The bottom line is that we need to identify those responsible, hold them accountable and bring them to justice, and at the same time examine what went wrong that allowed this kind of deplorable behavior.
   "We've got to send a message of zero tolerance for such acts, and I believe the examination of what went wrong must be multi-faceted. The Pentagon needs to conduct a swift but thorough investigation, and the CIA should do likewise as it is alleged that the abuses took place under the leadership of military intelligence officers. At the same time, Congress absolutely has a responsibility to conduct its own investigations to systemically account for what went wrong. 
   "Indeed, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I will be focused on these events and their implications to determine the facts. Without question we need answers as to the conduct of intelligence activities - specifically, methods used to elicit information from detainees. We must ensure that the Department of Defense has a clear and consistent set of guidelines that dictate the humane treatment of all detainees. Then, Congress needs to assess the Defense Department's findings so we can ensure our oversight on this issue and make sure it does not happen again."
