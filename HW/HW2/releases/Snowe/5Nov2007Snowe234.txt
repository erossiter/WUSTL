SEN. SNOWE PRAISES NATIONAL DAY OF CLIMATE ACTION ON GLOBAL WARMING
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today praised the Step it Up 2007 campaign, which is sponsoring a National Day of Climate Action this Saturday in order to raise awareness about global warming. Snowe commended Step it Up 2007 organizers and Mainers who are participating in the "Step it Up 2007: Green Leadership" events throughout the state Saturday in Portland, Blue Hill, Benton, Kennebunkport, Bar Harbor, and Deer Isle/Stonington and Farmington. A staff member from Senator Snowe's district office will attend the Farmington event. 
   "I applaud the Step it Up 2007 campaign for holding various events throughout Maine and the entire nation that will so urgently call attention to one of the most serious environmental and economic issues of the 21st century," said Senator Snowe. "The U.S. desperately needs to move forward in the fight against global warming by curbing its greenhouse gas emissions, updating our scientific research methods, and improving our ability to reduce our carbon footprint."  
   Senator Snowe has been a leading advocate of introducing legislation that will reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil, decrease our carbon emissions, and promote scientific research and understanding of the global warming crisis. 
   * The Kerry-Snowe bill, the Global Warming Reduction Act of 2007, aims to keep global average temperature from rising more than 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial level to limit the extent and magnitude of climate-change impacts. This is accomplished through the establishment of an economy-wide, market-based emissions cap and global warming pollutants trading program starting in 2010. The Lieberman-Warner America's Security Act, which passed out of a Senate subcommittee on November 1st, follows the Kerry-Snowe model, starting just a few years later. 
   * The Klobuchar-Snowe provision included as part of part of the America's Climate Security Act, introduced by Senators Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.) and passed by the Private Sector and Consumer Solutions to Global Warming and Wildlife Protection Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on November 1st, establishes a Greenhouse Gas Registry, an integral beginning for collecting emissions data that will lead to an economy-wide estimate of our nation's greenhouse gas emissions. 
   * This year Senator Snowe shepherded the passage of the first increase in fuel economy standards for America's automobile fleet since 1975. The legislation, entitled the "Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act" is critical to increasing fuel economy standards for all vehicles, which will result in a reduction of an estimated 206 million metric tons of CO2 in 2020 alone and 274 million metric tons in 2030. Senator Snowe has been a leading advocate for increasing fuel economy standards for all vehicles by working with colleagues on both sides of the political aisle to ensure our country reduces its level of carbon emissions. 
   * Introduced in 2004 and now in US statute, the Snowe-Feinstein bill, the Efficient Energy through Certified Technologies and Electricity Reliability Act of 2004 (EFFECTER Act) increases the security and reliability of the electric grid, while reducing natural gas and electricity prices though a gradual reduction in demand. Other provisions passed into law include targeted tax incentives and standards for energy efficiency in commercial buildings, both new and retrofitted, that will support energy demand reduction, the construction of new homes, and the use of more energy efficient appliances.
