SEN. SNOWE CONGRATULATES HOMETOWN OF AUBURN, FIRST 'ALL STAR CITY' AWARD-WINNER IN MAINE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised her hometown of Auburn on being named the first "All-Star City" in Maine as a part of the National Anthem Project. The Auburn School System's Music Department was recently recognized for its efforts to re-teach students the Star-Spangled Banner. Auburn Mayor John Jenkins will officially accept the "All Star City" award during a celebration at Edward Little High School tomorrow to honor the music teachers, parents, and the more than 200 students who made this achievement possible.  
   "I congratulate the city of Auburn and the many students, teachers, school administrators, and parents who participated in this remarkable program and made it a resounding success," said Senator Snowe. "There is no better way to bring the fabric of a community together, especially one as tight-knit as Auburn, than to expand music education in a way that bolsters civic and national pride." 
   The National Anthem Project is led by the National Association for Music Education (MENC) and is dedicated to highlighting the significance of music education, placing special emphasis on re-teaching the words and history of the Star Spangled Banner.
