SEN. SNOWE RECEIVES COMMITMENT THAT PROPOSED DELTA- USAIRWAYS MERGER WILL NOT IMPACT MAINE AIR SERVICES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R- Maine), a senior member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, today received a strong commitment from US Airways that their proposed merger with Delta Airlines will not affect air service in Maine. Delta Air Lines and US Airways both currently provide commercial flights at the Portland International Jetport and the Bangor International Airport.  
   "With the proposed merger between US Airways and Delta Airlines, I was given a firm commitment today from US Airways that air service to Maine's airports will remain strong. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees our nation's airlines, I will continue to work to expand air service to all of Maine's airports," said Senator Snowe. "Over the years, I have built a strong relationship with Delta Airlines and US Airways to keep Maine connected to our transportation network and as this merger moves forward, I will continue to advocate strongly for expanded air service to Maine.".
