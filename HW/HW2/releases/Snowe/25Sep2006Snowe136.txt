SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES $2.6 BILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF TWO DDG-1000 DESTROYERS IN 2007
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised Senate and House conferees who have agreed to fund the construction of two DDG 1000 Navy Zumwalt Class destroyers, formerly known as the DD(X) destroyer program. The agreement reached by negotiators Thursday evening appropriates $2.6 billion for the production of a lead DDG 1000 at both Maine's Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi beginning in 2007.  
   "The future of Bath Iron Works and the United States Navy depends on the successful construction of the next generation DDG 1000 destroyer," Senator Snowe said. "I would like to praise the Senate and House appropriators for their decision to fund the construction of two lead destroyers next year. This is a watershed moment for Bath Iron Works, the state of Maine, and the U.S. Navy. I will continue to fight in Congress for the funding of the DDG-1000 program, and I know the hardworking men and women at BIW are ready to serve their country and do what they do best, build the greatest ships in the world. It is because of their legendary work-ethic and skills that Mainers have been chosen to build these ships, and it is to the credit of this shipyard that the future backbone and nucleus of U.S. Navy fleet will once again be Bath-built."
