SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS APPLAUD ANNOUNCEMENT OF CALL CENTER IN OAKLAND
  Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins today applauded the announcement by wireless telecommunications provider T-Mobile that the company will be opening a customer call center in Oakland.  
 The Senators worked closely with T-Mobile officials to encourage them to locate the call center in Maine. 
   "We applaud T-Mobile for choosing Oakland to be the site of their new customer call center which will create approximately 720 new jobs in the greater Waterville area. This is certainly welcome news that will do a great service to not only boost the local economy, but the morale of the communities," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. 
   The Senators were officially notified on Wednesday by company representatives of the selection of the Maine site. The Senators were told that the new center will create approximately 720 new jobs in the greater Waterville Area. 
   "We are pleased that our continued discussions for the past months with T-mobile have yielded this promising partnership of the company and the State. This is an exceptional announcement that is truly in the spirit of the holiday season."
