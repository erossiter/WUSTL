SEN. SNOWE VOTES TO MAINTAIN VETERANS HEALTH CARE FUNDING
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today voted for an amendment to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Budget Act that would restore funding for the veterans health care by $823 million in FY2007 and $4.446 billion over 5 years. The Senate passed this amendment unanimously. The President's FY2007 budget calls for offsetting some of the increase in the VA's budget by instituting new enrollment fees and increasing co-payments for some veterans.  
   "With such a great number of our servicemen and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the VA's foremost responsibility is addressing the immediate needs of our veterans," said Snowe. "Unfortunately, the budget before us falls short of the President's request for funding the VA while retaining provisions that shift additional fiscal strain to those who have served. I am pleased that the Senate passed this amendment today to provide a level of funding for Veterans health care that reflects our gratitude and meets veterans' needs." 
   The President's 2007 budget for Veteran's Affairs includes $38.5 billion, a portion of which comes from new proposed user fee increases imposed on some veterans (priority level 7 and 8). The first user fee proposal would establish an annual enrollment fee of $250, and the second would increase pharmacy co-payments from $8 to $15 for a 30-day supply of drugs. Senator Snowe has long opposed such user fees, and Congress has defeated similar proposals in the past. 
   Since 2001, the VA's medical care budget has increased 69% (or $14.5B) and this year's medical care budget request (with collections) alone is 7% more than last year. VA estimates it will be able to provide medical services to an estimated 5.3 million patients. In a recent speech to the American Legion, the President noted how this increased funding has given almost a million more veterans access to the VA medical care system.
