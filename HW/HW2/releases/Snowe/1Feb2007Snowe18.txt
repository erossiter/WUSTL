SEN. SNOWE, ROCKEFELLER INTRODUCE MAJOR TRADE ENFORCEMENT LEGISLATION ON FEB. 1
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) on Thursday, Feb. 1, introduced legislation that would require the United States Trade Representative to take action on behalf of U.S. business and workers' when a U.S. trade right has been violated. Sen. Olympia Snowe joined Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) to introduce the Trade CLAIM Act in the Senate to ensure U.S. industry and labor groups receive appropriate protection under international trade agreements.  
   "The Trade CLAIM Act would give U.S. businesses and workers a greater say in whether, when, and how U.S. trade rights are enforced." Snowe said. "Guarding against violations of United States trade agreements benefits American industry, labor groups, and small businesses that are often drowned out by larger business interests. Providing the USTR with third party oversight of its rulings will ensure political and diplomatic pressures do not effect the decision to investigate or pursue trade violation claims." 
   Summary of the bill: 
   The Trade CLAIM Act would amend Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974- the statute setting forth general procedures for the enforcement of U.S. trade rights- to limit USTR's ability to decline an interested party's petition to take formal action in cases where a U.S. trade right has been violated to instances where: 
   * the matter has already been addressed by the relevant trade dispute settlement body; 
   * the foreign country is taking imminent steps to end to ameliorate the effects of the practice; 
   * taking action would do more harm than good to the U.S. economy; or 
   * taking action would cause serious harm to the national security of the United States. 
   The bill would also grant the U.S. Court of International Trade jurisdiction to review de novo (i.e., without deference to USTR's decisions) USTR's denials of Section 301 industry petitions to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair foreign trade laws or practices. Such jurisdiction would include the ability to review USTR determinations that U.S. trade rights have not been violated as alleged in industry petitions, and the sufficiency of formal actions taken by USTR in response to foreign trade laws or practices determined to violate U.S. trade rights. 
   Snowe believes that: 
   * Increasing the likelihood of facing a U.S. trade challenge would put greater pressure on foreign trade partners to cease and desist from unfair trade practices; 
   * Providing judicial review over USTR decisions not to enforce U.S. trade rights, would ensures effective oversight not subject to political and diplomatic pressures; 
   * Depoliticizing the enforcement of U.S. trade rights should lead to greater recognition of the effectiveness of the dispute resolution institutions provided for under U.S. bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, bolstering popular support for those agreements and the notion that free trade can be fair trade.
