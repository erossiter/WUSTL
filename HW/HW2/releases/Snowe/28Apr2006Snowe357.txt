SEN. SNOWE APPLAUDS U.S.-CANADA LUMBER IMPORTS DEAL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) said today that she believes that a tentative deal between the U.S. and Canada to end a decades long dispute over timber imports is welcome news that should provide relief to Maine and the nation's timber industry.  
   "This decision is major breakthrough after a bitter, decades-long dispute. It is good for Maine and fair to all parties involved," said Snowe. "As one who has been involved in trying to resolve this impasse for 25 years, I applaud U.S. and Canadian negotiators for reaching a deal that puts an end to trade practices that hurt the softwood lumber industry and their hardworking employees. I am pleased that this situation - which has been dragging on for so long - has reached its conclusion, and I hope that today's agreement will prove to be the beginning of a more harmonious relationship between our countries on this vital issue." 
   Under the terms of the deal, the United States would no longer impose quotas or tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber exports, and the U.S. would keep duties it has collected so far.
