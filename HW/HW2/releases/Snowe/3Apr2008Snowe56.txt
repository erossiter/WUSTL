SEN. SNOWE'S STATE DIRECTOR NAMED 2008 MOAKLEY AWARD WINNER
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today praised her State Director and longtime friend, Gail Kelly, for being honored as a recipient of the prestigious John Joseph Moakley Award for Exemplary Public Service. Gail has worked on behalf of Senator Snowe and the state of Maine for more than 20 years - first as a staff assistant when Senator Snowe served in the U.S. House of Representatives - and now as her State Director, a title she has held since 2004. Gail's contributions to the state extend to her service on the Multiple Sclerosis Society's Board of Directors, the Brewer City Council, and the Husson College Board of Directors in Bangor, Maine. 
   "I would like to congratulate Gail Kelly on this tremendous honor and thank her for her continued service to the state of Maine," Senator Snowe commented. "For the past 20 years, Gail's compassionate and effective service has undoubtedly improved the lives of countless Mainers. From her tireless efforts assisting dislocated workers in the wake of multiple industry and small business closings to her solid achievements in constituent casework, Gail is a revered champion of the citizens of our great state. I am thrilled that the Greater Boston Federal Executive Board recognized what Maine has known for many years and has honored Gail for her unwavering dedication to public service."
   Bestowed by the Greater Boston Federal Executive Board and the Moakley Family, the Award recognizes an outstanding staff member who represents a member of the New England Congressional delegation through exceptional and inventive work on behalf of their constituents. Named for Congressman John Joseph Moakley, the Moakley award was established in 2001 and is awarded annually during National Public Service Week.
