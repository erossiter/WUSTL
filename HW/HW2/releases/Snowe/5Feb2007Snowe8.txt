SEN. SNOWE BACKS LEGISLATION TO KEEP KIDS SAFE FROM INTERNET PREDATORS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, on Monday, Feb. 5,cosponsored legislation to keep kids safe from sexual predators who use the Internet and social networking sites to engage in criminal, sexual activity. Sen. Olympia Snowe joined Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and John McCain (R-AZ) in introducing the Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual-Predators (KIDS) Act, which would require convicted sex offenders to register their e-mail or instant messenger address, and any other internet identifier with the National Sex Offender Registry.  
   "With the success of social networking sites enhancing our ability to communicate worldwide, it is imperative that we take the necessary steps to safeguard our children from online sexual predators," said Senator Snowe. "This legislation is vital to ensuring that convicted sex offenders are registered with the Internet community the same way they are registered in our home communities. We must remain vigilant in our fight against sexual predation and utilize tools like the National Sex Offender Registry to keep our kids safe." 
   The Department of Justice would make the Internet addresses of registered sex offenders available for social networking sites to compare to the user profiles in their databases. The KIDS Act would also make it a crime for any person 18 years or older to knowingly misrepresent his or her age with the intent of using the Internet to engage in or facilitate sexual misconduct with minors.
