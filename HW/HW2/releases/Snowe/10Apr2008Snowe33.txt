SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $25,000 GRANT AWARDED TO PORTLAND STAGE COMPANY
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced today that the Portland Stage Company has received a grant of $25,000 on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts' Shakespeare for a New Generation Program. The Portland Stage Company will utilize the funds to produce seven performances of Julius Caesar for local students who have had little or no exposure to professional theater. In addition to the production, The Shakespeare for a New Generation program will also sponsor in-school workshops for the students. 
   "The efforts of the NEA to support the Portland Stage Company and its role in the community are commendable and greatly appreciated," Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "With the help of these funds, the production and subsequent performance of Julius Caesar will introduce countless young people in the Portland area to live theater and literature. The impact of this experience will undoubtedly enrich and benefit the lives and minds of these young Mainers and their communities for years to come."
   As Maine's largest fully-professional theater, the Portland Stage Company has been entertaining the Portland area since 1974 and plays to over 50,000 people annually. It is one of only 40 professional theater companies nationwide selected to participate in the 2008-2009 season of the Shakespeare for a New Generation Program.
