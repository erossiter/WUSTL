SENS. SNOWE, MCCAIN, WARNER MET WITH FAIRFIELD SOLDIER LATE ON JUNE 28
  Late yesterday, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) met with Army Spec. Chuck Ford who was injured in Iraq in her Washington, D.C. office today. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe also arranged for Ford to meet with Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. John Warner (R-VA). Ford was awarded the Purple Heart for acts of bravery. His convoy came under attack in Kirkuk in March. Ford lost his lower right arm in the attack.  
   "Today, I had the tremendous opportunity of meeting a true patriot in Spec. Chuck Ford. His acts of heroism in Kirkuk, Iraq during an insurgent attack last March saved not only his own life but that of five other soldiers," said Snowe. "His positive attitude and his commitment to his nation make him a true hero. I'm pleased that he was able to meet two other living war heroes in John McCain and John Warner yesterday as well. For all that Spec. Ford has done, for his tremendous sacrifice, our nation will always be grateful." 
   Ford is in Washington receiving therapy at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center to learn how to use a prosthetic arm.
