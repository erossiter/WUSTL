   The United States Senate Youth Program received notification that the Maine selection deadline is: October 26, 2007. 
   The program was established in 1962 by Senate Resolution 324 and since then, more than 4,600 students have participated in this unique leadership program. Each year, this United States Senate program brings two students from each state, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity to Washington to experience an intensive week-long program educational program about the workings of the Senate and the federal government overall. USSYP is fully funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
