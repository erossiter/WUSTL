SEN. SNOWE ANNOUNCES DEFENSE CONTRACT TO GENERAL DYNAMICS IN SACO
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, (R-Maine) today announced that the Department of Defense (DoD) has contracted with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products for the purchase of 45 M2HB Machine Gun Overhaul Kits for the Army Tank Automotive Command.  
 This contract with the DoD is estimated to be worth $26.5 million with all of the work conducted at General Dynamics' Saco, ME operations. 
   "I am pleased that the Defense Department has again recognized the excellence that General Dynamics consistently provides in support of our armed forces. In our nation's ongoing global war on terror, our military must have access to the best equipment to effectively complete their mission," said Snowe. "The continued construction of weaponry at the General Dynamics' Saco plant not only supports the increasing needs of the U.S. military, but will also create jobs at the Saco facility and strengthen the local economy." 
   Each kit will be used by the Army to overhaul 100 M2HB Machine Guns, replacing weaponry parts that have been classified as unserviceable. The weaponry is determined to have a high level of lethality and versatility, with a maximum effective range of 2,000 yards and firing at a rate of 450 rounds per minute. 
   If all planned options are exercised, the total contract announced by DoD could total $49.9 million, with production and delivery to be completed early 2005.
