SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $20.8 MILLION IN LIHEAP FUNDING FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan Collins today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services has released $1.2 billion in regular funding, including $20.8 million for Maine, for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
 The funding, which has been included in the fiscal year (FY) 2005 Continuing Resolution, will assist low-income families cover home heating costs through the winter months. 
   "This funding is indeed good news for many Mainers as winter fast approaches," said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. "We also remain committed to protecting the long-term strength of this essential program and will continue to work to secure additional LIHEAP funding that last year alone provided critical assistance to over 45,000 Maine households." 
   Snowe and Collins have cosponsored legislation to increase LIHEAP funding for FY 2005 through FY2007 and are committed to having this legislation considered before the Senate adjourns for the year. 
   LIHEAP provides a safety net against high energy costs for the nation's low-income households, disabled individuals and senior citizens living on fixed incomes. The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown since 1981, but the number of households served has declined, because of high fuel costs.
