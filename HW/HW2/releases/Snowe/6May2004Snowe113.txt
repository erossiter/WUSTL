SEN. SNOWE COMMENTS ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF NEGROPONTE TO U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on the Senate confirmation by a vote of 95-3 of John Negroponte to U.S. Ambassador to Iraq:  
   "Today, the Senate has rightly confirmed John Negroponte to the position of U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. As we fast approach the date when the Coalition Provisional Authority will transfer governing authority to the people of Iraq, I believe Ambassador Negroponte will be invaluable to enhancing a spirit of increased cooperation and understanding between our two nations. It is also my firm hope that his depth and breadth of political and diplomatic experience and knowledge will lead to increased international participation in our efforts to bring about a stable and peaceful Iraq."
