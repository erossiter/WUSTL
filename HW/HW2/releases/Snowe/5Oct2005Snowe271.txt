SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $1M FOR YORK LAND TRUST
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) today announced that the York Land Trust has been awarded $1 million for the Mount Agamenticus to the Sea Conservation Initiative.  
 These federal funds, distributed by the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, will allow York Land Trust to acquire up to 200 acres of salt marsh and upland buffer on the York River in order to protect habitat for more than 100 species of waterbirds and at least 28 species of fish, and to provide recreational access to the area. 
   "The York River and surrounding marshlands not only add to the beauty of the York community, but are invaluable to the area's ecological system," Senators Snowe and Collins said. "This federal funding will ensure that these natural resources are protected so they might be enjoyed by generations to come." 
   The Mount Agamenticus to the Sea Conservation Initiative is a coalition of the following agencies, organizations, and land trusts: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, Maine Coast Heritage Trust, Trust for Public Land, The Nature Conservancy, Great Works Regional Land Trust, Kittery Land Trust, York Land Trust, and York Rivers Association.
