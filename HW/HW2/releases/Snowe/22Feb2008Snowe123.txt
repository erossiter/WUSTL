SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE RELEASE OF $3.84 MILLION IN EMERGENCY LIHEAP FUNDS
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that the United States Department of Health and Human Services has released $40 million in emergency LIHEAP funding to 11 states including an additional $3.84 million for the State of Maine. 
    "This emergency LIHEAP funding comes at a critical time when the burden of record oil prices is having a devastating impact on many Mainers, especially low-income families and seniors." Senators Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement. "So many families are already stretched to the breaking point and no family should ever have to choose between heating their homes and food or prescription drugs. Without further assistance, too many families will be faced with making these impossible choices." 
   Each year, 4.5 million low-income families, including about 48,000 households in Maine, rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes. LIHEAP is a federal grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low-income households. In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low-income families and the elderly, LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs, low-cost residential weatherization and other energy-related home repairs.
