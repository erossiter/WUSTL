SEN. SNOWE REACTION TO BEHEADING OF AMERICAN CIVILIAN BY AL QAEDA OPERATIVES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement on the reported beheading of an American civilian - Nicholas Berg of Pennsylvania - allegedly at the hands of Al Qaeda:  
   "The sheer brutality of the senseless killing of an American civilian further demonstrates Al Qaeda's flagrant disregard for human life. I am shocked and horrified that these cowardly terrorists, hiding behind masks, would target an innocent American civilian. Today's heinous actions should only serve to strengthen the international community's resolve to wipe out terrorism from our world." 
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to the Berg family, who will forever cherish their memories of Nicholas, who deserved nothing less than the opportunity to live his life with dignity."
