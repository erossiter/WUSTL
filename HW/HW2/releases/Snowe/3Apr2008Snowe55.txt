SEN. SNOWE SUPPORTS GOVERNOR'S CALL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS DEAL ON RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDITS ANNOUNCED
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) offered praise for Governor Baldacci's effort to highlight the need to make the state of Maine more energy efficient as an energy summit was convened this morning in Augusta. At the same time, a bi-partisan deal was announced by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and John Ensign (R-Nev.) today to extend billions of dollars worth of renewable energy and efficiency tax incentives - including provisions introduced by Senator Snowe in the Finance Committee. 
   "We must do more than pay lip service to alternative energy production and conservation," said Senator Snowe, the author of the 2005 energy efficiency tax incentives. "The landmark energy efficiency tax incentives we passed in 2005 cannot be allowed to expire just as we have started down the proper path. The fact is too much of Maine's dollars are spent on imported fuels and energy sources. This renewed effort to make Maine more independent and efficient can yield significant results for our economy and our energy future."
   Key Snowe-backed provisions that were included in the bi-partisan renewable tax incentive agreement included:
   The deduction for building energy efficient commercial buildings was extended for one year;
   The tax credit for consumers to make existing homes more energy efficient was extended for one year;
   The credit for utilizing more energy efficient technology when building new homes was extended for two years; and
   The credit for producing more energy efficient appliances was extended for three years.
   Senator Snowe added, "The report released today by Charles Cogan underscores my long-held view that energy efficiency measures must be a key component of any stable energy policy that moves forward."
