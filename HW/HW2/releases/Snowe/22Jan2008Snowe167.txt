SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $350,000 IN LOAN FUNDING FOR YORK COUNTY SHELTER
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced today that York County Shelter Programs, Inc. has been awarded $350,000 of loan funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program.  Specifically, the Shelter will receive a loan of $300,000 and a conditional commitment for a guaranteed loan of $50,000. 
   "No Mainer should ever be left out in the cold," noted the Senators in a joint statement.  "With winter upon us, this funding comes at a critical time when many homeless shelters are reaching their full capacity.  Providing our homeless shelters with these additional resources will go a long way to helping Maine's homeless find a home for the winter and assist them as they transition to living on their own."
   The funding will be used to construct a two-story residential facility on Shaker Road in Alfred.
