REP. SNOWE CALLS ON CONGRESS TO TAKE ACTION NOW
  U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), a senior member of the Finance Committee, called on Congress to take immediate action to extend unemployment insurance, energy and efficiency tax credits, provide emergency heating assistance, and block the implementation of costly Medicaid regulations scheduled to take effect. 
   "The lack of GDP growth and the rise in unemployment insurance requests and highlights the need for Congress to take immediate action to alleviate the burden on working-class and low-income Americans," Senator Snowe said. "The economic stimulus package Congress recently passed should be the first step, not the last step in our efforts to reinvigorate the economy."
   The Labor Department reported today that initial claims for unemployment insurance climbed 19,000 last week to 373,000, higher than initially forecast. The level was the second-highest since a surge in claims in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Economic growth grew a scant 0.6 percent while personal income growth for the fourth quarter of last year came in short of expected projections. At the same time, the price of oil has reached record levels hitting a new high of $102 a barrel.
   "With the possibility that gas prices will reach $4 a gallon by spring and families continuing to struggle to afford the cost of heating their homes - now is the time to extend renewable energy and efficiency tax credits and revive a long dormant energy policy," Senator Snowe added. Senator Snowe added. "We must also not neglect the pending effect that new Medicaid regulations will have on the state's ability to provide health care services to the people who need it the most."
