SEN. SNOWE CALLS ON CONGRESS TO TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
  New U.S. Department of Labor statistics released this morning reported that U.S. employers cut 63,000 jobs during February, marking the largest monthly job decline in nearly five years. Today's figures also mark the second consecutive month of job decline and the first time since 2003 the nation has experienced job losses in consecutive months. The Labor Department estimates that the number of people in the workforce fell by 450,000 in February.  
   U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, called on her colleagues in the Senate and House to take immediate action to address unemployment insurance benefits and adopt measures that would inject more life into the flagging economy.
   "We cannot afford to wait for another month of job losses to take immediate and effective action - Congress should be proactive when addressing our economy, not solely reactive," Senator Snowe said. "Unemployment is rising, heating and oil costs are skyrocketing and the burden on working-class and low-income Americans is growing by the day. We have an obligation to alleviate that burden as soon as we can. That effort should start with addressing unemployment insurance benefits, provide additional heating assistance to low-income families and reduce the financial burden on states by delaying implementation of costly Medicaid regulations."
