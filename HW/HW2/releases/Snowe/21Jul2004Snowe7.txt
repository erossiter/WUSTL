SEN. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $937,500 IN EQIP FUNDING FOR MAINE
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that $937,500 in federal funding has been allocated to the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) in Maine.  
 Established under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, EQIP provides farmers assistance in voluntarily adopting measures to promote environmental quality on their working agricultural land.
   "This critical funding will assist farmers and ranchers in efforts to improve soil, air and water resources while working towards greater overall conservation," Snowe and Collins said in a joint statement.
   The essential objectives of EQIP are to aid farmers with regulatory compliance, to help ameliorate environmental threats such as soil erosion, and to promote cost-effective and beneficial changes to cropping systems, manure management, irrigation, and other elements of production. The selection for this program takes into account climatic conditions and watershed areas, making many Maine farms eligible for competitive consideration.
