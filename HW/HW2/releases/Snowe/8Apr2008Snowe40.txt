SENS. SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE $2.7 MILLION FOR BANGOR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins today announced that the Bangor International Airport has received a grant in the amount of $2,740,000 from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of continued work to upgrade and maintain its aviation facilities. 
   Specifically, the FAA says this grant will help the airport acquire friction measuring equipment that will allow it to measure the breaking ability on the runway during wet weather conditions. Results noted are reported to pilots to notify them of existing operational conditions during periods of inclement weather. In addition, the funds will help purchase a handicap passenger lift device to meet the Americans with Disability Act requirements for the boarding and deplaning of disabled passengers, and terminal building improvements that will include installation of fire alarms in the recently expanded terminal area.
   "This federal funding will help the Bangor International Airport fulfill the transportation needs of Eastern and Central Maine by enhancing the airport's facilities," said Senators Snowe and Collins in a joint statement.
