SEN. SNOWE MEETS WITH MAINE SERVICEMEN, WOMEN DURING TRIP TO GULF REGION
  On a recent trip to the Gulf region devastated by Hurricane Katrina, Sen.  
 Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) met with Mainers who are there working as part of the relief effort. She was accompanied on her trip by Admiral Thomas Collins, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard and Rear Admiral Robert Duncan, 8th Coast Guard District Commander in New Orleans. 
   "The heroic efforts of our nation's enlisted personnel during this time of crisis have not gone unnoticed," said Snowe. "Their acts of bravery and selflessness have been truly inspiring. I had the honor of meeting with Coast Guard members from South Portland on my recent trip to the Gulf region and witnessed firsthand the effort they are making to help some of the most devastated areas in the region. I also met with an Air National Guard unit from Bangor, the Maineiacs, who have been involved in airlifting supplies. I am so proud of all that Maine has done - and continues to do - to contribute to the relief efforts." 
   Snowe met with the Maine Coast Guard maintenance and assistance team from South Portland, which is currently constructing a dining hall facility in Gulfport, MS, and with the 101st Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard unit from Bangor, which is airlifting supplies to the region. Snowe also met with Coast Guard enlisted personnel at Air Station New Orleans.
