SEN. SNOWE HELPS MAINE DISH NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS KEEP NETWORK ACCESS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe joined Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Sen. Wayne Allard (R-CO), and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today in introducing the Satellite Consumer Protection Act of 2006, which will help EchoStar's DISH Network, subscribers keep their distant network feeds. A recent court decision found EchoStar guilty of violating copyright law under the Satellite Home Viewer Act and will, as a result deny access to distant network signals to more than 17,350 subscribers between now and December 1, 2006.  
   "EchoStar Communications intentionally violated copyright law and should be held accountable, but I do not believe Mainers should be unjustly punished," said Senator Snowe. "This legislation offers an adequate solution for those EchoStar subscribers with limited service programming who would otherwise be forced to change service providers within the next month or be left with no options for network programming at all." 
   Although originally a nationwide service, satellite television services have been taking steps to offer local network programming instead of distant network feeds since 1999. Subscribers in the upper half of Maine still depend on distant network stations that feed from New York to view ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX. Under this legislation, EchoStar will be able to continue to offer consumers in the areas where local channels are not yet available via satellite. 
   In terms of satellite coverage, Maine is broken down into three markets: Porltand/Auburn, Bangor, and Presque Isle. Customers in the Portland/Auburn can access to local network feeds via satellite television service today. However, the Bangor and Presque Isle markets do not have local feeds and therefore will be covered by this legislation.
