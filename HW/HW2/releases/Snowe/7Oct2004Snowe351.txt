SEN. SNOWE PROVISION TO PROVIDE CRITICAL RELIEF TO NATION'S NAVAL SHIPBUILDERS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE TAX BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee and a conferee to the House-Senate FSC/ETI Conference Committee, announced today that she secured a provision in the FSC/ETI Conference Report that would put Naval shipbuilders' tax payments on par with those currently paid by commercial shipbuilders. 
   "By changing the way our nation's naval shipbuilders account for their tax payments, this will strengthen the industry's overall financial health and ultimately our national security," said Snowe. "Currently, our naval shipbuilders at facilities like Bath Iron Works in Maine are forced to pay income tax much earlier than when they receive payments for the ship. This is unfair, as they are forced to use capital for early tax payments they otherwise could use to modernize and strengthen their facilities." 
   Snowe's provision would delay, but not reduce, the taxes a builder of a naval ship pays on estimated profits earned upon delivery of each ship, provided the construction or overhaul takes two years or longer. Currently, Naval shipbuilders are required to pay tax on a percentage of their expected profits while a ship is being built. This revised tax treatment is similar to how commercial shipbuilders pay their income tax.
   "This provision takes dramatic steps to remedy the inequity of how Naval shipbuilders pay their taxes by changing the timing in which these taxes are due," said Snowe. "By no means does this provision lower the taxes paid by our shipbuilders. Rather, it institutes a more balanced and reasonable approach by achieving equity with commercial shipbuilders." 
   The Senate and the House of Representatives are expected to pass the Conference Report later this week.
