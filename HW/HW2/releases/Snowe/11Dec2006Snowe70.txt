SEN. SNOWE PAYS TRIBUTE TO DR. JEANE KIRKPATRICK
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today paying tribute to former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick who passed away last night: 
 "Today, our nation mourns the passing of one of the architects of America's victory over the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Jeane Kirkpatrick believed, as President Reagan did, that we had to reaffirm our nation's great historic principles by challenging the false assumptions about our nation that had led to the decade of despair in the 1970s. She was the living embodiment of President Reagan's ideal that our response to our diminished economic and military strength must not be to 'blame America first,' but to reaffirm our confidence and our strength in ourselves and in the world.
 "Serving in the House of Representatives during the Reagan Administration, I came to respect her pragmatism, her conviction, and her candor. By virtue of the positions she held as the first woman to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations, as a member of the National Security Council, and a member of President Reagan's Cabinet, Jeane Kirkpatrick was a true trailblazer. Her memory will live on through her work and her historic contribution to our nation.".
