MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE DELEGATION MEMBERS, GOVERNORS MEET ON PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD
  Maine and New Hampshire's Congressional Delegations and Governors met today on Capitol Hill to discuss strategy as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission considers the Department of Defense's (DoD) closure recommendation for the shipyard.  
   "The BRAC Commission will evaluate the DoD's recommendations on their merit and their adherence to the BRAC criteria established by law, so those are the areas our arguments must address," Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, New Hampshire Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu, Maine Representatives Tom Allen and Mike Michaud and New Hampshire Representatives Jeb Bradley and Charles Bass said in a joint statement. "We are now laying our plans to shine the harsh light of hard facts on the DoD's flawed analysis and its deviation from the BRAC guidelines it should have followed. It is a travesty of justice that a shipyard that has set such a high standard by meticulous attention to detail and performance has been betrayed by a Department of Defense that could not adhere to its obligations." 
   "We are growing increasingly impatient with the DoD's delay in releasing the comprehensive set of data it used to justify its recommendations. The DoD owes the communities affected by its recommendations an explanation as to its reasoning and the process by which it reached its decisions. While DoD officials defend their conclusions before the BRAC Commission, they are unfairly denying the employees of the nation's best shipyard the information to which they are legally entitled."
