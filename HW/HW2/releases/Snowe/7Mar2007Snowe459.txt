SEN. SNOWE CALLS FOR INCREASE OF FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS
  At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) addressed the need to raise fuel economy standards of America's automobiles, SUVs, and trucks. Sen. Olympia Snowe is a cosponsor of the 10 in 10 bill introduced earlier this year with Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) that would increase CAF? standards by 10 miles per gallon over the next 10 years.  
   "The effect that increasing CAF? standards would have on the environment and U.S. dependence on foreign oil is not in question. What is in question is Congress's will to act," Snowe said. "Improving the fuel economy of America's automobile fleet is a national imperative and should be a federal priority. The path to energy security, a healthier environment and consumer relief begins with a national commitment to increasing national fuel economy standards. We already have the technology we need to achieve this goal and we must begin this process now." 
   U.S. vehicles are currently the greatest consumers of petroleum in the world, accounting for 9 million barrels of gasoline a day. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) in its 2007 Annual Energy Outlook projected that, between 2005 and 2030, 93 percent of the growth in the demand for liquid fuels will occur in the transportation sector, citing, "Growing population, incomes, and economic output spur travel demand." EIA further notes that projected fuel efficiency will only improve "slightly" if we maintain our present course. The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to our failing energy policy and a large contribution of manmade greenhouse gases. 
   From 1978 to 1990, automobile fuel efficiency increased from 18 miles per gallon to 27.5 miles per gallon - an increase of more than 50%. Congress has not increased CAF? standards for passenger cars since 1990 however, despite the repeated introduction of the CAF? bill by Senators Snowe and Feinstein since 2001. 
   Earlier this year, Senators Snowe and Feinstein introduced legislation that would raise the average fuel economy standards for all vehicles, including SUVs and sedans, from 25 miles per gallon (mpg) to 35 mpg by model year 2019. 
   The bill would also: 
   * Establish mandatory on-board fuel economy displays that show real-time fuel consumption to encourage more fuel efficient driving. 
   * Improve safety rulemaking standards: The bill would require the Department of Transportation to set standards for the industry that will protect Americans in whatever car they choose to drive. The bill would mandate standards to mitigate the difference in weight and size between the largest and smallest vehicles, and improve bumper height compatibility between vehicles. 
   * Create a program to identify vehicles that meet or surpass mandatory fuel economy standards - the green label and the gold star label. 
   * The green label would be for vehicles that meet or exceed the applicable fuel economy standard or have the lowest greenhouse gas emissions. 
   * The gold star label would be for vehicles that achieve a fuel economy at least 50 mpg, and for light trucks with 37 mpg or higher.
