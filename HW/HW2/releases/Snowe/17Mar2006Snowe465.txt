SEN. SNOWE COMMITTED TO SAVING GEORGIA-PACIFIC MILL IN OLD TOWN
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today expressed her deepest regrets upon the startling announcement by Georgia-Pacific that it will close its Old Town mill.  
   "This is a huge blow to Old Town and many other outlying communities, and I am extremely disappointed by the decision to close the GP Old Town mill," said Snowe. "I stand ready to work closely with officials from the Training and Development Corporation, CareerCenter, Penquis CAP and the City of Old Town to assist any worker who is affected by this closing or change in ownership. Fortunately, we have already formed a transition team for the region to prepare to organize assistance as quickly as possible. As the state moves forward with efforts to sell the mill to potential buyers that already exist, we will stand ready to assist in these efforts to do whatever we can within our power to save the GP mill. It is critical that a buyer be sought as quickly as possible to ensure these jobs are not lost." 
   As part of the announcement to close, the owners of GP have also agreed to work with state officials to help identify a buyer for the mill in the next 60 days, and to maintain the mill for that period.
