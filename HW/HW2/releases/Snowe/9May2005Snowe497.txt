SEN. SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON RUMSFELD ANNOUNCEMENT TO CLOSE FEWER MILITARY BASES IN BRAC ROUND
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement today on an announcement yesterday by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld that fewer U.S. military facilities will be on the Defense Department's list for the next round of base closings:  
   "It is indeed welcome news that the Department of Defense is scaling back the number of bases it will recommend for closure, even as we continue to leave no stone unturned to ensure that Maine's military bases remain vital components of our national security. 
   "With our military deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, as we continue our multi-front war on terrorism, and with the potential return to the United States of 70,000 servicemen and women given the closure of military bases overseas, it simply does not make sense to close our domestic bases. The Commission that reviewed our overseas military infrastructure found that we are ill-prepared to make this dramatic shift in our military positioning. The fact is, too many questions remain unanswered, and I believe this continuing uncertainty about our overseas bases is further proof that moving forward with this BRAC round is ill-advised."
