SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $168,000 FOR ASHEVILLE METHAMPHETAMINE INITIATIVE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced $168,000 for the Asheville Metro Area Methamphetamine Laboratory Enforcement Initiative. 
   "This is an important step in the fight against meth in Western North Carolina," said Dole. "Methamphetamine, as well as the process by which it is made, is dangerous and deadly. I am proud to support efforts to stop the rapid spread of this pervasive drug."  
   This project aims to help law enforcement agencies in Western North Carolina improve the way they are investigating, processing, and shutting down methamphetamine labs. The project funding will be used for enforcement and policing; enhanced technology and equipment; and training and education for law enforcement and relevant community groups. Moreover, this will help the entire state by reducing the case load at the Raleigh lab, which has been handling all the state's lab seizures. 
   From 2000 until 2004, meth lab seizures in North Carolina went up 2,013 percent, from 16 each year to 322 each year. This year, North Carolina has already seized 258 labs. 85 children have been rescued from meth homes this year. 
   Senator Dole secured this funding in a fiscal year 2005 appropriations bill. 
   Background 
   Senator Dole also is a cosponsor of a bill to combat methamphetamines. The bill, which has been approved by the Senate as an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, would limit methamphetamine producers' ability to obtain pseudoephedrine, the primary ingredient in methamphetamine. 
   Once approved by the Senate, this version of the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
