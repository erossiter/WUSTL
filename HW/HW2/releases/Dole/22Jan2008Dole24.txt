SEN. DOLE RESPONDS TO NAVY'S PLAN TO CONSIDER TWO NC SITES FOR POTENTIAL OUTLYING LANDING FIELD
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement responding to the Navy's announcement that it plans to further study two North Carolina sites in Gates County and Camden and Currituck Counties and three Virginia sites for a potential outlying landing field (OLF):  
   "I am pleased that the Secretary of the Navy decided to forego any further consideration of the five original proposed OLF sites, including the Washington and Beaufort Counties site that had the most pervasive opposition, particularly due to its proximity to a bird refuge. I welcome the service's serious consideration of three locations in Virginia. 
   "Based on my extensive discussions with officials and residents in Gates, Camden and Currituck Counties, it is clear that the Navy's proposal to locate an OLF at those sites will be met with considerable resistance. It is my understanding that the Navy has yet to consult with local leaders in these three counties, which I find very discouraging. 
   "Broad local support for an OLF is essential, and as I have assured North Carolinians and advised the Navy, I will oppose the Navy's efforts to acquire any site in North Carolina that fails to meet this standard."
