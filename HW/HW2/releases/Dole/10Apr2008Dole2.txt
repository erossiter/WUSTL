SEN. DOLE TO NAVY: THERE IS 'CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE' TO OLF IN CAMDEN, CURRITUCK, GATES COUNTIES
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole wrote to Secretary of the Navy Donald Winter to relay the "considerable resistance" she has heard from Camden, Currituck and Gates Counties towards a potential outlying landing field (OLF). Below are excerpts from her letter: 
   "It is troubling that the Navy has not made clear what, if any, economic benefits an OLF would create for the affected area. I am frankly baffled that many months have passed since the new OLF sites were identified, but officials and residents in these counties have yet to hear any compelling reasons why they should accept this facility.
   "As a representative of my constituents, I question whether it is prudent for the Navy to move forward with additional studies on these contested sites - spending millions in taxpayer dollars and causing further emotional and financial tolls on the residents of northeastern North Carolina along the way.
   "I fully understand that the Navy truly needs this facility, but I would respectfully offer that this process cannot and should not occur in a vacuum. A sincere and forthcoming effort by the Navy to outline the economic benefits is crucial to securing broad local support."
