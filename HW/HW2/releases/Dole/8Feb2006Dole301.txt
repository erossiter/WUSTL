SEN. DOLE PRAISES SIGNING OF DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a member of the Senate leadership, today joined President Bush and her colleagues at the White House for the signing of the Deficit Reduction Act, which was approved by Congress in December and will reduce government spending by $40 billion from 2006 to 2010.  
   "The majority in Congress is working hard to maintain fiscal discipline while addressing many unforeseen challenges," said Dole. "Particularly as we approve billions of dollars in much-needed funding to rebuild areas of our country devastated by last year's hurricanes and to fight the War on Terror, we must look at ways to trim other government expenses and wisely spend the tax dollars of hardworking Americans. 
   "I am particularly pleased the President's budget, which was submitted to Congress this week, holds the line on spending while including critical pro-growth policies. If we are going to reduce the deficit, we must identify which programs are working and which programs are not, and we should reform entitlement programs that continue to expand uncontrollably." 
   The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act seeks to slow growth and stimulate reform of entitlement programs, many of which are outdated, inefficient and costly. Spending on these programs now consumes 54 percent of the total federal budget - a number that is expected to rise to 62 percent over the next 10 years if no action is taken. 
   This bill includes $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The measure also provides a down-payment toward hurricane recovery and reconstruction costs, including $2 billion for Hurricane Katrina related health care costs.
