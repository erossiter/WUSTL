SEN. DOLE REINTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO AID STUDENT PARENTS WITH CHILD CARE, HEALTH CARE, HOUSING RESOURCES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, joined by Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), today reintroduced the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act. The legislation would provide higher education institutions with start-up grants to offer student service centers that help pregnant and parenting students find child care, health care, family housing and adoption services.  
   "Pregnancy and child rearing can be overwhelming, particularly when coupled with the pressures of being a student," said Dole. "Whether they are married or single, mothers or fathers, we need to do our part to support these students and provide them with options that allow them to be a parent and still graduate from college. In addition, we need to send a strong message that when an unwanted pregnancy occurs, there are alternatives to abortion. Having access to the resources provided by these grants will make the pursuit of education and a career a continued reality." 
   According to some estimates, 45 percent of women who have abortions are college-age (18-24 years old). Many are students or have plans to study and are concerned that having a child would interfere with education and career plans. Many also lack the financial resources to afford child care and adequate housing. 
   The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act is named for the suffragist who organized the first women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y. in 1848. Modeled on Feminists for Life Pregnancy Resource Forums, the legislation would provide funding for start-up costs, not ongoing revenue, for colleges that receive the grants. 
   Student service centers would help pregnant and parenting students, through campus and community organizations, access: 
   * Family housing; 
   * Affordable on-campus child care, babysitters, and co-ops; 
   * Information about telecommuting options; 
   * Maternity coverage in student health care plans; availability of coverage to family members; 
   * Information about adoption and adoption service providers; and 
   * Other resources to assist pregnant and parenting students.
