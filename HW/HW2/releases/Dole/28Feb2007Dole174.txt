SEN. DOLE SEEKS FUNDING TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IN NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole is calling for the conversion of a number of provisional drug task force offices in North Carolina into High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) offices. These North Carolina offices, which are currently operated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and FBI, would fall under the jurisdiction of the existing HIDTA in Atlanta, thus making North Carolina offices eligible for federal HIDTA funds.  
   In a letter to John P. Walters, Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, Dole wrote, "No one can dispute that North Carolina has been hit hard by an increase in drug trafficking. According to the most current North Carolina data available from DEA, methamphetamine labs increased from 32 in 2001 to over 300 in 2005, drug arrests by DEA agents nearly doubled from 2003 to 2005, and the state has become a staging and transshipment point for sending cocaine to other areas of the country. All indications are that North Carolina's rapidly growing population will only exacerbate these problems, unless steps are taken to increase enforcement efforts." 
   According to North Carolina law enforcement officials who have contacted Dole, converting the provisional task forces to HIDTA offices would provide greatly needed funding for operations, administrative support, computer equipment and officer overtime pay. For example, because provisional task force offices do not receive funds for administrative work, agents in North Carolina currently must devote hours that could be used for investigative work to handling administrative duties. 
   "The drug threat in North Carolina is increasingly severe and must be addressed," wrote Dole. "Providing for HIDTA offices in key North Carolina counties would greatly enhance the drug enforcement efforts already taking place in my state."
