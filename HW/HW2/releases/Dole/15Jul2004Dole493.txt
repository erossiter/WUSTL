SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $17.2 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR TRIANGLE TRANSIT AUTHORITY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that Triangle Transit Authority will receive $17,207,946 in funding from the Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration.  
 Funds will be used for the final design activities of TTA's master transit plan, which includes a 35-mile rail system with 16 stations connecting Durham, RTP, Cary and Raleigh. 
   "I commend Triangle Transit Authority for securing the funds to improve its operations," said Dole. "Expansion of services, particularly the completion of a light rail system, will greatly benefit Triangle residents and local businesses." 
   The light rail project received the go-ahead from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in January 2003 to take the 35-mile project, including 16 planned stations into "final design." Under final design, TTA has been acquiring land near the rail corridor and working with the FTA on refining costs for the project. 
   TTA is a regional public transportation provider, offering a wide variety of transit and vanpool services to the Triangle and outlying counties. Bus service is available to Apex, Cary, Chapel Hill, Durham, Garner, RDU International Airport, RTP and Raleigh. TTA also provides commuter resources and hosts GoTriangle.org, the new on-line resource for the public transportation information in the Triangle. The rail transit system is expected to be operational in late 2007.
