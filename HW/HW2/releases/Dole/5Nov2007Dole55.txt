SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR WRDA VETO OVERRIDE
  In response to the president's veto of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today pledged her support for overriding the veto. 
   The WRDA bill authorizes more than $70 million for North Carolina infrastructure, including: $14 million for Charlotte's Briar Creek Relief Sewer Project; $4 million for the Cary and Wake County water reclamation facility; $3 million for Winston-Salem storm water upgrades; $6 million for Fayetteville and Cumberland County water and sewer upgrades; $4 million for water and wastewater infrastructure improvements for the Town of Mooresville; $1 million for Washington County water and wastewater infrastructure; and $4 million for the Neuse Regional Water and Sewer Authority's regional drinking water facility in Kinston.
   In early October, Dole and more than 20 other fiscally conservative Republicans wrote to the president urging him not to veto the legislation.
   "Hurricane Katrina and the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minnesota are two recent examples of the dangers in under-investing in our nation's key infrastructure," wrote Dole and her colleagues to President Bush. "This bill provides an opportunity to prevent future infrastructure failures and disasters."
   The WRDA conference report passed both the House and Senate with nearly 90 percent approval. The House and then the Senate are expected to vote to override the veto this week. Two-thirds majority is required in both chambers for a veto override.
