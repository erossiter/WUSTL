FAYETTEVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT TO RECEIVE $2.5 MILLION GRANT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that Fayetteville Regional Airport will receive a $2,508,326 grant from the Federal Aviation Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.  
   "As a former Secretary of Transportation, I know how important it is for airports to have the appropriate infrastructure," said Senator Dole. "I applaud the Fayetteville Regional Airport for securing the funds to make their facility as safe and efficient as possible." 
   The funding will go towards rehabilitating the terminal loop roadways and will help replace the terminal's roof and interior signage. It also will provide for rehabilitating the airport's beacon and a study to determine the condition of the airport's pavement.
