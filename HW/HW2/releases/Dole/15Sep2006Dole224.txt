SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS U.S. CUSTOMS, BORDER PROTECTION ACTION ON ILLEGALLY TRANSSHIPPED TEXTILE PRODUCTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded news that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has seized more than $100 million in the last year in textile goods that were illegally smuggled or transshipped in an effort to circumvent trade laws and regulations.  
   "This news is a strong indicator that textile enforcement produces results," said Dole, who has been a strong voice for the hard-hit textile industry in North Carolina and has advocated for tough trade enforcement. "We have worked very hard to tackle the issues of textile transshipment, and while this encouraging news, we must remain focused on strong enforcement and continue a dialogue with the Administration on the textile industry's needs." 
   Background 
   In the Senate, Dole has repeatedly secured funding for additional Customs agents to oversee textile enforcement and has pressed the Administration to fill all agent positions. 
   This year, Dole successfully advocated for the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 to include $9.5 million for U.S. Customs to oversee textile transshipments enforcement. That bill must be considered by a House-Senate conference committee, and the final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate before the measure goes to the president for his signature.
