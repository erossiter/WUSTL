SENS. BURR, DOLE INTRODUCE BILL TO STUDY PERQUIMANS RIVER
  Senators Richard Burr and Elizabeth Dole introduced legislation today that begins the process of providing the Perquimans River with federal protection. The Perquimans River Wild and Scenic Study Act of 2007 would authorize the National Park Service (NPS) to study the Perquimans River and its tributaries to determine if the waterway qualifies for Wild and Scenic designation. The designation would not affect private property rights or re-zone any land around the river.  
   "As North Carolina continues to see unprecedented growth, it is vital we work to preserve our natural resources," Burr added. "This legislation is the first step to ensuring future generations enjoy the Perquimans River just as we do today." 
   "The Perquimans River is a North Carolina treasure that should be protected," said Dole. "I am pleased to join efforts with Richard Burr to ensure that the river's natural beauty and resources are preserved." 
   The Perquimans River is a tidal estuary based entirely in Perquimans County. The thirty mile, slow-moving river is widely known for its beauty and is an important tourist attraction for the area. Once the National Park Service submits the results of the study to Congress, further legislation will be needed to complete the designation process.
