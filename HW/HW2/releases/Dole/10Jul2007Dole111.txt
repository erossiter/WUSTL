SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today issued the following statement:  
   "Six months ago, after hearing testimony from our commanders in the field, I supported a strategy set forth by General Patraeus that called for an additional 28,500 U.S. troops in Iraq to provide security and restore order, particularly in and around Baghdad and Al Anbar province. The objective was to go on the offensive against insurgents and to provide the Iraqi government a chance to meet political, legislative and security benchmarks that are critical to establishing stability and peace. 
   "The troop surge was completed just a couple weeks ago, so it is too early to declare the ultimate success or failure of this strategy. That said, preliminary details about the administration's interim report on Iraq, due on July 15, indicate that the Iraqi government has failed to meet these benchmarks. 
   "Simply put, our troops have been doing a great job, but the Iraqi government has not. Our commitment in Iraq is not indefinite, nor should the Iraqi government perceive it to be. It is my firm hope and belief that we can start bringing our troops home in 2008." 
   This week the Senate began consideration of a bill to authorize fiscal year 2008 defense spending, which includes funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A number of amendments dealing with strategy in Iraq are expected. Dole continues to oppose proposals that would cut off funding to U.S. troops or set date-specific timelines for withdrawal.
