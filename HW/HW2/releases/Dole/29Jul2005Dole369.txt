SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS NATIONAL SEX OFFENDER PUBLIC DATABASE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole Thursday evening supported Senate passage of the National Sex Offender Public Database Act of 2005.  
 The legislation will provide information to be available on the Internet about sexually violent predators and those convicted of sexually violent or criminal offenses to a minor. It will also allow registry users to identify offenders living nearby. Dole was a cosponsor of the amendment that provided the final text to the legislation. 
   "Every day on the news, we hear heartbreaking stories about children who are taken from their families and harmed by predators," said Dole. "The safety of our children should be our highest priority, and I was pleased to cosponsor this legislation. It is my fervent hope that we can prevent more of these tragic crimes." 
   According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the average sex offender will molest 117 children over their lifetime. Information about offenders on the registry will include name, address, date of birth, physical description, photograph, the nature and date of the offense, and the date of the person's release from prison or parole.
