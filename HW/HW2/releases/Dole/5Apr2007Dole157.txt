SEN. DOLE PRESSES NAVY ON LANDING FIELD PLANS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today submitted questions to the Secretary of the Navy, raising many concerns about the Navy's proposed outlying landing field in eastern North Carolina.  
   "I will be paying very close attention to how the Navy addresses my questions, as well as the numerous concerns raised by other North Carolinians during the public comment period," said Dole. "I will carefully evaluate how the Navy responds to these serious and legitimate concerns as I make my conclusions about this long-standing issue. 
   "I understand that our pilots need an OLF to practice night-time landings in a realistic setting. While I support building an OLF in North Carolina, it is essential that the Navy locate an OLF at a site that is both acceptable to North Carolinians and consistent with Navy pilots' training requirements." 
   In her questions, Dole pressed the Navy on issues that include: 
   * Potential bird mitigation methods 
   * The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director's recent testimony about the Washington and Beaufort Counties site 
   * The feasibility of resolving bombing range restrictions and other conflicts at Open Grounds Farm 
   * The viability of other potential North Carolina OLF sites 
   * The substantial acreage the Navy has stated it needs, and may seize through eminent domain, for an eastern North Carolina OLF 
   * The Navy's ranking of all eastern North Carolina OLF sites, from most to least preferred 
   * How the concerns of North Carolinians are factoring into the Navy's decision-making 
   Dole requested that the Navy provide written responses to the questions as soon as possible before the end of the comment period. 
   Background 
  During the ongoing public comment period, Dole has continued her strongest efforts to facilitate a fair, open, and honest dialogue between North Carolinians and the Navy. At her request, the Navy agreed to hold an additional public hearing in Charlotte on April 17, 2007. Dole's staff has attended each public hearing in its entirety and reported back to her on the issues that were raised. 
   Over the last four years, Dole has made it a top priority to ensure that North Carolinians' voices are heard at the highest levels of the Navy, including setting up meetings for local officials and other constituents with then-acting Secretary of the Navy Hansford Johnson in September 2003, and Assistant Secretary for the Navy for Installations and Environment, B.J. Penn, in September 2006. Dole has repeatedly conveyed constituents' specific concerns to the Navy through personal phone calls and letters. In addition, she has brought every alternative location suggested by constituents to the Navy's attention, and has personally met on a number of occasions with concerned North Carolinians both in the state and in Washington, D.C.
