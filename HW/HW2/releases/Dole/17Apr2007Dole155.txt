SEN. DOLE: 'CHECK POLITICS AT THE DOOR' AT MEETING ON IRAQ
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding tomorrow's meeting on Iraq between Democratic leaders and President Bush: 
   "President Bush and the Democrat leadership have an opportunity to rise above the partisan bickering over Iraq at their meeting tomorrow. As a Senator who represents thousands of men and women in harm's way, I call on both sides to check the politics at the door and find common ground in order to expedite the funding of our troops' needs and to send a bi-partisan message of support that they deserve. "
