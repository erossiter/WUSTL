SEN. DOLE VOTES TO SUPPORT MILITARY, WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today voted in support of the Iraq-Afghanistan Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act.  
 The legislation passed the Senate 99-0. 
   "I am proud to support our troops, many of whom are based right here in North Carolina. They must have the best equipment, the best training, and the highest morale when called into harm's way," said Senator Dole. "This emergency funding is critical to protecting our service men and women as they complete their missions and to helping promote democracy around the world." 
   The bill also included an amendment cosponsored by Senator Dole to ensure that the C-130J Multi-Year contract is not terminated. All active duty modernization plans at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina would be eliminated by canceling the contract. 
   "I do not believe that termination of the C-130J contract is in the best interest of our national defense, nor in the best interest of our taxpayers," said Senator Dole, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "The C-130J is proving its worth in the fight." 
   The Fiscal Year 2005 supplemental appropriations bill also includes amendments to address other needs around the world. Senator Dole cosponsored an amendment that reconfirms that genocide has been committed in the Darfur region of Sudan and provides the tools and policies necessary to confront this urgent humanitarian crisis. She also cosponsored amendments to provide additional hunger aid to Africa and to provide emergency humanitarian assistance for Haiti, which in the past year has faced devastating landslides and political unrest.
