SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. DOLE'S LEGISLATION TO REFORM OVERSIGHT OF FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC
  The Senate Banking Committee today approved legislation introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Dole and her colleagues Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and John Sununu (R-NH) that would improve oversight of Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE). The bill, the Federal Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act (S. 190), must now be considered by the full Senate.  
   "It is of the utmost importance that we enact legislation this year to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operate under an effective, world-class regulator," said Dole. "This bill sends a strong message to those employees at Fannie and Freddie who have cooked the books at these important institutions. 
   "It is unacceptable that such entities - that were designed with the sole purpose of lowering the cost of homeownership through a liquid secondary mortgage market - had become grossly mismanaged and must restate earnings. Why should these financial institutions, with debts that rival the federal government, have any less regulation than a bank? We cannot accept having a regulator that was intentionally made to be weak when the stakes are so high for the American people and our economy," Dole added. 
   The legislation would: 
   * Create an independent world class regulator to oversee the safety and soundness of the housing enterprises; 
   * Give the new regulator the authority to close down a failing GSE and protect against a taxpayer bailout; 
   * Give the new regulator greater discretion in raising capital standards to prevent insolvency; 
   * Give the new regulator approval power over new programs and activities proposed by a GSE; 
   * Require the annual audits of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing programs to ensure that these programs support the enterprises' affordable housing mission; 
   * End presidential appointments to the board of directors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and require all Federal Home Loan Bank directors to be elected. 
   Additional Background 
   On September 17, 2004, Fannie and Freddie's regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, released a report that, among other things, charged that through improper derivatives accounting, Fannie Mae manipulated earnings to hide volatility (as Freddie acknowledged in 2003) and to reach bonus targets for executives. Fannie Mae denied this but did not file third quarter earnings in November. On December 15, 2004, the SEC released its findings with regard to only the underlying accounting questions. The SEC also determined that Fannie Mae violated underlying accounting questions. It determined that Fannie Mae violated underlying accounting rules and must restate its earnings for the last four years. This will force Fannie to recognize an estimated $11 billion of losses on derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks. 
   This legislation (S. 1508) was first introduced in 2003 by Senators Dole, Hagel and Sununu. Their bill served as the vehicle for GSE reform legislation passed last year by the Senate Banking Committee. The Senate did not act on the Committee-passed legislation last Congress.
