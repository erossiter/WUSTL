SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $400,000 FOR HOMELESS VETERANS IN DURHAM
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs will grant $400,000 to Healing With CAARE, Inc. in Durham. Funding will be used to purchase and renovate a building to house a shelter and service center for veterans. 
   "Our veterans have made enormous sacrifices to defend our freedoms," said Senator Dole. "We have a profound responsibility to support those who have served, particularly those who need our help most. I applaud Healing with CAARE for securing these funds to assist homeless veterans in the Durham community." 
   The Durham shelter will provide 20 beds for transitional housing for veterans.
