SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS RENEWED SANCTIONS AGAINST BURMA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today supported a resolution calling for a renewal of sanctions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. The Senate voted 97 to 1 in favor of renewing sanctions.  
   "We must continue to send a strong message to those who repress freedom and violate human rights in Burma," said Senator Dole. "Renewing sanctions will demonstrate our solidarity with the Burmese people and will effectively pave the way for democracy and religious freedom." 
   Although the National League for Democracy is the legitimately elected political leadership in Burma, the state is ruled by a military regime, the State Peace and Development Council. This military junta continues to violate human rights in Burma through their methods of murder, torture, rape, forced relocation, forced labor, and conscription of child soldiers. In addition, there are more than 1,300 prisoners of conscience currently detained for supporting democracy, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy. 
   The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act became public law on July 28, 2003, and the renewal of sanctions became public law on July 2, 2004. The current sanctions will expire this month if this legislation is not enacted. 
   The sanctions against Burma primarily affect imports of textiles and garments. Additionally, the act freezes Burmese assets in the United States and requires the United States to oppose aid to Burma by international financial institutions. The act also recognizes the National League of Democracy as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people. 
   Background 
   Dole is a co-sponsor of the original Senate version of this legislation (S. 1182) as well as the Senate versions of resolutions to renew sanctions in 2004 and 2005.
