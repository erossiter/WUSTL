SEN. DOLE CONDEMNS ISSUING DRIVER'S LICENSES TO ILLEGAL ALIENS
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole joined Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) and 14 of her other colleagues to introduce a Senate resolution that makes it the official position of the Senate that states that issue driver's licenses or other government identification to illegal aliens are disrespecting and disregarding immigration laws. The measure also states that these actions present risks for national security and election fraud. 
   "Issuing driver's licenses to people who came to this country illegally only fuels the fire that the United States government is not really serious about securing our borders and enforcing immigration laws," said Dole. "Not only does giving an illegal alien a driver's license reward illegal behavior, it is a risky practice that has dangerous ramifications for the soundness of our elections and the security of our nation."
   According to a Rasmussen Reports poll released this week, 77 percent of Americans are opposed to making driver's licenses available to people who are illegally in the United States. Recently, New York announced a plan to issue driver's licenses to illegal aliens, which has spurred widespread opposition throughout the country. Currently Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington issue driver's licenses to illegal aliens.
