SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOLE RESOLUTION HONORING OUR VETERANS
  The Senate approved a resolution this week introduced by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole that honors our nation's veterans. 
   "The brave men and women of our armed forces make enormous sacrifices to defend our freedoms, and we have a profound responsibility to show our gratitude and respect for those who wear or have worn the uniform of the United States," said Dole. "On Veterans Day, and every day, let us honor those who have served this country and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice."
   North Carolina is home to nearly 800,000 veterans, and more than 120,000 service members are stationed at the state's military installations.
   Below is an excerpt from Dole's resolution:
   Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the Senate
   (1) encourages Americans to demonstrate their support for veterans on Veterans Day each year by treating that day as a special day of reflection; and
   (2) encourages schools and teachers to educate students on the great contributions veterans have made to the country and its history, both while serving as members of the United States Armed Forces and after completing their service.
