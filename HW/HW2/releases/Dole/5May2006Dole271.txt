SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AUTHORIZES NATIONAL DEFENSE BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which she is a member, has approved the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2007. Sen. Dole successfully worked to include significant funding for North Carolina in the bill, including more than $720 million for military construction projects, nearly double the 2006 amount. The bill also authorizes more than $54 million for defense industry research and development in the state, including several partnerships with North Carolina universities for defense research.
   Additionally, Senator Dole championed more than $2.6 billion for the purchase and improvement of Marine Corps and Air Force aircraft with a significant presence North Carolina. She also succeeded in helping to increase the endstrength numbers of the Army and Marine Corps, while supporting total endstrength and force structure of the National Guard. 
   "North Carolina's military installations and our National Guard play critical roles in our national defense," said Senator Dole. "The funding authorized in this bill for North Carolina further advances our position as a leading military state by providing for construction at our bases, assisting the defense industry in our state, and most importantly, supporting our service members and their families."
   The bill also includes $17 million for efforts to treat post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), and funds other mental health initiatives, including a pilot program started at Ft. Bragg to provide early diagnosis and treatment of PTSD.
   "It must be a priority to diagnose and treat service members and veterans who suffer from the psychological traumas of war and help them lead healthy, productive lives," said Senator Dole. "This care is crucial in helping people through the demands of the on-going Global War on Terror."
   In addition, the measure authorizes $2.1 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Fund to facilitate the rapid development of new technology and tactics to defeat IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   "IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan are a real and daily concern to many service members and their families," said Senator Dole. "We must continue to do everything we can to stop their use by insurgents."
   Senator Dole also pushed for the inclusion of $5 million for the Citizen Solider support program, which is spearheaded by the University of North Carolina and is the only program in the nation that solely focuses on the needs of military families.
   The Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2007 is expected to be considered by the full Senate in the coming months. Once passed by the Senate, the legislation must be reconciled with the version passed by the House of Representatives, and then approved by both chambers and signed into law by the president.
