SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $1.2 MILLION LOAN FOR COLLETTSVILLE VOLUNTEER FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will loan $1,200,000 to Collettsville Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department.  
 The funding will go to the construction of a new fire station. 
   "I applaud Collettsville Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department for securing this significant funding," said Senator Dole. "Our first responders are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. It is so important that they have adequate facilities and equipment so that they can safely do their jobs and protect the communities they serve." 
   According to USDA, the new station will have offices, a training area, conference room and a satellite sheriff's office. FEMA mandated that Collettsville obtain a new fire station equipped with a standby generator to provide shelter in the event of another natural disaster in the area. The new station will also improve the response time of the fire department in the mountainous area.
