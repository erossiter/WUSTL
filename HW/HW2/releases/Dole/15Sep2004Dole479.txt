SEN. DOLE HELPS SECURE RELIEF MONEY FOR NORTH CAROLINA CROP DAMAGES
  With the strong support of Sen. Elizabeth Dole, the Senate passed a measure providing $2.9 billion in assistance for farm losses caused by hurricanes and other weather-related disasters, including drought, floods and freezes during the 2003 and 2004 crop years.  
 This amendment was included in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill and will directly benefit North Carolina.
   "North Carolina farmers are the backbone of our rural communities, and they've been hit especially hard by hurricanes and other adverse weather disasters," said Dole. "This critical funding will go a long way in helping them recover from losses suffered by recent disasters but also dating back to Hurricane Isabel."
   Background
   * The dollar amount received by states will be based need, according to individual claims by farmers.
   * The amendment includes $2.5 billion for traditional row crops, fruits and vegetables, Christmas trees and nursery stock.
   * Also includes $475 million for livestock assistance.
   * Funding covers counties nationwide that have been declared disaster areas in 2003 or 2004.
   * Producers may receive emergency financial assistance for the 2003 or 2004 crop years, but not both.
