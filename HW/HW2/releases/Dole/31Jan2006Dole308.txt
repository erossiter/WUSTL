SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
 Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement on the passing of Coretta Scott King:  
   "I was saddened to hear of the passing of Coretta Scott King, and I extend deepest sympathies to her family and loved ones. 
   "When Congress debated legislation to make the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a national holiday, I had the privilege of sitting in the Senate gallery with Mrs. King, as my husband Bob served as the floor leader for that landmark legislation. I remember well her pride in seeing this tribute to her husband become a reality. 
   "Coretta Scott King gallantly kept alive the vision and the legacy of her husband - in the process establishing her own place in history as a great civil rights advocate. I encourage my fellow North Carolinians to join me in remembering Mrs. King, and may we continue her good works on behalf of all Americans."
