SEN. DOLE SEEKS FUNDING FOR HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today cosponsored an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Spending Bill to include funding for Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI) under the HUD Capacity Building Program.  
 Since the Capacity Building Program was established in 1998, HFHI has received funding that has helped affiliates with training and technical assistance and contributed to the construction of more than 4,600 homes. 
   "Habitat for Humanity and its volunteers provide an invaluable service to communities across America and the globe, partnering with families to uplift them from poverty and place them in decent homes," said Dole. "With so many families displaced and significant rebuilding needed in the Gulf Coast states, it is more important than ever to support Habitat for Humanity's good works." 
   Under the Capacity Building Program, 583 Habitat for Humanity affiliates have received funding, and direct grants have increased home production by an average of 42 percent. In 2004, 17 North Carolina affiliates received more than $1.3 million in capacity building grants, more than any other state. 
   The House of Representatives on June 30, 2005 passed its version of the TTHUD appropriations bill, which included HFHI under the HUD Capacity Building Program.
