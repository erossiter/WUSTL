SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $3.5 MILLION FOR FLOOD PREVENTION IN HYDE, CARTERET COUNTIES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will grant $2,212,223 to Hyde County and $1,339,580 to Carteret County as part of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Funds will be used to elevate homes above the base flood elevation in order to reduce or prevent future flood losses.  
   "I applaud Hyde and Carteret Counties for securing these funds to prevent future risk to the community," said Senator Dole. "During my time at the American Red Cross, I saw first hand that mitigation not only prevents or greatly minimizes damage, mitigation also saves lives." 
   According to FEMA, 37 homes in Hyde County and 19 homes in Carteret County will benefit from this program to eliminate repetitive flood damage to dwellings. Residents in these counties suffered severe flood damage during Hurricane Isabel in September 2003. 
   FEMA's share covers approximately 75 percent of the projects' total cost. 
   Background: 
   Senator Dole cosponsored legislation in 2005 to reauthorize the national flood insurance program, which doubled the amount of funding to FEMA for mitigation to $40 million. 
   When Senator Dole was head of the American Red Cross, the agency took a leadership role and worked as a full partner in FEMA's efforts to develop and implement a National Mitigation Strategy and cosponsored FEMA's Biennial National Mitigation Conferences.
