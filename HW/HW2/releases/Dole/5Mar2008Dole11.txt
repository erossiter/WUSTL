SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR INCREASED FUNDING TO ADDRESS SOCIAL SECURITY BACKLOGS, DELAYS
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, along with more than 40 other senators, have called on the Senate Budget Committee to include additional funding in the budget for reducing backlogs and long delays in reviewing applications for Social Security disability benefits.  
   Dole and her colleagues are advocating for $350 million more than the president's budget request of $10.327 billion for administrative expenses within the Social Security Administration (SSA). The funding also would support a review program aimed at ensuring that only qualified individuals receive benefits. 
   "Far too many North Carolinians applying for and appealing denials of Social Security disability benefits must wait an extraordinary long time," said Dole. "Individuals who are ultimately granted benefits often suffer substantial financial, emotional and even physical hardships during a delay. We have a duty to expeditiously meet the needs of individuals who have disabilities and are dependent on Social Security benefits, and this ongoing problem with delays must be resolved." 
   In a letter to Sens. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, Dole and her colleagues wrote that many applicants to the Social Security Disability Insurance program and the disability portion of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program sometimes must wait more than three years before they receive benefits. 
   With regard to appealed claims, as of January 2008, nearly 751,000 appeal cases are awaiting a hearing, compared to 312,000 cases at the beginning of fiscal year 2000. 
   Dole and her colleagues also recommended allocating funds for Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) and SSI redeterminations to ensure that only qualified individuals receive benefits. These reviews would save an estimated $10 for each dollar spent.
