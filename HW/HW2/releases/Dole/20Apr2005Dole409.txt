SEN. DOLE AMENDMENT SUPPORTING C-130 PROGRAM PASSES SENATE
  An amendment cosponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Dole was approved unanimously by the U.S. Senate today.  
 The amendment to the Fiscal Year 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill would ensure that the C-130J Multi-Year contract is not terminated. 
   "I do not believe that termination of the C-130J contract is in the best interest of our national defense, nor in the best interest of our taxpayers," said Senator Dole, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "The C-130J is proving its worth in the fight." 
   The Air Force recently grounded or severely restricted the flying of 90 C-130 E-models due to old age, of which 84 are assigned to the active duty Air Force. Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina operates some of the oldest C-130s in the active duty Air Force inventory. All active duty modernization plans for units at Pope AFB (NC) and Little Rock AFB (AR) would be eliminated by canceling the program. 
   It is estimated that the termination decision was a fiscal one made without the benefit of military analysis in advance of the Department's own Mobility Capability Study and Quadrennial Defense Reviews that are scheduled for completion in 2005, and saves no money in FY06. The combination of paying early termination costs to the contractor for breeching a multiyear contract plus other related costs could be in the neighborhood of $1 billion.
