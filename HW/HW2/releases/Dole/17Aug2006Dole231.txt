SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR IMMIGRATION COURT IN NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole wrote to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, encouraging the Department of Justice to establish a new immigration court in Charlotte. 
   "The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that North Carolina's illegal population is the eighth-largest in the country at 300,000," wrote Dole to Gonzales. "An immigration court located in North Carolina will have a positive impact on the U.S. government's ability to process and adjudicate immigration violations within the region."
   "While a number of states are undoubtedly experiencing illegal immigration crises, no other state presently, without an immigration court is, in my view, as adversely affected as North Carolina," wrote Dole. "I am confident that your review of the evidence will lead you to the same conclusion."
   According to a Pew Hispanic Center report, of the 14 states with the largest illegal immigrant populations, North Carolina is the only one without an immigration court. North Carolina cases must be processed through the court in Atlanta.
   "Congresswoman Sue Myrick also has been a strong advocate for establishing an immigration court in our state, and we will continue to work together as the site selection process moves forward," said Dole. "North Carolina must have the resources to deal with those who break our immigration laws."
