SEN. DOLE COMMENTS ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today issued the following statement regarding the Senate Judiciary Committee's approval of the nominations of Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown to the federal bench. Dole also commented on the nomination of Terrence Boyle of North Carolina.  
   It is a great first step that these women were voted out of Committee. I commend the Committee for its swift action, and it is now time for these qualified women to receive an up or down vote on the Senate Floor. 
   It is a fact that these nominees have been rated qualified and well-qualified by the American Bar Association and each has a majority of support in the United States Senate. 
   It is a fact that today-for the first time in our nation's history-a President's nominees to the federal bench are being required to receive a 60-vote supermajority, rather than the traditional majority vote that has been the standard for 220 years. 
   And it is also a fact that the ongoing filibuster of the President's nominees has prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent to the appointment of the men and women chosen to sit on our nation's highest courts. 
   Unfortunately a system that has been in place for every President throughout history has been changed. Now judicial nominees must pass an unprecedented liberal litmus test. This is simply wrong and it must stop. I call on my Democratic colleagues to put partisan politics aside and allow these women of impeccable character and qualifications to receive an up or down vote on the Senate Floor. 
   Judge Boyle has strong credentials and his nomination has been held up far too long. Judge Boyle has been waiting for more than a decade and deserves an up or down vote. I hope the Committee will quit stalling and move forward on his nomination.
