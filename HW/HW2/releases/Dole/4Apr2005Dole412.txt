SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $1.5 MILLION LOAN FOR PITT COUNTY COUNCIL ON AGING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will provide a $1,510,000 loan to the Pitt County Council on Aging.  
 The funding will be used to build a new senior center. 
   "I am so pleased that the Pitt County Council on Aging has secured these funds," said Senator Dole. "As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am committed to serving the needs of our seniors, especially since North Carolina has experienced a tremendous increase in our senior population as many people have chosen our beautiful state as their place to retire." 
   The new 20,800 square-foot senior center will be a resource for wellness and social activities and will provide counseling and programs on maintaining good health, maximum function and quality of life.
