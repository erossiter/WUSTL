SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S REMARKS IN KERNERSVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today released the following statement: 
   "I was particularly pleased today to hear President Bush speak directly to the issue of training our workforce.  
 North Carolina continues to experience dramatic losses in employment, especially in the traditional industries of textile and furniture manufacturing. The national economy may be trending positively, but we must continue to focus special attention on the areas where folks have lost their jobs with U.S. companies that struggle to compete with foreign competitors that have dramatically lower cost structures. 
   "When I served as Secretary of Labor, I continuously spoke about the gap between skilled and unskilled workers. In the changing economic environment, this gap has widened, and there are fewer and fewer opportunities for lower skilled workers. We must do everything in our power to make sure that these folks don't fall through the cracks. We must focus greater attention on educating our less skilled workers so they can take advantage of the new jobs that are being created. To this end, I believe that we should take steps to improve Trade Adjustment Assistance and continue to make strengthening our community colleges a very top priority. Community colleges are a real beacon of hope, and I was pleased the president highlighted these important points during his remarks today."
