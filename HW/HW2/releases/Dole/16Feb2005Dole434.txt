SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES CLIMATE CONTROL LEGISLATION PACKAGE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today joined Sens. Hagel, Alexander, and Craig in introducing three bills to combat climate changes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The legislative package provides a broad approach to address climate control by combining international legislation, domestic legislation, and tax incentive legislation.  
   "We must make a united international effort to explore the implications and causes of global climate change," said Senator Dole. "I will continue to support policy solutions that address challenges in a broad manner. We need a market-driven, technology-based approach that will protect our economy while preserving our environment." 
   The Climate Change Technology Deployment in Developing Countries Act of 2005 
  This legislation will promote greenhouse gas reducing technologies in developing countries by: 
   * Provides the Secretary of State with new authority to coordinate assistance to developing countries by demonstrating technologies that reduce greenhouse gas intensities; 
  * Directs the U.S. trade Representative to identify and remove trade-related barriers to the export of U.S. greenhouse gas reducing technologies; 
  * The Departments of Energy and State will create a comprehensive list of all technologies that could aid developing countries in lowering emissions and will coordinate with Departments of Commerce and State will develop exchange programs between developing countries' regulators and American experts; 
  * Directs the department of state to coordinate between several international organizations to assist developing countries specifically for projects that reduce greenhouse gas intensity. 
   The Climate Change Technology Deployment Act of 2005 
   This legislation will promote adoption of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas intensity domestically by providing financial assistance for projects that use advanced energy technologies. 
   * Provides credit-based financial assistance and investment protection for projects that utilize advanced energy technologies; 
  * Directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a national strategy on climate change; 
  * Creates a Climate Coordinating Committee that will carry out the national strategy and oversee the Climate Credit Board, which will approve projects and provide financial assistance to projects that promote the reduction of green house gas intensity. 
   The Climate Change Technology Tax Incentives Act of 2005 
   This legislation will authorize $2 billion over five years in tax credits supporting technologies that reduce greenhouse gas intensity. 
   * Creates a new tax credit for investment in projects that reduce green house gas intensity and will direct the Secretary of Commerce to create a new Advisory Board that will approve projects; 
  * Expresses support for making the current research and development tax credit, which will expire on December 31, 2005, permanent. 
   Additional Information 
   * Greenhouse gas intensity is the best measurement of how efficiently a nation uses carbon emitting fuels and technology in producing goods and services. It is the link between energy efficiency, economic development and the environment. 
  * Some examples of the technology promoted by the legislation include renewable energy projects, lower emission transportation, advanced nuclear power projects, coal gasification and liquefaction, carbon sequestration, co-generation technology initiatives, and energy efficiency enhancements. 
  * This legislation is based on incentives and economic growth, rather than the mandatory caps often proposed on carbon emissions. 
  * Legislation will cost $4 billion over five years.
