SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $100,000 FOR EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA METABOLIC INSTITUTE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which included $100,000 for the Eastern North Carolina Metabolic Institute at East Carolina University. The center is a world leader in obesity and diabetes medical treatments and technology. 
   Dole worked to secure the funding, which will help plan a free-standing 230,000 square foot Metabolic Institute, develop an interim clinical research center, upgrade a diabetes clinic, refurbish several laboratories and support pilot studies and educational programs. 
   "I applaud the Institute for securing these resources to advance its study and treatment of diabetes and obesity," said Dole. "This is a serious public health problem, and I am proud to support the remarkable work being done at the Eastern North Carolina Metabolic Institute to treat these conditions and improve the lives of people in our state and beyond." 
   Note: The Senate version of this appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
