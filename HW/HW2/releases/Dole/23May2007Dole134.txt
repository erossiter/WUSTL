SEN. DOLE: MAKE ENGLISH OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole is cosponsoring an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 that would make English the national language of the United States. The amendment would prohibit the federal government from communicating or providing services in any language other than English.  
   "More than 322 different languages are spoken by people in this country, and it would be fiscally irresponsible and impractical for our government to provide services in all of these languages," said Dole. "Making English our national language will not only eliminate waste and duplication within our government, it will unite all Americans by providing a common form of communication. In addition, immigrants must be proficient in English to maximize their employment and economic opportunities in this country." 
   While Dole supports this amendment, she opposes the current immigration reform bill. 
   "I recognize that immigration reform is urgently needed, but I cannot support the current bill being considered in the Senate because it creates a new path to citizenship for those here illegally. While this bill includes some good measures - such as modifying the broken H-2A system for farmers to obtain legal workers - the amnesty this bill provides is a deal-breaker for me," she said.
