SEN. DOLE LAUDS SUPREME COURT DECISION UPHOLDING BAN ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded news that the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the federal ban on partial-birth abortion. Dole was an original cosponsor of the legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush on November 5, 2003.  
   "I am extremely pleased that the Supreme Court today upheld the federal ban on the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion," said Dole. "This decision is a significant step towards fostering a culture that respects life, and I will continue working for the day when all life is recognized as valuable." 
   Upon becoming law, the partial-birth abortion ban was immediately challenged in federal court and was deemed unconstitutional by the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision issued Wednesday, overturned these lower court rulings and upheld the constitutionality of the ban.
