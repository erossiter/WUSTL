ONSLOW COUNTY TO RECEIVE $800,500 GRANT FOR AIRPORT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that Onslow County will receive an $800,500 grant from the Federal Aviation Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.  
 The funds will be used to acquire a lift device for passengers with disabilities, to update the security system, and to purchase an aircraft rescue and fire-fighting vehicle. 
   "As a former Secretary of Transportation, I know how important it is for airports to have the proper infrastructure," said Senator Dole. "I applaud Onslow County for securing the funds to make their facility as safe and efficient as possible." 
   Additionally, funding will provide for the design of an air carrier apron expansion and the removal of an old maintenance building to create more usable space.
