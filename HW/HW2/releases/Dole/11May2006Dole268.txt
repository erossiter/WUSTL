SEN. DOLE EXPRESSES STRONG SUPPORT FOR JUDGE TERRENCE BOYLE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding the nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit: 
   "Judge Boyle is a distinguished judge and dedicated public servant, and he is eminently qualified to serve on the federal appellate court. I strongly support his nomination.
   "There is no doubt that these frivolous allegations have emerged at a strategically determined time, in a desperate partisan attempt to distract attention from the merits of Judge Boyle's nomination. Judge Boyle has an excellent reputation for fairness and integrity that will not be tarnished by this partisan politicking.
   "Judge Boyle deserves an up or down vote by the full Senate. His more than 20 year record as a judge has been thoroughly reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the American Bar Association, and the White House - and all have found him to be well qualified to serve as a federal appellate judge. Judge Boyle's experience, integrity, competence and temperament far exceed what is expected for an appellate nominee."
