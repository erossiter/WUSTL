SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $1.9 MILLION TO DARE COUNTY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that Dare County will receive $1.9 million to cover debris removal costs incurred from Hurricane Isabel in September 2003.  
 The funds are awarded by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
   "It is so important that our communities receive the proper assistance in the aftermath of hurricanes, not just for the short term but also for the long term," said Senator Dole. "Debris removal is a high priority following a storm, and it is a tedious and costly process. I am pleased that Dare County will receive this significant funding to cover that expense." 
   The monies will be awarded through the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. This funding represents the final costs associated with debris removal operations that were a result of Hurricane Isabel. Severe winds and flooding left fallen tree limbs, remnants of destroyed homes and other objects scattered along county roads and other public rights of way, making them impassable. 
   This reimbursement for emergency debris removal is made available through FEMA's Public Assistance program. According to FEMA, Dare County has already received a total of $885,021 in debris removal funding. This additional award brings the total to $2.9 million.
