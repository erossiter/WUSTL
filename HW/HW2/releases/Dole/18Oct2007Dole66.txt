SENS. DOLE, BURR ANNOUNCE $150,000 FOR CRIME LAB EQUIPMENT
  U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act, which included $150,000 to purchase equipment for a crime lab that will serve Iredell, Yadkin, Catawba, Rowan, Cabarrus and Wilkes Counties. Dole and Burr worked to secure these funds, which would be used to help law enforcement officials conduct ballistics tests and track criminals.  
   "I applaud the Iredell County Sheriff's Office for securing this significant funding," said Dole. "Our law enforcement officials are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. We should do everything we can to help provide the tools they need to solve crimes and keep our communities safe." 
   Note: The Senate version of the CJS appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
