SEN. DOLE ADVOCATES FOR $4.75 MILLION FOR CHARLOTTE LIGHT RAIL
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the inclusion of $4.75 million for the Charlotte Rapid Transit Extension for the Northeast Corridor in the conference report of the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Act. Dole worked to include this funding in the conference report, which must pass the House and Senate before going to the president for his signature.  
   "As a former Transportation Secretary, I appreciate that greater investment in transportation infrastructure translates into less traffic congestion, greater economic development and job creation," said Dole. "The Charlotte light rail project exemplifies how growing cities can meet transportation and urban development challenges and work towards a better future for residents." 
   "This is another positive step in our efforts to implement a regional rapid transit plan with the federal government as a partner," said Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory. "I want to extend a sincere thank you to Sen. Dole and to all our federal representatives from North Carolina who continue to support our vision to improve mobility choices in the Charlotte region." 
   According to the City of Charlotte, the Northeast Corridor Light Rail Project extends 14 miles from Center City Charlotte through the North Davidson and University areas to I-485 north of UNC-Charlotte. The dual track system will be considered an extension of the South Corridor, with 14 proposed stations. 
   Next Monday, Dole will participate in the ribbon cutting and first inaugural ride of the Charlotte Area Transit System's LYNX Blue Line, the first completed line of the rail system.
