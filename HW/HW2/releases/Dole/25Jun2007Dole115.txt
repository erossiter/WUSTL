SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS FUNDING FOR TEXTILE CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved her request for $9.5 million for U.S. Customs to oversee textile transshipments enforcement in the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security spending bill. This initiative helps support North Carolina textile jobs. 
   "I am very pleased that this bill contains critical funding for customs agents to monitor incoming textiles and enforce trade laws," said Dole, who has been a strong voice for the hard-hit textile industry and has advocated for tough trade enforcement. "North Carolina textile workers should not be on the losing end when countries such as China circumvent the rules."
   "Customs enforcement is the cornerstone of an effective textile program and this funding will help ensure that textiles remain a priority for the Department of Homeland Security," said Cass Johnson, President of the National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO). "NCTO greatly appreciates the efforts of Sen. Dole and her willingness to make textile enforcement a priority. We look forward to working with her to ensure that this funding is used in a meaningful and effective manner and on activities that prevent illegal goods from entering U.S. commerce."
   Background:
   Once approved by the Senate, this version of the Homeland Security appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. The final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
