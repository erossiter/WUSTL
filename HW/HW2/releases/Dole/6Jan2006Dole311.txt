SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1.3 MILLION FOR DARE COUNTY FLOOD PROTECTION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will grant $1,356,209 to North Carolina to elevate and protect 22 flood-prone residences in Dare County.  
   "It is critical that folks can defend themselves, their family and their property against flood losses and damage," said Dole. "During my time as president of the American Red Cross, I saw first hand that mitigation not only prevents or greatly minimizes damage, mitigation also saves lives." 
   According to FEMA, finished floors in the homes will be raised to one foot above the base flood elevation and the foundations of each home will be rebuilt according to the North Carolina state residential building code. 
   This FEMA grant will pay for 75 percent of the project's total $1,808,279 cost. State and local funds will cover the balance. 
   Background 
   Senator Dole cosponsored legislation in 2005 to reauthorize the national flood insurance program, which doubled the amount of funding to FEMA for mitigation to $40 million. 
   When Senator Dole was head of the American Red Cross, the agency took a leadership role and worked as a full partner in FEMA's efforts to develop and implement a National Mitigation Strategy and cosponsored FEMA's Biennial National Mitigation Conferences.
