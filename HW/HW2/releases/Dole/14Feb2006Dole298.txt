SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF FRANK WHITNEY TO FEDERAL JUDGESHIP
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the nomination of Frank Whitney to fill the vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. Dole, along with Sen. Richard Burr, recommended Whitney to President Bush.  
   "Frank Whitney would serve with distinction as a member of the federal judiciary in North Carolina," said Senator Dole. "He possesses a passionate sense for justice and has extensive legal and public service experience, serving for more than a decade as a federal prosecutor. 
   "I was honored to recommend Frank Whitney and am very pleased with his nomination. Over the last several years under Frank's able leadership, the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of North Carolina has developed a strong reputation as a leader in fighting against public corruption. Additionally the office has worked to make our state safer by increasing prosecutions for violent crimes by 259 percent. 
   "I congratulate Frank on this well deserved nomination, and I will work with my colleagues to swiftly move his nomination through the Senate confirmation process." 
   Whitney currently serves as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina and has devoted nearly his entire legal career to public service. He has built an impressive record as a civil attorney and criminal prosecutor in North Carolina, which led to his appointments as Assistant U.S. Attorney and U.S. Attorney in North Carolina's largest judicial district. He serves as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves and has worked as an intelligence officer and a judge advocate. Whitney graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wake Forest University, received his Masters of Business Administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and graduated with honors from the UNC School of Law.
