SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON VIEWING IRAQI DETAINEE PHOTOS
  Statement From Senator Dole on Viewing Iraqi Detainee Photos
   "The pictures that I viewed today were absolutely horrendous.  
 I am extremely disappointed that any American, and especially one in uniform, would mistreat or humiliate another human being and commit such atrocious acts. But I want to make clear that the acts depicted in these photographs do not in any way represent the values of the United States or her Armed Forces. 
   "The Armed Services Committee on which I serve is focusing on the root causes behind these instances of prisoner abuse and will continue to do everything within its power to ensure that such abuse never happens again. 
   "Regarding the unrestricted release of the photos, transparency is of the utmost importance to our nation's credibility and security - but we must not jeopardize the security of our men and women carrying out their mission in Iraq or undermine the judicial proceedings underway." -Senator Elizabeth Dole
