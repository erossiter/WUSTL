SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, joined by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), today introduced the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Reform Act to improve the program to meet the needs of today's workers. The legislation would expand TAA eligibility to displaced workers whose jobs are moved to a nation with no preferential trade agreement with the United States. In addition, the bill would provide automatic TAA eligibility for displaced textile and apparel employees. 
   The TAA Program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, provides aid to workers whose employment is adversely affected by offshore competition for the purpose of helping them prepare for and secure new employment. Eligible workers can receive training, job search and relocation allowances, income support and other reemployment services.  
   "In recent years, the forces of the global marketplace have triggered an economic transformation in North Carolina, and many of the new jobs being created require a more skilled labor force," said Dole. "TAA is critical to ensuring that displaced workers have the opportunity to train for new careers and that they don't slip through the cracks. Since my time as Secretary of Labor, I have championed the TAA program, and my strong support continues today." 
   "With Sens. Dole and Cantwell introducing this bill in the Senate, I think we are gaining some real momentum in our effort to improve the TAA program for our workers," said Rep. Robin Hayes (N.C.-08), who introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives earlier this year. "We expanded TAA a few years ago, and the new benefits have helped workers successfully reenter the workforce. But with the emergence of Asia, especially China, TAA needs to be updated to meet the emerging needs of American workers. This bill is aggressive, but I think it's what we need. 
   "I appreciate Sen. Dole and Sen. Cantwell for their support and their efforts in pushing this in the Senate. I believe TAA will be reformed in this Congress, and I believe this push on both sides of the Capitol will ultimately benefit our workers." 
   "In the past five years, North Carolina has been hurt by manufacturing layoffs more than any other state, and we have had the most demand for Trade Adjustment Assistance," said Billy Ray Hall, president of the N.C. Rural Economic Development Center. "In May 2007 alone, North Carolina had more than 9,500 displaced workers participating in training, thanks to the TAA Program. This legislation will help more of our displaced workers find a new career path, retrain for a new job, keep food on the table for their families while going to school and conducting a job search, and ultimately thrive in a new job. This bill also streamlines the bureaucratic process so displaced workers are not delayed in obtaining services, and increases the chances of the family having health care coverage until they can become employed again." 
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act would enhance the TAA Program by: 
   * Allowing workers whose jobs relocate to countries without preferential trade agreements with the United States (such as China) to receive TAA benefits; 
   * Automatically qualifying all textile and apparel workers for TAA benefits in the event of layoffs or business closures; 
   * Increasing funds for training; 
   * Simplifying the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) application process and increasing the HCTC from 65 to 80 percent of a worker's health care insurance premium; and 
   * Doubling the TAA funding authorization from $220 million to $440 million.
