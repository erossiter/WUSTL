SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $165,927 FOR CONOVER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) will grant $165,927 for the Conover Fire Department. The funding will be used for operations and safety.  
   "I applaud the Conover Fire Department for securing this significant funding," said Senator Dole. "Our firefighters are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. It is so important that they have adequate facilities and equipment so that they can safely do their jobs and protect the communities they serve." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
