SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOLE'S 'GO DIRECT' RESOLUTION
  The Senate approved a resolution introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Dole that encourages Americans to sign up for direct deposit to receive their Social Security and other federal benefits.  
   "Direct deposit eliminates the risk of lost or stolen checks, prevents identity theft and fraud and saves taxpayer dollars," said Dole. "I encourage our seniors and all Americans to take advantage of direct deposit." 
   Issuing a federal benefit payment check costs the government 77 cents more than issuing an electronic payment. Since 1986, direct deposit has saved taxpayers $6 billion. If all benefit recipients used direct deposit, taxpayers would save $120 million a year. 
   "With 77 million baby boomers approaching retirement age starting in 2008, direct deposit becomes an even more important tool to save taxpayers' dollars," said Dole. 
   The Go Direct campaign is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks. 
   Background 
   People interested in signing up for Go Direct may call the toll-free helpline at 1-800-333-1795, go to www.GoDirect.org, or visit their local bank, credit union or Social Security office. Social Security number, bank routing number (found at the bottom of personal checks) and account number are required for signing up.
