   "My deepest sympathy and heartfelt prayers are with those who lost a relative or loved one in the terrible tragedy of September 11th. This five year anniversary is a time to mourn those lives that were lost and to remember that day that forever changed our nation.
   "The anniversary of those tragic attacks also serves as a somber reminder of the threat we continue to face today. The Administration and the Congress are making sound policy decisions and taking appropriate actions at home and abroad to defeat the terrorists. It is important to remember that in the five years since 9/11, we have not had another attack on our soil?but the danger remains. It is essential that we not let our guard down or take even one step backward. We must remain vigilant and stay on the offensive against the terrorists, and we must use all tools available to us in this fight against terror."
