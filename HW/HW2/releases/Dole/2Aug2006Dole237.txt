SENS. CLINTON, DOLE HAILS PASSAGE OF SENATE RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING ISRAEL'S MAGEN DAVID ADOM FOR ACHIEVING FULL MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS
  Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) today announced the unanimous passage of a Senate Resolution they introduced congratulating the Magen David Adom Society in Israel for achieving full membership in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Following 57 years of rejection, the International Red Cross Movement in May approved changes to its statute accepting a neutral emblem and included Israel's Magen David Adom in the International Red Cross. 
   "As Israel's Magen David Adom continues its tradition of heroic service, providing humanitarian assistance to all those in need of aid without bias, it is fitting that we recognize their important contribution. In the midst of today's crisis in the Middle East, the humanitarian work of MDA is more important than ever. MDA's inclusion in the International Red Cross has been one of my top priorities as a Senator and I am delighted the Senate unanimously approved this resolution," said Senator Clinton.
   "Magen David Adom has a long history of providing humanitarian assistance to all who need help, yet for too many years, discrimination and delay unfairly obstructed MDA's acceptance into the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement," said Dole. "I am pleased the entire Senate today joined Senator Clinton and me in congratulating this extraordinary organization for finally obtaining this long-overdue admittance into the Red Cross movement."
   Senators Clinton and Dole have been tireless advocates of Magen David Adom's inclusion in the International Red Cross. Last November, Senator Clinton visited MDA's offices in Jerusalem and was briefed about the important humanitarian work that they perform, both in Israel and the world. Senators Clinton and Dole also urged the Bush Administration to submit to the Senate the Third Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which provide a means by which Israel's Magen David Adom can join the International Red Cross.
