SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding the death of terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi: 
   "Thanks to the courage and resolve of coalition and Iraqi forces, today one of the world's most dangerous terrorists is a threat no more. The demise of Al-Zarqawi is a significant victory in the War on Terror and a milestone in the stabilization of Iraq.
   "I returned last week from Iraq, where I met with our troops - including Special Operating Forces from North Carolina involved in the hunt for Al-Zarqawi - who underscored how firmly they believe in their mission. And I met with Prime Minister Maliki, who expressed a strong commitment to rapidly building up Iraqi forces and his country's infrastructure. I applaud the prime minister for yesterday filling two critically important cabinet posts and completing the formation of the new Iraqi unity government.
   "While challenges remain, we are making real progress in Iraq, on the political, economic, and security fronts. The defeat of Al-Zarqawi sends a clear message to the terrorists that we will prevail."
