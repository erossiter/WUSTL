SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS TERRORISM INSURANCE EXTENSION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today applauded Senate approval of a two year extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA).  
 TRIA was enacted shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001 to create a government insurance backstop for business and consumer losses resulting from terrorist attacks. 
   "As we are all painfully aware, the events of September 11, 2001 brought about changes in many aspects of American life," said Dole. "Terrorist attacks, particularly large scale events such as those on 9/11, have significant impact on the ability of consumers and businesses to obtain the insurance coverage they need to provide security, economic growth, and job creation. In my eight years as president of the American Red Cross, I have seen time and again how a good plan of action, established in advance, can make a dramatic difference after a disaster." 
   Similar to the original legislation, this bill gradually places more responsibility on the insurance industry, lessening government involvement in insuring for terrorism risk. This extension will continue to increase the trigger for when the government will cover losses, thus ensuring that the private sector will continue to increase its ability to provide terrorism insurance. For example, an attack in 2005 costing $5 million will be covered by the federal terrorism insurance program; that minimum coverage level will be raised to $50 million in 2006 and $100 million in 2007. 
   Dole introduced S. 467, the Terrorism Insurance Extension Act with Senators Dodd, Bennett and seven other Banking Committee members in February of 2005.
