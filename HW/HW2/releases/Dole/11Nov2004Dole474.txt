SEN. DOLE HONORS VETERANS
  Statement from Sen. Elizabeth Dole 
   "Today we pay tribute to this nation's heroes - our veterans.  
 And we all know there are as many different definitions of 'veteran' as there are veterans themselves. There are veterans of war and veterans of peace. Combat veterans and non-combat veterans. Veterans who served on the seas, in the air, or on the ground. Veterans from the Cold War and veterans from the hot wars: the World Wars; Korea; Vietnam; Panama; Grenada and the Persian Gulf. And now veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, all are veterans. 
   And right now, our brave servicemen and women, like the veterans before them, are answering the call to protect our country. We must continue to support those who are fighting for our freedoms now. We have the best equipped, most capable, most courageous military force in the world. They are fighting a daily battle in a war we all know requires steadfast commitment, both in the theater of battle and here at home. 
   I am so proud to represent the thousands and thousands of military personnel and Veterans who call North Carolina home. It is a privilege indeed to serve those who have served, and those who continue to serve, their country so valiantly." 
   - Senator Elizabeth Dole
