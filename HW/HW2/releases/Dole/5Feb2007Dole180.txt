SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES BILL TO EXPAND CARL SANDBURG HOME NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today introduced legislation to authorize the expansion of the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site's boundary by an additional 115 acres. Dole introduced the bill after consulting with the site's superintendent and reviewing the site's management plan, which recommends the expansion. Sen. Richard Burr cosponsored the legislation.  
   Many citizens, local government officials and park officials have expressed concern that development around the site, which is located in the Village of Flat Rock, could negatively impact the historic nature of the 264 acre park that was the home of the late poet, Carl Sandburg. 
   "The Carl Sandburg Home has enriched the lives of many North Carolinians through its rich history, natural beauty and abundant educational opportunities," said Dole. "I am pleased to introduce this legislation so that future generations can enjoy the site for many years to come." 
   Of the 115 acres to be used in the expansion, up to five acres are needed for visitor parking and a visitor center, and the remaining acres are needed for boundary and scenic view protection. The proposed extension would be located west of Highway 225 and south of Little River Road. 
   Background 
   The expansion of the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site is supported by the Flat Rock Village Council, the Henderson County Board of Commissioners, the Greater Hendersonville Chamber of Commerce, and the Travel and Tourism Committee of Henderson County. The site's expansion also is supported by the North Carolina National Park, Parkway and Forests Development Council. 
   This legislation authorizes the expansion of the site's boundary and does not request federal funding.
