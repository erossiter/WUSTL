SEN. DOLE: TAX RELIEF CRITICAL TO CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today voted to extend tax relief for all Americans and prevent a huge tax hike that would have reversed the economic gains that have been made over the last five years. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was approved by the Senate in a 54-44 vote. 
   "Tax relief is working to spur investment and job creation, particularly for small businesses," said Dole. "Since August 2003, our economy has created nearly 5.3 million jobs, and the national unemployment rate is lower that the averages of the last four decades. Extending this tax relief is critical to keeping our economy growing strong.
   "We must continue to hold the line on spending, but hiking up taxes on the American people is not the answer to reducing the deficit. In fact, our strong economy is increasing government revenue - federal revenues for 2005 were the highest ever, totaling $2.15 trillion."
   The tax reconciliation bill extends provisions of the tax code that have expired or will soon expire, including expensing for equipment purchases by small businesses, relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains. The bill extends the 15 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends for two years through 2010.
   The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act was approved by the House of Representatives late yesterday and will now be sent to the president to be signed into law.
