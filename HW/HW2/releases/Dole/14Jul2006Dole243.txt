SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS FUNDING FOR TEXTILE CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
  Late yesterday the U.S. Senate passed the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Sen. Elizabeth Dole successfully advocated for the bill to include $9.5 million for U.S. Customs to oversee textile transshipments enforcement, which is critical to the North Carolina textile industry. 
   "I am very pleased that this bill contains critical funding for the hiring of additional customs agents to monitor incoming textiles and enforce trade laws," said Dole, who has been a strong voice for the hard-hit textile industry and has advocated for tough trade enforcement. "North Carolina textile workers should not be on the losing end when countries such as China circumvent the rules."
   Once approved by the Senate, this version of the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. The final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
