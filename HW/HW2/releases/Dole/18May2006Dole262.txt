SEN. DOLE PRESSES USDA ON DELAYED TOBACCO QUOTA BUYOUT PAYMENTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, joined by the entire North Carolina congressional delegation, today wrote to Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns, pressing for all remaining tobacco quota buyout payments to be issued as quickly as possible. Dole has been contacted by many North Carolinians who have experienced delays in receiving their payments. 
   Below are excerpts from the letter.
   According to the Farm Service Agency, payments to these participants have not been processed because their claims were disputed or contained errors. Many of these constituents contacted their local Farm Service Agency offices and were informed that glitches in the software prevented local offices from correcting the errors and resolving disputed claims.
   We understand that the Farm Service Agency operates on limited resources and assists farmers all over the United States, but it is unacceptable that the Farm Service Agency has not resolved this issue after several months of unfulfilled assurances.
   We ask that you work assiduously to ensure that this matter is fully addressed in a thorough and timely manner, and that all remaining claims are processed and payments are issued to those tobacco buyout participants who have waited so long for the payments they deserve.
