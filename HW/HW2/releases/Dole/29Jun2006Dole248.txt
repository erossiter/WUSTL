SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES $21 MILLION FOR PORT OF WILMINGTON
  Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Energy and Water spending bill for fiscal year 2007. Dole and Burr successfully advocated for the bill to include $21 million for the Port of Wilmington's construction and maintenance. 
   "The Port of Wilmington is an economic powerhouse for North Carolina, as I saw firsthand when I visited the facility earlier this month," said Dole. "It is critically important that we have a deep water port in our state, not only to generate economic opportunity, but also to support our state's thriving defense community."
   "I am pleased the Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the importance of these funds to the Port of Wilmington and North Carolina," Burr said. "The Port of Wilmington generates economic growth and development for the entire state and these funds will enable the Port to continue in its prosperity."
   The Energy and Water Appropriations bill includes $11 million for operations and maintenance and $10 million for general construction at the Port of Wilmington.
   NOTE: Once approved by the Senate, this version of the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
