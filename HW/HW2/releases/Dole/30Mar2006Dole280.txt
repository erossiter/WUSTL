  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today accepted Sen. Barbara Mikulski's wager on the outcome of Sunday's University of North Carolina Tar Heels and University of Maryland Terrapins Women's NCAA Final Four basketball game. Below is Dole's response: 
   March 30, 2006
   Dear Senator Mikulski,
   I accept your challenge and predict the Lady Tar Heels will be triumphant in what is sure to be another classic ACC contest.
   I am of course proud that my home state has not just one, but two outstanding programs in this year's Final Four. I look forward to enjoying those famous Maryland crab cakes as the Tar Heels and Duke Blue Devils play for the women's national championship.
