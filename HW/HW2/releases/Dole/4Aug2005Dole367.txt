SEN. DOLE URGES FREEDOM, ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT IN IRAN
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole has cosponsored the Iran Freedom Support Act of 2005, which supports a transition to democracy in Iran and an end to Iran's weapons of mass destruction programs.  
 The legislation also holds the current Iranian government accountable for its threatening behavior. The legislation has been referred to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, where it awaits further consideration. 
   "The recent terror attacks in London are a far too violent reminder that we are still very much fighting the War on Terror," said Senator Dole. "Iran continues to support terrorists and persist in developing weapons of mass destruction. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to condemn those countries that pose a very real threat to our security." 
   The legislation includes provisions that would increase U.S. sanctions contained in the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA), including the removal of a sunset provision, making exports to Iran of WMD-related technology a sanctionable activity and raising the threshold for the President to waive ILSA's provisions or terminate its application. The bill also recommends the appointment of a policy coordinator in the Bush Administration for Iranian affairs and provides $10 million in aid for pro-democracy groups in Iran. 
   For more than 20 years, the United States has sought to contain the threat posed by Iran's weapons of mass destruction programs. The Iranian government continues its efforts to enrich uranium, develop nuclear weapons, ballistic missile systems, and support terrorist organizations.
