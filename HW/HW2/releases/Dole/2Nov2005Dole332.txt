SEN. DOLE TO SUPPORT BEN BERNANKE AS FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, today said she will support Ben Bernanke to be Federal Reserve Chairman.  
 Dole met with Bernanke in her Washington office and afterwards made the following statement: 
   "Ben Bernanke comes with strong credentials and I believe he will do a fine job in the capacity of Federal Reserve Chairman. We discussed a number of issues today including the difficult economic transition that continues in North Carolina with the loss of our traditional manufacturing base, as well as the growing gap between skilled and unskilled workers. This skill gap is something I spoke about during my confirmation as Labor Secretary and these challenges continue today. 
   "I emphasized to Mr. Bernanke my strong support for efforts to teach workers new skills and have more opportunities. For example, community colleges play a vital role in these efforts. I also emphasized my concerns with China's currency manipulation and the weakness of their banking system. Mr. Bernanke was very clear and thoughtful on these issues, and I came away from our meeting extremely impressed. Mr. Bernanke can count on my strong support."
