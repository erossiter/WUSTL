PRESIDENT TO RE-NOMINATE JUDGE BOYLE TO FOURTH CIRCUIT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the announcement by President Bush that he will re-nominate Judge Terrence Boyle to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
   "I am pleased that President Bush will re-nominate Judge Boyle," said Dole. "Terry Boyle has impeccable qualifications, sterling character and a distinguished record of public service. I will continue to work with the Senate Leadership as well as my other colleagues in an effort to move this nomination forward - it is important for our state and our nation that Judge Boyle be confirmed."
   Background
   Under Senate rules, when the Senate adjourns for more than 30 days, all nominations are returned to the president, unless a unanimous consent agreement is reached to override this rule. Prior to the Senate adjourning for the month of August, the Senate Judiciary Committee returned several judicial nominations, including that of Boyle, back to President Bush.
