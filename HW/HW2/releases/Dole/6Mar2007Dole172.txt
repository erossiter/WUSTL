SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR EXPEDITED APPEALS PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS DENIED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY BENEFITS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole has called on the Commissioner of Social Security to put a stop to long delays in the scheduling of hearings for North Carolinians who appeal a denial of Social Security disability benefits.  
   In a letter to Commissioner Michael J. Astrue, Dole wrote: "Those appealing a denial of Social Security disability benefits are experiencing outrageously long delays in the scheduling of hearings at the Offices of Disability Adjudication and Review. North Carolinians appealing a denial must in many cases wait nearly two years, and individuals who are ultimately granted benefits on appeal suffer substantial financial, emotional and even physical hardships during this delay. This situation concerns me deeply and is clearly unacceptable." 
   Dole urged Commissioner Astrue to address the problem in a prompt manner. 
   "We have a duty to expeditiously meet the needs of North Carolinians who have become disabled and are dependent on Social Security and Medicare benefits, and it is important to find a resolution to this continuing problem," Dole wrote.
