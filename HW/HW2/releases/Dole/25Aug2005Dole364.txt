SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $500,000 FOR JACKSONVILLE TO HELP RECRUIT SECOND AIRLINE SERVICE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Department of Transportation Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) will grant $500,000 to Jacksonville to help recruit air service by a second airline.  
 Currently, the community has service to Charlotte provided by US Airways Express. 
   "Successful commercial air service is very important to the economies of our smaller communities," said Senator Dole. "I commend Jacksonville for securing these competitive funds and working to meet the transportation needs of its businesses and citizens." 
   SCASDP helps communities address the challenges of local air service, such as high fares and insufficient levels of service. The grants will be used by communities around the country for programs such as financial incentives to air carriers, studies to determine air service needs, and marketing programs that encourage communities to use commercial carriers offering local air service. 
   This year, the Department of Transportation awarded 37 SCASDP grants totaling almost $19 million.
