SENATE INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the announcement by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that it will "mark up," or consider for committee approval, the Lumbee Recognition Act on Wednesday, August 2, 2006. Dole introduced the legislation to fully recognize the Lumbee Tribe, and the committee held a hearing on the bill on Wednesday, July 12, 2006. 
   "This is indeed a significant step towards our goal of achieving long-deserved federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe," said Dole. "I commend the Indian Affairs Committee for understanding that this is an issue of fairness and allowing this legislation to be considered for committee approval."
   In the last Congress, the committee unanimously approved the Lumbee Recognition Act. Earlier this month at the Indian Affairs Committee hearing, Dole urged her colleagues to again report this bill out of the committee as expeditiously as possible.
   The Lumbee Tribe is the largest American Indian tribe east of the Mississippi River as well as the largest non-federally recognized tribe in America. Full recognition would provide federal benefits, such as health care and education, to the more than 50,000 Lumbees, most of whom live in and around Robeson County, N.C.
