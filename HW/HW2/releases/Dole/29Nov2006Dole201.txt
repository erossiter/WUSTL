SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $115,766 FOR EFLAND VOLUNTEER FIRE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) will grant $115,766 for the Efland Volunteer Fire Company. The funding will be used for operations and safety.  
   "I applaud the Efland Volunteer Fire Company for securing this significant funding," said Senator Dole. "Our firefighters are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. It is so important that they have adequate facilities and equipment so that they can safely do their jobs and protect the communities they serve." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
