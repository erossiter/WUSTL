SENATE DEFEATS PROPOSALS TO PULL TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding the Senate rejecting proposals to set arbitrary timelines for withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq: 
   "Withdrawal from Iraq must be conditions-based. Those who call for setting arbitrary timelines for withdrawal fail to understand the enemy we are facing in the War on Terror - they fail to recognize that leaving Iraq before the job is done would have catastrophic implications for the security of Iraq and the entire Middle East region. Pulling out of Iraq and turning the country over to terrorists would destabilize the entire region, and would embolden the terrorists to attack us again.
   "Let me be clear: Iraq is the central battleground in the War on Terror - we are fighting the terrorists over there so we don't have to fight them here at home. We want our brave service members to come home as quickly as possible, but we will not cut and run - we must ensure that their sacrifice has not been made in vain. We will stay until the job is done."
