SEN. DOLE COSPONSORS BILL TO TACKLE BUREAUCRATIC WASTE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today joined Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and 21 of her colleagues to introduce the Commission on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA) Act. This legislation would create a bipartisan commission to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of federal agencies' programs and submit to Congress recommendations for realigning or eliminating programs where inefficiency, waste or fraud is found.  
   "We must be good stewards of taxpayers' dollars," said Dole. "Programs paid for by the American people should be carefully scrutinized and held to the highest standards for integrity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness." 
   The CARFA Act calls on the commission to propose legislation to implement its recommendations to realign or eliminate wasteful or redundant programs. Congress would be required to hold an up or down vote on the recommendations.
