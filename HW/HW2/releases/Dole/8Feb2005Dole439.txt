SEN. DOLE PRAISES CHERRY POINT AS WINNER OF 2004 NAVAL OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD
 Sen. Elizabeth Dole today praised Naval Air Depot Cherry Point for being selected as a winner in the 2004 Chief of Naval Operations Environmental Awards, sponsored by the Chief of Naval Operations' Environmental Readiness Division.  
   Cherry Point is one of twenty-eight winners announced from the Navy. Earlier this year the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources named the Naval Air Depot Cherry Point as one of only three 2004 Environmental Stewards. 
   "I am extremely proud of our dedicated professionals at Naval Air Depot Cherry Point. I commend the leadership and every single employee of this premier facility for the long hours and skilled work they dedicate to protecting our national security as well as our environment," said Senator Dole. 
   "It is very clear that the future of NADEP Cherry Point is critical to sustaining the nation's strong role in the global war on terror," Senator Dole added. 
   The annual program recognizes Navy individuals, teams, ships and installations for their exceptional environmental stewardship. Competition categories include natural resources conservation, cultural resources management, environmental quality, pollution prevention, environmental restoration, and environmental planning. 
   The awards will be presented May 3, 2005, at the U.S. Navy Memorial & Naval Heritage Center in Washington, DC.
