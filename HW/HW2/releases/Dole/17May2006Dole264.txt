SIGN UP BEGINS FOR HURRICANE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that sign up for crop and livestock assistance programs for producers affected by the 2005 hurricanes, including Ophelia, begins today at local Farm Service Agency offices. Producers in counties that were declared Presidential Disaster Areas may be eligible for disaster relief payments. 
   "This assistance is vitally important for producers who have struggled to get back on their feet since hurricane season," said Senator Dole. "I encourage those who may be eligible to contact their local FSA office as soon as possible."
   Producers in the following counties in North Carolina may be eligible for disaster relief: Brunswick, Carteret, Craven, Dare, Hyde, Jones, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, and Pender.
