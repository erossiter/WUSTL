SEN. DOLE ACCEPTS SEN. MIKULSKI'S DOUBLE OR NOTHING CHALLENGE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today accepted Sen. Barbara Mikulski's challenge to go double or nothing on the outcome of the Duke University Blue Devils and University of Maryland Terrapins Women's NCAA championship basketball game. The senators had wagered North Carolina barbeque and Maryland crab cakes on Sunday's North Carolina - Maryland women's Final Four game. Below is the response from Dole to Mikulski: 
   Dear Senator Mikulski,
   I congratulate you and the Maryland women's basketball team for their hard-fought win against North Carolina Sunday night. The Tar Heel women are a resilient team, and I expect they will have a very strong showing again next season. Of course, the Terrapins' chance to bask in victory will soon end, as they now face the Duke Blue Devils, my alma mater, for the NCAA championship.
   There is no shortage of basketball talent or good barbeque in North Carolina, so I am happy to accept your challenge to go double or nothing on the Duke - Maryland match up. I look forward to yet another great ACC game!
