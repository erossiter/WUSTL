SEN. DOLE: DETECTION, TREATMENT OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER MUST BE PRIORITY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today joined a bipartisan group of her colleagues in writing to Veterans Affairs Secretary James Nicholson, calling on the department to report on the VA's ability to handle the increasing number of veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). A recent study conducted by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research has indicated that combat duty in Iraq was associated with high utilization of mental health services and attrition from military service after deployment. 
   "It must be a priority to diagnose and treat veterans who suffer from the psychological traumas of war and help them lead healthy, productive lives," said Dole. "Our veterans have bravely defended our freedoms, and they deserve our utmost gratitude."
   In 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs established a Special Committee on PTSD, which made 24 recommendations for improving PTSD services and treatment. Dole and her colleagues are requesting a report from the VA by May 3, 2006 on their progress in implementing these recommendations.
