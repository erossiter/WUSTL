SEN. DOLE: NO MORE OF THE SAME OLD IMMIGRATION SONG
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today held a press conference with Sens. David Vitter (R-La.), Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), highlighting the broken promises of the 1986 immigration law that are again being made in the 2007 bill.  
   In her remarks, Dole cited promises made by members of Congress in 1986, such as: 
   * "Our country desperately needs to regain control over its borders. This bill will help us start that process and will provide the immediate relief on the border that we need." 
   * "This immigration bill says we are going to get tough with immigration laws?" 
   * "In my view it is a good bill. We should all support it and be glad that this long controversy has been finally put to rest." 
   "We've been hearing this same old song coming out of Washington in recent weeks," said Dole. "We're being told that this bill will finally solve the problem of illegal immigration. But the truth is this bill puts the cart before the horse again by rushing to legalize millions of people?when we should be rushing to secure our borders and enforce our laws." 
   "No more of the same old song. It's time for Congress to change its tune. It's time to make certain that we rectify these problems of the past."
