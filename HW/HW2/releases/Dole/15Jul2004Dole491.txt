SEN. DOLE ANNOUCES SENATE PASSAGE OF TOBACCO BUYOUT
  "As our farmers and rural communities reach for a life-line-we must help them", said Sen. Dole. "Rather than conceding tobacco production to countries like China - rather than allowing foreclosures to thousands of farmers - rather than allowing the negative economic ripple effect to be felt throughout rural southeastern America, let's do the right thing for our farmers and rural communities. We must pass this crucial legislation."
