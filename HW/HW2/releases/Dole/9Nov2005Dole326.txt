SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS PRAYER AT MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today cosponsored and voted for an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 National Defense Authorization Act that would ensure by law the ability of the military service academies to include the offering of a voluntary, non-denominational prayer as an element of their activities.  
   "I am proud to have supported this legislation that protects the Constitution and our religious freedoms at our service academies," said Dole. "The mission of the U.S. Naval Academy is to develop midshipmen morally, mentally, and physically. In my view, you simply cannot stress the moral component if prayer is not allowed." 
   The Fourth Circuit recently held that the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) supper prayer was unconstitutional. Bunting v. Mellen, 327 F.3d 355 (4th Cir. 2003). As a result, the Naval Academy is currently reviewing its policies with respect to prayer at academy functions. 
   The Supreme Court did not review the VMI ruling.
