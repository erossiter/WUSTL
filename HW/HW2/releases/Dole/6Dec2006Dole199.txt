SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS SENATE CONFIRMATION OF DR. ROBERT GATES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement following the Senate confirmation of Dr. Robert M. Gates as Secretary of Defense. Sen. Dole voted in favor of his confirmation during yesterday's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.  
   "I am very pleased that the Senate confirmed Dr. Gates as Secretary of Defense today. The task of running an agency like the Department of Defense is certainly daunting - especially during a time of war - and I know that Dr. Gates is ready to meet the challenge. He is extraordinarily well-qualified, bringing vast national security experience to the job, including his service as director of Central Intelligence. As a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look forward to working with Dr. Gates to develop fresh ideas on how we will win the War on Terror and set the course for a safer and more secure world."
