SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded Senate passage of the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which provides more than $100 million specifically designated for North Carolina. The overall bill provides $445.6 billion in new spending for the Department of Defense, including $50 billion related to the Global War on Terror, $3.9 billion in emergency funding for avian flu protection, and $1.3 billion in emergency funding for National Guard and Reserve Equipment.  
   "Right now, our soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, and even the Gulf Coast of the United States are facing extraordinary challenges. These soldiers make tremendous sacrifices every day to protect the freedoms that we all hold so closely," said Dole. "In turn, it is our responsibility to make sure that when our soldiers are called into harm's way, they have the best equipment, the best training, and the highest morale." 
   The legislation also includes more than $100 million for contracts with North Carolina companies and university programs. 
   "I am so impressed with the quality and innovation behind the growing defense industry in our state," said Senator Dole. "North Carolina cannot only be proud of all of our military installations, but also the universities, textile industry, and other contractors who are gaining a strong reputation in defense research and development." 
   Highlights for North Carolina Include: 
   * $12 million for the Medical Free Electron Laser (MFEL) Program at Duke University; 
   * $7 million for research, development, test, and evaluation conducted by NC State; 
   * $7 million to the Small Business and Technology Development Center at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill;

   * $2 million for the Citizen-Soldier Support Program (CSSP) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; 
   * $1.85 million for Eastern Carolina University for research, development, test, and evaluation. 
   Highlights of the Overall bill Include: 
   * $95.7 billion for military personnel, including a 3.1 percent across-the-board pay raise and a housing allowance to eliminate out-of-pocket housing expenses; 
   * $125 billion for operation and maintenance, which funds key readiness programs critical to the Global War on Terror; 
   * $75.8 billion for procurement of aircraft, weapons and missiles, shipbuilding, vehicles and force protection, other equipment;

   Note: The Senate version of the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
