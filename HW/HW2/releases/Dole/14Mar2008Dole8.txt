SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR 287 PROGRAM FUNDING
  The Senate yesterday evening approved U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole's amendment calling for $75 million to be directed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand the 287(g) program, which provides local law enforcement officers the training, resources and authority to help ICE apprehend, identify and remove criminal illegal aliens. The measure is part of the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution. 
   "To address the problems presented by individuals who are not only here illegally but who have self-identified themselves because of their criminal behavior - we must provide the funding for ICE to make the necessary resources available to our local law enforcement officers who are on the front lines," said Dole.
   Dole helped deliver the first in the nation statewide partnership plan for North Carolina sheriffs to coordinate with ICE, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The plan, which adopts a regional approach to ensure statewide access to 287(g) databases and other resources to determine the immigration status of apprehended individuals, is being directed by a steering committee made up of sheriffs from around the state.
   Currently, four North Carolina counties currently have 287(g) agreements with ICE - Mecklenburg, Alamance, Cabarrus and Gaston Counties. Sheriffs, working with ICE and the steering committee, will determine what tools and resources best meet their needs and where additional resources are needed in a region.
