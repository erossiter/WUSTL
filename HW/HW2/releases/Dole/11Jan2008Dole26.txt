SEN. DOLE WELCOMES STANDARDS FOR SECURE DRIVER'S LICENSES
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's establishment of uniform security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards, as part of the implementation of the REAL ID Act of 2005 that she supported. These standards will ensure that illegal aliens cannot obtain licenses, strengthen our national security, and prevent identity theft and document fraud.  
   Minimum licensing standards, such as those set forth by the REAL ID Act, were a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. According to DHS, the 9/11 hijackers obtained 30 driver's licenses and identification cards and used 364 aliases. 
   "Congress overwhelmingly supported the REAL ID Act, and I welcome today's announcement of these common-sense standards," said Dole. "The REAL ID is a reasonable and practical tool to help improve the safety and security of all Americans." 
   The secure identifications will be required for accessing a federal facility, boarding commercial aircrafts and entering nuclear power plants. December 31, 2009 is the first deadline for states to comply with REAL ID, and DHS will make $360 million available to assist states with implementation.
