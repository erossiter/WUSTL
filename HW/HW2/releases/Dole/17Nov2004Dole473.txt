SEN. DOLE ELECTED TO LEAD REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today was selected by her Senate Republican colleagues to chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 2006 election cycle.  
 From this leadership position, Dole will work to protect the seats of Republican incumbents, recruit outstanding candidates, and raise the necessary funds to increase the majority. 
   "It truly is an honor to have this trust and responsibility bestowed upon me by my colleagues," said Dole. "It will be a privilege to work to not only grow the Republican Party, but to give back to the Republican Party. And as a member of leadership, I look forward to promoting issues important to North Carolina."
