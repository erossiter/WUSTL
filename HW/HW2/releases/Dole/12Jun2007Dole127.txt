SENS. DOLE, LAUTENBERG, LINCOLN INTRODUCE BILL TO COMBAT HUNGER, PROVIDE JOB TRAINING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, along with Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.), has introduced legislation to combat hunger in America and create job training opportunities for those in need. The Food Employment Empowerment and Development (FEED) Act would combine food rescue with job training for unemployed and homeless adults to learn the skills needed to work in the food service industry.  
   "In this country, 27 percent of all the food produced annually is lost at the retail, consumer and food service levels - this means we are wasting about 3,044 pounds of good food every second," said Dole. "The FEED Act would not only ensure that some of this edible, nutritious food is rescued and distributed to the hungry, but this legislation would also help individuals who have faced adversity get on track for careers in the food service industry." 
   "It is a tragedy that in the United States, a country where food is plentiful, millions of Americans, including children, go hungry each day. The FEED Act would go a long way toward providing food and job training to those in need," said Lautenberg. 
   "As a nation of plenty, we must make a commitment to eliminate hunger in America," said Lincoln. "We are taking rescued food that would otherwise be wasted, turning it into meals that are prepared by people training to get a job to help support themselves and their family, and using the meals to feed hungry adults and children. This legislation will provide resources to local anti-hunger organizations in Arkansas and across the nation who want to use this multi-pronged approach to feed the hungry, empower the unemployed, and maximize food resources." 
   The FEED Act would provide $20 million a year for the next five years for local governments, groups and organizations to carry out food rescue and job training programs. Food rescue programs collect food from restaurants and businesses and turn it into nutritional meals for seniors, children, and low-income families. These meals are distributed and served at homeless shelters, community and youth centers, children's after-school programs and senior citizen programs. 
   The FEED Act would require eligible organizations to provide the following: 
   * Food Rescue: Safely recover unserved or unused food from food service businesses and industries and convert the donated foods into balanced meals for those without food. 
   * Job Training: Provide job training and life skills training to unemployed and underemployed individuals in culinary skills that will lead to employment. 
   * Community Service: Provide community service leadership opportunities for high school and college students and encourage partnerships between existing social service programs.
