SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $5 MILLION GRANT TO HELP CIVILIAN WORKERS AFFECTED BY BRAC
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor will award $5 million to the N.C. Department of Commerce for the BRAC Regional Task Force to assist civilian workers affected by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure actions. According to the Labor Department, this dislocated worker demonstration grant will help workers from Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base prepare for new careers in technology-based industries.  
   "The expansion of Fort Bragg resulting from the BRAC round not only solidifies the base's status as a critical component of our national security, but it also presents tremendous economic prospects for the surrounding region," said Dole. "This grant will help the local workforce successfully make the transition and prepare for new opportunities. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I remain committed to assisting our local communities throughout BRAC implementation."
