N.C. COUNTIES TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded the announcement that the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has designated five counties in North Carolina as part of its High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. Durham, Johnston, Wake, Wayne and Wilson Counties will now be eligible to receive additional federal resources to combat drug trafficking and related problems. 
   "North Carolina law enforcement officers are working hard to fight the growing drug threat in our state," said Dole. "Particularly in areas where problems are most severe, state and local law enforcement organizations must have the resources and assistance to aggressively and effectively tackle drug trafficking. These efforts are critical to keeping North Carolina communities safe and disrupting the flow of drugs throughout the United States."
   The five North Carolina counties are the first in the state to receive this designation and will be part of the Atlanta region HIDTA. According to ONDCP, in 2007 the HIDTA program provided more than $224 million to support drug enforcement efforts nationwide.
   Background
   Last year, Dole wrote John P. Walters, Director of National Drug Control Policy, urging ONDCP to convert a number of provisional drug task force offices in North Carolina into HIDTA offices. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, drug threat assessments demonstrate that over the past several years North Carolina has experienced a significant increase in drug trafficking activity.
