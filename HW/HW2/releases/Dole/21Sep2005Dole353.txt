SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $390,000 FOR EASTOVER VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will loan $390,000 to Eastover Volunteer Fire Department in Fayetteville.  
 Funding will be used to purchase a new fire and rescue truck to replace the existing truck. 
   "I am so pleased to announce this significant funding for Eastover Volunteer Fire Department," said Dole. "Our firefighters are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. It is so important that they have adequate equipment so that they can safely do their jobs and protect the communities they serve." 
   According to USDA Rural Development, the new vehicle will allow the fire department to improve its response time and possible its insurance rating, which would mean an insurance premium reduction for property owners in the district. 
   Eastover Volunteer Fire Department serves 1,376 residents in their district.
