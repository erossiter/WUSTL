SEN. DOLE RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS ON IRAQ
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole tonight made the following statement regarding the president's speech on Iraq:  
   "Our troops have made heroic efforts in Iraq, but the Iraqi government has made very little political progress to resolve the issues causing much of the conflict and violence. I urge the president to heed the sound advice of General Petraeus to begin a gradual draw down of our forces in Iraq. Scaling down our troops in a responsible manner will demonstrate to the American people that our commitment is not open ended and signal to the Iraqi government that it must achieve political reconciliation. 
   "I firmly believe that we must bridge the political gap that exists between the differing policy positions on Iraq, find common ground on a set of shared principles and work to bring our troops home with honor as soon as possible."
