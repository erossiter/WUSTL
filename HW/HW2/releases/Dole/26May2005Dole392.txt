SEN. DOLE PRESSES ADMINISTRATION ON TOBACCO BUYOUT PAYMENT TAX STATUS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today pressed the Administration to determine the tax status of tobacco quota buyout payments during a hearing in the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.  
 The signup period for the 2005 buyout payments ends on June 17, and Sen. Dole has heard from many North Carolina farm families concerned about this issue because they currently have no information from the IRS on how these payments may be taxed. 
   Treasury Secretary John Snow appeared before the committee today, and Senator Dole raised these concerns during the question period. Secretary Snow assured Senator Dole that the guidelines are currently being worked on and will be completed soon. 
   "The tax status of buyout payments is an issue of great concern to many farm families as they plan for the future," said Senator Dole. "As I stressed to the Administration, the rule on tobacco payments needs to be published as soon as possible. I am pleased with Secretary Snow's response today, and I intend to continue monitoring this closely." 
   Senator Dole was a leader in getting a tobacco quota buyout passed.
