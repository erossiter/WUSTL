SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $2.1 MILLION BOOST TO DEFENSE RESEARCH IN N.C.
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Army has awarded over $2 million to North Carolina researchers to develop enhanced training and mission rehearsal capabilities for the military.  
   "I applaud the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Applied Research Associates for receiving this significant funding," said Dole. "Their research will help ensure that when our soldiers are called into harm's way, they have the very best training possible to conduct operations in the field." 
   UNC-Chapel Hill received $1 million to research and develop more realistic training simulations of urban combat zones. Applied Research Associates in Raleigh received two contracts totaling $1.1 million to simulate structures like subways, sewers and tunnels in military training systems. 
   "I am so impressed with the quality and innovation behind the growing defense industry in our state," said Dole. "North Carolina can not only be proud of our fine military installations, but also the universities and other contractors that have earned a strong reputation in defense research and development."
