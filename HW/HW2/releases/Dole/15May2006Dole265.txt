SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding the president's address to the nation:
   "I am pleased that the president tonight called for important actions to step up border security, including increasing the number of border patrol agents and constructing additional facilities to detain those who are caught illegally entering our country. Securing our borders must be the centerpiece of any immigration reform. This is critical to winning the War on Terror and ensuring the safety of all Americans."
