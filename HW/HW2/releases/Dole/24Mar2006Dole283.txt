NORTH CAROLINA TO RECEIVE MORE THAN $32 MILLION FOR LOW-INCOME HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded an announcement from the Department of Health and Human Services that North Carolina will receive $32,061,626 for low-income home energy assistance. This funding is part of an additional $1 billion provided by Congress for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). 
   "I share the concerns of North Carolinians about home-heating costs, particularly in light of dramatic increases in residential energy costs this winter," said Dole. "It is so important that every family has the means to stay warm during the cold winter months."
   North Carolina has received a total of $70 million for LIHEAP in 2006. In addition to supporting this $1 billion in supplementary funding, Dole also supported the Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations bill, which included $2.1 billion for LIHEAP for fiscal year 2006.
