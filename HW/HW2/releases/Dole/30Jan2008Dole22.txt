SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOLE RESOLUTION HONORING U.S. COAST GUARD
  The U.S. Senate approved a resolution Tuesday evening introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Dole and cosponsored by Sen. Richard Burr that honors members of the United States Coast Guard for their work, dedication and commitment to protecting our nation. In 2007, the Coast Guard confiscated over 350,000 pounds of cocaine at sea, with an estimated import value of more than $4.7 billion. This helped reduce supply in more than 35 major U.S. cities. 
   "Our brave men and women in the Coast Guard not only help combat illegal drugs, but they also rescue people from dangerous sea conditions, guard our borders and work to protect the environment," said Dole, who oversaw the Coast Guard as Secretary of Transportation. "These fine Americans work tirelessly to keep us safe and secure, and they deserve our gratitude."
   Below is an excerpt from Dole's resolution:
   Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the Senate
   (1) honors the United States Coast Guard, with its proud 217-year legacy of maritime law enforcement and border protection, along with the brave men and women whose efforts clearly demonstrate the honor, respect, and devotion to duty that ensure the parents of the United States can sleep soundly knowing the Coast Guard is on patrol; and
   (2) recognizes the tireless work, dedication, and commitment that have allowed the Coast Guard to confiscate over 350,000 pounds of cocaine at sea in 2007.
   Background
   As Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Dole oversaw the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2002, the Coast Guard became part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
