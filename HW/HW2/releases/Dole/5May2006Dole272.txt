SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded news that the national employment rate remained low at 4.7 percent and that the economy created 138,000 jobs in April. More than 5.2 million jobs have been created since August 2003. 
   "This is indeed yet another good report for the U.S. economy," said Dole. "Jobs are being created and the unemployment rate remains lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. We have a first quarter GDP growth of 4.8 percent - the strongest in 2 ? years. And homeownership - including minority homeownership - is at an all time high.
   "Especially during these historic and challenging times, we must ensure that America continues this steady growth - we must make tax relief permanent, reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources, eliminate unnecessary regulations on businesses, and focus special attention on education and job training programs.
   "In North Carolina, our statewide economy is trending positively; still, we have parts of our state where people continue to lose jobs in traditional manufacturing industries. We've got to do everything in our power to ensure that folks realize new opportunities. The Labor Department estimates that 80 percent of new jobs created over the next decade will require post-secondary education - we must make certain that our less skilled workers can take advantage of these new jobs that our economy is creating."
