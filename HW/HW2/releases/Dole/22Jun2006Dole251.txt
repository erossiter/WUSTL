SENATE CONFIRMS FRANK WHITNEY FOR FEDERAL BENCH
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded Senate confirmation of Frank DeArmon Whitney to serve as a U.S. District Judge in the Western District of North Carolina. 
   "Frank Whitney will serve with distinction as a member of the federal judiciary in North Carolina," said Dole. "He possesses a passionate sense for justice and has extensive legal and public service experience, serving for more than a decade as a federal prosecutor."
   Dole, along with Senator Richard Burr, recommended Whitney to President Bush.
   Whitney currently serves as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina and has devoted nearly his entire legal career to public service. He has built an impressive record as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and as the U.S. Attorney in North Carolina's largest judicial district.
   Whitney also serves as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves and has worked as an intelligence officer and a judge advocate. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wake Forest University, received his Masters of Business Administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and graduated with honors from the UNC School of Law.
