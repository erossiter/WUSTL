CITY OF DURHAM TO RECEIVE OVER $6.5 MILLION GRANT FOR BUS SYSTEM
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the City of Durham will receive a $6,504,889 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.  
 Funding will go towards construction of a new transportation center. 
   "Safe and efficient public transportation provides ways for people to get around town -- to get to work, restaurants, shops and other places they need to go, " said Dole. "It is very important to residents and the local economy to have a dependable transit option." 
   The new transportation center will house transit and local buses, para-transit vans, taxi cabs, private automobiles, commuter rail, and rental cars. It will also provide access to a nearby facility that will house Amtrak.
