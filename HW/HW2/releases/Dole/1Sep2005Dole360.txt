SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS NORTH CAROLINA MARINES FOR ROLE IN HURRICANE RELIEF
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today commended North Carolina Marines who have been and are being deployed to assist in Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.  
   "I am so proud that Marines from North Carolina are playing a critical role in providing aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina," said Senator Dole. "These Marines have bravely defended our freedoms in the War on Terror and now are readily answering the call to help Americans on our own soil. This truly is a testament to their spirit, their superb training, and their ability to adapt to any mission." 
   As part of Joint Task Force Katrina, eight heavy and medium lift helicopters from Marine Corps Air Station New River have been deployed and are working out of Naval Air Station Pensacola and other regional airports around New Orleans. These operations require over 100 aircrew and mechanics. 
   These assets will provide the capability to deliver supplies, assist in site assessment, search and rescue operations, and help evacuate individuals in hard to reach locations. Marine Corps assessment teams are also in the region to assess damages and find how to best assist in supporting these emergency relief efforts. 
   Additionally, a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) comprised of units from Camp Lejeune is currently preparing to deploy and will assist in the continued humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts in support of Joint Task Force Katrina. An assessment team from the SPMAGTF will arrive in the region this evening to determine which units and capabilities are most needed. Depending on requirements, a force between 300 and 1000 will be deployed.
