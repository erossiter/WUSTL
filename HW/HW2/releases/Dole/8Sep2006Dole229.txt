SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS DEFENSE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded Senate passage of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate yesterday evening. 
   The overall bill provides $469.7 billion in new spending for the Department of Defense, including $65.2 billion in additional funding for operations related to the Global War on Terror, $21.4 billion for the Defense Health Program, $9.3 billion for missile defense programs, $1.5 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Organization, $735 million for body armor and personal protection equipment, and $340 million for National Guard and Reserve Equipment. The legislation also includes significant funding for contracts with North Carolina employers and university programs.
   The bill supports an Army end strength of 512,400 Soldiers, a Marine Corps end strength of 180,000 Marines, and an Army National Guard end strength of 350,000 Soldiers, as authorized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which Dole is a member.
   "Our service members face extraordinary challenges in the War on Terror, and they are making tremendous sacrifices every day to protect our freedoms," said Dole. "In turn, it is our responsibility to ensure that when our soldiers are called into harm's way, they have the best equipment, the best training, and the highest morale."
   "I am so impressed with the quality and innovation behind the growing defense industry in our state," said Dole. "North Carolina can not only be proud of our fine military installations, but also the universities, textile companies, and other contractors that have earned a strong reputation in defense research and development."
   Highlights for North Carolina:
   * $18.9 million for the Medical Free Electron Laser (MFEL) Program, which includes Duke University
   * $5 million for the Citizen-Soldier Support Program (CSSP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
   Highlights of the Overall bill Include:
   * $99 billion for military personnel, including a 2.2 percent across-the-board pay raise and a housing allowance to eliminate out-of-pocket housing expenses
   * $126.3 billion for operations and maintenance, which funds key readiness programs critical to the Global War on Terror
   * $81 billion for procurement of aircraft, weapons and missiles, shipbuilding, vehicles and force protection, and other equipment
   * $73 billion for research, development, testing, and evaluation
   * $23.9 billion for other Department of Defense programs, including cancer research, counter-drug activities, and the destruction of chemical agents and munitions
   * $1.8 billion for the Army National Guard for construction of 370 miles of triple-layered fencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border
   The Senate version of the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
