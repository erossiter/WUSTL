THREE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY CLINICS TO OPEN IN NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs will open three community-based outpatient clinics in Franklin, Hamlet and Hickory. The clinics are expected to be serving patients by the end of the year. 
   "Our veterans have made enormous sacrifices to protect our country and the freedoms we enjoy, and we have a profound responsibility to do everything we can to provide for their quality of life," said Dole. "I am pleased that these new community clinics will make health care more accessible to our state's veterans."
   According to VA, the three new North Carolina facilities are among 25 new community clinics nationwide. VA spent $2.3 billion last year to serve North Carolina's 760,000 veterans. VA operates major medical centers in Asheville, Durham, Fayetteville and Salisbury, with seven outpatient clinics, four nursing homes and five Vet Centers.
