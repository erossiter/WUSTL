SEN. DOLE JOINS BIPARTISAN GROUP TO INTRODUCE HIGHER EDUCATION BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today joined colleagues to introduce the "Higher Education Affordability, Access, and Opportunity Act of 2004." This legislation is designed to help universities, colleges and community colleges develop stronger links to the workforce and better prepare students for high-growth, high-demand jobs. 
   "In North Carolina and many other states where the traditional manufacturing industries are no longer thriving, our community colleges offer a real beacon of hope, educating and training the local workforce to meet the challenges of new jobs and opportunities," said Senator Dole. "Supporting these institutions and students is critical to preparing American workers for the jobs of the 21st century."
   Under the bill students could receive more relevant postsecondary education and training that would help them be more self-sufficient. Parents and students also would be able to access and understand data on individual schools, helping them make the choice that best fits their needs.
   Senator Dole was joined by Senators Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., in introducing this legislation.
   Background on the Higher Education Affordability, Access, and Opportunity Act of 2004
   Helps Institutions of Higher Education Develop Stronger Links to the Workforce:
   * Provides Grant funding for Workforce Development Curriculum Development. Institutions of higher education in this country provide the best postsecondary education in the world, but many of the programs offered are not linked to the workforce. Federal grant funding for institutions will help ensure that institutions have the resources to develop and support programs that help prepare students with the skills and knowledge necessary to enter the workforce in high-wage and high-skill occupations.
   * Provide Grant Funding for Small Business Training. Many federal small business programs already operate out of institutions of higher education, but there is no program that would provide easily accessible opportunities for small business owners to receive advanced skill training without formally enrolling. The legislation proposed would provide assistance for small business owners or operators to receive short-term postsecondary training, helping to ensure that small businesses continue to support the American economy.
   Helps Students Receive Relevant Postsecondary Education and Training That Will Lead to Self-Sufficiency:
   * Provide Additional Loan Opportunities for Students. First time college students in their first and second years have access to the smallest amount of federal financial aid. The legislation that will be introduced will provide an additional $2,000 in subsidized borrowing authority to first and second year college students who agree to pursue a program that will prepare them with skills necessary for entry into the workforce in high-wage and high-growth occupations.
   * Involve State Workforce Agencies. The key to helping students reach self-sufficiency on their own is to make sure their programs of study are connected to the workforce. Under current federal programs like the Workforce Investment Act, states already have the infrastructure to help identify growing workforce areas and can help institutions of higher education develop training or academic programs to meet these needs. By involving state workforce agencies, students, local communities, and the economy all benefit.
   * Support Lifelong Education. Education provides the skills necessary to unleash Americans' creativity and helps prepare them for the jobs of the future. The legislation would help students enter college at any time throughout their lives, and provide the resources for them to succeed. The fastest growing population of college students is nontraditional students (those who are over 24, independent, and frequently supporting families). These students need adequate support from institutions so they can return to the workforce with better skills that are in demand.
   * Simplify Credit Transfer Issues for Students: Many postsecondary students will transfer institutions at least once before finishing their degree or certificate program. These students frequently find that they have to repeat coursework after transferring institutions. The bill to be introduced would require institutions to clearly identify their credit transfer policies, an would prohibit institutions from denying transfer of credit based solely on the accreditation of the institution from which the student transfers.
   Provides Parents and Students with Easier Access to Postsecondary Education Opportunities:
   * Make Data More Easily Available and Easier to Understand. The U.S. Department of Education collects and reports data on every institution of higher education in the country, yet many students and parents are unaware that the data is available for free on the web. The legislation would make it easier for individuals to find the data, and require the data to be reported in a way that allows direct comparisons between institutions.
