SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S.-CHINA TEXTILE AGREEMENTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today released the following statement in response to the textile agreement announced by U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai:  
   I am pleased that our negotiators were able to resolve these complicated issues in a way that provides greater market security for our textile community. I support this agreement because it addresses the concerns of textile employers as well as retailers in North Carolina, and I appreciate the attention U.S. Trade Representative Portman and Special Textile Negotiator David Spooner have given to these critical issues. Much was at stake in the outcome of these negotiations - it was critical that the United States receive serious concessions before agreeing to any modification to the China textile safeguards. Far too many North Carolinians have lost their jobs due to surging Chinese exports. I am hopeful today's actions will keep people on the job while we work towards a level playing field.
