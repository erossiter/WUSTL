SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO FIGHT HUNGER
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today introduced the Hunger Relief Trucking Tax Credit Act.  
 This bipartisan legislation would change the tax code to give transportation companies tax incentives for volunteering trucks to transfer gleaned food. 
   "It is unacceptable that in a country that has so much, many of our fellow citizens go hungry every day," said Senator Dole. "This legislation will help more people who are struggling find relief while providing incentives for those donating their time and resources." 
   The legislation would create a 25 cent tax credit for each mile that food is transported for a charity by a donated truck and driver for hunger relief efforts. The incentive will encourage trucking companies to donate space in their vehicles so more food can reach those in need. The legislation has garnered the support of many Senators, including Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina. 
   "The battle to end hunger in our country is a campaign that can not be won in months or even years, but it is a victory within reach," said Senator Dole. "We need to help our fellow Americans understand the terrible reality of hunger...and how to put a stop to it."
