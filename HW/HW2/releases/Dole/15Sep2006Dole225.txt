SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR PROMOTING TEXTILE NEGOTIATOR POSITION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today introduced legislation to restore the rank of "ambassador" to the special textile and apparel negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, changing the title to "chief textile negotiator." In recent years, U.S. negotiators have encountered some obstacles because they did not carry the same rank as their foreign colleagues.  
   "Our textile and apparel negotiator is a tremendous advocate for U.S. textile and apparel interests," said Dole. "It is in the best interests of our textile workers for the individuals negotiating critical trade agreements to be on equal footing with their foreign counterparts." 
   U.S. Rep. Robin Hayes introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives earlier this month. 
   "I am proud to join Congressman Hayes in helping to ensure that our trade representative has every advantage in negotiations involving textiles," said Dole. 
   Up until four years ago, the special textile negotiator had the title "chief textile negotiator," carried the rank of ambassador, and had to be confirmed by the Senate; however, the position was downgraded and no longer requires Senate confirmation. 
   The chief textile negotiator, like the special textile negotiator, would be responsible for conducting trade negotiations and enforcing trade agreements relating to U.S. textile and apparel products.
