SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS ADMINISTRATION FOR INVOKING CHINA SAFEGUARDS FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CATEGORIES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the announcement from the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) that the Administration will invoke the China Safeguards for four additional product categories based on threatened damages.  
 The Administration approved safeguard cases covering men's and boys' cotton and man-made fiber shirts, man-made fiber trousers, man-made fiber knit shirts and blouses, and combed cotton yarn from China. 
   "Invoking safeguards on a threat basis is critical for our textile industry," said Senator Dole. "This will prevent further damaging surges into the United States - rather than reacting to them once it's too late. I applaud the Administration for invoking safeguards for these product categories and moving ahead with threat-based cases." 
   Threat-based petitions for these and eight other product categories were filed between October and December 2004, but action has been delayed by legal proceedings.
