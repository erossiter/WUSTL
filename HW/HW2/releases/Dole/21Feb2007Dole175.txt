SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR ACTION TO PREVENT MEDICAID CUTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, joined by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), led 41 other senators in calling for legislative action to prevent implementation of a proposed Medicaid rule change that would disproportionately affect public providers that care for Medicaid and low-income patients. Dole has heard from North Carolina hospitals concerned that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plan would have a devastating impact on North Carolina's Medicaid system.  
   The rule proposed by CMS on January 18, 2007 would impose cost limits for public health care providers and alter the definition of "public" status. The proposed rule would limit payments to government safety-net providers by capping reimbursement payments, redefining eligible public providers and imposing new restrictions on non-federal funding sources. According to CMS, the estimated impact of these changes could reach $3.87 billion over five years. 
   In a letter to the Senate Finance Committee chairman and ranking member, Dole and her colleagues wrote: "At a time when states are working toward increasing health care coverage for the uninsured, the CMS proposal would thwart their progress by weakening an already fragile safety net. The Medicaid program is a shared responsibility between the states and federal government, and attempts to shift the cost burden onto states will leave them with no choice but to cut benefits or eliminate coverage. The results would be devastating and will likely increase the number of uninsured Americans rather than help improve our health care system." 
   Forty-three North Carolina hospitals have "public" status and are eligible for Medicaid reimbursements for services provided to uninsured and low-income patients. Currently, these hospitals receive in total $330 million annually from this Medicaid program.
