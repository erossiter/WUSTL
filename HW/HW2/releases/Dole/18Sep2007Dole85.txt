SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR TWO N.C. COMMUNITY COLLEGES
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that Catawba Valley Community College in Hickory and the City of Laurinburg, in collaboration with Richmond Community College, will each be awarded $1 million in Economic Development Administration (EDA) investments to build job training centers.  
   The $1 million will help Catawba Valley Community College construct a healthcare training facility, which will provide a simulated hospital facility on the campus. According to the EDA, this project will create 859 new jobs and generate private investment in excess of $123 million. 
   The City of Laurinburg will use the $1 million for a workforce training center that will be built in collaboration with Richmond Community College. This project includes the construction of laboratory, computer and classroom space to help workers displaced by the recent loss of manufacturing jobs. According to the EDA, this facility will create 230 new jobs and generate more than $27 million in private investment. 
   "I applaud Catawba Valley Community College and the City of Laurinburg for securing this significant funding to help build job training facilities," said Dole. "I am a huge believer in our community colleges - they are leading the way in training workers for high-growth fields. These training centers will be tremendous assets to these North Carolina colleges and the communities they serve."
