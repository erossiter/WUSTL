SEN. DOLE PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF DEFICIT REDUCTION BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded Senate passage of the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act, which will reduce government spending by $40 billion from 2006 to 2010.  
   "The majority in Congress is working hard to maintain fiscal discipline in the wake of many unforeseen challenges," said Dole. "Particularly as we approve billions of dollars in much-needed funding to rebuild areas of our country devastated by this very active hurricane season and to fight the War on Terror, we must look at ways to trim other government expenses and wisely spend the tax dollars of hardworking Americans." 
   The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act seeks to slow growth and stimulate reform of entitlement programs, many of which are outdated, inefficient and costly. Spending on these programs now consumes 54 percent of the total federal budget - a number that is expected to rise to 62 percent over 10 years if no action is taken. 
   This bill includes $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This bill also provides a down-payment toward hurricane recovery and reconstruction costs, including $2 billion for Hurricane Katrina related health care costs. 
   The Senate-passed deficit reduction bill must now be approved by the House of Representatives before it goes to the president for his signature.
