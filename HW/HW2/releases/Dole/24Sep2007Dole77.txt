SENATE APPROVES $3 MILLION FOR WINSTON-SALEM STORM WATER UPGRADES
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Senate has approved $3 million in authorized funding for storm water upgrades for the City of Winston-Salem in the final version of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Dole advocated for this funding with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  
   "It is so important that communities have the infrastructure they need to support residents, sustain current industries and attract new businesses," said Dole. "I look forward to working with local officials and the Army Corps of Engineers to move this important water project forward." 
   The House of Representatives passed the final version of WRDA in August, and the bill will now go to the president's desk. Following enactment, WRDA will give the Corps of Engineers the authority to visit the City of Winston-Salem to study local water project needs before funds are appropriated.
