SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES HIGHER EDUCATION BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today introduced the Higher Education Affordability, Access, and Opportunity Act of 2007. This legislation is designed to help universities, colleges and community colleges develop stronger links to the workforce and better prepare students for 21st century jobs.
   "In North Carolina and many other states where traditional industries such as tobacco, textiles and furniture are transitioning, our community colleges are literally on the front lines during our economic transformation," said Dole. "Community colleges are leading the way in training workers for high growth, high demand jobs, and we must continue to make strengthening these institutions a top priority. This legislation provides a link between our higher education institutions and the business community to prepare a new generation of skilled workers so our workforce will remain strong and competitive." 
   The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that nearly two-thirds of new jobs created between 2004 and 2014 are expected to be filled by workers with some post-secondary education. Under Dole's bill, students could receive more relevant post-secondary education and training that would prepare them for high-skilled, high-wage occupations. Parents and students also would be able to access and understand data on individual schools, helping them make the choice that best fits their needs.
   Background on the Higher Education Affordability, Access, and Opportunity Act of 2007
   Would help higher education institutions develop stronger links to the workforce by:
   * Providing Grant Funding for Workforce Development Curriculum Development: American institutions of higher education provide the best postsecondary education in the world, but many of the programs offered are not linked to the workforce. Federal grant funding for institutions would help ensure that institutions have the resources to develop and support programs that help prepare students with the skills and knowledge necessary to enter the workforce in high-wage and high-skill occupations.
   * Providing Grant Funding for Small Business Training: Many federal small business programs already operate out of institutions of higher education, but there is no program that would provide easily accessible opportunities for small business owners to receive advanced skill training without formally enrolling. Dole's bill would provide assistance for small business owners or operators to receive short-term postsecondary training, helping to ensure that small businesses continue to support the American economy.
   Would help students receive relevant postsecondary education and training that will lead to self-sufficiency by:
   * Providing Additional Loan Opportunities for Students: This legislation would provide an additional $2,000 in subsidized borrowing authority to first and second year college students who agree to pursue a program that will prepare them with skills necessary for entry into the workforce in high-wage and high-growth occupations.
   * Involving State Workforce Agencies: The key to helping students reach self-sufficiency on their own is to make sure their programs of study are connected to the workforce. Under current federal programs like the Workforce Investment Act, states already have the infrastructure to help identify growing workforce areas and can help institutions of higher education develop training or academic programs to meet these needs. By involving state workforce agencies, students, local communities and the economy all benefit.
   * Supporting Lifelong Education: Education provides the skills necessary to unleash Americans' creativity and helps prepare them for the jobs of the future. This legislation would help students enter college at any time throughout their lives, and provide the resources for them to succeed. One of the fastest growing populations of college students is nontraditional students (those who are over 24, independent and frequently supporting families). These students need adequate support from institutions so they can return to the workforce with better skills that are in demand.
   * Simplifying Credit Transfer Issues for Students: Many postsecondary students will transfer institutions at least once before finishing their degree or certificate program. These students frequently find that they have to repeat coursework after transferring institutions. This bill would require institutions to clearly identify their credit transfer policies, and would prohibit institutions from denying transfer of credit based solely on the accreditation of the institution from which the student transfers.
   Would provide parents and students with easier access to postsecondary education opportunities by:
   * Making Data More Easily Available and Easier to Understand: The U.S. Department of Education collects and reports data on every institution of higher education in the country, yet many students and parents are unaware that the data is available for free on the web. The legislation would make it easier for individuals to find the data, and require the data to be reported in a way that allows direct comparisons between institutions.
