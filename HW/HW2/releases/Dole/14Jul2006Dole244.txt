SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR NEW COAST GUARD DIVE FACILITY IN ELIZABETH CITY
  Late yesterday the U.S. Senate passed the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Sen. Elizabeth Dole successfully advocated for the bill to include a provision for a new search and rescue training facility for the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Elizabeth City, which is home to the nation's only training facility for Coast Guard rescue divers. 
   "Our brave men and women in the Coast Guard work tirelessly and heroically, and they deserve our strongest support," said Dole. "Rescue divers often must save people from deep ocean waters, and their current training facility - a shallow recreational pool that was constructed in 1938 - is simply not adequate.
   "These divers must have the resources necessary to train for and carry out their important missions, and I am pleased that this bill includes my provision to support our courageous men and women of the Coast Guard and our fine North Carolina facility."
   NOTE: Once approved by the Senate, this version of the bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
   Background
   As Secretary of the Department of Transportation, Dole oversaw the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2002, the Coast Guard became part of the Department of Homeland Security.
