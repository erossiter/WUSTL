SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF RUTH GRAHAM
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made a statement on the passing of Ruth Graham. Dole will attend the public memorial service in Montreat tomorrow. 
   "I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Ruth Graham, a remarkable wife and mother and a devout servant of Jesus Christ. Bob and I have been blessed to call Ruth, Billy and their children dear friends for many years. My heartfelt sympathies and prayers are with the Graham family as North Carolina and all of America join them in mourning this great loss.
   "Ruth touched countless lives around the globe, sharing her tremendous faith, great God-given talents and lighthearted wit. She will be remembered as a loyal companion who shined with grace and courage beside her extraordinary husband, and a devoted mother who fostered individuality and humility in her five children. With the wisdom and strong spirit she instilled in them, Virginia, Anne, Ruth, Franklin and Ned will carry on the torch of the Graham legacy - and following their parents' example, they will continue to make the world a better place."
