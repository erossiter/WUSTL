SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL FAILS TO ADVANCE, SEN. DOLE SAYS SECURING BORDER, ENFORCING LAWS MUST COME FIRST
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole tonight made the following statement after the Senate failed to advance the immigration bill: 
   "I am very pleased that tonight the Senate immigration bill failed to advance. I have fought tooth and nail to defeat this bill because it rushes to legalize millions of illegal aliens, which is not the urgent matter at hand. I urge the Majority Leader to address the real crisis and first focus on securing our borders and enforcing our laws. We are a nation of laws - it's time we act like it!"
