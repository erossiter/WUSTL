SEN. DOLE, REP. HAYES REINTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO BOOST TEXTILE NEGOTIATOR POSITION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole and Rep. Robin Hayes today reintroduced their bills to restore the rank of "ambassador" to the special textile and apparel negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, changing the title to "chief textile negotiator." In recent years, U.S. negotiators have encountered some obstacles because they did not carry the same rank as their foreign colleagues.  
   "Our textile trade representative must have the clout necessary to negotiate trade agreements that affect North Carolina textile jobs," said Dole. "Our textile workers deserve for the U.S. textile negotiator to be on equal footing with his foreign counterparts. I am proud to work with Robin Hayes in advocating for this important designation." 
   "America's domestic textile industry should have every advantage that other countries enjoy when it comes to USTR negotiations with foreign counterparts," said Hayes. "We will continue to push for comprehensive agreements that prevent countries, including China, from dumping illegal transshipments into our market, and I want to empower the USTR textile negotiator to protect American textile jobs." 
   Until four years ago, the special textile negotiator had the title of "chief textile negotiator" which carried the rank of ambassador and had to be confirmed by the Senate; however, the position was downgraded and no longer requires Senate confirmation. In addition to restoring the rank of "ambassador," Dole's and Hayes' legislation would permit the individual currently serving as the special textile negotiator to act as acting chief textile negotiator until confirmation by the Senate. 
   The chief textile negotiator, like the special textile negotiator, would be responsible for conducting trade negotiations and enforcing trade agreements relating to U.S. textile and apparel products.
