SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR MILITARY SPOUSES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today voted in support of an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill that would restore full survivor benefits to surviving military spouses who are dually eligible for the Department of Defense's Survivor Benefits Plan and the Department of Veterans Affairs Dependency and Indemnity Compensation program.  
   "So many folks in our military communities have waited a long time for Congress to correct these two inequities," said Dole. "Not only have our men and women in uniform sacrificed for the freedoms we enjoy, but their spouses have served with pride and dignity as well. We have a responsibility to keep our promise to them, and we need to send a strong message to our military families that we support their service and their sacrifice." 
   The amendment would end the deduction of VA survivor benefits from military SBP annuities when military service causes an active duty or retired member's death and would move up the effective date of 30-year, paid-up SBP coverage from October 1, 2008 to October 1, 2005.
