SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $12.6 MILLION HOUSING GRANT FOR LUMBEE TRIBE OF NORTH CAROLINA
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has approved a $12,662,958 Indian Housing Block Grant for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. According to HUD, these funds may be used for the development of affordable housing, housing services, management for low income housing and crime prevention.  
   "I applaud the Lumbee Tribe for securing this significant funding to better meet its members' housing needs," said Dole. "The positive results of safe and affordable housing can have a truly positive ripple effect throughout the tribe and community, including in the local economy." 
   The tribe was approved for this grant under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. 
   Background 
   Dole has introduced legislation to grant the Lumbee Tribe the full federal recognition and benefits they deserve. The Lumbee Tribe has been unfairly deprived this recognition for more than a century. As a result, the tribe has been denied the education, health care and economic development opportunities that would significantly benefit not just the tribe, but also the regional economy. 
   With more than 50,000 members, the Lumbee Tribe is the largest east of the Mississippi River, as well as the largest non-federally recognized tribe in America. North Carolina formally recognized the tribe in 1885, and three years later, in 1888, the tribe began what has become a very long quest for full federal recognition.
