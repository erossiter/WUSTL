SENS. DOLE, BURR ANNOUNCE $150,000 FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNICATIONS IN CONCORD, KANNAPOLIS, CABARRUS COUNTY
  U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act, which included $150,000 to improve communications within the Cabarrus County Sheriff's Office and the Concord and Kannapolis Police Departments. Dole and Burr worked to secure these funds, which would be used to provide new hand-held radios for local law enforcement.  
   "I applaud Cabarrus County and the Cities of Concord and Kannapolis for securing this significant funding," said Dole. "Our law enforcement officials are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. We should do everything we can to help provide the tools they need to keep our communities safe."
