SEN. DOLE ASKS SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION TO CONSIDER KEEPING EXIT 131 ON INTERSTATE 40 OPEN
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters and asked her to consider keeping Exit 131 on Interstate 40 in Catawba County open, as long as the public's safety would not be compromised. Exit 131, which provides direct access to North Carolina Highway 16, is scheduled to close in May in preparation of the opening of Exits 130 and 132. Federal regulations require that all exits be at least one mile apart and Exit 131 falls just short of this threshold.  
   Dole contacted Peters after hearing the concerns of the Catawba County Board of Commissioners and the Mayor of Conover. In her letter, Dole wrote: 
   "As I understand, many individuals commute to work from outside of Catawba County and rely on this interchange for easy travel to and from their places of employment. In addition, there are numerous businesses that depend on the resulting traffic to produce a substantial number of patrons. Besides a prevailing lack of accidents at this exit, local law enforcement officials believe that closing this ramp will lead to an increase in emergency response times and divert traffic into residential neighborhoods. 
   "As you know, safety is of the utmost importance when it comes to decisions involving our nation's highways. As a former Secretary of Transportation, I did not support any federal action where I thought safety considerations would be compromised. I do ask that you take a close look at the circumstances surrounding the closing of Exit 131 and give all due consideration to the possibility of leaving this interchange open, if the safety of the traveling public would not be undermined."
