SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $5.69 MILLION FOR MOUNT OLIVE COLLEGE FOUNDATION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that USDA Rural Development will loan $5,685,000 to the Mount Olive College Foundation.  
 The loan will be used for additional costs on the construction of three buildings. 
   "Having a high quality and accessible college is so important to the economic development of a community. Not only is the college itself a major employer, but it also helps educate the local workforce for existing and new jobs," said Dole. "I commend Mount Olive College for continuing to secure the funding necessary to expand its campus and better serve its students, faculty and surrounding community." 
   The buildings will include an academic building, which will house the Schools of Business and Mathematics, an Agribusiness Center, a Communications Center with two teleconferencing facilities, and a Wellness Center that will provide activities for both the college and community.
