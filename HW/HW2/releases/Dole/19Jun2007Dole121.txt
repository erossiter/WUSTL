IMMIGRATION BILL IS NO REAL SOLUTION
  In 1986, when Congress passed an immigration bill, an estimated three million illegal aliens residing in the United States were granted amnesty. At that time, promises to secure our borders and enforce our laws were made?but not kept. Today, an estimated 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens live in the United States. The U.S. Senate now has an opportunity truly to address the past failures that have put us in the current crisis. Unfortunately, the Senate immigration bill again puts the cart before the horse.  
   This bill rushes to legalize millions of illegal aliens, which is not the urgent matter at hand. We must first focus on securing our borders and enforcing our laws. I have heard from thousands of North Carolinians who ask me what is being done to address these pressing needs and to make our communities safer. Understandably, folks have no confidence that this is occurring. 
   Consider last year's authorization of 700 miles of border fencing - astoundingly, just two miles have been constructed! And, the catch-and-release of aliens who are committing crimes, such as drunk driving, has become commonplace. 
   Given that the Senate immigration bill was crafted in secret sessions by just a handful of senators, pertinent amendments deserved a place in the debate - for example, my proposal to ensure that illegal aliens convicted of drunk driving do not become repeat offenders. But when I tried to fix this serious problem, my commonsense amendment was blocked. Similarly, many of my colleagues had worthy, enforcement-focused amendments that were denied a vote. 
   When I saw a chance to derail this fundamentally flawed immigration bill, I acted on it. I stand ready to work to first address the real crisis - the security of our borders and the enforcement of our laws. We must not ignore history's lessons - we must get immigration reform right this time.
