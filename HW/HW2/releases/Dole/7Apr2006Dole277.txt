IMMIGRATION REFORM OBSTRUCTED BY POLITICAL GAMES
  This is a very disappointing day in the U.S. Senate. Today we have been denied a great opportunity to address one of the most important issues facing our country - passing legislation to secure our borders and provide real immigration reform. Once again, as with so many other issues, we have seen the other side obstruct, slow roll and delay. They have blocked our efforts to fix critical legislation through the amendment process and craft a bill that would increase security at our borders and respect for our laws. 
   Everyone should agree that our top priority must be to gain control of our borders. We need to increase the number of border agents, make better use of unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, sensors and other technology on the border, and have adequate facilities to detain those who are caught illegally entering our country.
   We are nation of immigrants, and we are also a nation of laws - and we can have both. By playing political games with immigration reform legislation and blocking amendments that would address critical issues, the other side has done a real disservice to the American people. Again, this is a very disappointing day.
