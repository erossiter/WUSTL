SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON LONDON TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today released the following statement regarding the terrorist attacks on London that occurred Thursday morning:  
   "My thoughts and prayers are with the people of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Blair. The loss of life they suffered today is a reminder that all nations are threatened by terrorism. The United Kingdom has been steadfast in its resolve to rid the world of terrorism and the regimes that support and encourage them. Terrorists have no regard for human life or for freedom, and I implore leaders around the world to denounce these cowardly acts. I also extend my support to President Bush as the G8 summit continues, and I echo his sentiment that the war on terror indeed goes on. 
   "On September 11, 2001, the world entered a new era, and Prime Minister Blair took a courageous and principled stand during a time that must have been politically lonely, and some might even say risky. But he stood strong for what was right and for what was just. For years, our nations have been close allies, and our allegiance to each other has been demonstrated time after time when our men and women have joined together to defeat a mutual threat." 
   In March 2003, Dole introduced legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Prime Minister Blair. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent in May 2003 and recognized Blair's staunch and unwavering leadership in the war against terror and his country's steadfast friendship with the United States. The bill became law on July 17, 2003.
