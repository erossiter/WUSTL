SEN. DOLE LAUDS 18TH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded news that the U.S. economy continues to expand, with a first quarter GDP growth of 4.8 percent - the strongest in 2 ? years. 
   "The U.S. economy is moving full speed ahead," said Dole. "More than 5.2 million jobs have been created since August 2003, and our national unemployment rate remains lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Especially during these historic and challenging times, we must ensure that America continues this steady growth - we must make tax relief permanent, reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources, eliminate unnecessary regulations on businesses, and focus special attention on education and job training programs.
   "Consider states such as North Carolina, where statewide our economy is trending positively; still, we have parts of our state where people have lost their jobs in traditional manufacturing industries. We've got to do everything in our power to ensure folks realize new opportunities, and educate our less skilled workers so that they can take advantage of the new jobs that are being created."
