SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF JUDGE CONRAD TO FOURTH CIRCUIT
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the nomination of Judge Robert J. Conrad to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Conrad is currently a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of North Carolina.  
   "Bob Conrad has had a remarkable legal career, establishing an impressive record of public service as a prosecutor and district court judge," said Dole. "I am confident that he would continue to serve with distinction on the Fourth Circuit, and I will work with my colleagues to swiftly move his nomination through the Senate confirmation process." 
   "North Carolina, the most populous state in the Fourth Circuit, has been severely underrepresented on the court for years and presently can claim only one Fourth Circuit judge," said Dole. "I welcome the nomination of Bob Conrad, and I encourage the president to give every consideration to naming another North Carolinian to fill one of several Fourth Circuit vacancies." 
   Conrad is a graduate of Clemson University and the University of Virginia Law School. He served as a federal prosecutor in Charlotte, starting in 1989. Among his numerous accomplishments, Conrad was appointed in 1999 by then-Attorney General Janet Reno to head the U.S. Justice Department's investigation into campaign fundraising abuses. From 2001 until 2004, he was the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, where he handled many high-profile cases, including the prosecution of a cigarette smuggling ring funding the terrorist group Hezbollah. Conrad was subsequently nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, where he has served with distinction for the past two years. 
   The Fourth Circuit seat to which Conrad is nominated has been vacant since 1994 and was declared a "judicial emergency" by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
