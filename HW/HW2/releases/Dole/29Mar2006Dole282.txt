SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM
  As the full Senate prepares to consider border security and immigration reform legislation, Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement: 
   "We are a nation of immigrants, and we also are a nation of laws. Legal immigration is important for the future of our nation - and we should encourage it. At the same time, unfettered and uncontrolled illegal immigration threatens our national security and our economy. It's time to resolve this issue.
   "Our borders are currently not secure, and this is totally unacceptable. Period. Our top priority must be to secure our borders, by increasing the number of border agents, making better use of technology, and having adequate facilities to detain those who are caught illegally entering our country.
   "I oppose any proposal that provides amnesty to those who have broken our laws and entered this nation illegally. I do recognize, however, that temporary foreign labor plays an important role in the agriculture, construction, and service industries in North Carolina and throughout the country. I would support legislation that secures our borders to stop future illegal immigration and then create temporary worker permits, where people can apply to work in this country for a limited period of time, as long as they pay taxes and obey the law. After a time, the workers would have to return to their home country to reapply for legal admission."
