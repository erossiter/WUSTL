SEN. DOLE COSPONSORS RESOLUTION TO HONOR STATE VETERANS HOMES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that she and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) introduced a Senate Resolution honoring the National Association of State Veterans Homes and the 119 state homes that provide long term care for military veterans. The resolution was approved by the Senate last Friday. 
   "North Carolina has one of the highest military retiree and veteran growth rates in the nation, and it is important that we continue to support that trend," said Dole. "Our veterans have made enormous sacrifices to protect our country and the freedoms we enjoy, and we have a profound responsibility to do everything we can to provide for their quality of life."
   Fayetteville, N.C. and Salisbury, N.C. have veterans homes. The state veterans homes program is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the states. The facilities qualify for per diem payments from VA, but are wholly owned and operated by the state.
