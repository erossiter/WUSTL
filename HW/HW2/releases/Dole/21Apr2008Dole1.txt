SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR REQUIRING IRAQ TO FUND RECONSTRUCTION, STABILIZATION COSTS
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole joined 10 of her colleagues in calling for requiring Iraq to fund a decidedly greater share of the costs for its reconstruction and stabilization. In letters to leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Senators said that they intend to offer an amendment to the Supplemental funding bill to require that much of the funding to Iraq be provided in the form of a loan.  
   "As a result of record-high oil prices, Iraq is expected to experience a significant financial windfall through oil revenues that has been estimated to be almost $56 billion, while domestic gas prices reach new highs and negatively impact our economy at home," wrote Dole and her colleagues. 
   "The time has come to end this blank check policy and require the Iraqis to invest in their own future. We believe that it is time for Iraq to take greater responsibility for the costs of its reconstruction and stabilization."
