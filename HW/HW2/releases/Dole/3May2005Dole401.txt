HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY RESPONDS TO SEN. DOLE'S INQUIRY ABOUT HIRING OF TEXTILE-FOCUSED CUSTOMS AGENTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today was informed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that it has begun hiring to fill 72 positions for textile transshipment enforcement operations. Sen.  
 Dole had previously requested an explanation of how funding designated by Congress for this purpose was being spent. 
   "I am pleased that the Administration now recognizes the problem of transshipment and is hiring Customs agents to focus specifically on keeping out illegal textiles, as directed by Congress," said Senator Dole. "Especially with the expiration of quotas, our textile industry needs trade agreements to be strictly enforced." 
   On March 7, 2005, Senator Dole wrote Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff calling for the department to explain why money Congress appropriated specifically for hiring Customs agents assigned to keep out illegal textile transshipments was not being used for that very purpose. During the past two years, Senator Dole has helped secure congressional funding for the hiring of these agents but learned from textile industry reports that not a single new agent had been hired. 
   "While I'm heartened the Administration is finally moving forward on this, it is my fervent hope that it will proceed expeditiously and complete this hiring ahead of schedule," said Senator Dole. 
   Senator Dole has worked with other members of the North Carolina delegation, specifically Senator Burr and Representatives Coble, Hayes and Myrick, in stressing to the Administration how important the hiring of these agents is to the textile industry. 
   According to Secretary Chertoff, all 72 positions are to be filled by the end of December 2006 and will include overseas positions, import specialists, and audit, analytic and investigative staff.
