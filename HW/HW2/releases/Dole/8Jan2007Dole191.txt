SEN. DOLE CONCERNED THAT PROPOSED AGREEMENT WITH MEXICO COULD RESULT IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL WORKERS WHO COMMIT FRAUD
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole cosponsored the Social Security Totalization Agreement Reform Act of 2007, introduced last week in the Senate. The bill would require that both the Senate and House of Representatives consider and approve totalization agreements, which are deals that permit workers from other countries to receive U.S. Social Security benefits for work performed in the United States.  
   Recent reports suggest that President Bush is considering a proposal to enter into a totalization agreement with Mexico. Although totalization agreements technically grant benefits only to legal workers, there is concern that workers who are unlawfully in the United States will be able to collect benefits for illegal work if they are later granted amnesty. 
   "Any agreement that would allow workers from other countries to collect benefits from our already strained Social Security system must be carefully considered and subject to approval by Congress," said Dole. "I have particular concern that this proposed agreement with Mexico could ultimately allow individuals to claim benefits for work done illegally through the use of fraudulent Social Security numbers. This would be wrong, and would be terribly unfair to American and legal workers who have followed the law and put their hard earned dollars in the Social Security system." 
   Dole has consistently opposed granting amnesty to those who have broken our laws and entered this nation illegally. She voted against the bill that passed the Senate last year, and also supported a measure to prevent those who fraudulently use a U.S. citizen's Social Security number from accumulating and collecting Social Security benefits. 
   The United States currently has 21 totalization agreements in effect with other countries, all of which are developed nations with modern economies similar to ours.
