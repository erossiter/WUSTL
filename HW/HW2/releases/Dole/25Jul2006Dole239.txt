SEN. DOLE VOTES TO PROTECT CHILDREN, FAMILIES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today voted for the Child Custody Protection Act, which was passed by the Senate 65 to 34. Dole is an original cosponsor of the bill, which would make it a federal offense to transport a minor across state lines in order to circumvent a home state law requiring parental notification or consent prior to an abortion.  
   "In most schools, an underage child cannot go on a school field trip or get an aspirin without a permission slip signed by a parent," said Dole. "This legislation prevents that same child from being taken across state lines to circumvent laws requiring parental notification or consent before obtaining an abortion." 
   Currently, 37 states, including North Carolina, require parental involvement before a minor can get an abortion. This legislation would protect minors in North Carolina and other states with notification or consent laws from being taken to other states that do not have such laws. 
   "We must protect those most vulnerable in our society," said Dole. "And we must foster a culture that respects life." 
   Background 
   Parental notification/consent laws are often circumvented by adults who transport minors to neighboring states that do not require parental notification or consent. Many abortion clinics in states without parental involvement laws actually encourage such interstate activity by using "No Parental Consent Required" as a prominent "selling point" in ads run in neighboring states that enforce parental involvement laws.
