SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $50 MILLION FOR NORTH CAROLINA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN JOBS BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that North Carolina would receive $50 million in economic development funds under the FSC-ETI/JOBS Bill.  
 North Carolina is included in the Tobacco Community Economic Development Grants program in this bill. 
   "Areas of North Carolina continue to struggle economically, and our rural communities are certainly no exception," said Dole. "I am pleased that this bill includes a program that will spur growth and economic development in rural North Carolina. I will continue to work all angles to achieve a Tobacco Quota Buyout in this bill, which will provide the greatest help to our rural communities and farm families." 
   The grants will be issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Tobacco Community Economic Development Grants program allows state agriculture departments to request funding from USDA for specific projects in their states.
