SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $1.9 MILLION LOAN TO MURPHY FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that USDA Rural Development will issue a $1.9 million loan to Murphy Fire Department under the Community Facility Direct Loan program.  
   "I applaud the town of Murphy for securing this significant funding," said Dole. "Firefighters are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. It is so important that they have adequate facilities so that they can effectively protect the communities they serve." 
   The loan funds will be used for a new 11,000 square-foot volunteer fire department. The existing facility is located in the museum basement and is inadequate. The new facility will improve the fire department's response time, capabilities, and likely its insurance rating. The lower insurance rating would reduce the premium for each property owner in the district.
