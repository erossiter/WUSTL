SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR ACTION TO HELP NORTH CAROLINA SMALL, SEASONAL BUSINESSES
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole has called for Senate and House leaders to bring forward legislation renewing the H-2B returning worker provision, which expired in September 2007. This returning worker program allows North Carolina small and seasonal businesses that rely on temporary labor to rehire individuals who have previously worked for them on an H-2B guest worker visa. Some affected industries include tourism, fishing, landscaping and restaurants. 
   "The current cap of 66,000 visas is not nearly enough to meet the labor needs of the nation's small and seasonal businesses without a returning worker provision," wrote Dole. "I hear concerns from business owners throughout North Carolina regarding this issue and am compelled to advocate for them. These employers dutifully file their paperwork every year to comply with current immigration law, and unlike some of their competition, they will shut down their businesses before they will resort to hiring an illegal workforce. Their timely compliance with the law should enable them to hire returning H-2B workers.
   "Considering the current economic slowdown, this is certainly the time to move forward with a policy that would promote economic growth and save American jobs."
   Background
   The United States has two main programs for temporary lower-skilled workers. Agricultural guest workers enter through the H-2A visa program, and other guest workers (non-agricultural temporary workers) enter through the H-2B visa program.
   Employers who wish to hire guest workers under either program first apply to the U.S. Department of Labor, which must determine and certify that qualified U.S. workers are not available and the employment of foreign guest workers will not negatively impact the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers.
