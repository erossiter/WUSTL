NORTH CAROLINA TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR PROVIDING REFUGE TO HURRICANE KATRINA EVACUEES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded President Bush for declaring that an emergency exists in North Carolina as the state provides refuge to more than 1,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees.  
 This declaration allows state and local governments access to federal funding. 
   "In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, North Carolina and other states across our nation are extending a warm welcome and helping hand to our fellow citizens who have been forced to leave behind their homes and belongings and evacuate their towns," said Senator Dole. "I am very pleased the President recognizes the generosity of North Carolinians and has pledged this aid to allow our state to best provide assistance to these folks who desperately need our help." 
   The President's action makes federal funding available to North Carolina and all 100 counties. The state and eligible local governments are directed to use funding for measures undertaken to save lives and protect public health and safety.
