SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS NEW NORTH CAROLINA JOB NUMBERS AS STATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS TO 4.3 PERCENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded news that the North Carolina unemployment rate dropped to 4.3 percent in January 2006, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
   "This is indeed a good report for the North Carolina economy - jobs are being created and more folks are at work," said Dole. "Statewide our economy is trending positively; still, we must continue to focus special attention on the areas of our state where people have lost their jobs in traditional manufacturing industries. We've got to do everything in our power to ensure folks realize new opportunities, and educate our less skilled workers so that they can take advantage of the new jobs that are being created."
   According to the Department of Labor, North Carolina was one of four states to post gains in employment from December 2005 to January 2006, with an increase of 11,700 jobs.
   The national unemployment rate for January 2006 was 4.7 percent, down from 4.9 percent in December 2005.
