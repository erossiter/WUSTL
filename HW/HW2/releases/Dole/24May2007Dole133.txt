SEN. DOLE COSPONSORS MEASURE TO ENSURE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ALERT FEDS TO SUSPECTED IMMIGRATION VIOLATIONS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole cosponsored an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 that would ensure that local law enforcement officials can inquire about individuals' immigration status during routine investigations and in turn report suspected violations to federal law enforcement agencies. The amendment was defeated in a 48-49 vote today.  
   "Local law enforcement officials are on the front lines of defending our homeland," said Dole. "They must have the tools to obtain and share critical information when they suspect a violation of immigration law." 
   This amendment would have removed obstacles in state and local laws that prevent law enforcement agents from acquiring information about a person's legal status and reporting that information to the appropriate federal authorities. Currently, a number of cities throughout the nation, including Durham, N.C., have instituted ordinances forbidding local law enforcement officers to inquire whether a person is in the U.S. lawfully. 
   This amendment would not have required local law enforcement to use their own resources to enforce federal immigration laws, conduct immigration raids, or act as federal agents. 
   While Dole supports this amendment, she opposes the current immigration reform bill. 
   "I recognize that immigration reform is urgently needed, but I cannot support the current bill being considered in the Senate because it creates a new path to citizenship for those here illegally. While this bill includes some good measures - such as modifying the broken H-2A system for farmers to obtain legal workers - the amnesty this bill provides is a deal-breaker for me," she said.
