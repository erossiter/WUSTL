SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $143 MILLION TO BE INVESTED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Treasury Department will provide $143 million in New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) to Wachovia Community Development Enterprises, LLC to invest in low income communities. The NMTC program allows qualified investors and institutions to receive a federal income tax credit for investments in designated low-income communities, thereby stimulating development, economic growth and job creation. 
   "North Carolina is already benefiting from the results of the New Market Tax Credits program," said Dole. "This program has brought about development in low-income areas, such as Gaston College Prep Charter School in Gaston and the American Tobacco Campus in downtown Durham, which have made dramatic differences in their communities.
   "I have been impressed with the outstanding results of this program, and I am excited about the many new opportunities that will be made possible through today's announcement."
