SEN. DOLE NAMED RANKING MEMBER ON ARMED SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today was named the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. The subcommittee has jurisdictional oversight on issues including defense science and technology, homeland security, special operations, nonproliferation and terrorism. Sens. Carl Levin and John McCain, the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, today made the announcement that Dole will hold the senior Republican position on the subcommittee.  
   "It is indeed an honor to be named ranking member of this subcommittee," said Dole. "North Carolina is a strong military state, and the issues this subcommittee covers are important to our state - especially with the growing North Carolina technology sector, and the significant number of special operations forces based at Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune." 
   As ranking member, Dole will work closely with the subcommittee's chairman, Senator Jack Reed, to plan hearings and advocate for issues important to North Carolina's military presence when drafting the defense authorization bill. 
   Dole has four years of experience as a member on the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. Today she was also named a member of the Subcommittee on Personnel and the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support. 
   "As a senator representing more than 100,000 North Carolina-based service members, I am so proud to work for these men and women and their families on the Senate Armed Services Committee," said Dole.
