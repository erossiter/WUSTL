SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES IMMIGRATION COURT COMING TO NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice will be establishing a new immigration court in North Carolina. The court is projected to open in the Charlotte area as early as this fall.  
   "I am very pleased that North Carolina will soon have a much-needed immigration court," said Dole. "In just the last decade, the number of immigrants living in North Carolina has gone from 170,000 to over 590,000--an increase of nearly 250 percent! According to the Pew Hispanic Center, our state has the eighth-largest illegal population the country. This immigration court will have a very positive impact on the federal government's ability to process and adjudicate immigration violations within the region." 
   In August 2006, Dole wrote to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and called on him to establish an immigration court in North Carolina. Rep. Sue Myrick has also been a very strong advocate for the immigration court. 
   According to a Pew Hispanic Center report, of the 14 states with the largest illegal immigrant populations, North Carolina is the only one currently without an immigration court. North Carolina cases have been processed through the immigration court in Atlanta.
