SENATE PASSES PROJECT BIOSHIELD ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced passage of S. 15, the Project BioShield Act of 2004.  
 This bill focuses on developing protections and countermeasures against chemical, radiological and nuclear agents that could be used in a terrorist attack, as well as making drugs and vaccines more distributed and available. 
   "Although we must take every measure to prevent a terrorist attack on our soil, it is critical that we are coordinated on a local, state and federal level in the event such an attack occurs," said Senator Dole. "The Project BioShield initiative also seeks to ensure an attack does not have the catastrophic consequences intended by terrorist networks." 
   In addition to authorizing $5.593 billion over 10 years for procurement of countermeasures against an attack, which includes drugs and biological products, this bill also provides for compensation for individuals with injuries resulting from the administration of smallpox vaccine.
