SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION GRANT FOR WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA HURRICANE RECOVERY EFFORTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission has approved a $1 million grant for hurricane recovery efforts in 16 Western North Carolina counties.  
   "In the wake of two storms, with potentially another storm on the way, there is significant need for assistance in Western North Carolina to help individuals and businesses get back on their feet again," said Dole. "It is so important that the region receives the resources to rebuild infrastructure, schools, public buildings and health care facilities." 
   According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, primary consideration will be given to communities that require basic water and sewer infrastructure improvements and to projects that need assistance resolving health, safety and environmental quality issues. The community projects that will be selected will have to demonstrate economic development recovery aspects, and the retention or creation of jobs. It is anticipated that 100 jobs will be created or retained as a result of the projects to be assisted. 
   Background 
   The 16 counties in Western North Carolina that will eligible for assistance under this grant include: Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, and Yancey. Various communities within the 16-county area will provide a $1,000,000 match to the grant, bringing the total project cost to $2 million. 
   The State of North Carolina Small Cities / Community Development Block Grant program will administer the individual project proposals.
