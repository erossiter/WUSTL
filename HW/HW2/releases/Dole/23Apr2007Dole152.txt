SEP. DOLE CALLS FOR NATIONAL PARKS FUNDING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, along with 39 of her colleagues, is calling on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies to support $1.97 billion in funding for operations of the National Park System in fiscal year 2008. This would be a $211 million increase from the prior fiscal year. 
   In a letter to Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Larry Craig (R-Idaho), chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Dole and her colleagues wrote: "We recognize the fiscal constraints facing the Committee during these tight budget times. However, there is strong public support for America's parks, and the public expects our parks to be adequately protected and visitors educated and inspired by these natural and cultural wonders. We must provide the parks with the federal investment needed to restore these national treasures by their Centennial, which is less than ten years from now. Our national parks should be a national priority."
   North Carolina has a significant National Park System presence including the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Blue Ridge Parkway, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Cape Lookout National Seashore and Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
