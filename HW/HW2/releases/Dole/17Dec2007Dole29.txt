SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR FUNDING PROGRAM THAT DEVELOPS TREATMENTS FOR COMBAT WOUNDS
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, joined by nine of her colleagues, wrote Secretary of Defense Robert Gates urging him to advocate for funds for the Medical Free Electron Laser (MFEL) program in the president's fiscal year 2009 budget request. The MFEL program develops technology and treatments to provide immediate and long-term care for service members wounded in combat.  
   "Our commitment to fully train and equip our forces is accompanied by a moral responsibility to take all reasonable steps to care for them when wounded," wrote Dole and her colleagues. "Proper medical care also includes the development of new limb- and life-saving techniques and technologies for the modern battlefield." 
   Some of the MFEL program's current projects include treating infected wounds without using powerful antibiotics that damage kidneys; repairing severed nerves, blood vessels, tendons, cartilage and eye wounds; and detecting collapsed or soon-to-collapse lungs with a miniature camera. 
   "The success of this program, and its continued importance to the survival and care of wounded service personnel, both on the battlefield and afterward, certainly justifies continued funding," wrote Dole and her colleagues. 
   The 20-year-old MFEL program has been allotted on average $20 million annually, but it is expected to not be included in the president's budget request for fiscal year 2009, which will be sent to Congress by early February 2008. 
   Background 
   Dole helped secure $2.4 million for the MFEL program in the fiscal year 2008 defense appropriations bill, which was recently signed in to law by the president. Duke University is currently participating in the program along with Harvard University, Stanford University, Vanderbilt University and the University of California, Irvine.
