  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will provide a $1,875,000 loan and a $1,217,000 grant to the Little River Water District in Smithfield, North Carolina. 
   "It is critical that communities have strong infrastructure to support residents, sustain current industries and attract new businesses," said Senator Dole. "I applaud Little River Water District for securing the funds for this important project." 
   The funding will go towards phase I of a new water distribution system. The new system will serve the eastern part of Johnston County. The project will provide water service to 480 residential users, who currently rely on private wells.
