SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR CHARLOTTE GANG OF ONE PROGRAM
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act, which included $250,000 for the Gang of One Pilot Program in Charlotte. Dole worked to secure these funds to provide a resource network to help young people who are being pressured to join a gang or who need assistance getting out of a gang.  
   "I applaud the Gang of One Pilot Program for securing this significant funding," said Dole. "North Carolina has a dramatically growing gang presence, including MS-13, which is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous gangs in America. Gangs pose a serious threat to our safety, and it is imperative that we give our communities the tools they need to help young people stay on the right track and to keep our families out of harm's way." 
   Note: The Senate version of the CJS appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
