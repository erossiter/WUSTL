SEN. DOLE REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole tonight made the following statement regarding the president's State of the Union Address:  
   "The president hit on some extremely important topics ranging from economic security to national defense - and it's now time for Congress to get down to business and produce results. We need to work in a bipartisan way to swiftly advance a stimulus package that helps North Carolinians, especially those in greatest need. 
   "I look forward to holding the Administration accountable on immigration and border security issues, such as finishing construction of 670 total miles of fence along the border by the end of this year and streamlining guest worker programs so that North Carolina industries like agriculture have access to the temporary labor they need to fill the jobs Americans do not want. 
   "I am very pleased that the president called on Congress to continue enacting the recommendations of the Dole-Shalala Commission on Wounded Warriors. When a service member is injured while answering the call of duty, they deserve to receive the very best care possible. 
   "Finally, I welcome the president's call to rein in wasteful spending and look forward to supporting measures that ensure Washington spends the taxpayers' dollars wisely."
