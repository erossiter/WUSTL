SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES BILL TO HELP NATIONAL GUARDSMEN, RESERVISTS AVOID DEPLOYMENT-RELATED FINANCIAL STRAINS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, joined by Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.), today introduced legislation that would allow national guardsmen and reservists called to active duty for at least six months to make early withdrawals from their IRA, 401(k) or 403(b) retirement accounts without having to pay a 10 percent tax penalty. 
   "Members of our National Guard and military reserves play a pivotal role in keeping America safe, always standing ready to put their daily lives on hold and answer the call of duty," said Dole. "Our guardsmen and reservists can face lengthy deployments that require them to leave not only their loved ones, but also their regular jobs and paychecks. This abrupt cutoff of a family's main source of income can obviously result in major financial strains."
   Dole's bill would make permanent Section 827 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which allows guardsmen and reservists to make these types of penalty-free withdrawals. Earlier this year, the Senate approved a Dole amendment to the congressional budget resolution that extended the expiration of Section 827 from the end of 2007 to 2012.
   "As we continue to fight the Global War on Terror, members of the Guard and Reserve are going to be called upon more and more," said Dole. "We can send a message of support by allowing these men and women continued penalty-free access to their retirement savings if they find themselves in a deployment-related financial crunch. These families should not have to accrue debt or borrow against their homes just to make ends meet."
