BRAC COMMISSION VOTES TO EXPAND FORT BRAGG
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole made the following statement regarding today's vote by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission to expand Fort Bragg:  
   I am pleased the Commission recognized the tremendous military value of Fort Bragg and voted for its expansion. The relocation of FORSCOM and the Reserve Command solidifies Fort Bragg's status as a truly indispensable base and a critical component of our national security. 
   Dole, the senior Senator from North Carolina, is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   Background: 
   The Commission approved the relocation of the headquarters of the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) to Fort Bragg. FORSCOM is the Army component of United States Joint Forces Command and the Army's largest major command. Additionally, the headquarters of the U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) will relocate to Fort Bragg. Some Europe-based troops are to be relocated to Fort Bragg, and the base will gain 4,325 jobs (4,078 military, 247 civilian, 0 contractors). 
   The Commission today considered the realignment or closure of Army and Navy/Marine Corps facilities and the realignment of Joint Cross Service Groups. Votes on other military facilities will occur later this week.
