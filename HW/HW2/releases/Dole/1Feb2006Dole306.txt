SEN. DOLE RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
 Sen. Elizabeth Dole tonight made the following statement regarding President Bush's State of the Union Address:  
   "Tonight, the President presented a bold, optimistic vision, which I applaud - a vision of security, prosperity and leadership. And the President is right - America will continue to lead. 
   "I support President Bush's steadfast commitment to winning the War on Terror. We are indeed committed to an historic goal in pursuing the enemies of freedom, and our men and women in uniform from North Carolina are playing a key role. They are on the front lines every day defending our homeland and spreading freedom and democracy. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will continue working to ensure they have the resources they need to carry out their duties and complete their mission. 
   "I was very pleased that the President focused on keeping the American economy competitive - in North Carolina, we know all too well the challenges of a global economy. We must ensure that we continue to be a nation leading in education, job training, and innovation, and must do everything in our power to make sure that all individuals have opportunity for years to come. 
   "Our nation does have other challenges - challenges that the President strongly acknowledged - reducing the deficit, increasing border security, making health care more affordable, and reducing the cost of energy. We have worked to address these challenges in the Congress and will continue to do so. And as we move forward, North Carolina's priorities will remain my top priorities."
