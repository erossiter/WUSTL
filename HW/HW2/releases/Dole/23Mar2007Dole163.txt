SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOLE AMENDMENT TO SUPPORT RURAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE
  Today the Senate approved an amendment offered by Sen. Elizabeth Dole to the congressional budget resolution that paves the way for future legislation to provide additional funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development's water and wastewater loan and grant program. It is estimated that USDA Rural Development needs nearly $2 billion to fully fund the existing backlog of pending water and wastewater loan and grant applications. Dole's amendment, which is fully offset, will allocate an extra $50 million per year for five years, resulting in an additional $250 million for water and wastewater loans and grants for America's rural communities.  
   "There is no question that water access and water quality are critical needs in our rural communities," said Dole. "Many of these communities do not have the tax base to renovate or construct water and wastewater systems, and as a result, these communities lack the infrastructure to adequately support residents, businesses and additional economic growth." 
   In North Carolina, it is estimated that there will be $16 billion in water and wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 25 years. 
   The Senate's version of the congressional budget resolution must be reconciled with the House of Representatives' version. Dole will work with her colleagues to ensure funding for water infrastructure remains in the final congressional budget resolution and in the appropriations bill.
