ASHEVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT TO RECEIVE $1.9 MILLION GRANT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that Asheville Regional Airport will receive a $1,938,019 grant from the Federal Aviation Administration, part of the United States Department of Transportation.  
 The funds will be used to modify the terminal building and to acquire an aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicle. 
   "As a former Secretary of Transportation, I know how important it is for airports to have the proper infrastructure," said Senator Dole. "I applaud Asheville Regional Airport for securing the funds to make their facility as safe and efficient as possible." 
   Funding will be used for a new 3,000 gallon storage capacity aircraft rescue and fire-fighting vehicle. The grant will also provide funding to reorganize areas of the terminal so that space can be used more effectively.
