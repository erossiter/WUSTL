SEN. DOLE PRAISES SPEECH BY IRAQI PRIME MINISTER MALIKI
  Today Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki addressed a joint session of Congress. Sen. Elizabeth Dole made the following statement following his remarks: 
   "Today, history was made when Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the head of Iraq's first-ever permanent democratic government, addressed the United States Congress. In this landmark event, the prime minister underscored that success in Iraq is key to winning the War on Terror - and I could not agree more.
   "When I was in Iraq in May, I had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Maliki soon after he was elected. I saw then, as I saw again today, a proud, strong and determined leader, committed to fostering his country's fledgling democracy, to standing up their security forces, and growing their economy. It is my hope that the prime minister's visit to America has only reinforced for him and the Iraqi people that our nation continues to stand firmly with Iraq as we defeat a common enemy."
   Background:
   Dole, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, visited Iraq in May 2006 and was the first Member of Congress to meet with Prime Minister Maliki.
