SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $111,104 FOR HICKORY METRO HIGHER EDUCATION CENTER
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Department of Education will grant $111,104 to the Hickory Metro Higher Education Center (HMHEC).  
   "Hickory Metropolitan Higher Education Center plays an important role in educating and training the local workforce to meet the challenges of new opportunities," said Senator Dole. "The Hickory area has suffered from manufacturing job losses, and community colleges and centers such as HMHEC offer a real beacon of hope, helping displaced workers learn new skills for new jobs." 
   The funding will help HMHEC expand its educational programming. To achieve this, the center plans to expand the staff, operate a full 12-classroom curriculum and enroll a minimum of 1000 adults in the degree and credit programs.
