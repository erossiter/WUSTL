SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES GRANTS TOTALING $78.4 MILLION TO NORTH CAROLINA FOR HOUSING, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
  Senator Elizabeth Dole announced today that the State of North Carolina will receive grants totaling $78,433,496 from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  
   "These grants from HUD will help strengthen North Carolina communities through development projects and home ownership initiatives," said Dole. "Neighborhoods and communities are improved when adequate affordable housing is available to those who need it most and when home ownership is attainable for low-income and minority families. Initiatives that meet these needs truly benefit us all." 
   The grants are as follows: 
   * Community Development Block Grant $52,465,304 
   Program provides annual grants to states and local governments to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities principally for low and moderate-income persons. 
   * HOME Investment Partnership $21,526,782 
   Program helps expand supply of decent, affordable housing to low-income families by providing grants to state and local governments to meet local needs. A new initiative under the HOME program, the American Dream Downpayment Initiative, will promote home ownership by providing necessary resources for downpayment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority households. Downpayments are one of the largest barriers to home ownership for low-income families. 
   * Emergency Shelter Grant Program $2,359,410 
   Program provides annual grants to state, local and private entities to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters. 
   * Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS $2,082,000 
   Program provides housing assistance and related support services to local governments, states and non-profit organizations for projects that benefit low-income persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and their families.
