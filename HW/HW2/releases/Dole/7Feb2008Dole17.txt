SEN. DOLE VOTES FOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today voted in favor of an economic stimulus package that will provide tax rebates for more than 100 million eligible Americans, including seniors and disabled veterans.  
   "I am pleased that the Senate has come together to approve a stimulus package that targets Americans who need it most," said Dole. "I also welcome this bill's tax incentives to help businesses invest in new equipment and facilities and create jobs." 
   Provisions of the economic stimulus package will: 
   * Provide tax rebates of $600 for eligible individuals, $1,200 for eligible joint-filing couples and an additional $300 for eligible filers for each child under age 17; 
   * Include 20 million seniors and 250,000 more disabled veterans than the House-passed bill; and 
   * Require that only people with valid Social Security numbers can qualify for tax rebates. 
   The House of Representatives must approve the Senate-passed bill, or differences between the two versions must be resolved, before a final stimulus package can go to the president for his signature.
