SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $6.3 MILLION IN USDA EMERGENCY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FUNDS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced today that twenty-one counties in North Carolina will receive disaster relief funds as part of the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP).  
 Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Clay, Durham, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Orange, Polk, Rutherford, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga, and Yancey counties will receive funds totaling $5,607,400 and $750,000 will go to Duplin County. 
   "This funding is vitally important for farmers who have struggled to get back on their feet since Hurricane season," said Senator Dole. "Timely relief is critical to allowing our hardest hit North Carolina communities begin the rebuilding process." 
   The funding can be used by farmers for cleaning up farmland, restoration of fences and conservation structures, to provide water for livestock, and to grade and shape farmland damaged by Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Isabel.
