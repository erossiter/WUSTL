SEN. DOLE EMPHASIZES STRENGTH OF NORTH CAROLINA'S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AT HEARING WITH BRAC COMMISSION CHAIRMAN NOMINEE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today re-emphasized the strength of North Carolina's military installations during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.  
 The hearing was on the nomination of Anthony J. Principi to be Chairman of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. 
   Dole made the following remarks to Principi at the hearing: 
   "With our current world commitments, we must do everything possible to ensure that not one taxpayer dollar is wasted and that every resource and installation is essentially dedicated to keeping our military men and women safe and effective. This BRAC round must be, more than anything, untarnished by political influence. 
   "That being said, North Carolina supports a unique military infrastructure in that all of our major installations and training ranges are located in the Eastern part of the state, creating an unrivaled region of military value. The strong joint mission ties between Seymour Johnson and Pope Air Force Bases, Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, and Marine Corp Air Station Cherry Point, to include the Naval Depot, are only a hint at the possibilities that exist for expansion, not closure." 
   - Senator Dole to Anthony J. Principi, nominee for Chairman of BRAC Commission.
