SEN. DOLE: REPLACING YADKIN RIVER BRIDGES OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote to North Carolina Secretary of Transportation Lyndo Tippett expressing her concerns about the Interstate 85 bridges over the Yadkin River in Rowan County. The following are excerpts from her letter:  
   "As a Senator for North Carolina and a resident of Rowan County, I am concerned about the Interstate 85 bridges over the Yadkin River in Rowan County. Replacing the bridges is of utmost importance, particularly to the individuals in the 60,000 vehicles that cross the bridges daily. 
   "In the Senate, I have made every effort to secure federal funding for specific transportation projects in North Carolina when feasible and appropriate. My understanding, however, is that this option is not in order for the new Yadkin River bridges because of the way that the state's current equity formula distributes transportation funds, including those received from the federal government. In fact, I have been asked not to request directed federal funds for this project by individuals within NCDOT because if provided, this funding could eliminate transportation funds for other much-needed projects in the area. 
   "It is my hope that your office will work with local officials to determine the most effective and efficient way to construct new I-85 Yadkin River bridges, and I continue to stand ready to work to support this project at the federal level."
