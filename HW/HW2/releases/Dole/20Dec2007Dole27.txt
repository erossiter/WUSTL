SEN. DOLE: I WILL CONTINUE MY STRONGEST EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressing her disappointment that Congress was not able to pass a three-month extension for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) prior to closing the first session of the 110th Congress. The Department of Labor, however, has indicated that the recently approved Omnibus Appropriations Act will provide resources to meet the needs of current and future displaced workers through fiscal year 2008.  
   "As you know, North Carolina typically has some of the nation's highest numbers of TAA worker certifications, and it is vitally important that displaced workers continue to have access to these vital resources," wrote Dole to Chao. "In 2008, I will continue my strongest efforts\x85to strengthen the TAA program." 
   Earlier this year Dole introduced a bill to improve the existing TAA program to meet the needs of today's workers.
