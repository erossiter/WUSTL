SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI HANDOVER
  "Today is indeed a new day for the people of Iraq. We must do all we can to support the Iraqis and their brave leaders in this establishment of a free and democratic country. Our ability to turn over control to a peaceful and sovereign Iraqi Government truly is an integral part of the overall War on Terror, and we have no choice but to succeed. The world is watching, and even more, those who desperately want to derail our efforts are watching - and we must demonstrate that evil and oppression will not prevail in the face of democracy." - Sen. Elizabeth Dole.
