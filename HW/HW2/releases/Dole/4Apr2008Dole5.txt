SEN. ELIZABETH DOLE TO HUSBAND BOB: 'YOUR JAYHAWKS ARE GOING DOWN!'
  In a heated phone exchange today, Sen. Elizabeth Dole threw down the gauntlet with husband Bob. After hearing him gloat one too many times this week about his Kansas Jayhawks, Elizabeth had enough and told Bob to put his money where his mouth is.  
   The couple has agreed to a wager that the loser (Bob) will donate $1,000 to the academic scholarship fund of the winning team's school (UNC) and will also assume dog walking duties for the next month for their miniature schnauzer Leader. 
   "One North Carolina team already had Kansas on the ropes, and now it's time for the Tar Heels to finish the Jayhawks off," said Elizabeth Dole. "Bob better get out his checkbook and put on his walking shoes!"
