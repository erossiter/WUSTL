INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE APPROVES LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the decision of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to approve the Lumbee Recognition Act, a bill Dole introduced to provide full federal recognition and benefits for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. 
   "Today we have cleared another major hurdle in achieving long-deserved federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe," said Dole. "The Lumbees have patiently waited for more than a century for full federal recognition and the benefits that accompany that recognition. I commend the Indian Affairs Committee for understanding that this is an issue of fairness and approving this legislation."
   Federal recognition would make critical funding and benefits available to the 50,000 Lumbees, most of whom live in and around Robeson County, North Carolina. The Lumbee Tribe is the largest American Indian tribe east of the Mississippi River and the largest non-federally recognized tribe in the United States.
   BACKGROUND
   Dole's legislation to fully recognize the Lumbee Tribe was also approved by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee during the last Congress.
   North Carolina has recognized the Lumbee Tribe since 1885, but in 1956 the Lumbees were only partially recognized by the federal government. Partial recognition has deprived the Lumbees of critically needed federal assistance.
