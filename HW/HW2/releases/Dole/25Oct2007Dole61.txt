SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA-WILMINGTON NURSING SCHOOL
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which included $250,000 for the School of Nursing at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington for new technology and other educational materials. The school is expanding its program to educate more nurses to help alleviate the state's nursing shortage. 
   "I applaud the UNCW for securing this significant funding," said Dole. "No question, North Carolina greatly needs more nurses, and this program is helping address this critical need by equipping more students with the skills and knowledge to serve North Carolinians' healthcare needs." 
   Note: The Senate version of this appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
