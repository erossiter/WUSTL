SENS. DOLE, BURR PUSH FOR OREGON INLET FUNDING
  Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr today introduced legislation to provide $6.5 million to the Army Corps of Engineers to continue dredging operations at Oregon Inlet.  
   "It is my fervent hope that our action today will further highlight the importance of Oregon Inlet to our state and our coastal economy," said Senator Dole. "Oregon Inlet is a vital navigation channel, and we need to work towards finding a long-term solution for maintaining this essential waterway." 
   "Oregon Inlet provides vital commercial and recreational access," said Senator Burr. "It's critical that we do all we can to ensure the Inlet's long term future." 
   Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will provide $500,000 in additional funding for dredging Oregon Inlet, which will allow operations to continue at the inlet for another 30 days. 
   Senators Dole and Burr introduced this legislation as an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, which will provide critical funding for our troops and the Global War on Terror. 
   BACKGROUND 
   Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that they would have to discontinue dredging at Oregon Inlet because Fiscal Year 2005 funding had been exhausted. 
   Alternate access to the ocean is located 80 miles to the south and 120 miles to the north of Oregon Inlet; therefore, this inlet provides the only access to the ocean for a long distance along the North Carolina coast.
