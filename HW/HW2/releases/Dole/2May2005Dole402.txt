SEN. DOLE URGES U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE TO MEET DR-CAFTA CONCERN OF TEXTILE INDUSTRY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole is urging U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman to step up negotiations on certain provisions of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement that would affect the U.S. textile industry.  
 Of particular concern to Sen. Dole is the current problem with the rule of origin for non-visible pocketing and linings. While the text of the treaty is complete, there is still some flexibility on how this provision will be implemented should the agreement pass. 
   "North Carolina is the heart of our nation's textile industry and it is very important to me to ensure that this tradition continues," said Senator Dole in correspondence to Portman. "In recent months, I have shared a myriad of concerns regarding this agreement with the Administration and have been working diligently to have these issues addressed. While progress has been made on several fronts, there is one issue that remains very problematic and that is the rule of origin for non-visible pocketing and linings." 
   Under the current DR-CAFTA, non-visible pocketing and linings can be sourced from anywhere in the world, including China, while visible lining must be sourced regionally. Under the current CBTPA agreement, which covers DR-CAFTA countries, U.S. textile companies ship approximately $100 million in pocketing and lining fabric to the region annually. 
   "While this is a very significant business for U.S. producers, it only affects ten percent of current CAFTA exports to the United States," Senator Dole added. "I understand that several possible solutions to this problem have been proposed, and I strongly encourage you to closely review these options and to do your utmost to resolve this problem."
