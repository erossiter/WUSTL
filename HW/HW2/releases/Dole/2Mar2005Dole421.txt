SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DEATH OF FORMER REP. FOWLER
  "I am devastated by the passing of Tillie Fowler.  
 Tillie and I worked together in the White House Office of Consumer Affairs during my early years in Washington, and she has remained one of my dearest friends for over thirty years. I regarded Tillie like a sister, and am so proud to be godmother to her daughter, Elizabeth. 
   "Tillie was beloved by so many in the Capitol, in Washington, and throughout Florida. The eight years she spent in the U.S. House of Representatives, where she earned a reputation as one of the hardest working and most effective members of Congress, were full of accomplishments. She was nothing less than the embodiment of a woman who could achieve anything. Her compassion, grace, warmth and cheerful personality will always live in my heart. Bob joins with me in sending our love, our prayers, and our support to her husband Buck, and her daughters Tillie Anne and Elizabeth."
