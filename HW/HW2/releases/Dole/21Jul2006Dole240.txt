NORTH CAROLINA EMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH IN JUNE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded news that North Carolina's unemployment remained low in June, keeping steady with the national rate of 4.6 percent. North Carolina was one of 11 states that experienced the largest increases in payroll employment over the month with a 0.3 percent increase, and since June 2005, the state's overall employment has increased by more than 106,000. 
   "It is indeed good news that North Carolina's unemployment remains on par with the low national rate," said Dole. "In just the past year, our national economy has created nearly two million new jobs, and the unemployment rate remains lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Also, consumer confidence has continued to rise, and the first quarter GDP results of this year were revised upwards to an impressive 5.6 percent. This has resulted in higher than expected tax revenues and a decline in the deficit. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 we have seen one of the highest growths in tax revenues in 25 years - second only to last year.
   "These are indeed indicators of a robust and expanding economy; still, I share the concerns of the American people that energy prices continue to increase. There is no question these costs are putting a real strain on families and businesses, and in Congress we are working to develop real solutions to our energy security issues.
   "In addition, as our overall economy is thriving, I am ever mindful that there are areas in North Carolina where the economic picture is not quite as bright, where factories and businesses have closed and folks are out of jobs. It is imperative that we continue to look for new economic development opportunities in our state and educate our less skilled workers so that they can take advantage of the jobs that are being created."
