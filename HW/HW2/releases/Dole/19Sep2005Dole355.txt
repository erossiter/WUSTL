SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR COAST GUARD
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today joined a bipartisan group of her colleagues in urging Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten to support supplemental funding of at least $500 million for the U.S. Coast Guard to help cover its Hurricane Katrina costs.  
 Because of its response to Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard's operational funds have been seriously depleted, and many costs are not reimbursable by the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA). 
   "During and following Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard worked tirelessly and heroically to perform more than 33,000 rescues, clear shipping channels and restore navigation aids," said Senator Dole. "The Coast Guard certainly rose to the challenge, as they have so often in my own state of North Carolina when disaster strikes, and these brave men and women deserve our support. They must have the resources necessary to carry out their important mission." 
   Some expenses not covered by FEMA include operational expenses, construction of temporary facilities, repairs to small boat stations and air stations, as well as new construction to replace those facilities destroyed by the hurricane. Additionally, approximately 70 percent of Coast Guard personnel stationed in the Gulf Coast region have experienced major loss of personal property. The Coast Guard will be required to temporarily house all those members and their families for an unknown period of time. 
   Background 
   As Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Dole oversaw the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2002, the Coast Guard became part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
