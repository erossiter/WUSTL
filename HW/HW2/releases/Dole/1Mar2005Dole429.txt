SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $73,447 GRANT FOR PEMBROKE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) will grant $73,447 to the Pembroke Volunteer Fire Department.  
 The department will use the funding for operations and firefighter safety. 
   "It is so important that our firefighters have the adequate facilities, training, and equipment to safely and effectively do their jobs," said Dole. "Our firefighters are there for us in times of need, and they literally are on the front lines defending our homeland." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
