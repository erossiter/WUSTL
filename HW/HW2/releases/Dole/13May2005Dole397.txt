SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS ADMINISTRATION FOR INVOKING CHINA SAFEGUARDS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the announcement from the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) that the Administration will invoke the China Safeguards for three product categories based on actual damages as well as threatened damages.  
 The Administration approved safeguard cases covering cotton shirts, cotton trousers, and cotton and man-made fiber underwear. 
   "This is a very positive step by the Administration, and I am particularly pleased that they have invoked the safeguards on a threat basis," said Senator Dole. "I have talked on numerous occasions with Commerce Secretary Gutierrez and the White House about the need to act, and I applaud their willingness to aggressively use the guarantees for our textile industry that China agreed to, when it was allowed entry into the World Trade Organization."
