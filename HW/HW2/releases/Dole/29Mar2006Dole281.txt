SEN. DOLE COSPONSORS TRADE ENHANCEMENT ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole is an original cosponsor of the U.S. Trade Enforcement Act of 2006, which was introduced Tuesday evening. This legislation would help stop unfair trade practices through addressing currency imbalances and bolstering trade enforcement capabilities. 
   "Our manufacturers in North Carolina and across the country have been harmed by unfair trade practices and manipulated currency rates," said Dole. "As America continues to increase its exports and imports, it is critical that our trade partners play fairly - we should not be on the losing end when some countries circumvent the rules. This legislation sends a powerful message from Congress to countries such as China that enough is enough."
   Highlights of the Trade Enhancement Act
   Addresses imbalances in foreign exchange rates
   * Replaces current currency provisions with a new regime to give the United States additional tools to address currency imbalances that harm the U.S. economy
   * Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to identify misaligned currencies that adversely affect the U.S. economy
   * Provides new tools to address these currencies
   * Creates a new Assistant Secretary at the Treasury Department to improve oversight of currency issues
   Bolsters U.S. trade enforcement capabilities to focus on trade barriers of greatest significance to manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, innovators, and service providers
   Improves trade enforcement at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) and enhances Congressional oversight
   * Requires USTR to work more closely with Congress to identify and resolve the most significant market access barriers.
   * Creates at USTR a Senate-confirmed official to enforce trade commitments
   * Closes the loophole in U.S. trade remedy law that permits new shippers to evade antidumping and countervailing duties.
   Background
   Since 2003, Senator Dole has taken repeated steps to address the devaluation of China's currency, the yuan. In February 2005, Dole joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing legislation to address China's refusal to revalue the yuan. The legislation would penalize China for undervaluing the yuan by authorizing the United States to impose a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese products across the board should further negotiations with the Chinese to revalue their currency fail. The provisions in the Trade Enhancement Act create additional incentive for non-market economies, such as China, to address glaring monetary policy and currency manipulation issues or face the consequences.
