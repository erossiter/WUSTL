SEN. DOLE: OFFICE OF FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE OVERSIGHT REPORT CONFIRMS DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT FANNIE MAE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding a report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) on its investigation into accounting and management practices at Fannie Mae: 
   "The OFHEO report not only confirms my deep concerns about Fannie Mae - it demonstrates that the agency's actions were even worse than I imagined.
   "There is no doubt that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need a strong regulator to ensure that the manipulation and deception in Fannie and Freddie's accounting practices has been forever banished from both institutions. No clearer argument can be made for the swift consideration and passage of legislation to create a strong regulator of these enterprises."
   Background
  In July 2005, the Senate Banking Committee approved legislation introduced by Dole and her colleagues Senators Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and John Sununu (R-NH) that would improve oversight of Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE). The bill, the Federal Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act (S. 190), must now be considered by the full Senate.
