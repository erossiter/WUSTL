SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS RETIREMENT PAY PROVISIONS TO BENEFIT GUARD, RESERVISTS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today voted in support of an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 National Defense Authorization Act that will benefit National Guard members and Reservists who serve significant periods in active federal status, or on active duty, by reducing the age eligibility for retirement pay.  
   "As we continue to fight the War on Terror, members of the Guard and the Reserve are called upon more and more," said Dole. "This amendment sends a strong message that we appreciate their service and the critical contributions they make to our national security." 
   The amendment would provide Guard and Reserve personnel with a 3-month reduction from the current retirement age of 60, for every 90 days of mobilized active-duty service. To be eligible for this age reduction, service members must be under a call to active service authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by federal funds. 
   At present, approximately 30% of our total force in Iraq and Afghanistan is comprised of members of the Guard and the Reserve. According to statistics from the Citizen-Soldier Support Program (based in Chapel Hill), North Carolina is home to more than 21,000 Guard and Reserve members.
