SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR FULL FUNDING FOR NORTH CAROLINA STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, along with 28 of her colleagues, urged Senate leadership to fully fund a long-term extension of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) if a reauthorization of the program is not enacted by December 14, 2007, when the current extension will expire. North Carolina is one of 21 states that would face a shortfall without a fully funded long-term extension.  
   "We believe that a reauthorization of SCHIP is the best way to avoid shortfalls," wrote Dole and her colleagues. "But if a reauthorization is not enacted before December 14, we strongly urge you to plan for a fully-funded long-term extension to end the uncertainty facing our states and preserve coverage for thousands of children."
