SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $700,000 LOAN FOR CHATHAM COUNTY COUNCIL ON AGING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will provide a $700,000 loan to Chatham County Council on Aging, Inc.  
 The funding will be used to purchase and renovate a building for the council. 
   "I am so pleased that the Chatham County Council on Aging has secured these funds," said Senator Dole. "As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am committed to serving the needs of our seniors. North Carolina has experienced a significant increase in our senior population as many people have chosen our beautiful state as their place to retire." 
   The 12,000 square-foot center will provide services such as physical fitness and wellness programs, a transportation hub for the Chatham transit network, and a pharmacy operated by the Chatham County Health Department. The facility also will have a commercial kitchen and will prepare meals for home delivery throughout the county. Plans are to offer employment opportunities to senior citizens and "Work First" participants, a program with the Chatham County Department of Social Services.
