SEN. DOLE: FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY CONTINUE TO BE EMBRACED BY IRAQI PEOPLE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today released the following statement: 
   "We are facing a critical moment in history - for Iraq, the Middle East, and the United States.  
 The overwhelming success of today's elections proves once again that freedom and democracy continue to be embraced by the Iraqi people. From the landmark elections in January and October to today's first-ever free election of a permanent Iraqi government, this past year has been one of tremendous progress for the Iraqi people. I applaud the millions of men and women who have made their way to the polls for their undeterred desire for freedom and peace. 
   "We owe this success in Iraq to the steadfast commitment of our president and the dedication of our brave men and women in uniform working on the ground each day alongside Coalition and Iraqi forces. As we head into the New Year, I anticipate that partisan attacks from those here at home who choose to undermine our mission in Iraq will continue. But this historic year - a year when generations of Iraqis went to the polls to vote for democracy - will record that the naysayers are wrong."
