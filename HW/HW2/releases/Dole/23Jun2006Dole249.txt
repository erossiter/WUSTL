SENATE PASSES DOLE MEASURE TO HELP LEJEUNE WATER CONTAMINATION VICTIMS
  The U.S. Senate late yesterday approved the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization bill, which includes a provision authored by Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Jim Jeffords that helps individuals exposed to contaminated water at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, N.C. The contaminated wells were closed in 1985, but the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has found that babies exposed in utero to the drinking water developed leukemia and other cancers, as well as birth defects, such as spina bifida and cleft palate. 
   "I have heard from constituents and other Marine families whose children have suffered birth defects and even fatal illnesses, and these families believe that their tragedies were caused by water contamination at Camp Lejeune," said Dole. "We must uncover and evaluate the facts about this incident - and I am hopeful that this provision will help those families who are seeking answers."
   The Dole-Jeffords measure requires the National Academy of Science to review ATSDR's earlier study and identify any medical causes of adverse health affects, which could eventually lead to benefits for the victims. In addition, the amendment directs the Marine Corps to notify through the national media those potentially affected by contamination.
