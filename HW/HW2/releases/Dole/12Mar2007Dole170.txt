SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR MORE IMMIGRATION, CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AGENTS IN NORTH CAROLINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole has called on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to remedy the severe shortage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in North Carolina. Dole is concerned that among other problems, these shortages make it difficult to deport illegal immigrants who are convicted of driving while intoxicated or impaired.  
   Below are excerpts from Dole's letter to Julie L. Myers, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 
   "In just the last week, a 9-year-old boy and his father lost their lives in an accident caused by an intoxicated person who was in the United States illegally. This person had been convicted twice--yes, twice--of driving while impaired, and had an outstanding warrant stemming from a probation violation. I wish I could say that this was the first such fatal incident in North Carolina, but similar stories have become increasingly common. 
   "ICE agents in North Carolina have stated that they are understaffed and that they lack the resources to remove undocumented aliens convicted of DWI offenses. State and local authorities similarly claim that ICE officials cannot and do not respond because they lack sufficient personnel. This is unacceptable and must be addressed immediately. 
   "ICE's clear mission is to protect our nation and the American people--and there is no greater threat on our roadways than intoxicated and impaired drivers. Because ICE has the largest number of investigators and the most expansive investigative authority within the Department of Homeland Security, it is uniquely positioned to enforce existing immigration laws against unlawful aliens who drive while impaired. I therefore strongly urge you to make this a top priority."
