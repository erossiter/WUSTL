SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES SENATE SUPPORT OF $3 MILLION FOR CHARLOTTE SEWER PROJECT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Senate has approved $3 million in authorized funding for the City of Charlotte's Briar Creek Relief Sewer Project in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Dole advocated for this funding with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Senate's version of WRDA must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives' version. 
   "It is so important that communities have the infrastructure they need to support residents, sustain current industries and attract new businesses," said Dole. "I look forward to working with local officials and the Army Corps of Engineers to move this important sewer project forward."
   A final bill will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and before it goes to the president for his signature. Following this action, the WRDA will give the Corps of Engineers the authority to visit the City of Charlotte to study local water project needs before funds are appropriated.
