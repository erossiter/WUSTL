SEN. DOLE: ELIMINATION OF BORDER SECURITY FUNDING IS OUTRAGEOUS
  Today U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today expressed her frustration that $3 billion for border security and enforcement measures had been stripped out of a spending bill. The funding, which was overwhelmingly approved in a 95 to 1 vote by the Senate in October, was taken out the final fiscal year 2008 defense appropriations bill behind closed doors. 
   "It is outrageous that the leadership yanked this critical funding from the final bill," said Dole. "The Senate spoke loud and clear on this issue, and now a select few have decided to ignore the number one lesson learned from the Senate's failed immigration bill - that Americans simply don't have confidence that their government is serious about securing our borders and enforcing our laws."
   The $3 billion would fund border security and enforcement measures, including 700 miles of border fencing, 45,000 detention beds, and training and tools for local law enforcement to handle criminal illegal aliens. As a result of Dole's leadership, North Carolina is the first state in the nation to have a statewide partnership and plan for sheriffs to coordinate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This plan, which is in its early implementation stages, will ensure that North Carolina sheriffs can readily access the tools that they need to identify, apprehend and remove undocumented aliens who have self-identified themselves by committing crimes.
   Dole took part in a press conference today with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Jim Demint (R-S.C.), Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Mel Martinez (R-Fla.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.).
