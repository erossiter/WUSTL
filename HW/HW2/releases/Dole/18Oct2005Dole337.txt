SEN. DOLE COSPONSORS BILL TO TACKLE BUREAUCRATIC WASTE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that she is cosponsoring the Commission on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA) Act.  
 This legislation would create a bipartisan commission to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of federal agencies' programs and submit to Congress recommendations for realigning or eliminating programs where inefficiency, waste, or fraud are found. 
   "We must be good stewards of the taxpayer's dollar," said Dole. "Programs paid for by the American people should be carefully scrutinized and held to the highest standards for integrity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness." 
   The CARFA Act calls on the presidentially appointed commission to propose legislation to implement its recommendations to realign or eliminate wasteful or duplicative programs. Congress would be required to vote up or down on the recommendations. 
   This bill has been referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
