SENS. DOLE, SCHUMER PLACE WAGER ON HURRICANES-SABRES SERIES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole accepted a friendly wager from Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) on the Carolina Hurricanes - Buffalo Sabres National Hockey League Eastern Conference Finals, which start tomorrow. Dole bet two dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts on the Hurricanes claiming victory in the series, and Schumer put up a bucket of Anchor Bar Buffalo wings in favor of the Sabres winning. 
   "I know better than to get into a war of words with my friend Chuck Schumer, so I'm just going to let our Carolina Hurricanes win the battle on the ice and bring home another Eastern Conference Championship," said Dole.
