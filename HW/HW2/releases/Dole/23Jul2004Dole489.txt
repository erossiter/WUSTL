SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $6 MILLION RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN TO CALDWELL COUNTY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that a $6 million loan from United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development will be awarded to Caldwell County, which will be used to construct a 45,000 square-foot Teacher Training Facility on the campus of Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute.  
 The teacher training program is a partnership between CCC&TI and Appalachian State University. 
   "I applaud Caldwell County, an area that is recovering from textile and furniture layoffs, for securing this funding for a job-training facility at their community college," said Senator Dole. "This project will allow more teachers to be trained at the local level, which is greatly needed as our schools face teacher shortages." 
   The faculty and curriculum of the teacher training program is provided by ASU. Future teachers may enroll in the program by pursuing an Associate Degree from the community college and then complete their teaching degree requirements on the same campus. 
   According to USDA Rural Development, this project is designed to address a projected shortage of 5,000 teachers over the next 10 to 12 years. Additionally, the project will allow teachers now teaching on "conditional" certificates to upgrade their training.
