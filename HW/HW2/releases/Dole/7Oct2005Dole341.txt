SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS FUNDING FOR INCREASED BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded Senate approval of the Fiscal Year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Report, which includes more than $31 billion for operations of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including customs, border and immigration enforcement and other measures. The bill also includes $9.5 billion for U.S. Customs to oversee textile transshipments enforcement, which is critical to the North Carolina textile industry. Dole has been a strong advocate of such measures. The bill now goes to President Bush for his signature.  
   "I believe this spending bill is an important step towards enhancing our transit security as well as our border security, but there is absolutely more work that needs to be done," said Dole. "Border patrol and immigration enforcement is one of the greatest challenges facing our Nation today. We are a country of immigrants but we are also a country of laws. There are those who seek to come to this country to pursue the American dream, but there are also those who seek to exploit our immigration laws at the expense of our national security. We must continue to address this very real situation. 
   "I am also pleased that this bill contains funding for the hiring of additional customs agents to monitor incoming textiles. As a senator from a textile state, I have continued to press for this much-needed funding, because we must put an end to the hemorrhaging of jobs due to illegal textiles coming from countries such as China."
