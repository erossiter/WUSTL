SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO ASHEVILLE SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote the Administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and asked her to help improve access to the Social Security Administration (SSA) Field Office in Asheville. A constituent had made Dole aware that the local SSA office is unreachable by public transportation.  
   "This logistical challenge has placed an undue burden on disabled, elderly and economically disadvantaged citizens in the area by limiting access to needed services provided by the SSA," wrote Dole in a letter to GSA Administrator Lurita Doan. "Since the field office opened at its current location in 2003, citizens who must use buses to reach this office have been required to walk three-quarters of a mile - much of it uphill - along a road without sidewalks. This situation clearly needs to be remedied in a timely manner, and deserves the attention of the General Services Administration." 
   Dole is asking the GSA to work to resolve this issue and to prevent this type of situation from occurring in the future.
