SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding Hurricane Katrina:  
   "My heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to our fellow citizens along the Gulf Coast and other areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. There have already been countless lives lost as a result of this disaster, and unfortunately the devastation continues. As a former president of the American Red Cross I have a deep appreciation for the great work that private agencies perform while working closely with our first responders at the state and local level. 
   "The victims of Katrina need your help and compassion now. A donation to the American Red Cross or other relief agencies will help provide shelter, food, water, and other critical assistance for those in need." 
   To provide assistance please visit www.redcross.org or call 1-800-HELP-NOW, or visit www.fema.gov for a list of other relief agencies.
