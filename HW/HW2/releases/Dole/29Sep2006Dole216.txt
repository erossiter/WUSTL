SEN. DOLE LAUDS DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PROVISIONS TO PROTECT SERVICE MEMBERS FROM PREDATORY LENDING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization conference report contains a number of provisions to protect members of the armed forces and their families from predatory lending practices. These provisions were recommended in an August 2006 Department of Defense report on predatory lending to the military, required by legislation that Dole authored. 
   "The Department of Defense report painted a powerful picture of the many problems brought about by predatory lenders that target military families," said Dole, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "As a senator representing more than 115,000 North Carolina-based service members, I take this issue very seriously - because predatory lending harms not only our troops and their families, but also our nation's military readiness. I am delighted that these very important safeguards were included in the conference report and will soon become law. I especially praise Senator Jim Talent who offered the amendment to impose a much-needed interest rate cap on loans to the military. He has been a real leader in fighting for our service members in this and so many other areas."  
   Highlights of the provisions in the conference report: 
   * Requires a 36 percent annual interest rate cap on loans to service members. Dole offered legislation in 2005 to impose such a cap and in 2006 co-sponsored the amendment introduced by Senator Talent that set this cap. 
   * Requires that clear and uniform price disclosures be given to all service members and their families whenever credit is extended. 
   * Prohibits lenders from using checks, access to bank accounts and car titles as security for financial obligations. 
   * Prohibits lenders from requiring military families to waive their rights to take legal action or exercise any legal protections. 
   * Prohibits states from applying different treatment to service members and family members stationed within their borders, and prohibits lenders from making loans to service members that violate consumer protections of the state in which their base is located. 
   * Directs the Secretary of Defense to issue regulations to implement predatory lending protections for service members. 
   The House of Representatives has approved the Defense Authorization Conference Report, and the Senate is expected to vote on it before adjourning for October. 
   Background: Dole's predatory lending legislation 
  Many young troops, like many young people across the country, do not have a cushion of savings to use in an emergency, and most are not educated in financial management. Lending can be an alluring option for a young soldier to get cash fast and easy, but predatory lending practices can send an individual into a spiral of debt. 
   Predatory lending practices can also have serious ramifications for our military's operational readiness. Military conduct codes stress financial solvency, and a member with bad credit and mounting debt can face potentially career-ending disciplinary measures. 
   Dole's legislation required the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Chairman of the FDIC, and representatives of military charity and consumer organizations to provide to Congress a report that includes: 
   * An assessment of how predatory lending is being directed at members of the armed services; 
   * A list of current and future programs to prevent or eliminate predatory lending to service members; including education on predatory lending for service members and their families; and 
   * Specific legislative and executive branch actions that should be undertaken to further address this problem.
