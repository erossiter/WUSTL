SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOLE'S 'GO DIRECT' RESOLUTION
  The U.S. Senate yesterday evening approved a resolution introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Dole that encourages Americans to "Go Direct" and sign up for direct deposit to receive their Social Security and other federal benefits.  
   "Direct deposit eliminates the risk of lost or stolen checks, prevents identity theft and fraud, gives people more control over their money and saves taxpayer dollars," said Dole. "I encourage our seniors and all Americans to take advantage of this opportunity." 
   The federal government mails more than 150 million benefit checks each year, and if all benefit recipients used direct deposit, taxpayers would save around $132 million a year. Since 1986, direct deposit has saved taxpayers $6.6 billion. 
   "With 77 million baby boomers approaching retirement age starting in January this year, direct deposit is an increasingly important tool to save taxpayer dollars," said Dole. 
   The Go Direct campaign is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks. 
   Background 
   People interested in signing up for Go Direct may call the toll-free helpline at 1-800-333-1795, go to www.GoDirect.org, or visit their local bank, credit union or Social Security office. Social Security number, bank routing number (found at the bottom of personal checks) and account number are required for signing up.
