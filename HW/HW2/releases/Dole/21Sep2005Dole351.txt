SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $3.4 MILLION FOR HYDE COUNTY COURTHOUSE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will loan $2,650,000 and grant $750,000 to Hyde County for construction of a new courthouse facility.  
   "I am so pleased to announce this significant funding for Hyde County," said Dole. "In light of the damage caused when Hurricane Isabel hit our state, funding for this project is greatly needed and will be a tremendous asset to the community." 
   The existing Hyde County Courthouse was heavily damaged by Hurricane Isabel and condemned. According to USDA Rural Development, funding will be used to construct a new 7,590 square-foot courthouse and an administrative building that will include a 15,000 square-foot county administration facility, a 16,330 square-foot public safety facility and a 32 bed detention center.
