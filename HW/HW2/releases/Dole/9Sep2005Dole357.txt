SEN. DOLE URGES DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO PLACE HURRICANE KATRINA EVACUEES IN VACANT MILITARY HOUSING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote to Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Philip Grone urging the Defense Department to consider placing Hurricane Katrina evacuees in former and excess military housing.  
   "The housing located on former and active DoD bases and installations may provide a significant number of those evacuated with a home and a community environment where they can begin to restore their lives," wrote Dole to Grone. "I ask you to consider placing Gulf Coast evacuees in former or excess military housing, either on a temporary or long-term basis. 
   "At a time when our nation is at war, the Department of Defense has provided unprecedented support for victims of Hurricane Katrina; however, we must utilize all possible resources to help our fellow Americans during this crisis at home." 
   Background 
   Since 1992, the Department of Defense has closed many bases and installations, but DoD still owns the property. Also, as the military has privatized much of its housing, there is more available excess housing on active bases and installations. The housing units on bases are already equipped with the basic infrastructure such as water, sewer, and electricity, whereas tents and trailers require installation of this infrastructure.
