SEN. DOLE COSPONSORS RESOLUTION URGING EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN IN IRAQI CONSTITUTION
  Sen. Dole has joined a bipartisan group of senators to become an original cosponsor of a resolution that encourages equal rights for women in the Iraqi constitution.  
 The Iraqi National Assembly is expected to approve a draft of their constitution by August 15 and hold a national vote by October 15. 
   "Since U.S. military operations began in Iraq, millions of women have been liberated and now share many of the same freedoms we enjoy," said Dole. "It is important that as the Iraqis adopt a constitution they do not backtrack, but rather that they move forward and allow women a meaningful role in the building of their nation. In the United States, we must continue to send a strong message that women can make profound contributions in this emerging democracy." 
   Iraq is currently governed under the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), which includes provisions that provide equality for all Iraqis, regardless of gender. However, there are concerns that the current draft of the constitution weakens the TAL's provisions on equality, including the TAL's requirement that 25 percent of the parliament seats be held by women. Currently 31 percent of the seats in Iraq's National Assembly are occupied by women. Women also lead the Iraqi ministries of Displacement and Migration, Telecommunications, Municipalities and Public Works, Environment, Science and Technology, and Women's Affairs. 
   Background 
   Senator Dole was an original cosponsor of Senate Resolution 38, which commended the Iraqi national elections on January 30, 2005. The resolution included a measure calling for the establishment of a government in Iraq that "respects the rights of women and all minorities."
