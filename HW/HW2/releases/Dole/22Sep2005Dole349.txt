SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS IN VIETNAM
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that she has asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to keep the country of Vietnam on its list of "Countries of Particular Concern" as a result of its gross violations of religious freedom.  
   "In America, we are fortunate to have many freedoms, but sadly those freedoms are not shared or even tolerated by some countries around the world. It is important for us, as a country with these unparalleled freedoms, to make clear that religious persecution by the Vietnamese government is not condoned," said Senator Dole. 
   In a letter to Secretary Rice, Dole highlights the significant persecution of Montagnards in that country. In July, 2005, nine Montagnards were imprisoned for "inciting" their fellow citizens to participate in demonstrations on Easter 2004. There are more than 4,000 Montagnards living in North Carolina today. 
   While Vietnam has taken some strides in the last year by releasing some political prisoners, the government has failed to meet other requirements such as legalizing banned religious groups and returning church properties. 
   Background 
   Senator Dole also contacted President George W. Bush in May 2005, urging the administration to address concerns over Vietnam's human rights record during the visit of Prime Minister Phan Van Khai to the United States.
