SENS. DOLE, BURR ANNOUNCE UP TO $2 MILLION FOR RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE'S BIOFUELS PROJECT
  U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr today announced that the Research Triangle Institute of Research Triangle Park will receive an investment of up to $2 million from the U.S. Department of Energy for biofuels research and development.  
   "It is critical to our security that we reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, and it is critical to our environment that we have clean energy sources," said Dole. "I am proud that innovative work is being done in North Carolina to develop solutions to these significant challenges facing our nation." 
   "North Carolina's budding renewable fuels industry is quickly gaining national attention because of important projects like this one," Burr said. "I applaud RTI and N.C. State for working to grow North Carolina's economy and reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources." 
   According to DOE, the grant will allow the Research Triangle Institute, in partnership with North Carolina State University and the University of Utah, to generate synthesis gas derived from tree products, including wood, leaves and needles. The funds will be used to develop a reactor that will transform and remove substances like tar, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from the tree-derived synthesis gas. Phase 2 of the project will involve development of a different reactor that will convert the clean synthesis gas into liquid fuel for cars, trucks and other forms of transportation. 
   DOE will provide up to $2 million for the $3.1 million project.
