SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $700,000 FOR UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA-EAST CAROLINA UNIVERSITY PROGRAM IN RACIAL DISPARITIES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which included $700,000 for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and East Carolina University Program in Racial Disparities and Cardiovascular Disease. Dole worked to secure funding for the project, which examines how racial disparities contribute to differences in health care, especially with regard to cardiovascular disease. 
   "Cardiovascular disease causes 36 percent of all deaths in North Carolina, making it the leading cause of death in our state," said Dole. "I applaud UNC-Chapel Hill and ECU for securing this funding to study a disease that afflicts too many North Carolinians." 
   Note: The Senate version of this appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
