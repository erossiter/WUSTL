SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $350,000 FOR LEVINE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which included $350,000 for the Levine Children's Hospital at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. Dole worked to secure funding to help purchase a "multi-slice" computed tomography (CT) scanner for the hospital's Pediatric Imaging Center. 
   "I was honored to participate in the ribbon cutting celebration at Levine Children's Hospital last weekend," said Dole. "I applaud the hospital for securing this funding for equipment that best meets the unique needs of pediatric patients. Many young Carolinians will now be able to receive care much closer to home, and they will lead healthier, more productive lives, thanks to this children's hospital." 
   Note: The Senate version of this appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
