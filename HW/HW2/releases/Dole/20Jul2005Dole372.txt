SEN. DOLE COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today made the following statement regarding the President's decision to nominate Judge John Roberts of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to the U.S. Supreme Court.  
   "I commend President Bush for the very deliberate way in which he arrived at the decision tonight to nominate Judge Roberts to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Judge Roberts is an outstanding choice. His demonstrated intellect, experience, and integrity will serve him well on the Supreme Court. It is my hope that the Senate will move expeditiously and with civility through confirmation hearings to a final up or down vote on the Senate floor, as has been the tradition in this institution for more than 200 years. North Carolinians and the American people deserve no less."
