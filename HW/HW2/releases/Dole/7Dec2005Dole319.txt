SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S SPEECH ON IRAQ
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today released the following statement: 
   "I was pleased to hear the president discuss today the strategy we are pursuing for reconstruction in Iraq.  
 For decades, this country, its infrastructure and its economy were neglected by a brutal dictator. Now liberated Iraqis, working alongside the Coalition, are making real progress in securing and rebuilding their country. And this positive message needs to reach the American people. 
   "The rebuilding of Iraq is critical to the long term success of this fledgling democracy and the broader U.S. agenda in the Middle East. The progress being made is evident - in the new public services, infrastructure, free press, economic activity, and legal institutions that are emerging in Iraq. 
   "Any timeline for withdrawal from Iraq must be driven by continued success - not artificially tied to a calendar. A constitutional democracy is taking hold in Iraq, and the Middle East is moving towards greater stability. It is integral to the continued progress in this region and to the overall War on Terror that we stand firm and not allow the insurgents to derail our mission."
