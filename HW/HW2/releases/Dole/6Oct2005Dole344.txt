SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR HURRICANE VICTIMS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole has joined a bipartisan group of senators in urging White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Joshua Bolten to support funding for mental health care services for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  
   "For many of the hurricane victims and relief workers, the magnitude and duration of the traumas they are experiencing place them at great risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder, severe anxiety, depression, and other mental and emotional disorders," wrote Dole and her colleagues. "The overwhelming evidence shows that mental health interventions will prevent or mitigate those outcomes." 
   Dole and her colleagues are asking OMB to provide resources for mental health services for children and adolescents, as well as first responders and relief workers. They are also requesting resources to expand the capacity of existing emergency hotlines and telehealth services for underserved areas, and to provide long-term, formal mental health services.
