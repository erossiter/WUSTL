SEN. DOLE PRAISES PASSAGE OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole tonight supported passage of the $34.8 billion Department of Homeland Security appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2007. Dole successfully advocated for a provision in the bill for a new search and rescue training facility for the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Elizabeth City, which is home to the nation's only training facility for Coast Guard rescue divers. Dole also worked to include $9.5 million for U.S. Customs to oversee textile transshipments enforcement, which is critical to the North Carolina textile industry.  
   The bill dedicates $16 billion for border, port and maritime security. It adds 1,500 new border patrol agents, over 2,700 new detention beds, and $1.2 billion specifically for border security fencing, infrastructure and technology. In addition, the bill protects our nation against weapons of mass destruction, providing $480 million for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. 
   "In our post 9/11 world, we cannot separate national security from border security and I am pleased we are providing the tools necessary to keep Americans safe," said Dole.
