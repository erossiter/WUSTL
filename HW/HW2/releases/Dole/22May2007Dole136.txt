SEN. DOLE, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE STOP OVER-SPENDING ACT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today joined Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and 22 of their colleagues to introduce the Stop Over-Spending (S.O.S.) Act of 2007. This legislation would encourage fiscal discipline within the federal government, set consequences for overspending, reduce the federal deficit and balance the budget by 2012.  
   "It's high time that we restore fiscal discipline to government, and the Stop Over-Spending Act will help do just that - by eliminating wasteful spending, strengthening the budget process, and seeking solutions to the looming financial crisis facing entitlement programs, " said Dole. "No question, we must address these issues now, so that future generations are not burdened by out of control deficits and unmanageable entitlement program growth." 
   The Stop Over-Spending Act of 2007 would: 
   * Reinstate statutory caps on discretionary spending; 
  * Create an automatic deficit reduction mechanism to balance the budget by 2012; 
  * Allow the president to rescind individual projects from spending bills and send them back to Congress for an up-or-down vote; 
  * Create a bi-partisan commission to look for waste, fraud and abuse within government programs and; 
  * Strengthen and improve the budget resolution and reconciliation processes. 
   Background 
   Dole has sponsored and cosponsored Senate measures to provide the president the authority to "veto" or rescind individual earmarks, so that wasteful spending can be stopped in its tracks.
