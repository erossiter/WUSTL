SEN. DOLE CALLS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today called for full funding of the Community-Based Job Training Grant Program, which supports community colleges, in the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies spending bill for fiscal year (FY) 2006.  
   For FY 2005, the program was funded at $250 million. The House-passed version of this spending bill provides no funding for this program for FY 2006. (The House bill designates $125 million in funding for FY 2006 while at the same time rescinding $125 million of the FY 2005 funding.) Dole seeks to restore full funding in the Senate bill and has received the assurance of Senator Arlen Specter, the chairman of subcommittee that oversees this spending bill, that his committee is committed to funding the program at the highest level possible. 
   "So many men and women across our country have lost their jobs, and our traditional manufacturing industries have been hit especially hard," said Dole. "In the midst of this economic transition, community colleges have been a real beacon of hope." 
   "I am grateful to Chairman Specter for his attention to my concerns and for his continued commitment to this important program," said Dole. "Community colleges are on the front lines, training workers and helping grow our economy - and we can and should do better to assist them in this endeavor." 
   Since 2002, North Carolina has received approximately $78 million in Community-Based Job Training grants, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.
