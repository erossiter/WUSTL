SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS HOUSE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF LUMBEE RECOGNITION BILL
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the House Natural Resources Committee's approval of a bill providing full federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe. The legislation, which was introduced by Rep. Mike McIntyre, would provide federal recognition and benefits for the tribe. Dole has introduced companion legislation in the Senate. 
   "Today we have cleared a significant hurdle in achieving long-deserved federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe," said Dole. "I congratulate the Lumbee people on today's milestone. This quest is about allowing future generations of Lumbees to benefit from the recognition for which their ancestors have tirelessly fought. I commend the House Natural Resources Committee for recognizing that this is an issue of fairness and approving this legislation, and I am advocating for rapid committee consideration of the Lumbee bill in the Senate."
   Federal recognition would make critical funding and benefits available to the 50,000 Lumbees, most of whom live in and around Robeson County, North Carolina. The Lumbee Tribe is the largest American Indian tribe east of the Mississippi River and the largest non-federally recognized tribe in the United States.
