SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $4.01 MILLION FEMA GRANT TO UPDATE NORTH CAROLINA FLOOD MAPS
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will grant $4,010,000 to the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management for the state's floodplain mapping project.  
   "I applaud the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management for securing these funds to improve floodplain mapping," said Dole. "By being proactive and identifying areas at risk for flooding, we can save lives and prevent damages and losses. I am pleased that this funding will help protect North Carolinians and their property by enabling them to evaluate flood risk more accurately." 
   According to FEMA, the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management's Floodplain Mapping Program will produce Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM) for the counties within the New River Basin, including Alleghany, Ashe and Watauga Counties. Additionally funding will be used to bring pre-Map Modernization projects up to date with data storage and geographic standards.
