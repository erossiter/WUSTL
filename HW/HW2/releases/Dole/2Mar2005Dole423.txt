MOORE COUNTY TO RECEIVE $1 MILLION GRANT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that Moore County will receive a $1,000,000 grant from the Federal Aviation Administration, part of the United States Department of Transportation. The funds will be used to move two roads farther from the airport's runway. 
   "As a former Secretary of Transportation, I know how important it is to keep travelers safe," said Dole. "I applaud Moore County for securing the funds to make the necessary improvements for both air and road travel." 
   The funding will relocate Highway NC 22 and State Road 1843 so that the safety area can be brought up to FAA standards.
