SEN. DOLE TO TREASURY SECRETARY: IMMEDIATE STEPS NEEDED TO INVIGORATE ECONOMY
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson calling for immediate steps to help stimulate the economy. Dole encouraged Paulson to consider targeting assistance to those experiencing the greatest financial hardship and creating a better environment for business investment and growth through prudent tax relief.  
   Below are excerpts from Dole's letter: 
   "According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the fastest and most effective ways to get money to those consumers likely to spend immediately would be to increase food stamp benefits and extend or expand unemployment insurance benefits. Given the loss of manufacturing jobs in my home state, a short term increase in benefits would make a significant difference in the quality of life for many families." 
   "I would suggest that we stimulate greater business investment through a temporary 10 percent investment tax credit for the purchase of new equipment for the next 12 months. This will help the manufacturing sector create jobs." 
   "We should return restaurants and retail space to a 15 year depreciation schedule back from the current 39 and a half year schedule. This will provide greater financial stability to these restaurants and retailers and allow them to make larger investments in their facilities." 
   "If we want our businesses to be successful in an increasingly competitive global market, these businesses should be taxed at rates that place them on a more level playing field."
