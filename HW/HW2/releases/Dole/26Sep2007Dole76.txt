  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the City of Henderson will be awarded a $1 million HOPE VI Main Street grant to help provide affordable housing and revitalize its downtown business district.  
   "I have had the opportunity to see first-hand the positive turnaround that HOPE VI investments have brought to so many communities in North Carolina," said Dole. "The development of affordable housing brings positive results that have a ripple effect throughout the community, including the economy. I applaud the City of Henderson for securing this funding to help its residents and rejuvenate its downtown business district."
