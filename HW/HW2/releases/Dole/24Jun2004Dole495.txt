SENATE PASSES REAUTHORIZATION OF CHILD NUTRITION ACT
  Following through on her initiative to battle hunger, Sen.  
 Elizabeth Dole successfully worked to include a provision to expand the free school lunch program in the Reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent Wednesday night. This provision authorizes a five-state pilot program over two years that expands the free lunch category thereby eliminating the reduced price category, if sufficient funding is appropriated by Congress. 
   "Struggling to pay the reduced price for school lunch is an issue that is real for too many families in North Carolina and across America," said Senator Dole. "I have heard from school administrators who share stories of children eating only one meal during the day-and that is from the school lunch program. Moving forward with this initiative to improve the school lunch program for the children and families who depend on it is the right thing to do." 
   Under the current school lunch program, children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of poverty are eligible for free meals. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of poverty are eligible for reduced price meals. 
   More than 500 state and local school boards have passed resolutions urging Congress to eliminate the reduced price category and expand free lunches and breakfasts to all of those children whose families' incomes are at or below 185% of poverty. The American School Food Service Association, the Association of School Business Officials, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, and the American Public Health Association have endorsed this idea.
