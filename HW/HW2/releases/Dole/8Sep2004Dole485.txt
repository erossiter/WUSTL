SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $313,896 GRANT TO SALISBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will issue a $313,896 grant to Salisbury Fire Department, under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. 
   "I applaud Salisbury Fire Department for securing this significant funding," said Dole. "Firefighters are there in times of need and are literally on the front lines defending our homeland. It is so important that they have adequate facilities, training and equipment to safely and effectively do their jobs."
   The grant funds will be used for Operations and Firefighter Safety Programs, which include training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
