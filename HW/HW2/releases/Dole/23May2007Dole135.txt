SEN. DOLE TO HOST WORKSHOP ON MAKING HOMEOWNERSHIP A REALITY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that she will host a workshop, "Making Homeownership a Reality," in Hickory on Friday, June 1.  
   "Some folks believe that homeownership is an impossible dream - that buying a home is just too complicated," said Dole. "This workshop is designed to help potential homeowners maneuver through the home buying process, and also to provide important information to local organizations that assist people in purchasing and renovating homes." 
   Some topics to be addressed include repairing credit, budgeting for a home, choosing a realtor, navigating the loan application process, and avoiding foreclosure. 
   There is no cost to attend, but space is limited. Registration forms are available on Dole's Web site, http://dole.senate.gov (see attached pdf form), and may be mailed or faxed to Dole's Raleigh office. Constituents with questions about the workshop may call toll-free 866-420-6083.
