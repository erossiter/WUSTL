HMHEC will stem economic losses by providing new opportunities for existing workers, by creating local avenues for higher learning, and by providing an efficiency of educational services to the community. 
   Caldwell County Community College Teacher Initiative $112,000 
   A partnership with Appalachian State University and Caldwell County Community College & Technical Institute to establish a baccalaureate degree program in education. 
   Central Piedmont Geospatial training $500,000 
   The requested funds would directly support Geospatial Curriculum Development, Professional Development for Faculty and Teachers, and Geospatial Technology Equipment. According to the Department of Labor, the current global market for geospatial technologies is estimated to grow from $5 to $30 billion by 2005, creating a great demand and projected shortage of skilled workers across all industries. 
   Johnson C. Smith E-Learning Center $320,000 
   JCSU will establish a community e-learning center to help underserved adults and displaced workers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg region. 
   U.S. National Whitewater Center $200,000 
   North Carolina is considered one of the focal points of whitewater sports and its associated industry. The area is the home of many of the major whitewater equipment manufacturers, and with the addition of the U.S. National Whitewater Center, the Charlotte region will become the center of the paddle sports recreation industry. 
   Charlotte Surface Water Improvement $250,000 
   City of Monroe Highway 74 Bypass $1,000,000 
   Garden Parkway in Gaston and Mecklenburg Counties $1,000,000 
   Elizabeth Avenue Redevelopment in Charlotte $500,000 
   Albemarle-Stanley County Airport improvements $500,000 
   Charlotte Criminal Justice Information System Program- $500,000 
  Mecklenburg county's current criminal justice information system is inadequate and must be updated to meet the demands of a large, urban law enforcement system. CJIS will enable participating agencies to share and compile information about subjects and their cases and to share electronically-maintained subject and case data in real time. CJIS will serve a group of sixteen state, county and city agencies and enable them to simultaneously communicate, track, process, report and update information that is vital to public safety. This system will minimize the time from arrest to trial, reduce the repetition of tasks by multiple agencies and increase the effectiveness of all agencies that rely on criminal justice information. The integration of local systems will provide immediate efficiencies and cost savings.
