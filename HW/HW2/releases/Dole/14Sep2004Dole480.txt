SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $3.1 MILLION LOAN FOR KINSTON FIRE STATION
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that the City of Kinston will receive a USDA Rural Development loan for $3,135,000.  
 The funds will be used to construct a new state of the art fire station on Vernon Avenue.
   "I applaud the City of Kinston for securing this loan," said Dole. "Our firefighters are there for us in times of need, and they literally are on the front lines defending our homeland. They must have outstanding facilities, equipment and training to best do their important jobs."
   The new 14,000-square-foot fire station will allow the department to store the larger equipment that is needed today. According to USDA Rural Development, a new station should allow the fire department to improve response time and possibly their insurance rating, which could mean an insurance premium reduction for the property owners in the district.
