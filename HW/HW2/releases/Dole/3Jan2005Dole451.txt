SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $157,500 GRANT FOR FIRE STATION IN MOUNT AIRY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) will grant $157,500 to the Pine Ridge Volunteer Fire Department in Mount Airy.  
 The funding has been designated for a new firefighting vehicle. 
   "It is so important that our firefighters have the adequate facilities, training, and equipment to safely and effectively do their jobs," said Senator Dole. "Our firefighters are there for us in times of need, and they literally are on the front lines defending our homeland." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP) awards one-year grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers the program, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
