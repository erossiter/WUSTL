SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR NORTH CAROLINA HURRICANE DAMAGES
  After appealing to President Bush yesterday for immediate relief for North Carolina communities affected by Hurricanes Charley and Frances, Sen. Elizabeth Dole announces that North Carolina will receive significant funding included in the President's request for hurricane relief in Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina. The President sent the request to Congress today, and Congress is expected to vote on the measure this evening. 
   "I want to ensure that North Carolina receives immediate funds to provide much-needed relief as quickly as possible," said Dole. "These critical dollars will go a long way in assisting hard-hit communities in eastern and western North Carolina. Funding is needed urgently, as these people start rebuilding their homes, businesses, schools, farms and public health facilities."
   Background
   The President's request totals $3.1 billion for Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Senator Dole worked hard to ensure that North Carolina received relief during this round of funding. The exact dollar amount will not be known until FEMA completes its damage estimates.
   Some items in the President's request include:
   * $2 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide support for the response and recovery of Hurricanes Charley and Frances and other ongoing and future disasters. This assistance is to pay for public infrastructures such as schools, police stations, bridges and roads. Funding also will support assistance to families and individuals.
   * $21.3 million for clean-up and facility repair needs at national wildlife refuges and national parks, including the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina.
   * $118 million for the Corps of Engineers to restore navigation channels, repair and rehabilitate coastal areas and address other projects in areas affected by Hurricanes Charley and Frances.
   * $8 million for U.S. Coast Guard to repair damages to facilities, to replace lost or damaged buoys and channel markers and for other emergency expenses such as personnel evacuation and activation of Coast Guard reserve personnel. Includes the U.S. Coast Guard Facility at Elizabeth City, North Carolina.
