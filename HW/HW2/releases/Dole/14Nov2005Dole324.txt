SEN. DOLE ENCOURAGES MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TO LEARN ABOUT, SIGN UP FOR VOLUNTARY PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE PLAN
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today encouraged Medicare beneficiaries to educate themselves about and enroll in the voluntary prescription drug coverage plan that best meets their needs.  
 Enrollment opens tomorrow, November 15, and beneficiaries may choose from the different Medicare approved drug plans available in their area. Coverage begins January 1, 2006. 
   "The long-awaited Medicare prescription drug benefit is a welcome relief and provides choice and flexibility for seniors, regardless of their income level, existing coverage, or current prescription needs," said Dole. "I encourage all seniors, along with their family and friends, to take the time to learn about the significant prescription drug savings available through this benefit and decide what works best for them." 
   Senator Dole supported the Medicare Prescription Drug, Modernization, and Improvement Act of 2003, which established the prescription drug benefit. 
   From November 15 to May 15, 2006, beneficiaries can sign up for a plan, and those enrolled prior to December 31, 2005 will receive coverage beginning January 1, 2006. Those who enroll after January 1 will receive coverage on the first day of the following month. 
   To enroll or for more information and questions about coverage, call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit www.medicare.gov.
