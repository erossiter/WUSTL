SEN. DOLE APPLAUDS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTION ON NORTH CAROLINA JUDICIAL NOMINEE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today applauded the Senate Judiciary Committee's approval of Judge Terrance Boyle, nominee for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and urged members of the U.S. Senate to swiftly move towards his confirmation.  
   "I applaud the committee for finally approving this nomination," said Senator Dole. "The length of time Judge Boyle has been waiting for an up or down vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate is simply astounding. Judge Boyle has been waiting for more than a decade. In his impressive career, he has done a superb job of interpreting the law and diligently studying the facts of each case before him, particularly in his current capacity as a Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. 
   "He has received praise from attorneys and colleagues of both political persuasions, and that is why it is my fervent hope that my colleagues in the Senate will move expeditiously on this fine nominee. He deserves an up or down vote and in my view he deserves to be confirmed. I am please to give him my strong support," Dole concluded.
