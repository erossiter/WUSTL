SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL FAILS TO ADVANCE; SEN. DOLE SAYS LET'S STOP WASTING OPPORTUNITIES TO SECURE OUR BORDERS, ENFORCE OUR LAWS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today voted against proceeding with the Senate immigration bill. In a 46 to 53 vote, the immigration bill failed to receive enough support to advance. Dole, who has strongly opposed the bill, made the following statement:  
   "For the second time in just one month, the Senate again rightly rejected a fundamentally flawed immigration bill. Drafted in secret sessions by a handful of senators and unfairly shielded from the amendment process, this bill failed to do what must be our first order of business - securing our borders and enforcing our laws. 
   "Although there are vastly different viewpoints - among members of Congress and all Americans -about 'comprehensive' immigration reform, there is a consensus that we must secure our borders and enforce our laws. So let's start there. The solution is not inaction. Let's razor focus our energies and resources towards attaining verifiable enforcement. We must have proof, not just promises."
