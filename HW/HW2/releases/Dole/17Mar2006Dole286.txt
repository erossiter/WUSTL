SEN. DOLE: PERSONAL INFORMATION OF TOBACCO BUYOUT PARTICIPANTS RETURNED TO FARM SERVICE AGENCY
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that she has been informed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that data containing the tax identification and Social Security numbers of approximately 80,000 North Carolina tobacco buyout participants has been returned to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) or destroyed. 
   "I am very pleased to hear that this unfortunate error has been corrected and hope that this news offers some relief to the thousands of affected North Carolinians," said Dole. "The release of personal information can be very damaging. I have been informed that FSA acted quickly to mitigate misuse of this data, and I am hopeful that my constituents will not experience further distress from this incident."
   Upon learning that data had been mistakenly disclosed, Dole called the error "unacceptable" and called on the USDA to act swiftly to prevent possible identity theft and other privacy invasions. Dole also asked that safeguards be put in place to prevent future mishaps. USDA Under Secretary J.B. Penn has informed Dole that FSA has implemented a more stringent policy to ensure the protection of personal information in the future.
