SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOLE-COSPONSORED BORDER SECURITY MEASURE
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today cosponsored an amendment, which was approved by the Senate, to designate $3 billion in emergency spending for border security and enforcement initiatives in the homeland security appropriations bill.  
   "In the aftermath of the immigration debate, it is abundantly clear that Americans have no confidence that their government is taking the critical steps to secure our borders or enforce the laws on the books," said Dole. "The public will continue to distrust and rightly reject any so-called comprehensive immigration reform until there is real proof, not just promises that our communities are safe and our borders are secure. With this amendment, I hope that the government will finally put its money where its mouth is." 
   The border security amendment provides funding for: 
   * 45,000 detention beds; 
   * 300 miles of vehicle barriers and 700 miles of border fencing; 
   * Hiring of Customs & Border Protection officers, ICE agents, investigators and U.S. Marshals; 
   * Unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based radar and camera towers; 
   * Employee verification improvements; and 
   * Detention and removal of visa overstays. 
   The amendment also increases funding for the 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement agencies to receive authority from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to help process illegal aliens who have committed crimes. Dole spoke on the Senate floor yesterday and called for the appropriations bill to include increased funding for the 287(g) program. 
   Dole has heard from dozens of North Carolina local law enforcement officials who seek 287(g) status; however, their applications have been delayed or denied. ICE informs Dole that it lacks the resources to accommodate many of the local entities that apply for this designation. 
   "I have heard from local law enforcement officials from every corner of my home state of North Carolina who frankly have had it up to here," said Dole. "They are fed up. They are fed up that they are powerless to bring justice to illegal aliens who are committing crimes, such as drinking and driving, drug smuggling and gang-related activity. They are fed up that federal agents lack the manpower to help them process these criminals. They are fed up with the 'catch and release' of dangerous individuals. The 287(g) program is an invaluable tool to addressing these challenges and securing our communities, and it must be fully utilized." 
   The Senate is considering the fiscal year 2008 homeland security appropriations bill this week.
