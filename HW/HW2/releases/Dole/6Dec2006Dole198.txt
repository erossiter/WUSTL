SEN. DOLE WELCOMES IMPROVED ACCESS TO ASHEVILLE SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today welcomed news that citizens may now use public transportation to more easily access the Asheville Social Security Administration (SSA) Field Office. On October 26, Dole wrote Lurita Doan, administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), to request that GSA help improve access to the SSA Field Office after a constituent had made Dole aware that it was unreachable by public transportation.  
   "I am pleased that residents now have improved access to the much-needed services provided by the Asheville SSA office," said Dole. "I was disheartened to learn that folks - including some of our most vulnerable citizens - had to walk three-quarters of a mile from the closest bus stop, much of it uphill and along a road without sidewalks, just to reach the office. I appreciate the efforts by the GSA to remedy this situation." 
   Background 
   Effective Monday, December 4, the city was permitted to begin "on demand bus service" to the Asheville SSA office. After individuals board a public bus, they must inform their bus driver that they need to be dropped off at the SSA office. They must also request a transfer ticket, which they will receive at no extra charge. 
   The bus will then take individuals to a central bus service location where they will transfer to Dial-A-Ride Bus #26, which will take them directly to the SSA office. After they complete their business, they must call Dial-A-Ride at (828) 253-5691 to request a pick up. They will be transported back to the central bus service location, where they will board their regular public bus.
