SEN. DOLE EXPRESSES OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED NATIONAL FOREST LAND SALE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, urging them to oppose a proposal to fund the Secure Rural Schools Program through the sale of national forest land, including 10,000 acres in North Carolina. 
   "The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act has been so important to the livelihood of North Carolina's many rural counties, which rely on these funds for public schools and road maintenance. In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bill that would extend the Act through fiscal year 2013. In light of today's tight budget, it is imperative that we look for offsets for government programs; however, I do not believe it is a wise investment to sell our public lands in return for short-term funding of a program that deserves full-funding on its own-especially when the lands have been selected without the input of local communities and park rangers." - Senator Elizabeth Dole, March 21, 2006.
