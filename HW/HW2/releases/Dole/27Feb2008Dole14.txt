N.C. TO RECEIVE NEARLY $4.7 MILLION TO FIGHT HOMELESSNESS, POVERTY
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole announced that 78 North Carolina counties and municipalities will receive a total of $4,697,079 to supplement food, shelter, rent, mortgage and utility assistance programs. The funds are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program.  
   "In America--the land of prosperity and plenty--some people have the misconception that poverty and hunger only plague far-away, undeveloped nations," said Dole. "The reality is that nearly 1 million North Carolina residents struggle with food security issues. I welcome this funding for North Carolina organizations to assist the hungry, homeless and others who need a helping hand." 
   Attached is a list of counties and municipalities that will receive funding. Please visit http://www.efsp.unitedway.org to enter a zip code and view local funded organizations.
