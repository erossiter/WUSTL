SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES $200,000 FOR WAKEMED EMERGENCY OPERATIONS, REGIONAL CALL CENTER
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which included $200,000 for the WakeMed Emergency Operations and Regional Call Center. Dole worked to secure the funding, which will be used to develop communications infrastructure that gives the region's emergency and healthcare providers the ability to coordinate care and response in a disaster. 
   "WakeMed, one of North Carolina's largest healthcare systems, was recently recognized as one of the best prepared hospitals in the nation for disaster response," said Dole. "This funding will help them further improve their capacity for caring for North Carolinians in the event of a major emergency." 
   Note: The Senate version of this appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
