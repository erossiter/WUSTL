SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HYDE COUNTY COURTHOUSE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that USDA Rural Development will loan $880,000 to Hyde County. This funding will be used for the new Hyde County Courthouse facility.  
   "I am so pleased to announce this funding for Hyde County," said Dole. "Since Hurricane Isabel, many of the local government agencies have had to continue providing their important services while operating in temporary facilities. The new courthouse facility is greatly needed and will be a tremendous asset to this community." 
   The existing Hyde County Courthouse was heavily damaged by Hurricane Isabel and condemned. According to USDA Rural Development, the new 7,590 square-foot courthouse and administrative building includes a 15,000 square-foot county administration facility, a 16,330 square-foot public safety facility and a 32 bed detention center.
