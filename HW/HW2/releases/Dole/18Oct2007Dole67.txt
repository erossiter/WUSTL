SENS. DOLE, BURR ANNOUNCE $13 MILLION FOR NATIONAL TEXTILE CENTER
  U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr applauded this week's Senate passage of the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act, which included $13 million for the National Textile Center. Dole and Burr worked to secure these funds for the consortium of eight universities, including North Carolina State University, which develops new textile materials and technologies, trains personnel, and conducts textile education research.  
   "I am so pleased the Senate has recognized the importance of the North Carolina textile industry, by supporting the National Textile Center," said Dole. "I have seen first-hand the great work the center is doing at N.C. State. It is critical that we continue to promote research and development that supports our domestic textile industry." 
   Note: The Senate version of the CJS appropriations bill must be reconciled in conference with the House of Representatives-passed version of the bill. A final bill then will have to be approved by both the House and the Senate and go before the president for his signature.
