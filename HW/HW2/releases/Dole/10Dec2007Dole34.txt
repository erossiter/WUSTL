SEN. DOLE SUPPORTS INCREASED DEFENSE FUNDING
 U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole introduced a joint resolution that recommends that our nation commit no less than four percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to annual defense budgets. This would provide, for example, an additional $40 billion in fiscal year 2008 to adequately fund military procurement, readiness, personnel, health care, research and construction.  
   "We must invest the resources for our military to fulfill its current missions and prepare for future conflicts, and we must provide the health care and other services these men and women need and deserve," said Dole. "Projected defense spending will fall considerably short of meeting many of our military's needs, and if we do not remedy this situation now, there will be serious consequences for our national security." 
   Admiral Mike Mullen, the newly appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in his first speech said that "?four percent is the floor. It may even [need to] be higher." 
   Dole's measure (S.J. Res. 26) is endorsed by the 33 organizations of the Military Coalition, including the Association of the U.S. Army, Air Force Association, Navy League, Marine Corps League, National Guard and Reserve Officers Associations and Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
   U.S. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) last week introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
