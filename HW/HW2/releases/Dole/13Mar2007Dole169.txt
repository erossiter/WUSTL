SEN. DOLE ADVOCATES FOR FUNDING HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, SENIORS, DISABLED INDIVIDUALS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole, along with 49 of her colleagues, have called on the Senate Budget Committee to allocate $5.1 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for fiscal year 2008. Dole and her colleagues also have requested the same amount in advance funding for LIHEAP in fiscal year 2009, which enables states to pre-purchase fuel and plan for heating and cooling assistance.  
   "It is so important that every individual has the means to stay warm during the cold-weather months and cool during the hot-weather months," said Dole. "Our most vulnerable citizens - children, seniors, and those with disabilities - should not have to choose between affording home energy and affording other basic necessities, such as food, housing, and prescription drugs. LIHEAP helps ensure that these individuals' safety and health are not compromised by unaffordable home energy bills - and Congress must do its part to fund this program." 
   In addition to assisting low-income families and seniors with their energy bills, LIHEAP funds would also help citizens weatherize their homes to save energy. On average weatherization reduces heating bills by 31 percent.
