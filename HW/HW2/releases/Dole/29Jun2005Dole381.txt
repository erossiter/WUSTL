SEN. DOLE: TOBACCO QUOTA BUYOUT SIGNUP A HUGE SUCCESS
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today said she is pleased with initial numbers from the tobacco quota signup period announced today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency.  
   "Based on the numbers I received today from USDA, the signup appears to have been a huge success," said Senator Dole, who was instrumental in getting the buyout passed last year. "The buyout was a tremendous legislative success for North Carolina's farm families last year and I appreciate the hard work of all of our FSA offices in assisting folks during this process." 
   Numbers reported today include: 
   More than 90% sign up in North Carolina 
   Approximately 570,000 applications received nationwide 
   Approximately $9.2 billion has been requested nationwide 
   USDA's target date for issuing the majority of 2005 payments is late July. Those who did not sign up for 2005 payments can still sign up for the remaining nine payments.
