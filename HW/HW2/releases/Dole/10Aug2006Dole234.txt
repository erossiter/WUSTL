SEN. DOLE ANNOUNCES PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD EXTENSION FOR GLOBE PROJECT AT PISGAH NATIONAL FOREST
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today announced that the U.S. Forest Service has agreed to informally extend the public comment period until August 18 for the Pisgah National Forest's Globe Project, located in Avery, Caldwell and Watauga Counties. Dole's office encouraged this extension following discussions with several Northwest North Carolina residents and officials.  
   "I am pleased that the Forest Service has agreed to extend the public comment period," said Dole. "I know that some residents were not aware of the public comment period until just recently, so this extension will help ensure that all views are considered as part of the decision-making process." 
   Oral or hand-delivered comments may be sent to the Forest Service between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Comments may be sent via e-mail to: comments-southern-north-carolina-pisgah-grandfather@fs.fed.us or by regular mail to: Grandfather Ranger District, Attn: District Ranger, 109 East Lawing Drive, Nebo, North Carolina, 28761.
