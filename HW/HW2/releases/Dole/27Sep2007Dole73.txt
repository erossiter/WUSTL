SEN. DOLE TO NAVY SECRETARY: BROAD LOCAL SUPPORT FOR OUTLYING LANDING FIELD IS ESSENTIAL
  U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole today wrote to the Secretary of the Navy regarding the six new North Carolina sites it is considering for an outlying landing field (OLF). Dole expressed her dismay that the Navy apparently did not consult with local officials in potentially affected communities prior to announcing the six potential sites, and she said that she will not support the Navy's efforts to acquire any site where the local population is generally opposed.  
   Below are excerpts from Dole's letter: 
   "Some North Carolinians support such a facility in our state, but it must be located at a site that is generally acceptable to the local population. I was hopeful that the Navy had learned from past mistakes and that this was the course the service was taking in its selection of six new North Carolina sites." 
   "Based on my office's outreach to many elected leaders in the potentially affected communities, however, it appears that little if any effort was made to confer with local officials during the latest OLF site search." 
   "Considering the imperfect training environment around NAS Oceana, coupled with the challenges of locating an OLF in North Carolina, it may be time to discuss the possibility of locating more than an OLF in our state. In short, if there is a potential for economic benefits beyond the small number of jobs associated with an OLF, the Navy should address the matter directly and plan accordingly." 
   "I cannot stress enough that broad local support for an OLF is essential, and I will oppose the Navy's efforts to acquire any site in North Carolina that fails to meet this standard."
