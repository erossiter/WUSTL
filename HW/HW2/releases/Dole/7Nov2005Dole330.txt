SEN. DOLE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO AID STUDENT-PARENTS WITH CHILD CARE, HEALTH CARE, AND HOUSING RESOURCES
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole today introduced legislation to provide higher education institutions with start-up grants to offer one-stop centers for child care, comprehensive health care, family housing, and adoption information to pregnant and parenting students.  
   "Pregnancy and child rearing can be overwhelming, particularly when coupled with the pressures of being a student," said Dole. "Whether they are married, single, mothers, or fathers, we need to do our part to support these students and provide them with options that allow them to be a parent and still graduate from college. In addition, we need to send a strong message that when an unwanted pregnancy occurs, there are alternatives to abortion. Having access to the resources provided by these grants will make the pursuit of education and a career a continued reality." 
   Forty-five percent of women who have abortions are college-age (18-24 years old). Many are students or have plans to study and are concerned that having a child would interfere with education and career plans. Also, they lack the financial resources to afford a child, child care, and adequate housing. 
   The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act is named for the suffragist who organized the first women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York in 1848. The legislation will provide funding for start-up costs, not ongoing revenue, for colleges that receive the grants. 
   Campus resources would include: 
   * Family housing 
  * Affordable on-campus child care, babysitters, and co-ops 
  * Telecommuting options 
  * Maternity coverage in student health care plans; availability of coverage to family members 
  * On-campus parking 
  * Desks accessible to pregnant women 
  * Diaper decks in men's and women's restrooms 
  * Clean, comfortable places for women to breast-feed in private if they choose 
  * Financial aid, especially for women living independently from their parents
