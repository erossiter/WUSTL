SEN. DOLE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECURE FENCE ACT OF 2006
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole made the following statement following tonight's passage of the Secure Fence Act of 2006:  
   "I am very pleased that the Senate approved this legislation authorizing the construction of a 700 mile fence and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to achieve operational control over our borders. While I don't think the fence will solve all of our problems, it will certainly go a long way in securing our southern border from the thousands of illegal immigrants who continue to enter our country each day. While this is an important step in the right direction, we also need to consider additional measures - such as a better, more effective employee verification system."
