SEN. HAGEL PRAISES AGREEMENT TO RESUME BEEF TRADE BETWEEN U.S., JAPAN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today released the following statement praising the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) announcement that U.S. and Japanese officials have reached a framework agreement that will permit the resumption of beef trade between the two countries:  
   "The resumption of beef trade with Japan is important news for Nebraska's beef producers. The Japanese beef market is critical for the expansion of Nebraska's beef exports. The Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman and the rest of the USDA deserve credit for working to resolve the differences between the U.S. and Japan and re-open this market," Hagel said. 
   Japan is the U.S.'s largest beef export market, valued at an estimated $1.7 
  billion in 2003. U.S. sales to Japan were suspended following the discovery one case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in the U.S. from an imported cow on December 23, 2003.
