SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES HAYES AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today announced that Mary Hayes of St.  
 Louis, Missouri, will join his Washington, D.C. staff as a 2004 Summer Intern. 
   "Mary will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Hayes is currently a senior at Loyola University-New Orleans studying Psychology and Sociology. She is involved in student government, Theta Phi Alpha, and presides as President of Big Brothers/Big Sisters at Loyola. Hayes plans to attend law school after graduation. 
   "This summer I hope only to listen, learn, and emulate. There is truly no experience like working on Capitol Hill and working here will truly deepen my understanding of the American political system. This will be an outstanding summer," Hayes said. 
   Hayes began her intern session June 1 and finishes August 13.
