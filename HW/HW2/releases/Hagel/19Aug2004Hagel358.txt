SEN. HAGEL TRAVELS TO AFRICA
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) will be traveling to West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea with General Charles Wald, the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Europe.  
 He will leave on Friday for a week-long trip. 
   "As this area grows in strategic importance, it will require greater attention by the U.S. and its allies. Many of the countries in this region have significant oil and gas deposits but continue to struggle with endemic poverty, corruption and ethnic strife. I look forward to learning more about this critically important region with General Wald," Hagel said. 
   Hagel, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on International Policy, Export and Trade Promotion, has held hearings on the Gulf of Guinea. The most recent was "The Gulf of Guinea and U.S. Strategic Energy Policy" held on July 15. Hagel will assess regional security and energy issues, economic development and political reform in West Africa. He will travel to Nigeria, Angola, Gabon, Cameroon, Sao Tome and Principe.
