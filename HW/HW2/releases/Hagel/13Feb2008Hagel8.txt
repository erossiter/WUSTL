SEN. HAGEL TO TRAVEL TO PAKISTAN TO OBSERVE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
  U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) will travel with Senators Joseph Biden (D-DE) and John Kerry (D-MA) to Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Turkey February 16-22. The three Senators sit on the Foreign Relations Committee; Senator Biden is the Committee Chairman.  
   The delegation will visit Pakistan to observe the upcoming parliamentary elections. They will also meet with host government, U.S., business, and non-government officials in each country to discuss a full range of issues. 
   "Pakistan is approaching a defining moment. The upcoming parliamentary elections need to represent a step forward toward democracy and help to inspire the confidence of the Pakistani people, and the world, in the future of Pakistan. It is in every nation's interest to have a stable and secure Pakistan. 
   "Afghanistan is one of the most volatile regions in the world; this trip will allow us to assess our progress there. I also look forward to meeting again with government leaders in India and Turkey. America's interests in these countries are interconnected to our wider objectives in promoting security, economic growth, political openness, and geopolitical stability throughout the Greater Middle East and Central Asia," Hagel said.
