SEN. HAGEL TO MEET WITH NEBRASKA TROOPS, GOVERNMENT LEADERS DURING ASIA TRIP
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) will travel to Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Mongolia October 2-11. Hagel will meet with Nebraska troops stationed in South Korea, as well as meet with government, business and other leaders in each country. The purpose of Hagel's trip will be to discuss regional security, Asia's economic outlook, and U.S. bilateral relations.  
   Our relationships and alliances in Asia are historic, and continue to be critically important to U.S. strategic interests. The U.S. will be affected for years to come by the security, stability and economic development in this region. I look forward to discussing these and other common interests with Asian government and outside leaders, as well as meeting with Nebraska troops serving in the region, Hagel said.
