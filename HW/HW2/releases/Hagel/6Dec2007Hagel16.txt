  The United States Senate today unanimously passed a resolution honoring the victims of yesterday's shooting at Westroads Mall in Omaha. Nebraska's Senators Ben Nelson and Chuck Hagel introduced the sense of the Senate resolution earlier today.  
   "We are stunned, grief-stricken, shocked and in complete disbelief. However, the community of Omaha is already coming together to comfort each other in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy," said Nelson. "The United States Senate stands with Omaha and I know every one of my colleagues joins me in extending our prayers and deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the victims." 
   "What transpired at Westroads Mall has touched the lives of many throughout Nebraska and our country. In this time of deep sorrow, the entire Senate extends its deepest sympathies and prayers to the families and friends of the victims of this horrific tragedy," said Hagel.
