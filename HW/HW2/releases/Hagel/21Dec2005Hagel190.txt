SEN. HAGEL JOINS CHAIRMAN INHOFE TO HELP SMALL COMMUNITIES ADDRESS EPA ARSENIC STANDARDS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today cosponsored the Small System Safe Drinking Water Act of 2005 introduced by Sen.  
 James Inhofe (R-OK), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee. This legislation would require the EPA Administrator to establish a working group composed of representatives from affected states, small publicly-owned water systems, and water treatment manufacturers to study methods and develop guidance on treatment options for arsenic in drinking water. 
   The legislation would also state that the EPA cannot enforce the arsenic rule of 10 parts per billion (ppb) unless sufficient federal funding is made available for compliance efforts to small communities. Earlier this year, Hagel introduced legislation with Senator Pete Dominici (R-NM) to help communities comply with environmental standards for drinking water. 
   "Many small communities cannot afford to comply with revised EPA arsenic standards for drinking water. This legislation will provide small communities with access to the resources and guidance they need in order to improve the quality of Nebraska's drinking water, while lessening the immediate financial strains," Hagel said. 
   In 2001, the EPA changed the existing water quality standard by reducing the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water from 50 ppb to 10 ppb. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services estimates that implementing the new arsenic standard will cost Nebraska communities $128 million over the next 10 years. 
   In the last three Congresses, Hagel has introduced legislation to provide communities with funding to help meet the increased costs associated with complying with the arsenic standard for drinking water and is a member of the Arsenic Working Group which has met with EPA Administrator Johnson to voice concerns small communities in states like Nebraska have with compliance requirements.
