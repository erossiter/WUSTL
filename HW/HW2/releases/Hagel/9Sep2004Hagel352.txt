HOUSE COMMITTEE PASSES BILL TO CREATE NEW NEBRASKA JUDGESHIP
  Today, the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee passed S.878 authorizing several federal judgeships across the country, including a permanent federal judgeship for Nebraska. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) has worked on gaining a fourth permanent judge for Nebraska since 2000 and has introduced legislation on this issue. Nebraska lost its authorization for its fourth judge in May with the retirement of Judge Thomas Shanahan. 
   "With the retirement of Judge Thomas Shanahan, Nebraska's three District Court judges carry the second highest caseload per judgeship in the country. This is unacceptable. I applaud the House Judiciary Committee for moving forward with this critical legislation that will authorize a fourth permanent judgeship for Nebraska. It is urgent that we pass this bill in the Senate and House as soon as possible," Hagel said. 
   This legislation passed the Senate on May 22, 2003 but stalled in the House for more than a year. The bill will now go to the full House for a vote. If it passes the House, it will be returned to the Senate for final passage.
