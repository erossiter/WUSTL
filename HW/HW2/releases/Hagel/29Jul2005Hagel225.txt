SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. TREASURY ISSUING CLARIFICATION FOR CUBA AGRICULTURE TRADE WITH U.S.
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) was contacted by the U.S. Treasury Department today to announce a clarification statement about "Cash in Advance" for agriculture products sold from the U.S. to Cuba.  
 The department clarified that U.S. producers are able to export their agricultural goods to Cuba by confirming that goods may be shipped once the seller or the seller's agent, including a third country financial institution, has received payment in advance: 
   "This U.S. Treasury clarification is good news for the Nebraska farm and export community and good news prior to Governor Heineman's upcoming trade mission to Cuba. This re-opens and expands important trade opportunities for Nebraska agriculture producers."
