SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES CRETE, NEB. RESIDENT AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Ashley Swiercinsky of Crete, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Ashley will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Swiercinsky is a senior at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska studying Political Science and History. In addition to her schooling, Swiercinsky works full time at a facility, where she aids the mentally handicapped with their daily needs. Swiercinsky aspires to work for the government on the state or national level to strengthen her experience. 
   "I am really excited to have the opportunity to experience six weeks in Senator Hagel's office, with the chance to advance my knowledge in how the government really works. I have enjoyed getting to know the staff and other interns," Swiercinsky said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
