SENATE PASSES SEN. HAGEL's LUNG CANCER RESOLUTION
  Senate Resolution 408, introduced by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) calling on President Bush to declare lung cancer a national public health priority, passed the Senate last night by unanimous consent. The resolution calls on the President to increase funding for lung cancer research, develop early detection lung cancer screening programs and appoint an advisory committee to oversee and coordinate efforts to reduce lung cancer mortality rates.  
   "A coordinated, comprehensive effort by the federal government to reduce the lung cancer mortality rate is critical. It is estimated that over 900 Nebraskans will die of lung cancer in 2006. This resolution is a positive step in our efforts to detect and prevent this deadly disease," said Hagel. Nebraska will be the first in the nation to initiate a state-wide screening program for lung cancer. 
   The legislation lays out a multi-agency action blueprint for reducing lung cancer's high mortality by at least 50 percent within the next 10 years. The legislation emphasizes the need for a carefully coordinated approach among the federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Department of Defense, in focusing on earlier detection and more effective treatments. 
   "By coming together and working as a team, we can make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans who have been affected by this disease," said Lung Cancer Alliance President Laurie Fenton.
