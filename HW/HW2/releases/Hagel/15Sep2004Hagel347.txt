SENATE PASSES HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATION BILL
  The Senate approved a $33.1 billion Homeland Security Appropriations Bill (HR 4567) for Fiscal Year 2005 last night.  
 The bill provides $69 million for university programs including six to nine university-based research centers. The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) will compete for the funding. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) encouraged the Appropriations Committee to adequately fund the university-based research center system. Included in the bill was an amendment cosponsored by Hagel to provide $2.9 billion in disaster assistance for states impacted by natural disasters. This will provide important drought aid funds for states like Nebraska. 
   "It was critical that this bill provide adequate funds for university-based research centers. UNMC is a world-class research facility and a strong contender for designation as a homeland security research center," Hagel said. 
   The Homeland Security Appropriations Bill also includes: 
   * $5.2 billion for the Transportation Security Administration for air cargo and rail security; 
   * $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection including funds for port/container security; 
   * $3.4 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement including money for Federal Air Marshals and the security of Federal property; 
   * $2.5 billion for Project BioShield which develops vaccines to protect against attack by biological and chemical weapons. 
   The House passed its version of the bill on June 18. The bill will now go to a conference to work out differences between the House and Senate bills.
