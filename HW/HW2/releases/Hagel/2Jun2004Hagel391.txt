NEBRASKA RECEIVES $3.62 MILLION FOR BYRNE GRANT PROGRAM
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice will receive $3,620,958 from the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Formula Grant Program.  
 This U.S. Department of Justice funding will help state and local governments control violent and drug-related crime, and promote drug control initiatives in Nebraska. 
   "Byrne Grant funding supports our local law enforcement officials in fighting methamphetamine abuse and violent crime across the state. This federal program is critical to maintaining the statewide effort to reduce crime in rural areas," Hagel said. 
   The grant will allow Nebraska to implement programs addressing drug enforcement, treatment, intervention, juvenile criminal activities, and violence associated with gang activities. This year's funding will support programs for drug demand reduction, treatment, training, and court system improvement. 
   In April, Hagel sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee requesting continued funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Grant Program, which had been slated for elimination by the Bush Administration.
