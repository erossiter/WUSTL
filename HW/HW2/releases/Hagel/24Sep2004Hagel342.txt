GREAT CHALLENGES, GREATER OPPORTUNITIES
  The United States faces complicated challenges every day. These challenges provide great opportunities to employ America's talents and strengths. Poverty, hunger, diseases such as malaria, polio, and HIV/AIDS, the environment and threats from terrorism and war are all difficult global issues we must address. Inherent in each of these challenges are complexities that require us to develop new, better and more innovative responses.  
   The strength of the United States lies in individuals seeking to be part of something bigger and more important than their own self-interests. Every Nebraskan is able to contribute in some way, whether it be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces, donating needed items to local shelters and international organizations or spending time with an older American. 
   The following is a list of just a few diverse opportunities for service and involvement across Nebraska. 
   * Help Enroll Nebraskans in a Medicare Demonstration Program: The Medicare demonstration project gives a number of beneficiaries with specific diseases immediate access to a drug benefit that would otherwise not be available until 2006. This is a good opportunity for Nebraska Medicare beneficiaries with serious diseases to obtain deeply discounted medications. The application deadline is September 30, and the application itself is 12 pages long. Individuals can help spread the word about this program and assist those who are eligible fill out the application. More information on the Medicare demonstration program and an application can be found on the web at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/researchers/demos/drugcoveragedemo.asp. 
   * Operation Shoe Fly: This program collects and distributes shoes of all sizes for children in Afghanistan. The program began when Army Captain Jed Dimon of Axtell, Nebraska asked friends and family to send shoes instead of candy to soldiers to pass out to children. More information about this project can be found on the web at www.operationshoefly.com or by contacting the First United Presbyterian Church, 414 Delaware Avenue, York, Nebraska at 402/362-5176. 
   * Community Action Programs (CAP): It's the 40th Anniversary of CAP. Volunteers are needed as teaching aides, food distributors, daycare workers and rounding up community contributions, supplies and items for donation. Nebraska currently has eight community action programs, each offering a multitude of service opportunities. More information about Nebraska CAPs can be found on the web at http://www.ncaf.org/. 
   * Make a Difference Day: On Saturday, October 23, volunteers across Nebraska are encouraged to participate in National 'Make a Difference Day.' Individuals or groups interested in volunteering choose how and where they want to volunteer. More information can be found on the web at www.makeadifferenceday.com. 
   * Keep Nebraska Beautiful: 40 years ago, Governor Frank B. Morrison issued an Executive Order creating "Keep Nebraska Beautiful." Today, every Nebraskan can share in the responsibility of ensuring that our state remains in good condition for future generations by participating in environmental beautification efforts. Information about recycling, clean-up and beautification programs can be found on the web at http://www.knb.org/ or by calling 402/486-4562. 
   * Quilts for Wounded Soldiers at Andrews Air Force Base: My wife, Lilibet Hagel, is working on a continuous project to collect lap-size and twin-size quilts for returning injured military personnel at Andrews Air Force Base. Completed quilts and a small note or message should be sent to: Kevin Chapman, 1310 'G' Street NW, Suite 600, Washington, D.C. 20005. The quilts are then immediately given to the injured upon their arrival at Andrews. 
   Every collective effort we make is an opportunity to build relationships, foster understanding and create important and meaningful connections. By volunteering and helping others we influence and shape the wider world. There is much our great country does for us and there is much we Nebraskans can do for America.
