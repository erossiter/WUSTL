SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS EPA DECISION TO EXTEND COMPLIANCE DEADLINE FOR CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS OPERATORS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) applauded the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision today to extend until February 27, 2009 the deadline for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) to obtain a discharge permit and implement a nutrient management plan on their operations. The expanded regulations were scheduled to go into effect on July 31, 2007. Sen. Hagel introduced legislation in the 109th and 110th Congresses to provide a tax credit that will help livestock producers meet the costs of complying with these EPA regulations. 
   "I commend the EPA for recognizing the significant financial and operational costs that CAFO operators face in order to comply with these expanded regulations. Small and mid-size livestock producers in Nebraska will be especially hard hit. It will also be critical for Congress to pass my legislation that will provide a tax credit to help producers meet the costs of compliance. This extension is a positive first step for producers to meet these regulations," Hagel said.
   CAFOs are sites at which large numbers of animals are housed and fed. In 2003, the EPA issued expanded regulations requiring CAFOs which discharge into U.S. waterways to obtain a discharge permit, and control material that enters those waterways. Livestock producers incur large costs in applying for the discharge permits and modifying their operations to comply with EPA regulations.
