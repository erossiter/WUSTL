SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) issued the following statement today following Senate passage of a $295 billion Highway Bill by a vote of 89 to 11.  
 Hagel voted in favor of this bill: 
   "I voted for this bill to move the process forward. Our nation's infrastructure desperately needs the investment provided by a new Highway Bill. President Bush has said he will veto any Highway Bill with a cost that exceeds the $284 billion. I support the President in his efforts to get a fiscally responsible bill. I believe that the House-Senate Conference will ultimately produce a fiscally responsible bill that stays within the budget and the President can sign."
