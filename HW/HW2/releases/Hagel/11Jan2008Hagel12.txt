  U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) will travel to Russia and the United Kingdom (UK) January 13-19. Hagel will meet with host government, U.S., business, and non-government officials to discuss a full range of issues. Senator Hagel will also speak at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence's first international conference in London on January 18.  
   "Our historic relationships with Russia and the UK are critically important to U.S. security and our future. Both Russia and the UK are and will continue to be significant geostrategic countries in the 21st century. U.S. energy security interests will be affected for many years by developments in Russia. I look forward to having comprehensive consultations on this trip," Hagel said.
