USDA ANNOUNCES FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION FOR 49 NEBRASKA COUNTIES
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) applauded today the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) decision to grant a secretarial disaster designation to 49 Nebraska counties. Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman made three separate requests, totaling the 49 counties, for the designation and Hagel wrote three separate letters to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns in support of the designation. It allows eligible agriculture producers in disaster counties to apply for low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency. On July 7-8, Sen. Hagel surveyed the ongoing drought conditions in Sidney, Imperial, Valentine and Broken Bow.  
   "Nebraska's agriculture producers have suffered through years of continued drought conditions. The ongoing hardships have resulted in losses to crops and livestock throughout the state. Today's announcement is an important step to help farmers and ranchers in disaster counties survive a difficult market and recover from damages caused by poor conditions. I will continue to work with Secretary Johanns and Governor Heineman to find ways to help Nebraska producers," Hagel said. 
   The designated counties suffered significant losses due to drought, extreme heat and high winds. Loans will be granted to individual applicants based on the extent of losses, security available, and repayment ability.
