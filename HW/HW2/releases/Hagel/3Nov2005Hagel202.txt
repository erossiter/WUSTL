SENATE PASSES BUDGET TO CUT FEDERAL SPENDING
  The U.S. Senate today passed budget reconciliation legislation to reduce federal spending by roughly $35 billion in the federal budget over the next five years by a vote of 52 to 47. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the bill. The bill also authorized oil and natural gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). 
   "Passing this legislation is an important step towards getting control of federal spending. Since 1997, we have not passed a budget reconciliation bill. As a result, we have drifted recklessly in our spending and increased our budget deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. This bill contained responsible reductions in the rate of growth of the federal government and allowed us to take a common sense step towards expanding our domestic energy portfolio," Hagel said.
