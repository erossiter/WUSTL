SENS. HAGEL, NELSON INTRODUCE LEGISLATION ON LEWIS AND CLARK INTERPRETIVE CENTER
  Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) introduced legislation today to give the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Trail and Visitor Center Foundation, Inc. full control of the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Trail and Visitor Center in Nebraska City, NE.  
 The National Park Service (NPS) currently owns the Center building and property, pays for one employee at the Center, and has legal control. 
   "The Lewis and Clark Interpretive Trail and Visitor Center preserves and protects an important part of Nebraska's history. The Lewis and Clark Center Foundation will be a responsible steward of the Center's operations. This legislation transfers legal control of the Lewis and Clark Visitor Center from the federal government to the local foundation, and saves tax payer dollars," Hagel said. 
   "Considering the legacy of Lewis and Clark in Nebraska, it only makes sense to have more local control over the operations of the Lewis and Clark Center. Our bill will centralize control with local officials who can more effectively offer visitors a unique look at the more than 300 scientific discoveries made by those early pioneers," Nelson said. 
   The Center opened on July 30, 2004 and serves as an educational tool and historical landmark for those interested in learning more about the Lewis and Clark expedition. Congressman Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE) introduced the companion legislation in the House of Representatives, and Congressmen Tom Osborne (R-NE) and Lee Terry (R-NE) cosponsored the bill.
