SENATE PASSES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The U.S. Senate today passed the Conference Report for the Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations Bill by a vote of 99 to 1.  
 The bill includes $1.5 billion in emergency funds for veterans' health care. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) requested funding for five Nebraska projects that were included in the bill. 
   "It was critical to get this bill passed with the emergency funding to cover the shortfall in veterans' health care. This bill also provides funding for several important projects for Nebraska including a lead-based paint hazard control program in Omaha and funding for the Homestead National Monument museum and education center. The Homestead Monument is a national treasure," Hagel said. 
   Senator Hagel has supported funding for the Homestead National monument since it began its expansion in 2002. 
   The bill appropriates funding for the following projects requested by Hagel: 
   * $3,690,000 for the Homestead National Monument heritage museum and education center near Beatrice; 
   * $500,000 for a lead-based paint hazard control program in Omaha; 
   * $500,000 for water and wastewater infrastructure improvements in Lincoln; 
   * $500,000 for combined sewer separation projects in Omaha; and 
   * $250,000 for White House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance. 
   The Interior Appropriations bill will now go to the President for his signature.
