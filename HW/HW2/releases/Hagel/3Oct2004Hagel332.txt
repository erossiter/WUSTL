SEN. HAGEL ENCOURAGES NEBRASKANS TO APPLY FOR WHITE HOUSE FELLOWS PROGRAM
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the President's Commission on White House Fellowships is seeking applicants for the 2005-2006 White House Fellows Program.  
 The program offers one of the nation's most prestigious opportunities to engage in leadership and public service by working side-by-side with top-ranking government officials. 
   "A White House Fellowship is a chance to witness the dynamic nature of the Federal government through first-hand experience. I encourage those Nebraskans who are eligible to apply," Hagel said. 
   Applicants must be U.S. citizens. Employees of the Federal government are not eligible unless they are career military personnel. Most competitive applicants have completed their graduate studies and are working in their chosen professions at the time of consideration. 
   The 2005-2006 application deadline is February 1, 2005. Further information and a downloadable application are available at www.whitehouse.gov/fellows.
