SENATE PASSES TRANSPORTATION BILL
 The U.S. Senate today passed the Transportation Reauthorization Bill (Highway Bill) Conference Report by a vote of 91 to 4. The six year bill includes $1.68 billion in highway funding and $92.9 million in transit funding for Nebraska. Highway funding for Nebraska increased by 32% over the last highway bill (Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century) that covered Fiscal Years 1998-2003. Transit funding for Nebraska increased by 50%. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) requested funding for a number of Nebraska projects that were included in the bill.  
   "Our nation's infrastructure desperately needs the investment provided by this new Highway Bill. This bill provides funding for several important projects in Nebraska," Hagel said.
