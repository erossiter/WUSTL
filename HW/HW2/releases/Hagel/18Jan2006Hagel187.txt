SEN. HAGEL PRAISES SINGAPORE'S PLAN TO RESUME BEEF TRADE WITH THE U.S.
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) praised Tuesday's announcement that Singapore's government plans to reopen its market to boneless U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30 months of age.  
 In December, Hagel sent letters to the ambassadors of several Asian countries, including Singapore, whose markets remained closed to U.S. beef imports. The letter invited each ambassador to meet with Hagel and encouraged each country to work with the United States to resume U.S. beef imports. On Wednesday, Hagel met with Chan Heng Chee, Singapore's Ambassador to the U.S., to discuss the announcement of the reopening of Singapore's market to U.S. beef. 
   "For nearly two years, we have worked to re-open all closed markets for Nebraska's beef producers and we continue to make progress. Ambassador Chan and I had a good discussion about Singapore's announcement. I will continue to work with the countries whose markets remain closed to U.S. beef," Hagel said. 
   During today's meeting, Ambassador Chan thanked Senator Hagel for reaching out to Asian nations to resolve the beef trade issue and emphasized the importance of working together on other issues that affect the region. Hagel assured Ambassador Chan that he remains committed to strengthening U.S.-Singapore relations.
