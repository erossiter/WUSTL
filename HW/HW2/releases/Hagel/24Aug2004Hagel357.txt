SEN. HAGEL MEETS WITH NIGERIAN PRESIDENT, TOURS HIV-AIDS CLINIC, MEETS WITH ANGOLAN LEADERS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) yesterday met with Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and toured the Mogadishu Health Barrack HIV/AIDS clinic in Abuja, Nigeria, the Nigerian capital.  
 Following the meetings in Nigeria, Hagel traveled to Luanda, Angola for meetings on Monday and Tuesday. Nigeria and Angola are the first two stops on Hagel's 5-day tour of the Gulf of Guinea with U.S. European Command Deputy Commander General Charles Wald. During their tour through the Gulf of Guinea, Hagel and Wald are examining regional security, economic development and energy issues. 
   "The challenges facing Nigeria and Angola are global challenges: health, the environment, energy, security, and terrorism. We need to consider our relationships in the Gulf of Guinea in this wider strategic context," Hagel said. 
   In a meeting with President Obasanjo, Hagel discussed economic development and regional security issues, including the situation in Darfur, Sudan. Obasanjo is chairing a meeting of the Organization of African Unity, made up of 53 African states, in Abuja to discuss the situation in Darfur. Hagel and U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell toured the Mogadishu Health Barrack HIV/AIDS clinic to inspect a U.S. Office of Defense Cooperation laboratory project for HIV/AIDS vaccine research with the Nigerian military. During the tour, Hagel said, "the U.S. is supporting Nigeria's efforts to address the challenges HIV/AIDS poses to global peace and stability." Finally, Hagel met with Nigerian officials, parliamentarians, and American and Nigerian business leaders to discuss political reform, economic development, energy and regional security. 
   In Angola, Hagel is meeting with senior Angolan officials, including Prime Minister Fernando da Piedad Dias dos Santos and the Angolan Defense Minister Kundi Paihama before proceeding to Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe, and Cameroon.
