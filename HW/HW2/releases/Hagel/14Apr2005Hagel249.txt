SEN. HAGEL ORIGINAL COSPONSOR OF FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) is an original cosponsor with Sens.  
 Hatch, Feinstein, Talent and Thune of legislation introduced today creating a constitutional amendment to protect the American Flag from desecration. Hagel has been an original cosponsor of this legislation since the 105th Congress. 
   "The Flag is not just a symbol of America, it is America. It should not be desecrated. Too many have died defending the Flag for us to allow it to be used in any way that does not honor their sacrifice. This legislation is critical to protecting and preserving this symbol of America," Hagel said. 
   The Flag Protection Amendment would amend the Constitution to give Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the United States flag. This legislation is supported by the Knights of Colombus, the American Legion, the Scottish Rite, the Fraternal Order of Police and the African-American Women's Clergy Association, among others.
