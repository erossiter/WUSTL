SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES OMAHA, NEB. RESIDENT TO JOIN HIS WASHINGTON, D.C. OFFICE AS SUMMER INTERN
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Tim Wilkening of Omaha, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Tim will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Wilkening is a senior at Washington University in St. Louis studying Finance, Marketing and Managerial Economics and Strategy. He is a member of the Delta Sigma Pi fraternity and the Ashoka Cultural Association. 
   "It's an honor and a privilege to be working for Senator Hagel. I hope to learn about the workings and the history of the U.S. Government," Wilkening said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
