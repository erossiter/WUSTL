  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement this morning after meeting with President Bush's nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton:  
   "I intend to support John Bolton's nomination to be Ambassador to the United Nations. His experience and knowledge will serve him well as he represents America's interests in the U.N. at a critically important time. Mr. Bolton's commitment to consult with members of Congress on a regular basis will be essential in helping him strengthen the U.N. and moving it toward reform. 
   He has the confidence of the President and the Secretary of State and I believe he will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate."
