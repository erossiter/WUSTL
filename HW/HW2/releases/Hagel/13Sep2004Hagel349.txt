SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES OMAHA COUPLE AS ADOPTION ANGELS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Scott and Colleen Schmidt of Omaha, Nebraska are recipients of the 2004 Angels in Adoption award.  
 Every year, the Angels in Adoption program allows members of Congress to recognize and honor those who have been involved in adoption. Hagel recommended the Schmidt's to be the Nebraska recipients for 2004. 
   "Adoption is an amazing gift of love. The Schmidt family has opened their home and hearts to a child in need of a loving family and have shown others across the country the importance of adoption. The Angels in Adoption award allows Congress to recognize those who are real-life angels. The Schmidt's are a testament to the merit of adoption," Hagel said. 
   The Schmidt's adopted Anna, an orphan from Romania, in the fall of 2002. They also have three sons. Hagel met with several Romanian government officials in order to persuade them to allow Anna and other orphans to come to the United States. 
   The sixth annual congressional Angels in Adoption awards ceremony will be held September 23, 2004 in Washington, D.C.
