SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON PAUL WOLFOWITZ MOVE TO WORLD BANK PRESIDENT
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today after it was announced that President Bush had recommended Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz to become President of the World Bank: 
   "The World Bank is an extremely important institution. The new President must be able to work with both developed and developing countries. This requires special skills and understanding of the world. 
   Paul Wolfowitz has the experience and ability to do this job. However, it will be a significant transition from his current portfolio. I will support him in his efforts."
