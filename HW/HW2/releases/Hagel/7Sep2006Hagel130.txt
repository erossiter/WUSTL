SENATE PASSES DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The U.S. Senate passed the FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations bill today by a vote of 98 to 0. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted for the legislation. The bill provides over $468 billion in funding for Department of Defense (DoD) operations and programs. Hagel requested funding for a number of Nebraska projects that were included in the bill.  
   "In order to effectively meet the global challenges of the 21st Century, we must ensure that our Armed Forces have a sufficient number of highly trained and professionally equipped personnel to do the job. This funding is necessary to support America's ongoing military operations and provide the best resources for our service men and women who sacrifice for our country every day. It also funds the development of important projects in Nebraska that will help America continue to improve its world-class military," Hagel said. 
   The bill includes funding for the following projects requested by Hagel: 
   * $1.1 million for Detecting Emerging Classes of Explosives at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln; 
   * $6 million for High Energy Laser for Detection, Inspection, and Non-Destructive Testing at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln; 
   * $6 million for Munitions Shape Charge Control Research at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln;

   * $3 million for Rapid Identification of Biological Warfare Agent at the University of Nebraska Medical Center;

   The Defense Appropriations bill will now go to a House-Senate Conference.
