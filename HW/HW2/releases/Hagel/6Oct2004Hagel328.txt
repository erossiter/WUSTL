SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE REFORM LEGISLATION BY SENATE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement today following the Senate's passage of comprehensive intelligence reform legislation by a vote of 96 to 2 Hagel voted in favor of the legislation:  
   "Our intelligence community must be restructured and reformed. This effort is essential for America's security. Today, the Senate has taken a solid step toward reforming our nation's intelligence community. 
   As policymakers, we must ensure that the final intelligence reform product enhances our national security by improving our ability to collect and analyze information, and get it into the hands of decision makers in a timely and effective manner," Hagel said. 
   The House of Representatives is currently debating intelligence reform legislation. Once a bill passes the House, there will be a House-Senate Conference Committee to reconcile differences between the two bills.
