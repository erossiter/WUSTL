SEN. HAGEL INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO EXTEND WATER SERVICE CONTRACT
  Today Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) introduced legislation to extend the water service contract between the Ainsworth Irrigation District (AID) and the Bureau of Reclamation until 2010.  
 The AID's current contract is set to expire on December 31, 2006. The legislation would extend the current 40 year old contract by four more years.
   "Water for both agricultural and recreational activities is one of the most important resources in Nebraska. Extending the current AID contract will help maintain those activities in north central Nebraska," Hagel said.
   Using water from the Snake River, a tributary of the Niobrara River, the AID stores water in the Merritt Reservoir located in Cherry County and provides agricultural irrigation to 34,459 acres of farm land in Cherry Brown, and Rock counties.
   In October, 2002, the AID initiated a proposal to transfer the ownership title and operations of the Merritt Dam storage facility from the Bureau of Reclamation to the AID. The title transfer currently is under review by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. In March, 2004, the Bureau of Reclamation invited state, local and federal agencies, and the affected counties to participate as "cooperating agencies" in the Environmental Assessment (EA) process. The title transfer review and EA process will not be impacted by Hagel's legislation.
