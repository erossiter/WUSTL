SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES U.S. SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS
  Today, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced that the United States Senate Youth Program (USSYP) has begun its statewide selection process of two Nebraska high school students to spend a week in Washington observing the federal government in action.  
 The application deadline for students in Nebraska is October 5, 2004. 
   "It is important to give young people an opportunity to experience the workings of the federal government. This program is an excellent way to engage Nebraska's outstanding high school students in government affairs. I encourage all those who are eligible to apply," Hagel said. 
   The USSYP brings two student delegates from each state, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense overseas schools to spend a week in Washington studying their federal government. In past years, students have visited Capitol Hill, the White House, Supreme Court, Pentagon and State Department and met with leading cabinet members and key Congressional policymakers. 
   Eligible applicants must be junior or senior elected student officers for the 2004-2005 academic year and reside in Nebraska. Names of students selected will be announced mid-December and the delegates will receive a $5,000 scholarship and an all-expenses paid trip to Washington. Interested students should contact their high school principal or the selection administrator, Mr. Larry Starr, at the Nebraska Department of Education at 402/471-2449. Additional program information can be obtained at www.ussenateyouth.org.
