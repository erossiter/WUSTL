USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR ENERGY PROJECT FUNDING
  U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) wants Nebraskans to be aware of available funds for small businesses and agricultural producers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Program for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects.  
   The USDA is currently accepting applications for Renewable Energy Systems projects that derive energy from wind, solar, biomass, biogas, and geothermal sources. Funding is also available for Energy Efficiency Improvement projects such as improvements to HVAC systems, insulation, refrigeration, lighting, pumping systems, air systems, motor systems, irrigation efficiency improvements and others. 
   "Investment in renewable energy and energy related projects is critical to address our nation's growing energy needs. This USDA funding is a good opportunity for many Nebraskans who are developing renewable energy enterprises or updating existing energy operations," Hagel said. 
   Small businesses in communities with a population of 50,000 or less and agricultural producers that demonstrate a financial need are eligible to apply for this funding. The grant funding may be used to pay for up to 25 percent of the eligible project costs, with a minimum project expense of $2,500. Applications must be postmarked by March 1, 2006.
