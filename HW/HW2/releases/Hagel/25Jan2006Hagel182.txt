SEN. HAGEL PRAISES TAIWAN'S RESUMPTION OF BEEF TRADE WITH U.S.
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) praised Taiwan's announcement to resume beef trade with the U.S. to boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months of age.  
 In December, Hagel sent letters to the ambassadors of several Asian countries, including Taiwan, whose markets remained closed to U.S. beef imports. The letter invited each ambassador to meet with Hagel and encouraged each country to work with the United States to resume U.S. beef imports. On January 5, Hagel met with Dr. David Tawei Lee, Taiwan's chief representative in Washington, D.C. to discuss beef trade between the U.S. and Taiwan. 
   "Taiwan made a decision based on internationally accepted food safety guidelines. Nebraska beef is the safest in the world. This is a victory for the entire U.S. beef industry. I will continue to work with Secretary Johanns and countries whose markets remain closed to U.S. beef," Hagel said. 
   Taiwan closed its market to U.S. beef in December of 2003 after the first case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) was discovered in the U.S. In December 2005, Taiwanese officials held four meetings to discuss the safety of U.S. beef.
