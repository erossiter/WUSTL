SEN. HAGEL'S LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT OF FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC PASSES SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE
 The Senate Banking Committee passed legislation today originally introduced by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to create an independent federal regulator with new authority over the safety and soundness, and mission of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank. Sen. Hagel's legislation was used by Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-AL) as a vehicle for the legislation passed by the Committee this morning. The bill will now go to the Senate Floor for consideration. Sen. Hagel introduced his legislation with Sens. John Sununu (R-NH) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) earlier this year.  
   "Fannie and Freddie are public companies with shareholders, and their Boards have a fiduciary responsibility to those shareholders. But Congress did not create GSEs to enrich shareholders and executives. They were created to provide stability and capital in the secondary housing finance market. Given all the management and accounting turmoil that has occurred within Fannie and Freddie over the last two years, it would be irresponsible for Congress not to pass strong GSE reform legislation," Hagel said in his statement to the Committee. 
   The legislation would: 
   * Create an independent world class regulator to oversee the safety and soundness, and mission of the housing enterprises; 
   * Give the regulator the authority to regulate the assets of the GSEs based on mission and systemic risk; 
   * Give the new regulator the authority to close down a failing GSE and protect against a taxpayer bailout; 
   * Give the new regulator greater discretion in raising capital standards to protect against insolvency; 
   * Give the new regulator approval power over new programs proposed by a GSE; 
   * Provide the regulator with greater authority to limit exit compensation packages or golden parachutes for executives removed for cause; 
   * Require the annual audits of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing programs to ensure that these programs support the enterprises' affordable housing mission; 
   * End presidential appointments to the board of directors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and would require all Federal Home Loan Bank directors to be elected.

   The Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 
   U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
   July 28, 2005 
   WASHINGTON, D.C. - "Mr. Chairman, thank you for your strong leadership and commitment to GSE reform and bringing your legislation forward for mark-up. 
   This issue has been very important to me for the past several years. Three years ago, I urged this Committee to look into the accounting practices and risk exposure of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That was the same year this Committee held hearings on and passed bi-partisan legislation addressing the corporate governance of public companies. 
   Two years ago this week, Senators Sununu, Dole and I introduced the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act. This legislation created a strong independent new GSE housing regulator. It gave the new regulator greater discretion to set capital standards and the ability to approve new programs. It also provided the regulator with the authority to limit the type and amount of non-mission related assets of Fannie and Freddie. 
   At the time, we heard many protests that this legislation was irresponsible and would "roil the markets." However, it was clear that the current GSE regulatory framework was completely inadequate and there was a compelling need for serious reform. 
   In January of this year, Senators Sununu, Dole and I reintroduced the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act (S. 190). This legislation built on our bill from the last Congress giving the new GSE regulator the authority to place a GSE into receivership, complete discretion to set both risk based and minimum capital standards, and strong program approval language to ensure that the GSEs stay within their charter. Mr. Chairman, after holding a series of hearings on this issue both last year and this year, you have wisely added a critical fourth component giving a new regulator the authority to limit GSE assets based on systemic risk. 
   Fannie and Freddie are public companies with shareholders, and their Boards have a fiduciary responsibility to those shareholders. But Congress did not create GSEs to enrich shareholders and executives. They were created to provide stability and capital in the secondary housing finance market. 
   Mr. Chairman we have before us today comprehensive GSE reform legislation that will not "roil the markets." In fact, given all the management and accounting turmoil that has occurred within Fannie and Freddie over the last two years, it would be irresponsible for Congress not to pass strong GSE reform legislation. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for the Chairman's mark. 
   Thank you."
