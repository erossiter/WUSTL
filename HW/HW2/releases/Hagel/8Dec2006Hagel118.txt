Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today following the passing of Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under from President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1985: 
 "America has lost one of its preeminent statesmen. Ambassador Kirkpatrick's contributions to America and the world have helped shape American foreign policy for many years. Her insightful analysis, clear judgement and penetrating writings represent some of the clearest thinking on American security and foreign policy issues over the last 40 years. 
 "America owes Ambassador Kirkpatrick a great deal. We will miss her."
