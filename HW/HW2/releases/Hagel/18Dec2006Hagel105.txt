SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES DOBROVOLNY AS NOMINEE TO U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY
  Sen. Chuck Hagel nominated Joseph L. Dobrovolny from Alliance, Nebraska for admission to the United States Naval Academy.  
   Applicants were required to meet with one of three regional academy selection committees that Hagel has set-up to assist him in the evaluation of academy candidates. They were judged on their high school transcripts, academic achievement, ACT/SAT scores, career motivation, self-assurance, leadership, extra-curricular and community activities, and an essay on the Academy Honor Code, "We will not lie, steal or cheat nor tolerate among us anyone who does." The four academies will make their selections for the class of 2011 from these appointees. 
   "I am proud to announce this academy nomination from Alliance. Joseph Dobrovolny is an outstanding young man, who will be one of our nation's leaders in the 21st century," said Hagel. 
   Dobrovolny attends Alliance High School and is the son of Leo and Mary Dobrovolny.
