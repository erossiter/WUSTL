SEN. HAGEL RETAINS SEATS ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, BANKING AND INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES; JOINS RULES COMMITTEE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that he will build on his seniority on the Foreign Relations Committee, where he is the ranking Republican behind Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN); Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee; and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence by remaining on those Committees when the 109th Congress convenes on January 4th.  
 Hagel will also join the Senate Rules Committee. 
   "I look forward to building on the work I've done in these three very important Committees, as well as adding additional responsibilities with the Rules Committee." 
   The Senate Rules Committee has many areas of jurisdiction, including oversight of Congressional rules and procedures. Committee assignments must be approved by the Republican Conference on January 6th.
