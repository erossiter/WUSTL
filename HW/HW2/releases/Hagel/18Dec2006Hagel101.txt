SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES TURNER AS NOMINEE TO U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY
  Sen. Chuck Hagel nominated Jerra L. Turner from Norfolk, Nebraska for admission to the United States Air Force Academy.  
   Applicants were required to meet with one of three regional academy selection committees that Hagel has set-up to assist him in the evaluation of academy candidates. They were judged on their high school transcripts, academic achievement, ACT/SAT scores, career motivation, self-assurance, leadership, extra-curricular and community activities, and an essay on the Academy Honor Code, "We will not lie, steal or cheat nor tolerate among us anyone who does." The four academies will make their selections for the class of 2011 from these appointees. 
   "I am proud to announce this academy nomination from Norfolk. Jerra Turner is an outstanding young woman, who will be one of our nation's leaders in the 21st century," said Hagel. 
   Turner attends Norfolk Senior High School and is the daughter of Marshall Keith and Rose Brown.
