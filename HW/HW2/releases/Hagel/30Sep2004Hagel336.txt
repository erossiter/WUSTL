SEN. HAGEL INTRODUCES BILL SUPPORTING STATE COMMODITY BOARDS
  Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and James Inhofe (R-OK) introduced legislation that will allow the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to continue to collect check-off funds on grain under federal loan on behalf of state commodity boards.  
 This past year, the Nebraska State Legislature increased the check-off rate on corn and grain sorghum prompting the USDA to terminate its agreement with the commodity boards for collection of the check-off on loan grain. The USDA said it needed statutory authority to recognize new or modified cooperative agreements. 
   "This collection mechanism is vital to Nebraska's agriculture industry. It provides a consistent way of collecting check-off funds to support corn, grain sorghum, and ethanol incentive programs in Nebraska. This legislation is a responsible fix to the problem," Hagel said. 
   Producers in Nebraska have supported a check-off system for collection of assessments on some of their agricultural production. For many years the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has supported state commodity commissions in the collection of check-offs on the grain under USDA loan. State assessments have been collected under a cooperative agreement defined in Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) between individual state commodity commissions and the USDA. 
   The Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Nebraska Corn Board, Nebraska Corn Growers and Grain Sorghum Associations, and Nebraska Farm Bureau support the legislation.
