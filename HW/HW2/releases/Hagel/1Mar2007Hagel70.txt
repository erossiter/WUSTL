SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION ON NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE'S REPORT
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding a report published by the Congressional Commission on the National Guard and Reserve's Report that concluded 90 percent of Army National Guard Units are rated "not ready." The report details the Guard's struggles with equipment, recruitment and retention, training and funding. The Commission estimates that the National Guard would require $38 billion for equipment to restore domestic Army and Air units to full readiness:  
   "This report serves as a clear indication of the damage we have done to the National Guard over the last four years. As I have said, we are stretching the National Guard beyond the breaking point. It is unacceptable to ask the National Guard to take on missions for which we have not prepared or equipped them. The report's recommendations should be seriously considered and the Administration and Congress must act now to fix these problems," Hagel said.
