NEBRASKA RECEIVES LIVESTOCK FEED ASSISTANCE FROM USDA
  Today, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will provide 7,875,000 pounds of non-fat dry milk (NDM) to livestock producers in eight Nebraska counties.  
 This spring, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Gov. Mike Johanns asked Secretary Veneman for emergency assistance to address Nebraska's drought. In June, Sen. Hagel supported Gov. Johanns request to Veneman for the milk feed assistance program. 
   "Nebraska has been hit hard with the drought for the past few years. This livestock feed assistance will help Nebraska's ranchers and livestock producers provide a high-protein feed supplement for beef cattle, sheep, goats, or bison. Secretary Veneman understands Nebraska's limited pasture resources and Governor Johanns' administration deserves enormous credit for its leadership on this issue," Hagel said. 
   The counties in Nebraska that will receive the NDM are: Banner, Box Butte, Cheyenne, Garden, Kimball, Morrill, Scotts Bluff, and Sioux. In order to be eligible for the livestock feed assistance, the counties had to be located in a D4-Exceptional category at any time during the six months prior to June 15, 2004, and be in at least a D3-Extreme category based on the June 15, 2004 Drought Monitor.
