SENATOR HAGEL COMMENTS ON PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement today regarding passage of comprehensive intelligence reform legislation.  
 The legislation was passed by both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Hagel voted in favor of the legislation. The bill will now go to the President for his signature: 
   "Like all compromises, this bill is imperfect. I voted in favor of the legislation because it has the potential to move our intelligence community in the direction of necessary reform. Ultimately, reform of our intelligence community will be about implementation, the right people and culture. Next year will be critical as the Bush Administration implements these reforms and Congress exercises its oversight over the intelligence community. 
   We must restructure and reform our intelligence community infrastructure to meet the threats of the 21st century. I voted to give this bill a chance to work."
