SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES AINSWORTH, NEB. RESIDENT AS SUMMER INTERN
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Rachel Williams of Ainsworth, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Rachel will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Williams is a sophomore studying Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She is a member of the Bach Society Orchestra. Williams plans to attend law school after graduation. 
   "I have been an admirer of Senator Hagel since I met him when I was in the 4th grade, so I am very honored to be working for him now. I hope that my time here will teach me a lot about life on Capitol Hill, as well as open opportunities for my future," Williams said. 
   Williams' intern session began July 6 and ends September 10.
