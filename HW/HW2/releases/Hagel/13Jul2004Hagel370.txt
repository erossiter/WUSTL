SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES OMAHA, NEB. RESIDENT AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Erin Haas of Omaha, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Erin will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Haas is a junior at Miami University in Ohio studying Journalism and Public Policy. She is an active member in her sorority, Delta Delta Delta, and volunteers through the Adopt-A-School program in elementary school classrooms. 
   "This is an incredibly rewarding experience. I am thoroughly enjoying my time in Washington working for Senator Hagel," Haas said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
