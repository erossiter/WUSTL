SENATE PASSES CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  The U.S. Senate today passed The Child Custody Protection Act (S.403) by a vote of 65 to 34. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) was an original cosponsor of the bill.  
   This legislation makes it a crime to transport a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion if the purpose is to circumvent a state parental notification or parental consent law. Nebraska requires a parent to be notified before a minor has an abortion. A majority of states have laws that require a parent to give consent or be notified before a teenage girl can obtain an abortion. 
   "State parental notification and consent laws have been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. These responsible state laws should not be circumvented by those who would take a young girl across state lines for an abortion. It is in the interest of a young pregnant daughter to have parental involvement in their medical decisions. This legislation reaffirms states' authority to enact and enforce their own laws regarding abortions," Hagel said.
