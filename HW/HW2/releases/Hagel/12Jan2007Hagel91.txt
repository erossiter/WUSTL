SEN. HAGEL JOINS SENATORS IN RE-INTRODUCING DISASTER ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined a bi-partisan group of Senators today in re-introducing legislation that would provide $4.5 billion in agriculture disaster assistance. Hagel was an original co-sponsor of this bill in the last Congress.  
   "Nebraska's agricultural producers have endured one of the worst sustained droughts in U.S. history. This funding is long overdue, and it will provide important relief for Nebraska's producers who have suffered severe losses to crops and livestock due to the ongoing conditions. The Senate must address disaster assistance in the 110th Congress," Hagel said. 
   The bill will do the following: 
   * Cover crop losses in both the 2005 and 2006 production years for producers who lost at least 35% of a specific crop; 
   * Provide funds to cattle producers in disaster counties for increased feed expenses; 
   * Provide funds for the Emergency Conservation Program; 
   * Provide funds for additional personnel for the Farm Service Agency county offices to implement the disaster assistance program. 
   In 2006, all Nebraska counties were designated as disaster counties. Hagel has supported all disaster declaration requests from Governor Dave Heineman. 
   This bill will now be referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry.
