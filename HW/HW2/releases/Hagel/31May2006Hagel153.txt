SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT U.S. WILL ENGAGE IN TALKS WITH IRAN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement today regarding the announcement by Secretary of State Rice that the U.S. would engage Iran if Iran suspends its nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activity:  
   "I applaud President Bush and Secretary Rice for the decision to engage Iran through multilateral talks if Iran suspends its nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activity. This is an important development that should strengthen diplomatic efforts to address the Iranian nuclear threat. 
   "As I have said, our allies will support tough action against Iran only if they are confident that the United States is serious and committed to achieving a negotiated, diplomatic solution. Iran should return to the negotiating table. Ultimately, a lasting solution can only be achieved if the broader interests of the U.S., Iran, the region and world are addressed," Hagel said.
