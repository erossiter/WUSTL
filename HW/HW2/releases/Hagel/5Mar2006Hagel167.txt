USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT EXTENDS APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR ENERGY PROJECT FUNDING
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) encourages small businesses and agricultural producers to apply for funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Program for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency projects. The application deadline has been extended to May 12, 2006.  
   The USDA is currently accepting applications for Renewable Energy Systems projects that derive energy from wind, solar, biomass, biogas, and geothermal sources. Funding is also available for Energy Efficiency Improvement projects such as improvements to HVAC systems, insulation, refrigeration, lighting, pumping systems, air systems, motor systems, irrigation efficiency improvements and others. 
   "Investment in renewable energy and energy related projects is critical to address our nation's growing energy needs. I encourage eligible Nebraskans who have not applied to take this funding opportunity to develop renewable energy enterprises and update existing energy operations," Hagel said. 
   Small businesses in communities with a population of 50,000 or less and agricultural producers that demonstrate a financial need are eligible to apply for this funding. The grant funding may be used to pay for up to 25 percent of the eligible project costs, with a minimum project expense of $2,500. Applications must be postmarked by May 12, 2006.
