SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS LEGISLATION FOR STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) cosponsored legislation (S. 2759) to retain and redistribute unspent funds for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).  
 SCHIP offers federal matching funds for states and territories to provide health insurance to uninsured, low-income children in families whose annual incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid. 
   "Over 150,000 Nebraskans are uninsured. SCHIP is a successful grant program that addresses the health needs of children. This legislation is crucial for ensuring that necessary funds are available to states like Nebraska," Hagel said. 
   Allotment of funds among states is determined by a formula set in law. Once a state depletes its original allotment for that year, no additional federal funds will be made available to that state for that year. 
   S. 2759 would preserve approximately $1.1 billion in unused federal SCHIP funds allocated for fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000. These funds would otherwise expire and revert to the Treasury. This legislation would make these funds available through fiscal year 2007.
