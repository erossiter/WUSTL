SENATE PASSES BUDGET RESOLUTION CONFERENCE REPORT
  The U.S. Senate last night passed the Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2006 by a vote of 52 to 47. U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the resolution. 
   "Passing this Budget Resolution is an important step towards fiscal responsibility and regaining control over government spending. Last year, when the Senate failed to pass a Budget Resolution, we drifted recklessly in our spending which increased our budget deficit by billions of dollars. This year's budget contains responsible funding for important programs," Hagel said.
