SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION PUTTING SENATE ON RECORD OPPOSING ADDITIONAL U.S. TROOPS TO IRAQ
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding his support for the revised Warner Resolution:  
   "After extensive hearings, negotiations, and debate, the Senate has taken an important step toward sending a clear bipartisan message against adding 21,500 new U.S. troops to Iraq. I have appreciated working with Senators Warner and Levin to meld our two different Congressional Resolutions into one bipartisan resolution. We approached Senator Warner several times to try and resolve the differences. Last night, we came together to produce this resolution. We have agreed to a responsible and constructive resolution that reflects America's interests in Iraq and the Middle East. 
   "Next week's debate will be important to the American people and put the Senate on record as to America's future course in Iraq. War is the most important and serious issue Congress and the American people will ever deal with."
