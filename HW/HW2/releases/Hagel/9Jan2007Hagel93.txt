SEN. HAGEL STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF U.S. BEEF TO SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) met today with a delegation of Korean Parliamentarians led by Jay-Hyung Hong, Chairman of the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Special Committee, to discuss the importation of U.S. beef into South Korea, the FTA, and other issues of mutual importance. Sen. Hagel stressed to Mr. Hong the importance of resuming U.S. beef exports into South Korea under the import agreement that was established between the two countries in September 2006.  
   "The South Korean government needs to understand that fully opening South Korea's market to U.S. beef exports is critically important to South Korean-U.S. relations. U.S. beef is the highest quality, safest beef in the world, and it is important for Nebraska's producers to have full access to the South Korean market. The relationship between South Korea and the United States is historic, and will continue to be vital as the world faces the challenges of the 21st century. We must be able to continue to work together on issues of common interest to both of our countries," Hagel said.
