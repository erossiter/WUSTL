SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS NEBRASKA'S ANIMAL ID CERTIFICATION
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service today approved Nebraska's animal identification system.  
 USDA approval of the Nebraska Animal Verification Enhancement (NAVE) system on a state level is a step towards developing the programs which will be required for a national animal identification program. The NAVE system features animal identification, animal tracking, and integrated participation for all segments of Nebraska's livestock and beef production industries. Sen. Chuck Hagel, who introduced legislation to create a national Animal ID system, applauded the news. 
   "Nebraska's agriculture department deserves enormous credit for leading the way on animal identification and being one of the first states to be named compliant with USDA's national standards. This is an important first step in implementing a national animal identification system. A national Animal ID program will help consumers in the U.S. and around the world have increased confidence in our food supply," Hagel said. 
   NAVE is a computerized livestock premises registration system designed by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture that records locations where animals reside or will reside.
