SENATE PASSES DOD APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The U.S. Senate passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report today by a vote of 96-0.  
 Funding for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, increasing the size of the Army by 20,000 soldiers and pay raises for military personnel were included in the bill. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) who voted in favor of the bill, worked to increase the size of the Army and personally worked to include $19.2 million in funds for enhanced amputee care to ensure military amputee patients are returned to the highest level of physical function. 
   "With today's global threats, it is critical that our military has the tools and equipment they need. As we extend our troops around the globe, the increase in Army troop strength is especially important," said Hagel. 
   The appropriations bill also includes the following funding requested by Senator Hagel:
   * $35 million of impact aid funding for school districts like Bellevue, Nebraska with heavy military populations; 
   * $3.5 million for Fibrinogen Bandages research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL); 
   * $1.6 million to develop information security solutions at the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO); 
   * $1.0 million for the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) for treatment research into infectious organisms that have been developed as weapons; 
   * $1.0 million for hydrogen fuel cell research at UNL; 
   * $700,000 for crew training for the National Airborne Operations Center at STRATCOM; 
   * $2.5 for research on advanced materials for mine detection and blast mitigation for UNL. 
   The bill includes $665 million in spending for the Department of State to support operations, IT costs, logistical support, and security requirements at the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
   The Department of Defense Appropriations bill will now go to the President his signature.
