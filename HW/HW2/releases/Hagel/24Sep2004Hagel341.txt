SEN. HAGEL URGES APPROPRIATORS TO KEEP DROUGHT DISASTER ASSISTANCE IN APPROPRIATION BILL
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), along with a bi-partisan group of senators, sent a letter to Appropriations Chairman Stevens (R-AK) and Ranking Member Byrd (D-WV) supporting retention of the $2.9 billion agriculture assistance in the final Homeland Security Appropriations bill currently being negotiated by House and Senate leaders.  
   The drought aid was included in the Senate version of the bill passed last week. U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) was a co-sponsor of the amendment, which provides $2.9 billion in targeted aid to those who have suffered crop or livestock losses due to natural disasters, such as hurricane or drought. The funding will provide aid to those in Nebraska who have suffered severe losses due to drought conditions. 
   "We strongly urge you to maintain our bipartisan amendment to proved emergency agriculture disaster assistance for producers in the final FY05 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. It is essential that the Congress provide emergency disaster assistance for crop and livestock producer who suffered losses from hurricanes, droughts, floods, freezes and other natural disasters in either 2003 or 2004," the Senators said in the letter. 
   Attached is a copy of the letter sent to Senator Stevens and Byrd.

   Dear Chairmen and Ranking Member: 
   The leadership and effort you have provided in advancing the Fiscal Year 2005 Appropriation Bills are to be commended. We thank you for your support and cooperation in securing approval of our amendment on the floor. 
   We strongly urge you to maintain our bipartisan amendment to provide emergency agricultural disaster assistance for producers in the final FY05 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. It is essential that the Senate provide emergency disaster assistance for crop and livestock producers who suffered losses from hurricanes, droughts, floods, freezes and other natural disasters in either 2003 or 2004. 
   Our amendment will fund the Crop Disaster Program, the Tree Assistance Program, the Livestock Assistance Program, and the American Indian Livestock Feed Program for losses incurred in 2003 or 2004. The producer would have the option of deciding in which of the two years he or she needs the assistance. 
   American farmers and ranchers across our nation - from Maine to Oregon to Minnesota to Mississippi - had losses in 2003 and 2004 as a result of freezes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, and other natural disasters. In many areas, multiple years of drought has decimated row crops and forage and has reduced water supplies available for livestock. In other regions, farmers are experiencing crop destruction and reduced yields and quality due to flooding and an increased incidence of crop pests and diseases. Financial assistance is needed now if the economic ruin of farms, ranches and rural businesses is to be averted. 
   Thank you for your attention to this issue. We look forward to working with you to address this serious situation.
