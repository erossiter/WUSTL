SEN. HAGEL VOTES AGAINST OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL
  The House and Senate today passed a $388 billion Omnibus spending bill. The bill will now go to the President for his signature. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted against the bill.  
   "I could not vote for this Omnibus spending bill. After it came out of the House-Senate Conference Committee, was passed by the House, and then came to the Senate floor, a provision to allow congressional staff to review the tax returns of individuals and businesses was found in the bill! Despite the fact that this provision was addressed, to pass a 3000-page $388 billion spending bill that gives Members of Congress less than 24 hours to review it and understand what is in it is wrong and irresponsible. While there was much in this bill that I worked hard to get included for Nebraska, it would be irresponsible for me to vote for this much federal spending when we do not even know what is in the bill. Too many problems and too much unaccountable spending: that's partly why this country has been running record budget deficits the last few years. 
   Our system is badly broken. We must find a way to get control of the way we spend taxpayer dollars in Washington. This was a bad day for the Congress and America. Congress is going to have to change the appropriations process. This has been a festering problem over the last few years. I have been saying this since I came to the Senate. This is a dangerous way to govern. We must change it next year," Hagel said.
