OMAHA PUBLIC SCHOOLS SELECTED AS NEW HEAD START CONTRACTOR
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has selected the Omaha Public Schools (OPS) as the new contractor for the Head Start program in Douglas County.  
   "This announcement is very good news for Omaha. Having the Head Start program managed by Omaha Public Schools is a common sense decision. Head Start is an important program that helps develop pre-school children," Hagel said. 
   In January 2004, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) suspended funding for the Child and Family Development Corporation, the Omaha organization directing Douglas County Head Start. Since then, the Child Development Institute of Denver has been managing the Douglas County Head Start program.
