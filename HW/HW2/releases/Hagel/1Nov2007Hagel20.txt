SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF SASSE
  Statement by U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel 
   Dr. Benjamin Sasse to be Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at Health & Human Services: 
   "Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Members of the Committee: Just as society must constantly adapt to an evolving health care environment, so must the federal government. As we know, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plays a defining role in the protection of our nation's health. Because the list of issues facing HHS is long and complicated, it must be guided by the most qualified individuals. I have particular confidence in one individual who President Bush has nominated for the position of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at HHS - a fellow Nebraskan, Dr. Benjamin Sasse. 
   Ben possesses the character, experience, and knowledge to excel in this role. As Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Ben will be responsible for policy coordination and development, as well as legislative development and strategic planning at HHS. His current position as Counselor to the HHS Secretary for Policy and Strategic Initiatives has helped prepare him for this role. As Counselor, Ben has provided sound guidance to Secretary Leavitt on a wide array of policy matters. Prior to joining HHS, Ben was Chief of Staff for Nebraska Representative Jeff Fortenberry and served as Chief of Staff of the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice. His educational accomplishments are equally impressive as he holds Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorate Degrees. He and his wife Melissa have two young daughters, Elizabeth and Alex. 
   I enthusiastically offer my support for his nomination. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to introduce to the Senate Finance Committee, the President's nominee for Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Dr. Benjamin Sasse. 
   Thank you."
