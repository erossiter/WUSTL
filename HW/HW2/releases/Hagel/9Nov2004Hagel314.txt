SEN. HAGEL HONORED BY 82ND AIRBORNE ASSOCIATION FOR 'NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY' RESOLUTION
  Today, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) was honored by members of the 82nd Airborne Association in appreciation for his efforts to gain passage of Senate Resolution 322 recognizing August 16, 2004 as 'National Airborne Day.'  
 This day marked the 64th anniversary of the first official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon. The 82nd Airborne Division was one of the first airborne divisions to be organized in the United States Army. 
   "In the last sixty-four years, U.S. airborne forces have performed important military and peace-keeping operations all over the world, including Operation Iraqi Freedom. 'National Airborne Day' is a day to celebrate and thank Airborne veterans and Airborne units for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and for the ideals of duty, honor, and country they embody. It is an honor to be recognized," Hagel said. 
   On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test Platoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The Parachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed the first official Army parachute jump on August 16th. The success of the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne contingent that has served from World War II until the present. 
   Senator Hagel will introduce a Senate Resolution in the 109th Congress to make August 16, 2005 'National Airborne Day' and work to establish an annual 'National Airborne Day' on August 16th.
