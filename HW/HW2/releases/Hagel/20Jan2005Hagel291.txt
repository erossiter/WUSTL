SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE CONFIRMATION OF NEBRASKA GOVERNOR'S NOMINATION
  The Senate confirmed (by unanimous consent) the nomination of Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns to be Secretary of Agriculture. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) introduced Governor Johanns at his nomination hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this month.
   "Mike Johanns will help guide U.S. agriculture over the next four years and will be faced with many significant challenges. Mike is up to the task. He will be a strong leader on behalf of American agriculture. I look forward to continuing my close working relationship with Mike on behalf of Nebraska agriculture," said Hagel.
