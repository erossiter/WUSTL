SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON VOTE AGAINST BUDGET
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding his vote against the budget passed by the Senate: 
   "This is an irresponsible budget. It increases taxes by more than $700 billion on families and businesses over the next five years and increases the debt by $2.4 trillion over the next five years. The federal government's problem is not that it has too little money, but that it spends too much money. This budget would put America in a deeper financial hole."
