RENEWABLE FUELS STANDARD AMENDMENT ADDED TO ENERGY BILL IN COMMITTEE MARK-UP
  The Senate Energy Committee today passed an amendment during the markup of the Energy Bill that would call for an 8 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS).  
 In March, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing the Fuels Security Act of 2005, which called for 8 billion gallons of ethanol to be used by 2012. The legislation would dramatically expand the use of ethanol and biodiesel. 
   The RFS in the amendment would gradually increase the nation's use of renewable fuels from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 8 billion gallons in 2012. The RFS in this amendment is modeled after Hagel's "Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001." 
   "Ethanol has the potential to play an important role in creating a broader, deeper and more diverse domestic energy portfolio providing important markets for Nebraska agriculture producers. Roughly 60% of U.S. consumed petroleum is imported. This is common sense legislation to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy while at the same time providing additional grain marketing opportunities to producers," Hagel said. 
   After the Energy Bill committee markup is completed, the bill will go before the full Senate for consideration.
