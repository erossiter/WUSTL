SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS BILL TO COMBAT UNDERAGE DRINKING
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), is an original cosponsor of the "Sober Truth on Preventing (STOP) Underage Drinking Act."  
 The bill was reintroduced in both the House and the Senate today. Rep. Tom Osborne (R-NE) is an original cosponsor of the House version. 
   "Underage drinking claims too many young lives each year. The STOP Underage Drinking Act will provide the resources necessary to educate young people about the dangers of underage drinking," said Hagel. 
   The bill includes provisions to 1) create a coordinating committee to guide policy and programs at federal agencies regarding underage drinking; 2) monitor state efforts to prevent underage drinking; 3) authorize a national media campaign encouraging adults to talk to young people about underage drinking; 4) provide grants for state, community, and campus prevention programs; and 5) increase research and data collection on underage drinking.
