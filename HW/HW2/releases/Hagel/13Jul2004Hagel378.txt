SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES MCLEAN, VA., NATIVE AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Jacqueline Schmitz of McLean, Virginia, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Jacqueline will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Schmitz is a junior studying International Economics at the Georgetown University Walsh School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., where she is a member of the varsity sailing team. 
   "I look forward to learning more about the detail behind the workings of the Senate and U.S. government in general. I'm also excited to meet and work with Senator Hagel," Schmitz said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
