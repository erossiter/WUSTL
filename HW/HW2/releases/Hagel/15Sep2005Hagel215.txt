SENATE PASSES COMMERCE, JUSTICE AND SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill today by a vote of 91 to 4. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted for the legislation and was a cosponsor of two amendments included in the bill. One amendment included the Combat Meth Act and the other increased funding for the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. The amendments increase funding for state and local law enforcement agencies to combat crime, violence and the production and distribution of methamphetamine. 
   "Meth abuse is an immense problem in Nebraska and puts a severe strain on federal and local law enforcement. It is critical that Nebraska law enforcement officials have the resources they need to effectively fight drug abuse and crime. This funding will help law enforcement officials control and prevent drug abuse, crime and violence, and improve the functioning of the criminal justice system," Hagel said. 
   The Combat Meth Act amendment would provide $43 million for enforcement, training and research into treatment options for those who are addicted. It provides $25 million for local law enforcement and federal prosecutors to bring meth manufacturers and dealers to justice, $13 million for meth treatment and research and $5 million to help children who have been affected by meth. 
   The JAG program was created last year by consolidating the Edward Byrne Memorial Grants Program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program. It is one of the primary federal assistance programs for state and local law enforcement agencies used to fight meth. The amendment increases funding for the JAG program by $275 million, bringing the total funding to $900 million for FY2006. 
   The Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill will now go to a House-Senate conference.
