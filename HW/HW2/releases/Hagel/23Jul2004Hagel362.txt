SEN. HAGEL URGES EXPEDITED REVIEW OF NORTH PLATTE FLOOD PLAIN MAPS
  The city of North Platte has completed its Three-Year Flood Plain Mitigation Planning/Mapping and Analysis Project and formally submitted a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) today. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) sent a letter to FEMA urging an expedited review of the LOMR request submitted by the city. 
   "The implementation of updated flood insurance maps for the City of North Platte is critical. The final revision has the potential to significantly reduce flood insurance premiums paid by property owners in North Platte. Such a potentially positive result should prompt quick action by all federal agencies involved in the process," Hagel said in the letter.
