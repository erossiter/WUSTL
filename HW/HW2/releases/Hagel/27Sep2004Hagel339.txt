RESOLUTION HONORING NORTH PLATTE CANTEEN PASSES SENATE
  Today, the Senate passed by unanimous consent a House concurrent resolution honoring the activities of individuals and communities who volunteered or donated items to the North Platte Canteen during World War II. Rep.  
 Osborne originally introduced the resolution in the House of Representatives and it was co-sponsored by Rep. Terry and Bereuter. Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) sponsored the Senate companion resolution. 
   "The North Platte Canteen is an important part of Nebraska's history. The Canteen's efforts went far beyond serving food and coffee to the millions of troops that passed through North Platte, but also served to boost morale and show America's deep appreciation for the sacrifices they were making in the defense of freedom," Hagel said. 
   "The residents of North Platte created a 'home away from home' for our service men and women," said Nelson. "Their efforts in providing homemade food certainly brightened the trips, while their friendship and support created bonds that last to this day. I'm pleased the Senate has honored these residents for their sacrifices on the home front and their legacy of good will." 
   During World War II, the North Platte Canteen provided food and other donated items to U.S. military troops traveling by train through North Platte on their way to being shipped overseas. Individuals from 125 communities in Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas donated food and volunteered at the North Platte Canteen over approximately five years, serving roughly 6,000,000 military personnel. 
   The resolution requests that the President issue a proclamation recognizing the North Platte Canteen's efforts.
