SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFENSE SECRETARY GATES' ANNOUNCEMENT EXTENDING ARMY DEPLOYMENTS FROM 12 TO 15 MONTHS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding Defense Secretary Robert Gates' announcement that U.S. Army deployments will be extended from 12 to 15 months:  
   "Secretary Gates is right to bring greater predictability and clarity regarding the deployment of our military overseas rather than allowing creeping deployment extensions. However, the Secretary's announcement extending the deployments of active duty Army units is a stark admission that the Administration's policies in Iraq are doing permanent damage to our military and a clear acknowledgment that the U.S. military is being forced to ignore its own deployment standards. Maintaining this tempo of operations will have drastic and lasting consequences for our nation's military readiness and unnecessarily endangers our ability to react to any other crisis in the world. We are on a very dangerous course. That is why Senator Webb and I have called for legislatively-mandated readiness and deployment standards to protect our U.S. military."
