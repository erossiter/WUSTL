SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON BIPARTISAN IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined Sens. Joe Biden (D-DE) and Carl Levin (D-MI) today in introducing a bipartisan Senate Resolution expressing opposing an escalation in the Iraq war and providing constructive options to the way forward in Iraq. 
   "The resolution we are introducing today is responsible, forward-looking, bipartisan and constructive. The Iraq war is the most important issue facing America today and the Congress must be engaged in this debate. This resolution engages the Congress in that debate," Hagel said.
