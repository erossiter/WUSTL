SEN. HAGEL AIDE FEATURED IN ESQUIRE MAGAZINE'S 'BEST AND BRIGHTEST'
  Eric P. Loewen, the 2005 American Nuclear Society Congressional Fellow in Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel's (R-NE) office, is featured in the December issue of Esquire magazine as one of "America's Best and Brightest." Loewen is a native of Idaho Falls, ID where he is a scientist at the Idaho National Laboratory. He is a leader in the development of new and innovative nuclear energy technologies. 
   Loewen is finishing a one year congressional fellowship in Senator Hagel's Washington, D.C. office. He assisted Senator Hagel in formulating a comprehensive global climate change strategy, which is now a part of the Energy Bill that was signed into law by the President in August. 
   "This is a fitting recognition for Eric. He is truly one of America's best and brightest. We could not have accomplished all we did in the area of climate change this year without Eric. His far ranging experience and scientific knowledge have been invaluable in helping draft effective climate change legislation," Hagel said. 
   Loewen and his wife, Jennifer, have two children.
