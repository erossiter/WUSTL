SEN. HAGEL CONGRATULATES HASTINGS AREA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION
  Today, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) congratulated the Hastings Area Retired Teachers Association (HARTA) for being one of three recipients of the 2004 National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA) With Our Youth! Award of Excellence.  
 The With Our Youth! program is a volunteer service initiative implemented by retired educators associations. Volunteers work with youth to provide educational and life-skills support. 
   "Nebraska's retired teachers and professionals have years of experience in their field and continue to enrich the lives of our young people. We are very proud of these Nebraskans who take time to mentor youth and serve the community," Hagel said. 
   Nebraska Association of Retired School Personnel President Bob Kuhn said, "We're proud of all of our Nebraska Association of Retired School Personnel volunteers. The Hastings Area Retired Teachers Association is a great example of the power of retired educators to strengthen communities." HARTA is a local member of the Nebraska Association of Retired School Personnel. 
   Leona Anderson, Nella Kincaid and Dick Kincaid represented HARTA at the 2004 With Our Youth! National Awards Banquet held August 15 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, D.C. HARTA, which consists of 69 volunteers, represents retired teachers and other retired professionals from the area. Volunteers logged 10,025 hours encouraging children of all ages to read.
