SEN. HAGEL MEETS WITH U.S. AMBASSADOR DESIGNATE TO JAPAN TO DISCUSS LIFTING BAN ON U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today met with President Bush's nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Japan, J. Thomas Schieffer, current U.S. Ambassador to Australia, to discuss trade issues including Japan lifting its ban on U.S. beef.  
 Hagel stressed the importance of resolving this issue as soon as possible. U.S. beef has been blocked from Japan since the discovery of a single U.S. case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in December of 2003. 
   "Tom Schieffer recognizes the importance of lifting the ban quickly. He understands the impact of this ban on Nebraska producers. I look forward to working with Ambassador Schieffer on this issue," Hagel said. 
   Schieffer's nomination will be considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after the President's Day recess. 
   Last week, Senator Hagel spoke to the Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato and joined several senators in sending a letter to Ambassador Kato to urge the Japanese government to move swiftly in lifting its ban on U.S. beef.
