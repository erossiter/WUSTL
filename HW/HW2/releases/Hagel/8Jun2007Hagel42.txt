REP. HAGEL OFFERS CONGRATULATIONS TO NEBRASKA ASTRONAUT CLAYTON ANDERSON ON EVE OF LAUNCH
  Nebraska's Sen. Chuck Hagel called Astronaut Clayton Anderson, of Ashland, last night to offer congratulations and to tell him how proud Nebraskans are of him. Today at 6:38 p.m. CDT, Clayton is scheduled to lift off on the Space Shuttle Atlantis. He will be the first native Nebraskan to travel into outer space.  
   "All Nebraskans are proud to have Astronaut Clayton Anderson as a native son. He has represented Nebraska with distinction and honor. We all anxiously await tonight's lift off, and it was wonderful to hear that Clayton invited his family, friends and even a few former Hastings college professors to watch the launch from the launch pad," Hagel said. 
   "He told me that he would put two Big Red N's in the Space Station. We are proud of Clayton and keep him in our thoughts and prayers." 
   Anderson will depart today from the Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida on board Space Shuttle Atlantis for a shuttle mission to the International Space Station. Anderson will be a flight engineer and NASA science officer on the mission and will remain on the Space Station for about five months. 
   Clayton is a 1981 graduate of Hastings College. Hagel is a member of Hastings College's Board of Trustees.
