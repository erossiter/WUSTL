SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS NATIONAL DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS ACT
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM) in re-introducing legislation that would establish a long-term, cohesive strategy for addressing droughts.  
 The legislation would help state and federal agencies prepare and coordinate a national drought plan. Hagel was an original cosponsor of this legislation in the 107th and 108th Congresses. 
   "The severe drought that Nebraska and parts of the United States have endured demonstrates the direct need for a national drought plan. This is a responsible bill that will allow local, state and federal officials to coordinate drought mitigation efforts. We need to continue to be pro-active to lessen the toll that severe drought has on agriculture producers and the state's economy," Hagel said. 
   The National Drought Preparedness Act would: 
   * Create a 14-member National Drought Council; 
   * Establish a national drought office within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide assistance to the council; 
   * Coordinate drought preparedness activities for federal, state, and local governments and tribes; 
   * Develop a national drought policy action plan; and 
   * Authorize a drought assistance fund to help state and local governments implement drought preparedness plans. 
   Under this legislation, the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln would have an expanded role in monitoring and analyzing drought data.
