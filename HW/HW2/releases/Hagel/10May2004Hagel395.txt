SEN. HAGEL SUPPORTS JOHANNS' DISASTER AID REQUEST
  Today Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman supporting Governor Mike Johanns' disaster designations request for 21 Nebraska counties.  
 The designated counties have suffered from ongoing drought conditions and are generally located within the "drought extreme" D-3 category on the U.S. Drought Monitor.
   "While some Nebraska counties have received increased precipitation this year, many Nebraska counties will experience poor crop and pasture production due to adverse weather conditions. Governor Johanns' request is important for the financial future of our agricultural producers," Hagel said.
   The 21 counties requested for disaster declarations are: Arthur, Banner, Box Butte, Chase, Cheyenne, Deuel, Dundy, Frontier, Garden, Grant, Hayes, Hitchcock, Keith, Kimball, Lincoln, McPherson, Morrill, Perkins, Red Willow, Scotts Bluff and Sioux.
   Counties that receive federal disaster declarations will be able to apply for low-interest loans. Disaster declarations have helped Nebraska producers to access more than $350 million in federal assistance in the past five years through the Livestock Assistance Program, the Livestock Compensation Program and the Crop Disaster Program.
