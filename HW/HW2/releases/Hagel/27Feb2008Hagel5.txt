SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DECISION TO LIFT MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO CAPS ON FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC
  U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) issued the following statement today on the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's (OFHEO) decision to remove the mortgage portfolio growth caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on March 1, 2008:  
   "It is irresponsible and dangerous to remove Fannie and Freddie's portfolio cap and talk about lifting their capital surcharge on the same day we learn of billions of dollars in new GSE losses. This makes no sense just weeks after Congress allowed Fannie and Freddie to purchase loans in the jumbo market, which is traditionally a riskier market. We should be increasing their capital requirement, not loosening it. 
   "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee over $5 trillion in mortgages which the taxpayer could be liable for if either one were to fail. They have faced billions of dollars in accounting restatements, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and paid billions of dollars in accounting and consulting fees to clean up their financial mess and their problems are still not fixed. 
   "We have overbuilt, overmortgaged, overleveraged and abused credit. The market is now self-correcting. The GSEs were created to serve a housing mission. Using the GSEs to solve and bail out the problems the markets are facing now is not only dangerous to Fannie and Freddie's stability, but also the American taxpayer."
