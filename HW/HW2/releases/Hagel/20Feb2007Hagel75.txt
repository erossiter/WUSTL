  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding Fannie Mae's decision to withhold bonuses from former and present executives that oversaw the company from 2001-2004: 
   "The decision announced by Fannie Mae today to recoup $44.1 million in performance bonuses from top Fannie Mae executives is an appropriate one. The Fannie Mae executives who deceived regulators, Congress, and their own shareholders must be held accountable for their actions. This is a responsible step toward that accountability."
