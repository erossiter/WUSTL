 Jim Exon: 
   "Lilibet, my staff and I want to extend our deepest sympathy to Senator Exon's family. During my years in the Senate, as I followed Jim Exon in this Nebraska Senate seat, I came to know him well and respect his judgment. 
   I always appreciated the opportunities I had to visit with Senator Exon on many issues. We didn't always agree. However, I had the highest regard for Senator Exon personally and respected his deep and wide government experience serving the people of Nebraska. He will be missed by the Nebraskans he served so well and loved so much."
