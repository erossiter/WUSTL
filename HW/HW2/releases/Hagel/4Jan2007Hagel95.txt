   The President 
  The White House 
  Washington, DC 20500 
   Dear Mr. President: 
   I write in support of Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman's request for an expedited disaster declaration for 57 counties in the State of Nebraska. 
   The severe winter storms that struck the state between December 19 and January 2 have caused significant damage to public power districts in Nebraska. Additionally, preliminary estimates indicate at least $58 million in damages to public infrastructure. 
   As the state responds to this disaster, Governor Heineman has requested federal assistance for generators, shelter assistance, volunteer coordination, and energy restorations. 
   Thank you for your consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   CC: Governor Dave Heineman 
  The Honorable R. David Paulison
