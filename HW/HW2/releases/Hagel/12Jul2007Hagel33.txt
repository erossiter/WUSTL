SENATE PASSES 'WOUNDED WARRIORS ACT'
  The United States Senate passed today by a vote of 94-0 the "Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act" as an amendment to the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) was a cosponsor of the amendment. The amendment would provide for an overhaul in the medical and disabilities systems at the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to better care for service members wounded in service to the country.  
   "This is common sense legislation that is long overdue. Our current system to treat wounded soldiers is overburdened by more patients than it was prepared to help. This amendment will provide the comprehensive approach necessary to ensure that the best resources and care are provided to our service members and their families who have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of our country," Hagel said. 
   The amendment would overhaul the current military medical and disabilities systems at DoD and the VA in the following ways: 
   * Requires DoD and VA to jointly develop a comprehensive policy on the care and management of service members' transition; 
   * Requires the use of VA standards when determining disability ratings; 
   * Authorizes $50 million for improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of members with Traumatic Brian Injury (TBI) or PTSD; 
   * Authorizes medically-retired service members with disability ratings of 50% or higher to receive the active duty medical benefit for three years after leaving active duty; 
   * Authorizes military and VA health care providers to provide urgent and emergency medical care and counseling to family members on invitational travel orders; 
   * Establishes a DOD and VA Interagency Program Office to develop and implement a joint electronic health record; 
   * Requires the Secretary of Defense to establish standards for housing for military out-patients and for military hospitals, clinics and specialty care facilities; 
   * Increases the minimum severance pay for those separated for medical reasons; and 
   * Provides concurrent receipt of military retired pay and disability pay.
