NEBRASKANS URGED TO REPORT FLU VACCINE PRICE GOUGING
  There is a severe shortage of influenza (flu) vaccine in the U.S. this year.  
 There have been isolated reports in Nebraska of providers selling the vaccine at an inflated price. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) wants to make sure that Nebraskans are aware of possible price gouging by suppliers of the flu vaccine and encourages individuals to report any unreasonable pricing practices. 
   "This flu season, Nebraskans need to be aware that there are some who are taking advantage of the flu vaccine shortage for their own profit. Price gouging is unjust and ultimately hinders high-risk individuals from having access to the vaccine at a reasonable price," Hagel said. 
   According to an article in the October 13 Washington Post Express, last Friday, a pharmaceutical distributor attempted to sell the vaccine to a pharmacy in Kansas City, KS for $900 per vial when a week earlier it was selling the vaccine for $85 per vial. 
   Individuals who feel they are being charged an inflated price for the vaccine can file a report with the Nebraska Attorney General's office. Reports can be made by phone to the Attorney General's toll free Consumer Protection line at 1-800-727-6432 or by filling out an on-line contact form at www.ago.state.ne.us. Individuals are asked to include their name and contact information.
