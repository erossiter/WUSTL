SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES OPENING OF 2005 COMPETITIVE TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security is now accepting concept paper proposals for the 2005 Competitive Training Grant Program (CTGP).  
 The program provides funding for training initiatives in prevention, deterrence, response, and recovery from incidents of terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). 
   "It is important that Nebraska public safety officials have the resources and training they need to efficiently and effectively protect our state's communities. I encourage all public safety organizations in Nebraska to submit a proposal," Hagel said. 
   State and local public safety organizations interested in the CTGP are asked to submit a concept paper that demonstrates the applicant's ability to develop and deliver a WMD response training program. 
   The deadline to submit a concept paper is April 8th. For further information, contact 800/368-6498, or visit www.ojp.usdoj.gov/odp.
