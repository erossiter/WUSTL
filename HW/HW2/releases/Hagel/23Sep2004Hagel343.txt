SENATE PASSES MIDDLE CLASS TAX-CUT PACKAGE
  The Senate tonight passed the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 (HR. 1308) by a vote of 92 to 3. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the bill. This legislation extends the 2003 Bush tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of this year. Included in the package was roughly $146 billion in tax cuts. 
   "This is a responsible tax cut package. Extending the $1000 Child Tax Credit, the expanded 10 percent tax bracket and the marriage penalty-relief provisions that were set to expire puts money back in the hands of those taxpayers who need it most," Hagel said. 
   Tax relief provisions in the bill include: 
   * An extension through 2010 of the three expiring provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 - the $1,000 Child Tax Credit, the expanded 10 percent bracket, and the marriage penalty-relief; 
   * It would accelerate to 2004 the child tax credit increase for people who do not earn enough to qualify for the entire $1,000 per child; 
   * It permits members of the military to include combat pay as earned income for purpose of calculating the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit; 
   * It also includes a tax credit for research and development, tax credit for electric vehicles, a tax deduction for clean-fuel vehicles, and a tax credit for electricity from renewable sources.
