SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS AMENDMENT TO BRING DROUGHT AID TO NEBRASKA
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), along with a bi-partisan group of senators, today introduced an emergency supplemental amendment to provide $2.9 billion in targeted aid to those who have suffered crop or livestock losses due to natural disasters, such as hurricane or drought.  
 The amendment will provide aid to those in Nebraska who have suffered severe losses due to drought conditions. The amendment will be offered to the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. 
   "This amendment meets the critical standard of targeting drought aid specifically to those who need it and being responsible with taxpayer dollars. If we can pass this amendment, it will provide important relief for Nebraska's producers who have suffered severe losses due to drought conditions," Hagel said. 
   The amendment cosponsored by Hagel will do the following: 
   * Provide $2.9 billion in emergency drought relief funding through the Crop Disaster Program (CDP), the Quality Loss Program (QLP), and the Livestock Assistance Program (LAP). 
   * Funding would be eligible for those producers who have sustained losses in counties designated as primary or contiguous disaster areas during the 2003 or 2004 production years. 
   * Producers would have to select either the 2003 or 2004 production years. 
   In 2003, 92 Nebraska counties were designated as disaster counties. In 2004, 22 Nebraska counties have been designated as disaster counties. Hagel has supported all disaster declaration requests from Governor Mike Johanns. 
   "Governor Johanns deserves enormous credit for his leadership in securing disaster declarations for the hardest hit counties in Nebraska," Hagel concluded. 
   A vote on the amendment is expected later today.
