SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES LINCOLN COUPLE AS ADOPTION ANGELS
  U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Stephen and Jennie Mossman of Lincoln, Nebraska are recipients of the 2007 Angels in Adoption award. Every year, the Angels in Adoption program allows members of Congress to recognize and honor those who have been involved in adoption. Hagel recommended the Mossmans to be the Nebraska recipients for 2007. 
   "Adoption is an amazing gift of love. The Mossman family has opened their home and hearts to children in need of a loving family and has shown others across the country the importance of adoption. The Angels in Adoption award allows Congress to recognize those who are 'real-life angels.' The Mossmans are 'real-life angels'," Hagel said.
   The Mossmans have adopted three children, Molly, Martha and Riley. They have also provided foster care for a young girl whose mother was struggling with substance abuse. In addition to providing for the Mossman girls - they call themselves the Thundering Herd - Jennie works as a child therapist, specializing in children who have been abused or neglected. She recently became the Chair of the Nebraska Child Abuse Prevention Fund Board, serves as a member of the Nebraska Child Abuse Prevention Partnership, and has served on the Judicial Nominating Commission for the Lancaster County Juvenile Court.
   "None of this would have been possible without the love of family and friends, including those brave young men and women who entrusted us to raise their birth children," the Mossmans said.
   The ninth annual congressional Angels in Adoption awards ceremony was held Thursday, October 4, in Washington, D.C.
