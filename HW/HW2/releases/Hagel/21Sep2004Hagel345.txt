VETERAN'S HISTORY PROJECT RECEIVES ADDITIONAL FUNDING
 Today, the U.S. Senate passed the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2005. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the $2.46 billion measure, which included a $1 million increase for the Veterans History Project. 
   The Veterans History Project was created by Congress in 2000. Senator Hagel was the Republican sponsor for this legislation in the Senate. The Veterans History Project is part of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The project collects video and audio recording of personal histories and testimonials of American war veterans. The Project was signed into law by President Clinton on October 27, 2000. 
   "At this critical time in our nation's history, the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress contributes to our collective understanding of war. The History Project is dedicated to preserving the experiences of America's veterans by recording the oral histories of every living veteran. The interviews are archived and will become an permanent record of the courage and sacrifices of thousands of veterans," Hagel said. 
   The House passed their version of the Legislative Branch Appropriation bill on July 12, 2004. The bill will now go to a House-Senate conference.
