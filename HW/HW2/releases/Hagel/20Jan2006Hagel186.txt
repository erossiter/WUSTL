SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING U.S. BEEF EXPORTS TO JAPAN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding Japan's temporary suspension of U.S. beef imports following the discovery of risk materials in a recent beef shipment from New York state:  
   "I spoke with Secretary Johanns this morning. He has taken swift action and is investigating this incident. As the Secretary said, a mistake was made by us. It will be corrected. Today's discovery is an isolated incident and is not representative of the U.S. beef industry as a whole. Nebraska's beef exports are the safest in the world. I will continue to work with Secretary Johanns, Ambassador Kato, and the Japanese government to ensure that this is a very temporary closure of the Japanese market," Hagel said.
