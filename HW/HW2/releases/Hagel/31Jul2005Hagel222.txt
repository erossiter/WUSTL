SEN. HAGEL ENCOURAGES NEBRASKANS TO PARTICIPATE IN OPERATION: TAKE A SOLDIER TO THE MOVIES
  Sen. Chuck Hagel announced today an opportunity to support our troops serving overseas.  
 "OPERATION: Take a Soldier to the Movies" is a program that collects and delivers movies to Army, Marine, Air Force and Navy units serving overseas. Since the program began in September 2004, more than 5,000 movie packages have been delivered to troops. 
   "As President of World USO, I saw firsthand how important American caring is to our troops. Gifts from home are an excellent way to boost troop morale and let members of our Armed Forces know we appreciate all they do in defense of our freedom," Hagel said. 
   "OPERATION: Take a Soldier to the Movies" requests that donations of new or used DVDs, microwave popcorn, artificially sweetened powdered drink mix, non-chocolate theater style candy, postage and a letter of support from the donor with a return address be sent to: c/o Hintzke & Associates, 10617 W. Oklahoma Avenue U1, West Allis, WI 53227-4010. Those wishing to make a donation to cover the cost of a movie package can make checks payable to "Soldier to Movie, Inc." and send them to the above address. For more information about this project, call 414/543-4010 or visit www.soldiertomovies.org. 
   This week Senator Hagel's office collected and sent movies, candy and popcorn to the "OPERATION: Take a soldier to the Movies" program.
