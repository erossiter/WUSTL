SEN. HAGEL TO TRAVEL TO THE MIDDLE EAST
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) will lead a Congressional Delegation to the Middle East next week to examine political, economic and security conditions during a 7-day tour through Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt.  
 Hagel will leave on Sunday, November 27 and return on Sunday, December 4. Sen. Hagel's delegation includes Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) and Reps. Vic Snyder (D-AR) and Ellen Tauscher (D-CA). 
   "This trip will allow us an opportunity to assess our progress in Iraq and the Middle East and meet with the key leaders of this region. I also look forward to meeting with Nebraska troops serving in the region," Hagel said. 
   On November 15, Hagel delivered a foreign policy speech at The Council on Foreign Relations that focused on Iraq and the Middle East. Last December Hagel was in the Middle East. This will be his 4th visit to Iraq since 2002.
