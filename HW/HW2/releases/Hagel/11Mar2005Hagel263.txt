SEN. HAGEL MEETS WITH JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO DISCUSS LIFTING BAN ON U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and several other senators today met with Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato to discuss lifting the Japanese ban on U.S. beef.  
 Hagel stressed the importance of resolving this issue as soon as possible. U.S. beef has been blocked from Japan since the discovery of a single U.S. case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in December of 2003. 
   "Japan has been a very important trading partner and ally. It is in both countries interest to get this situation resolved very soon. Unfortunately, Ambassador Kato did not present any encouraging prospects that the Japanese ban would end anytime soon. The eleven Senators and two House members made it very clear to the Ambassador that if this issue was not resolved soon the Congress would be forced to take measures against Japan. Ambassador Kato understands the importance of resuming beef imports as soon as possible and will carry this message back to the Prime Minister," Hagel said. 
   The meeting comes after Senator Hagel spoke to Ambassador Kato and joined several senators in sending a letter to Ambassador Kato to urge the Japanese government to move swiftly in lifting its ban on U.S. beef.
