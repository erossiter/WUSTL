SEN. HAGEL SUPPORTS NEW LEGISLATION FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, CARE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) co-sponsored legislation today to fund breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease research, provide more help to caregivers, and increase public education about prevention.  
 The Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004 would provide authorization for nearly $1 billion in new funding for Alzheimer's research, care, and support through a variety of programs. 
   "Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that impacts not only those afflicted, but their families and caregivers as well. This legislation provides increased funding for research being performed by the National Institutes of Health to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. It also provides funding to help support those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's and increases public awareness about research and prevention," Hagel said. 
   The legislation authorizes more funding for Alzheimer's research at the National Institutes of Health, for the Safe Return Program, and for the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which provides information, assistance, counseling, training, and support services to caregivers and their families. The legislation also provides a tax credit of up to $3,000 to help family caregivers with the costs of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease. 
   The bill would also reauthorize the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program, expanding the program to every state, and requires the Department of Health and Human Services to host a National Summit on Alzheimer's disease.
