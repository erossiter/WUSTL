REP. HAGEL APPLAUDS JAPANESE FOOD SAFETY COMMISSION PANEL REPORT FOLLOWING JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S VISIT TO NEBRASKA
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) applauded the Japanese Food Safety Commission (FSC) panel for today's approval of a report on the safety of U.S. beef.  
 The panel will forward the report to the full FSC, which will then seek public comment for four weeks, followed by a week in which the FSC will take those comments into consideration before final approval. On Friday, October 28th, Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato and Sen. Hagel toured Timmerman & Sons Feeding Company, Inc. in Springfield, NE and the Greater Omaha Packing Company in Omaha, NE. 
   "Today's approval by the Japanese Food Safety Commission panel is a significant break-through in the effort to re-open the Japanese market to U.S. beef. The U.S. continues its commitment to re-establish beef trade between our two nations. Opening the Japanese market to U.S. beef is of critical importance to Nebraska's beef producers. I thank Ambassador Kato for accepting my invitation to take a first-hand look at the beef producing and processing industry in Nebraska. His efforts continue to be instrumental in opening Japan's market to U.S. beef," Hagel said. 
   U.S. beef exports to Japan were suspended following the discovery of one case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in an American cow. Since December 2003, Hagel has worked with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Japanese Government to open up the Japanese market to U.S. beef products. Japan was the U.S.'s largest beef export market, valued at an estimated $1.4 billion in 2003.
