SEN. HAGEL RE-INTRODUCES AUTISM RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) re-introduced a Senate Resolution today recognizing the importance of increasing awareness of autism spectrum disorders. Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate effectively and form social relationships. The resolution recognizes the importance of supporting programs for increased research and improved treatment of autism, and lending support to individuals with autism and those who care for them. The resolution also designates April 2007 as "National Autism Awareness Month."  
   "This resolution recognizes the importance of autism awareness. The prevalence of autism among children remains high, while the causes of autism are poorly understood and there is no cure. It is critical to support research and improve treatments of autism that will foster the health and well-being of autistic individuals," Hagel said. 
   On February 8, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated statistics on the prevalence of autism among children. Research reveals that children with autism are more common in the communities studied than previously thought. Estimates now show autism affects an average of 1 child in 150, compared with previous estimates of 1 child in 166. 
   Hagel introduced this resolution in the 108th and 109th Congresses. Senators Feingold (D-WI) and Stabenow (D-MI) are co-sponsors of this resolution.
