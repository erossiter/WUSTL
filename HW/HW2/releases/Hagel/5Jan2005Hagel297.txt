SEN. HAGEL TO CO-SPONSOR TSUNAMI TAX DEDUCTION RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel will co-sponsor a resolution that would allow tax payers to claim a 2004 charitable tax deduction for cash gifts made to aid tsunami relief efforts.  
 The resolution is authored by Sens. Baucus (D-MT) and Grassley (R-IA). 
   "This is one of the greatest natural disasters of our time. The effects and consequences of this will reach far beyond the nations which were directly affected. This is common sense legislation that would create an incentive for Americans to donate to the tsunami victims and bolster critical donation efforts," Hagel said. 
   Under the proposal, taxpayers making charitable contributions in January 2005 for tsunami relief efforts would be able to claim the deduction for the 2004 tax year. The 2004 deduction would only be applicable for donations made in January 2005. 
   Last week, Hagel visited the Embassies of each country devastated by the Tsunami and pledged his help in assisting with congressional aid packages to those nations dealing with this disaster.
