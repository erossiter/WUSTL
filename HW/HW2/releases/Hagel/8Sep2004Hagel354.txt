SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE'S RULING AGAINST FEDERAL BAN ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION
  U.S. District Court Judge Richard Kopf of Lincoln, Nebraska this morning ruled that the federal ban on partial-birth abortion is unconstitutional. Below is a statement from Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), a supporter of the ban on partial-birth abortion, on Judge Kopf's ruling: 
   "I am deeply disappointed in Judge Kopf's ruling. The ban on partial-birth abortion reflects the will of the majority of Nebraskans and Americans. It is a common sense ban on an uncommonly inhuman procedure. I am hopeful that when this decision is appealed to the Supreme Court, it will be overturned."
