SEN. HAGEL RESOLUTION ON AFGHAN ELECTIONS PASSES SENATE
  A resolution sponsored by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) commending the people of Afghanistan for holding landmark Presidential elections on Saturday, October 9, 2004 passed the Senate by unanimous concent last night.  
 Hagel, the Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was joined by Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Sens. Joseph Biden (D-DE), John McCain (R-AZ), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), John Sununu (R-NH) and Chris Dodd (D-CT) as original cosponsors of the resolution. 
   "The Government and people of Afghanistan deserve our praise and recognition for their achievements. The presidential election is a critical benchmark for America's commitment to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan," Hagel said in a statement for the Congressional Record. 
   "An independent investigation will address concerns by some of the candidates of voting irregularities" said Hagel. "The bigger picture is that these elections are a historic milestone for the people of Afghanistan." 
   Hagel was the lead Senate sponsor of the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 which authorized more than $3 billion in political, economic and security assistance and committed the United States to the development of democratic institutions and a representative government in Afghanistan.
