SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding the nomination of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State:  
   "Dr. Rice will bring significant experience to the State Department. She has served as National Security Advisor to President Bush during four very difficult years. She is smart, capable and she has the President's confidence. 
   The challenges that face America and the world are enormous. I look forward to her confirmation hearings where we will have an opportunity to learn where she and the President plan to take American foreign policy over the next four years. I also anticipate continuing a good working relationship with Dr. Rice like we've had over the last four years."
