SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON RECOMMENDATIONS OF IRAQ STUDY GROUP
Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, released the following statement today regarding the recommendations release by the Iraq Study Group:  
 "The Iraq Study Group has provided an important opportunity for the Administration to forge a bi-partisan consensus around a new way forward in Iraq. I look forward to reviewing all of the Iraq Study Groups recommendations. The report is an acknowledgment that there will be no military solution in Iraq. It will require a political solution arrived at through sustained Iraqi and region-wide diplomacy and engagement. 
 "The President and Congress now must work together to frame a new policy that will allow the U.S. to leave Iraq and the Iraqi people to make their own decisions as to their future."
