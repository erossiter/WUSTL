SEN. HAGEL CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO MAKE HEARTLAND EXPRESSWAY PRIORITY CORRIDOR
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) is an original co-sponsor of legislation introduced designating the Heartland Expressway as a high priority corridor.  
 This designation will make the Heartland Expressway a high priority during the federal funding process. Priority federal funding for the Heartland Expressway project promotes and enhances domestic and international trade by connecting cities and regional trade centers. This bill updates the route and expands the corridor to include portions of Wyoming. Hagel was an original co-sponsor of similar legislation in 2004 with Sen. Wayne Allard (R-CO). 
   "The Heartland Expressway is critical to transportation and economic development in Nebraska's Panhandle. This is a common sense proposal that is beneficial to the entire region," Hagel said. 
   The Heartland Expressway runs through Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming. In Nebraska, the Heartland Expressway follows State Highway 71 from the Colorado border to Scottsbluff, U.S. Route 26 from Scottsbluff to the intersection with State Highway L62A, State Highway L62A from U.S. Route 26 to U.S. Route 385 north of Bridgeport, & U.S. Route 385 to the South Dakota border. 
   The bill will now go to the Environment and Public Works Committee for consideration.
