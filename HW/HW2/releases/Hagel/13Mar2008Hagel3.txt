SEN. HAGEL RE-INTRODUCES AUTISM RESOLUTION
 U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) re-introduced a Senate Resolution today recognizing the importance of increasing awareness of autism spectrum disorders. Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate effectively and form social relationships. The resolution focuses on increasing autism awareness among parents, teachers and doctors. It strongly encourages research, early intervention, and treatment for individuals with autism. The resolution also designates April 2008 as "National Autism Awareness Month."  
   "This resolution recognizes the importance of autism awareness. The prevalence of autism among children remains high, while the causes of autism are poorly understood and there is no cure. It is critical to support research and improve treatments of autism that will foster the health and well-being of autistic individuals," Hagel said. 
   Reports released last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that autism now affects up to 1 in 150 children in the United States, up from previous reports of 1 in 166 children. 
   Senator Hagel has introduced this resolution since 2004. Senators Feingold (D-WI), Schumer (D-NY), Stabenow (D-MI) and Lautenberg (D-NJ) are co-sponsors of this resolution.
