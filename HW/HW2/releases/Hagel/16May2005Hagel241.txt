SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON USDA APPOINTMENTS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) issued the following statement today after Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced the appointment of Nebraska State Director of Agriculture Merlyn Carlson to serve as USDA's Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, and Nebraska Gov.  
 David Heineman announced Greg Ibach, Nebraska's Assistant Director of Agriculture, to be Carlson's successor: 
   "These are two excellent appointments for Nebraska and our nation's agriculture producers. Merlyn Carlson brings a wealth of hands-on experience and a deep knowledge-base to a critically important position. All Nebraskans are grateful for his service to our state for the last six years. 
   Greg Ibach is an experienced and worthy replacement for Merlyn Carlson. He understands Nebraska agriculture from the ground up. Both Secretary Johanns and Governor Heineman deserve credit for these two outstanding selections. They have chosen wisely."
