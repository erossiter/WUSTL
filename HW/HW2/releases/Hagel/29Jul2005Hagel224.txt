SENATE PASSES ENERGY BILL
  The United States Senate passed the Energy Bill today by a vote of 74 to 26. The bill includes an amendment authored by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to address the issue of climate change both domestically and internationally. Sen. Hagel's amendment focuses on the role of public-private partnerships, technology and developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas intensity. The bill also includes a renewable fuels provision cosponsored by Sen. Hagel, which would gradually increase the nation's use of renewable fuels from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 7.5 billion gallons in 2012.  
   "This legislation empowers America to develop the resources required to meet our 21st Century energy needs. Renewable fuels, innovative technologies, conservation and efficiency programs, and tax incentives are critical components to ensuring America maintains a reliable and diverse energy supply. 
   "The provisions in this bill provide a realistic and responsible approach to addressing the issue of climate change. The renewable fuels provision is a common sense measure to help reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy while at the same time providing additional markets for Nebraska's agriculture producers," Hagel said. 
   Major provisions in the bill include: 
   * Extends the tax credit for the production of bio-diesel from 2006 to 2008; 
   * Provides tax credit bonds for clean and renewable energy facilities; 
   * Provides nuclear production tax credits to spur the construction of new nuclear facilities; 
   * Provides incentives for production of clean coal, wind, solar and geothermal energy; 
   * Repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) of 1935, which eliminates outdated utility regulations; and 
   * Deploy U.S. technologies to reduce greenhouse gas intensity in developing countries. 
   The House passed the Energy Bill by a vote of 275 to 156 on Thursday. It will now go to the President for his signature.
