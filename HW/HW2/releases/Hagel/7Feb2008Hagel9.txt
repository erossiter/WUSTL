SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOTE AGAINST SENATE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
 U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel issued the following statement today after voting against the passed United States Senate economic stimulus package:  
   "In the last few years we have overbuilt, overmortgaged, overleveraged and abused credit. The market is now self-correcting. 
   "This economic stimulus package is wrongheaded, short-sighted and will only drive our country deeper into debt and continue to perpetuate this irresponsible mantra of spend, spend, spend. We are borrowing money that our children are going to have to pay back. Flying over America dropping rebate checks that we can't cover doesn't solve anything. This isn't free money."
