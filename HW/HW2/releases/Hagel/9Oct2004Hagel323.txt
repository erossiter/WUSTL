SEN. HAGEL'S PROPOSAL TO ADD 20,000 TROOPS TO THE ARMY INCLUDED IN DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  House and Senate conferees to the Department of Defense Authorization bill have concluded negotiations on a final bill which includes a proposal by Sens.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Jack Reed (D-RI) to expand the size of the United States Army by 20,000 soldiers. In June, the U.S. Senate passed its version of the Defense Authorization Bill which included an amendment by Hagel and Reed to add 20,000 soldiers to the Army. The amendment raises the active duty end strength of the Army from 482,200 to 502,400. Also included in the House-Senate Defense Authorization Conference Report were an additional 3,000 Marines. 
   "The additional troops included in this bill are urgently needed to give the Chief of Staff of the United States Army the tools he needs to fight the War on Terrorism, help stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan, and meet the global demands being placed on our current force structure. It is even more apparent today than it was in June how important this increase in end strength is," Hagel said. 
   Additionally, Hagel supported the following provisions also authorized in the bill: 
   * A 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed service personnel, 
  * An elimination of the reduction of the Survivor Benefit Plan annuity, 
  * Permanent eligibility for up to 90 days of TRICARE coverage for Reserve members and their family prior to mobilization, and 180 days of transitional health benefits for reserves, 
  * Immediate concurrent receipt for retirees who are rated 100 percent disabled.
