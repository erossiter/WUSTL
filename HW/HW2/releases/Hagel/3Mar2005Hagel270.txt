SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE VOTE ON RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL TO PREVENT USDA FROM OPENING CANADIAN BORDER FOR BEEF TRADE
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today following the Senate passage of a Resolution of Disapproval (S. Res. 4) that would prevent the U.S. Department of Agriculture from implementing its rule to allow the re-importation of beef from Canada. 
   "This is a harmful vote for Nebraska. The Nebraska Farm Bureau, the Nebraska Cattleman and Secretary Johanns all were opposed to this resolution. Resuming trade with our beef trading partners is critically important to Nebraska. These decisions should be made based on sound science, not special interest influence," Hagel said
