SEN. HAGEL, REP. TANNER INTRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE ENTITLEMENT REFORM COMMISSION LEGISLATION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) introduced legislation in the Senate today to form a Comprehensive Entitlement Reform Commission to review Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and make recommendations to Congress that would sustain the solvency and stability of these three programs for future generations. Rep. John Tanner (D-TN) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  
   "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid have played a vital role for millions of Americans to cope with the financial burdens of retirement and health care costs. However, over the next 75 years these three programs represent a $42 trillion unfunded commitment and are on a trajectory that cannot be sustained. The Commission will review America's three major entitlement programs and make comprehensive recommendations to sustain the solvency and stability of these programs for future generations," Hagel said in a floor statement. 
   The bi-partisan Commission would be comprised of eight members appointed by bi-partisan leaders of the House and Senate. Its work would fall under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires Government Accountability Office oversight and full public access. The Commission would be required to submit a final report to the President and Congress one year after the appointment of all Commission members and staff, and Congress would be required to hold committee hearings to review the Commission's recommendations. 
   Attached is a fact sheet detailing the proposed Commission.
