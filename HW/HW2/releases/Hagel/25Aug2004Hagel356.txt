SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY DROUGHT ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today applauded the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's $354,000 award to nine emergency drought relief projects in Nebraska.  
 This emergency funding will help Nebraskans minimize water losses and damages resulting from a multi-year drought. 
   "Nebraska has been hit hard with drought for the past few years. This funding will help Nebraska manage the water supply efficiently," Hagel said. 
   The funding is made available under the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991. The money will be used to improve real-time stream gage monitoring, purchase meters to monitor groundwater pumping, implement a computerized system to integrate water rights information, add soil moisture sensors, update the Nebraska State Drought Mitigation Plan and provide upgrades to stream gaging equipment and reporting capabilities. 
  Earlier this year, three Nebraska projects received $531,500 in emergency drought relief from the United States Bureau of Reclamation.
