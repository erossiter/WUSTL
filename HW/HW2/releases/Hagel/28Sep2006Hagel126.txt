SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES CATTLE PRODUCERS IN ALL 93 NEBRASKA COUNTIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX DEFERMENT EXTENSION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today announced that cattle producers, in all 93 Nebraska counties, that were forced to sell cattle due to drought have been granted an extension of the capital gains tax deferment. Producers will not have to pay capital gains until one year after the drought ends. In June, Senator Hagel wrote a letter to then Treasury Secretary Snow requesting this extension. Since that time, Senator Hagel has had several direct conversations with Treasury Secretary Paulson pushing for this extension for Nebraska's cattle producers.  
   "Nebraska's agriculture producers have suffered through years of relentless drought conditions. Today's announcement provides relief to producers to help them continue to sustain their operations during the ongoing drought. I appreciate Secretary Paulson's work on this issue, and I will continue to work with my colleagues and administration officials to find ways to help Nebraska producers," Hagel said. 
   Section 1033 of the Tax Code gives producers four years to replace cattle they were forced to sell due to weather-related conditions, before capital gains are due. Some Nebraska cattle producers will soon be required to purchase replacement cattle to avoid realizing a gain on cattle sold four years ago. However, current conditions are not suitable for the purchase of replacement cattle because of persisting drought.
