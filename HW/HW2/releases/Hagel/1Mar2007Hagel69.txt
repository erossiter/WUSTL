SEN. HAGEL RE-INTRODUCES GI ENHANCEMENT LEGISLATION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today re-introduced legislation that would eliminate the current Montgomery GI Bill's $1,200 enrollment fee for active duty members of the military, including Reserve and National Guard members. Hagel introduced similar legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses.  
   "The demands on America's service members and their families have been significantly increased with the threats of the 21st century. The Montgomery GI Bill must be updated to ensure that it is relevant to the sacrifices our service members are making. There can be no higher priority for America than our soldiers and their families," Hagel said. 
   The Montgomery GI Bill Enhancement Act of 2007 covers any member of the United States military, including Reserve and National Guard members, serving on active duty during the period after President Bush's November 2001 Executive Order that placed the military on a wartime footing. Hagel's bill would: 
   * Waive the GI Bill enrollment fee until President Bush's November 2001 Executive Order is rescinded; 
   * Allow all servicemen and women who have served or are serving on active duty since November 2001 to opt into the GI Bill with no penalty or enrollment fee; and 
   * Reimburse those servicemen and women who entered service after President Bush's November 2001 Executive Order and paid the $1,200 enrollment fee.
