SEN. HAGEL NAMED CHAIRMAN OF CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTIVE COMMISSION ON CHINA
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) has been named Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) for the 109th Congress by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN).  
 Hagel was Co-Chairman of the Commission during the last Congress. 
   "I look forward to working with Administration officials and my colleagues during the new Congress to fulfill the Commission's mandate dealing with human rights and the rule of law in China. The U.S. relationship with China is critical to America's global interests and security. The Commission has an important role to play in U.S.-China relations," Hagel said. 
   The Commission was established in 2000 to monitor China's progress in human rights and the rule of law. It includes Members of the House and Senate as well as senior representatives from the Departments of State, Labor and Commerce. The Commission submits an annual report to the Congressional leadership and the President. To gather information for the report, the CECC holds formal hearings and informal issues roundtables that bring together academics, activists, government officials, business representatives, and other experts on issues related to the Commission's mandate.
