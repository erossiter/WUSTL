SEN. HAGEL RE-INTRODUCES AUTISM RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) re-introduced a Senate Resolution today recognizing the importance of increasing awareness of autism spectrum disorders.  
 Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate effectively and form social relationships. The resolution recognizes the importance of supporting programs for increased research and improved treatment of autism, and improving training and support for individuals with autism and those who care for individuals with autism. 
   "This resolution recognizes the importance of autism awareness. It is critical to support research and improve treatments of autism that will foster the health and well-being of autistic individuals," Hagel said. 
   Hagel introduced this resolution in the 108th Congress. Senators Feingold (D-WI) and Stabenow (D-MI) are original cosponsors. 
   Autism is typically diagnosed during the first 3 years of life and affects an estimated 1 in every 166 children in America.
