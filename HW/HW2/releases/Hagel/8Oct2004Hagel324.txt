SENATE PASSES BILL TO EXTEND BANKRUPTCY AUTHORIZATION FOR FARMERS
  A bill to extend the authorization of Chapter 12 bankruptcy for farmers cosponsored by Sens.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent. 
   "It is important for agriculture producers to have a streamlined bankruptcy process. I support a permanent fix to the bankruptcy code. This legislation will provide an important short term solution while we work to fix the problem permanently," Hagel said. 
   The Chapter 12 provision helps allow Nebraska agricultural producers to reorganize their financing to continue to operate the family farm. The last extension of Chapter 12 expired on January 1, 2004. This bill will retroactively extend Chapter 12 from January 1, 2004 to July 1, 2005.
