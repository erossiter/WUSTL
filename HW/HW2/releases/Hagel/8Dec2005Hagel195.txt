SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS JAPANESE FOOD SAFETY COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION TO RE-OPEN JAPANESE MARKETS TO U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) applauded the Japanese Food Safety Commission (FSC) for today's approval of a report to the Japanese Government that recommends re-opening the Japanese market to U.S. beef below the age of 20 months.  
 The Japanese government is expected to act on the FSC's recommendation this month. On October 28th, Hagel hosted Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato on a tour of Timmerman & Sons Feeding Company, Inc. in Springfield, NE and the Greater Omaha Packing Company in Omaha. 
   "Today's decision by the Japanese Food Safety Commission is very good news for Nebraskans. For nearly two years, we have worked to re-open this critical market for Nebraska's beef producers and today we have had an important breakthrough. I thank Ambassador Kato for accepting my invitation to take a first-hand look at the beef producing and processing industry in Nebraska. We must continue to work with the Japanese government to re-open the Japanese market to all U.S. beef imports," Hagel said. 
   U.S. beef exports to Japan were suspended following the discovery of one case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in the U.S. in December 2003. Japan was the U.S.'s largest beef export market, valued at an estimated $1.4 billion in 2003.
