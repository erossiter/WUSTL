SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON NEWS REPORT OF JAPANESE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO RE-OPEN JAPANESE MARKETS TO U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding press reports of the Japanese Government's decision to be made on Thursday to resume U.S. beef importation following the recently completed inspection of all authorized beef processing plants in the United States:  
   "I am hopeful that tomorrow will be an important victory for the entire U.S. beef industry. Today's news reports are encouraging. For two and half years, we have worked to re-open this significant market for Nebraska's beef producers. We must now work to re-gain the confidence of Japanese consumers until the market has been fully re-opened to all U.S. beef products. U.S. beef is the highest quality, safest beef in the world, and it is critical for Nebraska's producers to have full access to the Japanese market. I will continue to work with Secretary Johanns to open markets which remain closed to U.S. beef," Hagel said. 
   Last week, Senator Hagel met with senior officials from the Japanese Embassy to discuss the resumption of U.S. beef exports into Japan. In May, Senator Hagel met with the Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso and Ambassador Kato in Washington, D.C. to discuss the resumption of U.S. beef exports into Japan. On October 28, 2005 Senator Hagel hosted Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato on a tour of beef producing and processing plants in Nebraska.
