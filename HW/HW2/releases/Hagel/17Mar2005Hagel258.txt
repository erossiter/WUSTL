SEN. HAGEL INTRODUCES RENEWABLE FUELS STANDARDS BILL
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing the Fuels Security Act of 2005.  
 The legislation would dramatically expand the use of ethanol and biodiesel. 
   The bill includes a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which would gradually increase the nation's use of renewable fuels from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 8 billion gallons in 2012. This is an increase over previous RFS measures. The RFS in this bill is modeled after Hagel's "Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001." 
   "Ethanol has the potential to play an important role in creating a broader, deeper and more diverse domestic energy portfolio providing important markets for Nebraska agriculture producers. Roughly 60% of U.S. consumed petroleum is imported. This is common sense legislation to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy while at the same time providing additional grain marketing opportunities to producers," Hagel said. 
   The bill will now go to the Environment and Public Works Committee for consideration.
