SEN. HAGEL CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION RE-DESIGNATING HEARTLAND EXPRESSWAY A PRIORITY CORRIDOR
  Today, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) co-sponsored legislation re-designating the Heartland Expressway as a high priority corridor.  
 Priority federal funding for the Heartland Expressway project promotes and enhances domestic and international trade by connecting cities and regional trade centers. This bill updates the route and expands the corridor to include portions of Wyoming. Hagel co-sponsored similar legislation in 2002 with Senator Wayne Allard (R-CO). 
   "The Heartland Expressway is critical to transportation and economic development in Nebraska's Panhandle. This is a common sense proposal that is beneficial to the region," Hagel said. 
   The Heartland Expressway runs through Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming. In Nebraska, the Heartland Expressway follows State Highway 71 from the Colorado border to Scottsbluff, U.S. Route 26 from Scottsbluff to the intersection with State Highway L62A, State Highway L62A from U.S. Route 26 to U.S. Route 385 north of Bridgeport, & U.S. Route 385 to the South Dakota border.
