SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES WOODBRIDGE, VA., RESIDENT BALES AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today announced that Michael Bales of Woodbridge, Virginia, will join his Washington, D.C. staff as a 2004 Summer Intern. 
   "Michael will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Cadet Bales is currently a senior at the United States Military Academy at West Point majoring in International Studies. He is a member of the Varsity Army Crew Team and active in Officer Christian Fellowship (OCF). Bales will commit to a minimum of five years in the U.S. Army after graduation. 
   "This opportunity will surely shape the way I view politics and our national government. I consider it a privilege to work in this office," Bales said. 
   Bales began his intern session June 14 and finishes July 2.
