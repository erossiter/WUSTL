SENATE RE-AUTHORIZES IDEA PROGRAM
  Today, the U.S. Senate passed a bill (S.1248) to re-authorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by a vote of 95 to 3. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted for the legislation. The law guarantees special-needs children a free and appropriate public education and provides federal funding to states and school districts. 
   The Senate passed an amendment to the IDEA re-authorization bill that increases discretionary funding for IDEA by roughly $2 billion a year over the next 7 years. Hagel and Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) offered an amendment to provide mandatory annual increases of $2.2 billion per year over the next six years to IDEA. Hagel's amendment received 56 votes, 4 votes short of the 60 votes needed to override a budget point-of-order.
   Since 2001, Hagel and Harkin have worked to increase IDEA funding. In 2001, the Senate passed a Hagel/Harkin amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act to provide mandatory funding for IDEA. The amendment was removed during a House/Senate Conference Committee.
   "Today's re-authorization of IDEA provides important funding to meet the needs of students with special needs. Increasing IDEA will help local school districts fund additional priorities such as facility improvements, teacher salaries, and purchasing upgraded hardware and software for the classroom," Hagel said.
   "I will continue to work to make funding for IDEA mandatory. While we have made great progress in increasing IDEA funding over the last seven years, it is only by making funding for IDEA mandatory that we can assure full funding for the program. Until funding is mandatory, we will continue to work for funding increases every year," Hagel concluded.
   When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, it committed to funding 40% of the costs imposed on states to meet the mandates of IDEA. Congress has never funded more than 20% of the program.
   The bill will now go to the House/Senate Conference Committee.
