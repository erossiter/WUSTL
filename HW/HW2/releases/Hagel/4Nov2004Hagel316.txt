SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONDITION OF PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT ARAFAT
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today on the failing health of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat: 
   "Based on current information we have, the removal of Arafat from the leadership of the Palestinian movement opens up new opportunities for peace in the Middle East. The Palestinians must now rally around new leadership which presents new possibilities to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Sharon should move quickly to reach out to this new Palestinian leadership so that a lasting Middle East peace agreement becomes closer to reality."
