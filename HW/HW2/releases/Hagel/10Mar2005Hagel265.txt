SENATE PASSES BANKRUPTCY REFORM BILL
  The U.S. Senate passed the Bankruptcy Reform Bill (S. 256) today by a vote of 74 to 25. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) cosponsored the legislation and voted in favor of it. The legislation prevents wealthy individuals from using bankruptcy to avoid paying debts that they can easily pay. 
   "Bankruptcy reform is long overdue. All Americans are hurt by abuse of the bankruptcy code. The costs of these abuses are passed on to everyone through higher interest rates. This reform bill aims to put responsibility and accountability back into the system," Hagel said. 
   The bill ensures that individuals who fall on hard times will continue to have access to the promise of a fresh start through bankruptcy. Single mothers will benefit from a provision in the bill which would make child support payments a top priority in bankruptcy. In addition, the bill contains consumer protection provisions that require creditors to make increased disclosures to their customers. 
   For family farmers, the bill permanently extends Chapter 12 bankruptcy. Senator Hagel has previously cosponsored legislation that would ensure that farmers could continue to rely on Chapter 12. 
   The Bill will now go to the House for consideration.
