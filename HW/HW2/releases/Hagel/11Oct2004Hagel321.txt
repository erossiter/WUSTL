SENATE PASSES DISASTER ASSISTANCE
  The United States Senate today passed $2.9 billion in agriculture disaster assistance as part of the Military Construction Appropriations Bill by a voice vote. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the legislation. The funding for disaster assistance is offset by a reduction in the Conservation Security Program (CSP) over a period of ten years. In September the Senate passed drought assistance without offsets, while the House of Representatives included offsets in their drought assistance package. 
   "This bill provides important relief for Nebraska's producers who have suffered severe losses due to drought conditions. While I supported funding drought assistance without offsets, it was not possible to pass a bill through the House without offsets. Given the choice between not passing drought assistance or offsetting the cost of drought assistance from the CSP, we made the best deal possible. Our priority must be providing assistance to producers who have been hit hardest by drought," Hagel said. 
   The bill will do the following: 
  * Provide $2.9 billion in emergency drought relief funding through the Crop Disaster Program (CDP), the Quality Loss Program (QLP), and the Livestock Assistance Program (LAP). 
  * Funding would be eligible for those qualified producers who have sustained losses during the 2003 or 2004 production years. 
  * Producers would have to select either the 2003 or 2004 production years. 
   In 2003, 92 Nebraska counties were designated as disaster counties. In 2004, 22 Nebraska counties have been designated as disaster counties. Hagel has supported all disaster declaration requests from Governor Mike Johanns. 
   This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on October 9th and will now go to the President for his signature.
