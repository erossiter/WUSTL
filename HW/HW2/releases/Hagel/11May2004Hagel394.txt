SENATE PASSES TAX BILL
  The U.S. Senate tonight passed S.1637, the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) bill by a vote of 92 to 5. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the bill. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code to make it easier for U.S. businesses to trade in international markets, includes incentives to increase renewable fuel production, and establishes provisions to fund sections of Hagel's New Homestead Act.
   "This bill includes important provisions to enhance America's competitive position in the world, increase energy production and conservation, and expand rural investments for states like Nebraska," Hagel said.
   The adjustments to the Internal Revenue Code will help lift European Union trade sanctions on some U.S. exports. These changes in the tax code are offset by closing loopholes and off-shore tax shelters.
   Among the incentives to increase renewable fuel production are provisions to:
   * Revamp ethanol tax formulas and extend a tax credit for ethanol producers;
   * Extend a tax credit for solar and wind power generators to those who produce energy from agricultural livestock, small irrigation, geothermal sources, and municipal solid waste;
   * Provide tax incentives for investing in electricity transmission lines and shift the burden of paying for new lines from ratepayers to power suppliers;
   * Extend a credit to facilities that produce fuel from landfill gas, agricultural and animal waste, refined coal, and coal byproducts.
   The New Homestead provisions will provide a tax credit for starting or expanding businesses that are in high out-migration counties.
   The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for consideration.
