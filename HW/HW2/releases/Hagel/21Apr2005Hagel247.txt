EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING BILL PASSES SENATE
 The U.S. Senate passed the Emergency Supplemental Spending Bill today for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by a vote of 99 to 0.  
 The funding provides troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with resources to continue operations. Without this bill the Armed Forces will begin to run out of funding as early as next month. 
   A provision supported by Hagel for increasing the Survivor Benefit was included in the Bill. Hagel introduced legislation in January to raise survivor benefits paid to the families of military personnel killed while on active duty from $12,000 to $100,000. The increase applies retroactively to all service members on active duty who have died since military operations began in 2001. 
   "This bill is essential to provide our troops with the resources they need. It is critical that this legislation get to the President as soon as possible. Increasing the survivor benefit assures those sacrificing for their country in a time of war that their families will be taken care of. The loss of a loved one is a tremendous emotional hardship for families. Congress must do what it can to ensure that it does not cause devastating financial hardship as well," Hagel said. 
   The military death benefit is money provided within 72 hours to families of service members who are killed while on active duty. These funds assist next-of-kin with their immediate financial needs. 
   The Bill will now go to a House/Senate Conference.
