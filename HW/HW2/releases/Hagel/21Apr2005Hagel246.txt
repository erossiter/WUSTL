SEN. HAGEL CONTINUES TO NEGOTIATE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR COMPREHENSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that after several weeks of negotiations, Sens.  
 Mark Pryor (D-AR) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA) have agreed to cosponsor legislation dealing with the issue of climate change. In February, Hagel introduced international, domestic, and tax incentives legislation addressing the issue of climate change. Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Larry Craig (R-ID), Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are cosponsors of all three bills. Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV) is a cosponsor of the international bill. 
   "The support of Senators Landrieu and Pryor is a critical bipartisan step forward for our climate change legislation. They understand that our success in dealing with the climate change issue will be driven by innovation and requires public-private partnerships. I look forward to working with all the cosponsors to pass responsible climate change legislation in the Senate," Hagel said. 
   Hagel's legislative package focuses on the role of private-public partnerships; the need for shared responsibilities between developed and developing countries; the linkages between environmental, economic, and energy policies; technology and developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
