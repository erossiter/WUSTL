SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS FEMA'S APPROVAL OF NORTH PLATTE'S LETTER OF MAP REVISION
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved the city of North Platte's Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) and has announced that the LOMR will become effective on May 4, 2006.  
 In July 2004, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) sent a letter to FEMA urging an expedited review of the Flood Plain Maps North Platte submitted, and has worked closely with FEMA and North Platte officials to expedite the process. 
   "FEMA's approval of North Platte's Letter of Map Revision is good news for the community. When the process is finalized, this will allow many property owners to discontinue the previously required federal flood insurance. However, maintaining flood insurance on a voluntary basis will still be available. Given the many extraordinary demands on FEMA in the previous year, I applaud FEMA for their efforts to expedite this process and thank North Platte's elected officials, city and county government employees and leaders for their dedication," Hagel said. 
   The city will conduct four public meetings to review the map information beginning January 30, 2006. A representative from Hagel's office will attend.
