COMMUNITY DRINKING WATER ASSISTANCE ACT
  It is now estimated that implementing new arsenic standards for public drinking water will cost affected Nebraska communities collectively $120 million over the next ten years. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that in water systems serving communities smaller than 10,000 people, the average annual cost of implementing the new standards could range from $38 to $327 per household. This is an unacceptable burden on our communities. The federal government must be certain that it acts in a thoughtful and responsible way when enforcing regulations. The financial burdens of implementing these new regulations must be carefully considered.  
   This year, I will reintroduce legislation that proposes federal funding of $1.9 billion annually to assist communities that are upgrading their water systems in order to meet Safe Drinking Water Act standards. My legislation also addresses workable timelines for regulatory compliance on the new arsenic standards by delaying EPA enforcement during a grant application and post-award process. 
   In 2001, the EPA changed the water quality standard by reducing the amount of arsenic allowed in our drinking water from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb in order to improve the safety standards of our drinking water. The new national standard for arsenic is scheduled to take effect in January 2006. This new government mandate will create high costs in developing and implementing new technologies to meet drinking water standards. It is important that Congress does what is necessary to address unfair financial burdens on our Nebraska communities. 
   Federal requirements and regulations should be based on reasonable, common sense solutions to problems. We must do more to help small communities meet new regulations. Senator Domenici and I introduced legislation in the 108th Congress that would address our challenges by: 
   * Establishing $1.9 billion per year in grant money for small public water systems; 
   * Providing temporary relief from EPA enforcement during and after the grant application process; 
   * Delaying enforcement of the standards if a state proves they have made substantial progress in drinking water standards compliance; and 
   * Mandating that at least 20% of grant funds shall be provided for smaller communities like many of those in Nebraska. 
   Under current policy, small communities (below 3,300 residents) that are expected to face financial challenges in complying with new standards may be granted temporary extensions. These temporary extensions can amount to a total of 14 years to achieve compliance. However, towns with populations over 3,300, such as Alliance, Gering, and McCook, are not eligible for extensions. It is important to provide a more realistic timeline of compliance for these communities so that they too can gradually acquire the necessary technology to address these problems. Also, we should make available to small Nebraska communities funds to help them with the technical assistance necessary to implement environmental upgrades. 
   This year, the small Nebraska community of Lyman and its 421 residents will become a model for the nation. Lyman is slated to be a one-of-a-kind "pilot" project in a national demonstration studying a public water treatment system for the contaminates of arsenic and uranium. Through a national grant from the EPA, officials in Lyman and scientists at EPA will get a better understanding of treatment costs and effective solutions. 
   According to Nebraska Health and Human Services, 75 communities in Nebraska are affected by the arsenic standard and could benefit from the type of assistance that my legislation proposes. Exemptions and delays of EPA enforcement are an important step we can take to help our small communities lessen the immediate financial strains. While we work on improving the quality of our drinking water in Nebraska, we also need to provide responsible timelines. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues on finding responsible ways to address compliance with EPA standards.
