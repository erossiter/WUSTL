SEN. HAGEL SUPPORTS SEN. BURNS' BOXED BEEF BILL
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) in introducing legislation today which would delay the importation of boxed beef over the age of 30 months from Canada.  
 The U.S. is scheduled to resume importation of Canadian beef on March 7th. 
   "Whether the beef is boxed or alive, it needs to be addressed in a uniform way and we need to deal with both issues at the same time," Hagel said. 
   On January 7th, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a final rule allowing the live importation of cattle under 30 months of age from Canada into the U.S. The rule also allows for the importation of meat and meat byproducts from beef over 30 months of age. The Senate Committee on Agriculture held a hearing today on the USDA rule allowing the importation of live cattle under 30 months of age and boxed beef from Canada.
