SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULING REINSTATING NEBRASKA'S CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION BANNING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement this afternoon in support of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit's ruling which reinstated Nebraska's constitutional provision banning same-sex marriage:  
   "The federal appeals court has reinstated Nebraska's constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, re-affirmed the right of Nebraskans to determine their own laws governing marriage, and has found there is no constitutional right to same-sex marriage. I support Nebraska's constitutional provision and I support this long-awaited and common-sense decision by the 8th Circuit. States have always had jurisdiction over marriage laws. Today's ruling should not come as a surprise. Every other ruling by state appeals courts or federal courts on this issue has upheld the authority of states to define their own definition of marriage," Hagel said.
