THREE NEBRASKA STUDENTS CHOSEN AS PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) applauds three Nebraska students chosen to participate in the Presidential Scholars Program.  
 The scholars are Nickolas Fretes and Anish Mitra of Lincoln East High School and Amy Gilpin of Westside High School in Omaha. The scholars will be honored during the program's national recognition events in Washington, D.C. from June 25-28. As part of the Presidential Scholars National Recognition Week, the students will attend a ceremony sponsored by the White House, participate in panel discussions, and attend performances at the Kennedy Center. 
   "I applaud these three terrific Nebraska students for their hard work and dedication. Nickolas, Anish and Amy are fine representatives for our state at the annual Presidential Scholars National Recognition Week. Their academic and leadership accomplishments are recognized among the best in the nation," Hagel said. 
   The Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964 to honor the Nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors. Each year, the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects up to 141 Presidential Scholars on the basis of their accomplishments in academics, the arts, leadership, and extracurricular activities.
