SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER NEBRASKA GAME AND PARKS COMMISSION DIRECTOR
  The following is a response from Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) regarding the death of former Nebraska Game and Parks Commission Director Gene Mahoney:  
   "This is a sad day for all Nebraskans. Gene Mahoney was a tireless advocate for Nebraska, and he was a dear friend and advisor to me. Through his visionary leadership of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, his work on behalf of the Henry Doorly Zoo, his deep commitment to his faith and church, and his generous efforts on behalf of others, he leaves an enduring legacy. Nebraska and the nation are better places because of Gene Mahoney. 
   Lilibet and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the Mahoney family. We will all miss him."
