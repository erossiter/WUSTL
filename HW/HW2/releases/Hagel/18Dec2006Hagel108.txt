SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES LINCOLN NOMINEES TO U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Chuck Hagel nominated Jonathan P. Sloup and John R. Grabowski from Lincoln, Nebraska for admission to the United States Military Academy and Patrick A. Hybl, also from Lincoln, for admission to the United States Air Force Academy.  
   Applicants were required to meet with one of three regional academy selection committees that Hagel has set-up to assist him in the evaluation of academy candidates. They were judged on their high school transcripts, academic achievement, ACT/SAT scores, career motivation, self-assurance, leadership, extra-curricular and community activities, and an essay on the Academy Honor Code, "We will not lie, steal or cheat nor tolerate among us anyone who does." The four academies will make their selections for the class of 2011 from these appointees. 
   "I am proud to announce these academy nominations from Lincoln. These outstanding young people will be our nation's leaders in the 21st century," said Hagel. 
   Sloup attends Lincoln Southwest High School and is the son of Steve and Lori Sloup. Grabowski attends Lincoln East High School and is the son of John and Karen Grabowski. Hybl attends Lincoln Lutheran High School and is the son of Mike Hybl and Chris Dibbern.
