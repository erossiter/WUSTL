USDA TO HOLD INFORMATION SESSION IN FREMONT, NEB.
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will hold an information session about early soybean rust detection and treatment.  
 The seminar will be held on July 28 at 10 a.m. at the Holiday Inn Express in Fremont, Nebraska. USDA officials and experts will present a panel entitled "Soybean Rust: What Is It, Why Should I Care and What are Government and Industry Representatives Doing to Address It?" Information will also be presented on combating rust and government safeguards. 
   "It is important that agricultural producers are aware of soybean rust and its potential harmful effects. This seminar will provide necessary information about soybean rust and allow producers to ask USDA experts questions," Hagel said. 
   Soybean rust, a fungus that infects the leaves of soybean plants and has caused significant yield losses in other parts of the world, has not been detected in the continental United States. However, USDA officials and field experts say early detection and treatment could minimize the impact of the eventual introduction of the disease in this country.
