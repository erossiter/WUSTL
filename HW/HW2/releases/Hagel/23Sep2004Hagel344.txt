SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONCERNS OVER MANAGEMENT OF FANNIE MAE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement regarding the release of a report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight which raised serious concerns about the "overall safety and soundness" of the congressionally chartered mortgage finance company Fannie Mae.  
   "This is a deeply troubling report. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac account for almost half of all mortgage loans in the United States. The public has a vested interest in ensuring that these two congressionally chartered institutions follow their housing mission and pose no significant risk to our economy. 
   Last year, I introduced legislation to provide effective regulation of these institutions. A modified version of that legislation passed the Senate Banking Committee earlier this year. Congress must now act on this legislation. It is in the best interest of the housing industry, the private capital markets, investors and most importantly the American taxpayer," Hagel said.
