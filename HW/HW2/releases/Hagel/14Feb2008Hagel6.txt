SEN. HAGEL RE-INTRODUCES BEGINNING FARMERS, RANCHERS TAX INCENTIVE ACT
  February 14th, 2008 - U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today re-introduced legislation to provide an incentive for active agricultural producers to sell their farmland to beginning farmers and ranchers. Hagel originally introduced this bill in 2003. Congressman Lee Terry (R-NE) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives in January.  
   "More than half of our nation's producers will reach retirement age in the next 10 to 15 years. A smooth transition to the next generation of producers is critical to the future of our agriculture industry. This is important legislation for Nebraska," Hagel said. 
   The bill provides the following three tiers of tax breaks according to type of sale: 
   * Tier One: Active farmers/ranchers selling their land to a beginning farmer or rancher would benefit from a 100% reduction in the capital gains tax rate, up to $500,000 of a single sale. 
   * Tier Two: Active farmers/ranchers selling land to someone keeping the land in agricultural production would receive a 50% reduction in the capital gains tax rate. 
   * Tier Three: Active farmers/ranchers selling land to anyone would receive a 25% reduction in the capital gains tax rate. 
   This legislation is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation; National Farmer's Union; National Cattleman's Beef Association; National Association of Wheat Growers; and the Center for Rural Affairs.
