SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES HASTINGS COUPLE AS ADOPTION ANGELS
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Gene and Carlene Boner of Hastings, Nebraska are recipients of the 2005 Angels in Adoption award.  
 Every year, the Angels in Adoption program allows members of Congress to recognize and honor those who have been involved in adoption. Hagel recommended the Boners to be the Nebraska recipients for 2005. 
   "Adoption is an amazing gift of love. The Boner family has opened their home and hearts to children in need of a loving family and has shown others across the country the importance of adoption. The Angels in Adoption award allows Congress to recognize those who are 'real-life angels.' The Boners are 'real-life angels'," Hagel said. 
   The Boners have adopted six-year old Brittany, are guardians of fifteen-year old Jeremy, and are in the process of adopting two-year old Matthew. Gene is Captain of the Hastings Police Department and Carlene is a nurse. 
   "We are both very honored and humbled to even have been nominated for this wonderful award, let alone to be selected. There are many people involved in foster care and the adoption of children who tirelessly devote their time, love and compassion. We accept this award on behalf of those many people who work behind the scenes to promote the rights of children to be able to grow up in a happy and loving home," the Boners said. 
   The seventh annual congressional Angels in Adoption awards ceremony will be held on September 13, 2005 in Washington, D.C.
