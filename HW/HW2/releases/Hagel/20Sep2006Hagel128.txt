SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES LINCOLN COUPLE AS ADOPTION ANGELS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Lance and Amy McCord of Lincoln, Nebraska are recipients of the 2006 Angels in Adoption award. Every year, the Angels in Adoption program allows members of Congress to recognize and honor those who have been involved in adoption. Hagel recommended the McCords to be the Nebraska recipients for 2006.  
   "Adoption is an amazing gift of love. The McCord family has opened their home and hearts to children in need of a loving family and has shown others across the country the importance of adoption. The Angels in Adoption award allows Congress to recognize those who are 'real-life angels.' The McCords are 'real-life angels'," Hagel said. 
   The McCords have adopted their three children, Wesley, Anna and Jackson. The McCords have also provided "cradle care" for 16 newborns ranging in age from a week to a month old while adoption proceedings were pending. Lance worked at The People's City Mission in Lincoln for 14 years and is now serving as a Nebraska Corrections Officer at the Lincoln Correction Center. Amy is the Activities Director at the Clark Jeary Retirement Center in Lincoln and previously served as the "Adoption Specialist" for the Lincoln Crisis Pregnancy Center. 
   "We are humbled and honored to be recognized among many others who have given of themselves in foster care and adoption. Every child deserves a loving family and if we can help that happen we are blessed. We are very thankful for the privilege of having children through adoption," the McCords said. 
   The eighth annual congressional Angels in Adoption awards ceremony is being held today in Washington, D.C.
