SEN. HAGEL INTRODUCES BILL TO PROVIDE TAX CREDIT FOR LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today introduced the "CAFO Tax Credit Act." The legislation provides a tax credit that will help livestock producers meet the costs of complying with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. Last Friday, Sen. Hagel was at Ole's in Paxton, Nebraska to discuss the introduction of this legislation with Nebraska cattlemen.  
   Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are sites at which large numbers of animals are housed and fed. The EPA has ruled that CAFOs which discharge into U.S. waterways must obtain a discharge permit, and control material that enters those waterways by July 31, 2007. Livestock producers incur large costs in applying for the discharge permits and modifying their operations to comply with EPA regulations. This legislation provides a tax credit to producers who undertake the corrective measures to control the discharges. 
   "Complying with EPA's CAFO regulations is going to cost money, and small and mid-size producers in Nebraska will be especially hard hit with these new costs. This legislation provides a significant tax credit to offset the cost of compliance. There is no debate on the need to control discharges into waterways. However, EPA has once again regulated industry without considering the costs. This common-sense legislation addresses the reality of these costs," Hagel said. 
   "This legislation is much needed and greatly appreciated," states Pete McClymont, a cattle producer from Holdrege, Nebraska and current President of Nebraska Cattlemen. "The cost of complying with EPA regulations is very burdensome to Nebraska producers costing $200,000 or more."
