SEN. HAGEL CALLS IDEA RE-AUTHORIZATION BILL 'HUGE WIN FOR EDUCATION FUNDING'
  The U.S. Senate passed a bill (HR 1350) to re-authorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by unanimous consent late last night.  
 The law guarantees all special-needs children a free and appropriate public education. 
   "This is a huge win for education funding. This bill puts IDEA on the path to full funding. The IDEA Re-authorization bill has been pending for nearly two years. Passage of this bi-partisan legislation will ensure that children with disabilities receive a quality education, and help provide their parents, teachers and school administrators with the resources they need to help meet the academic and personal needs of students with disabilities," U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) said. 
   The bill includes authorization levels that, if met, would put Congress on a path to fully-fund IDEA by 2011. Every year since 1997 Senator Hagel, along with Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), has worked to increase funding for IDEA. 
   When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, it committed to funding 40% of the costs imposed on states to meet the mandates of IDEA. Congress has never funded more than 20% of the program. Since 1996, IDEA funding has increased from $2.3 billion to $10.1 billion in FY04.
