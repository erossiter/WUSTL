SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY POWELL
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding the resignation of Secretary of State Colin Powell:  
   "Secretary Powell has led the State Department with strength, dignity, and clarity of purpose. He has elevated the morale and spirit of State Department employees around the globe, commanded international respect, and combined traditional diplomacy with creative policies to meet the great challenges of our time. He leaves the State Department as still the most respected, most trusted, and most popular leader in America today. He was always the calm, steady, balanced voice in the Bush Administration. His presence will be severely missed. 
   America is grateful to Colin Powell for his historic service."
