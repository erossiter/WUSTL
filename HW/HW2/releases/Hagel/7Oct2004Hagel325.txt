SEN. HAGEL RECEIVES NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS AWARD
  Today, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) received the "Guardian of Small Business" Award from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) in recognition of his strong small business voting record during the 108th Congress.  
 The award was given to 48 Senators and 236 Representatives whose voting records support small business at least 70 percent of the time on key votes. Sen. Hagel voted in support of small business on all votes for a 100 percent voting record. Hagel has been recognized by the NFIB in each session of Congress since 1996. 
   "It is important that Congress support the important contributions small businesses make to America's economy and local communities. I am committed to ensuring that Nebraska's small businesses are able to operate in an environment conducive to their growth and prosperity. It is an honor to receive this award," Hagel said. 
   NFIB represents 600,000 small businesses nationwide, and has about 6,100 members in Nebraska. Most NFIB members have five or fewer employees and have been in business more than 10 years. The key votes NFIB used to determine recipients of the award dealt with legislation ranging from tax relief to the creation of tax-free medical savings accounts.
