SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS LIVESTOCK COMPENSATION PROGRAM
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined a group of Senators this week in introducing legislation to re-authorize the Livestock Compensation Program (LCP). The legislation provides funds to livestock producers in disaster-designated counties for feed losses incurred due to snow storms, drought and other natural disasters. Under the legislation livestock producers in counties given a disaster designation between January 1, 2006, and the enactment of the bill, would be eligible for LCP funds. The LCP was originally authorized in 2002.  
   "This is important legislation for Nebraska's livestock producers. Producers are struggling to recover from last weekend's winter ice storm, after suffering from one of the worst years of drought on record in 2006. Programs like the LCP will help Nebraska's ranchers sustain operations during this difficult period," Hagel said. 
   The legislation was referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
