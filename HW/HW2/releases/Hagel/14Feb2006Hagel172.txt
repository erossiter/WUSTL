SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING SALE OF NEBRASKA DRY BEANS TO IRAQ
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding the sale of 10,000 metric tons of Nebraska's Great Northern dry beans to Iraq. The deal was reached between four Nebraska dry bean processors, Kelley Bean, Trinidad Bean, New Alliance Bean and Grain, and Stateline Bean Cooperative, and the government of Iraq. Last week, Hagel wrote a letter to the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroads requesting assistance in helping Nebraska's bean processors meet deadlines in obtaining rail cars to transport their products. In 2003, Hagel's office worked with United States Agency for International Development to help facilitate the first shipment of Nebraska's dry beans to Iraq. The Great Northern beans are slated for shipment to Iraq in April.  
   "This is good news for Nebraska's dry bean growers. The sale of these beans will benefit both Nebraska and the people of Iraq. This deal is a credit to both the determination of Nebraska's dry bean processors and the quality of their product. As we have done since 2003, my office will continue to do all it can to help cut through government red tape as this sale moves forward," Hagel said.
