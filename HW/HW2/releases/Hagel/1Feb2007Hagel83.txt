SENS. HAGEL, NELSON RE-INTRODUCE LEGISLATION ON LEWIS, CLARK INTERPRETIVE CENTER
  Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) re-introduced legislation today that would transfer full control of the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Nebraska City, Nebraska to the locally owned Missouri River Basin Lewis and Clark Interpretive Trails and Visitor Center Foundation, Inc. Hagel and Nelson introduced a similar piece of legislation in the 109th Congress.  
   "The Lewis and Clark Interpretive Trail and Visitor Center preserves and protects an important part of Nebraska's history. The Foundation has consistently been a responsible steward of the Center's operations. Providing the Foundation full control of the Center will save federal funds and help assure continued success of the Center," Hagel said. 
   "Lewis and Clark's expeditions are a proud chapter in Nebraska's heritage. Our bill will give greater control of this heritage to local officials who can more effectively offer visitors a unique look at the more than 300 scientific discoveries made by those early pioneers," Nelson said. 
   The Center opened on July 30, 2004 and serves as an educational tool and historical landmark for those interested in learning more about the Lewis and Clark expedition. The National Park Service (NPS) currently owns the building and property on which the Lewis and Clark Center is located. The Lewis and Clark Center in Nebraska City is the last of the eleven major Visitors Centers along the Lewis and Clark Historic Trail that has not been turned over to a state or private entity.
