SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION OF STECHER FOR U.S. ATTORNEY
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released this statement today following notification from the Department of Justice that President Bush will nominate Mr. Joe Stecher for the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Nebraska. Mr. Stecher currently serves as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Nebraska. In December, Sen. Hagel - in consultation with Nebraska's Congressional Delegation - recommended to President Bush that Mr. Stecher be nominated for the position:  
   "This is important news for the federal justice system in Nebraska. Joe Stecher brings enormous commitment and integrity to the U.S. Attorney's office. He has done an exceptional job over the last few months as acting U.S. Attorney and enjoys widespread support in Nebraska for his nomination to be U.S. Attorney for the District of Nebraska. I will work with my colleagues to ensure that Joe Stecher is confirmed by the Senate as soon as possible." 
   Mr. Stecher's nomination will now be considered in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
