SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT OF FANNIE MAE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) determination that Fannie Mae must restate its losses for the last four years.  
 This could result in Fannie Mae recording $9 billion in previously unrecorded losses: 
   "This is another dangerous example of why the Congress must pass strong, effective oversight legislation to regulate these mammoth Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE). 
   Last year, my colleagues and I introduced legislation to provide strengthened regulation of these institutions. A modified version of that legislation passed the Senate Banking Committee, but Congress failed to act on this legislation before adjourning. I plan to re-introduce a strong GSE regulatory reform bill at the beginning of the next Congress. The Congress must begin providing responsible oversight of these GSEs. 
   A world-class GSE regulator is in the best interest of the housing industry, the private capital markets, investors and most importantly the American taxpayer," Hagel said.
