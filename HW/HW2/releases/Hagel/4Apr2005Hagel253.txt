SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS BILL TO HELP SMALL COMMUNITIES MEET EPA ARSENIC STANDARDS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM) in introducing legislation today to help communities comply with environmental standards for drinking water.  
 This legislation would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide communities with the funding needed to comply with stricter arsenic regulations for drinking water imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This legislation would also assist communities faced with other contaminant regulation compliance such as uranium and copper. 
   "Many small communities cannot afford to comply with revised EPA arsenic standards for drinking water. Exemptions and delays of EPA enforcement are an important step to help our small communities lessen the immediate financial strains. While we work on improving the quality of Nebraska's drinking water, we also need to provide responsible timelines," Hagel said. 
   Specifically, the bill would: 
   Authorize $1.9 billion in grants for the years 2006-2011; 
   Provide temporary relief from EPA enforcement of drinking water standards during and after the grant application process; and 
   Delay enforcement of the standards if a state proves they have made substantial progress in drinking water standards compliance. 
   In 2001, the EPA changed the existing water quality standard by reducing the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb. It is estimated that implementing the new arsenic standard will cost Nebraska $128 million over the next ten years.
