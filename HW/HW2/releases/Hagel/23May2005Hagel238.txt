SENATE PASSES SEN. HAGEL'S RESOLUTION WELCOMING PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN
  The U.S. Senate passed a resolution today introduced by Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) welcoming Hamid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan, and expressing support for a strong and enduring strategic partnership between the U.S. and Afghanistan. Hagel, the Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was joined by the Committee's Chairman, Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Ranking Democratic member, Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE), in introducing the resolution. 
   "President Karzai is a valued friend of the United States. America is committed to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan. America and Afghanistan are linked together by the war on terrorism and promoting security and more open political and economic systems throughout the Greater Middle East and Central Asia," Hagel said. 
   President Karzai is in the United States for a 5-day trip to meet with President Bush and other national leaders. Hagel will accompany Karzai to Nebraska. On Wednesday, President Karzai will visit a farm in West Point, receive an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha and will participate in meetings with local and state officials and Afghan-American residents in Nebraska.
