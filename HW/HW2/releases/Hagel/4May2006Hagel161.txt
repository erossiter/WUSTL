SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON VOTE AGAINST WASTEFUL NON-EMERGENCY SPENDING
  The U.S. Senate voted to pass a $109 billion emergency spending bill today by a vote of 78 to 20. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted against the bill because it far exceeded President Bush's original request for $92.2 billion in emergency spending to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. The Senate bill now includes billions of dollars in unrequested funding for projects that do not require emergency funding. President Bush has threatened to veto any emergency spending legislation that exceeds his request.  
   "At some point, we've got to come forward with some courage and discipline to stop this massive hemorrhaging of federal spending. The President is right to say he will veto this bill , which spends over $14 billion more than he requested. I support him and will support his veto. Many of these projects are worthwhile but they should be funded through the normal appropriations process where there is accountability, not stuffed into an emergency bill. The American people deserve better than a U.S. Senate out of control with no fiscal discipline - further eroding the economic strength of this country, and continuing to pile up more and more debt for future generations," Hagel said. 
   The House passed an emergency spending bill that cost $91.9 billion. Differences between the two bills will now be negotiated in a House-Senate Conference Committee.
