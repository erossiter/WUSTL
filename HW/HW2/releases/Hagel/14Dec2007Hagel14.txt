SEN. HAGEL OPPOSES SENATE FARM BILL
  U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today voted against final passage of the Senate farm bill. The following is a statement from Senator Hagel regarding his vote. The bill passed by a vote of 79-14.  
   "Our federal farm policy has drifted far from where it was originally intended to be 70 years ago. The Senate missed an opportunity to reform our farm policy for 21st Century challenges and opportunities, and reconnect our agriculture policy to its original purpose: providing a true safety net to real farmers when they need it most, while limiting government involvement in producer's decisions. 
   "One of the biggest problems with the bill we voted on today is the continuation of a farm payment system that encourages producers to make their business decisions not on market conditions, but on what subsidies they are eligible for. Fewer than half of America's farms benefit from our current farm policy and nearly 66 percent of farm payments go to only 10 percent of producers. This lopsided payment system is nothing more than federally-subsidized farm consolidation, allowing large land owners to buy up small agricultural producers with taxpayer dollars. It is unwise and wrong to continue these policies. The real farmers and tax payers lose. The big guys win. 
   "We need to pass a farm bill that significantly reforms our current policy. The Senate Farm bill does nothing to reform the system, but instead does everything to sustain the status quo. Our agriculture producers deserve better. 
   "In the coming weeks Senate and House conferees will have an opportunity to produce a responsible farm bill. Agriculture policy is far too important to Nebraska and America for it to continue on such a misguided path. I look forward to working with my colleagues on developing responsible farm policy for the 21st Century," Hagel concluded.
