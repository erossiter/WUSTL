SENATE PASSES WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
 The U.S. Senate passed today by a vote of 81-12 the Water Resources Development Act. Senator Hagel voted in favor of the legislation. This legislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to construct various projects for improvements to U.S. waterways, including improvement and expansion of existing locks on U.S. rivers, environmental restoration projects, and flood damage reduction projects. U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) supported authorization of six Nebraska projects that were included in the bill. 
   "This legislation addresses needed improvements in our nation's waterway infrastructure. Additionally, this bill authorizes important projects in Nebraska addressing flood control, environmental restoration and Endangered Species recovery. The targeted programs address significant needs in Nebraska communities," Hagel said. 
   The bill includes the following projects for Nebraska:
