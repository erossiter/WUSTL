SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON JIM NICHOLSON'S SENATE CONFIRMATION TO BE VA SECRETARY
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today following Senate confirmation of Jim Nicholson to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs:  
   "Jim Nicholson understands war, duty and sacrifice from his experiences as a soldier in the Vietnam War. He recognizes the vital role the Department of Veterans Affairs plays in addressing the needs of our nation's veterans and will bring the necessary leadership to ensure that our latest generation of warriors and those veterans before them receive the services they deserve. 
   I look forward to working closely with Jim Nicholson over the next four years to promote and protect the interests of those who have sacrificed for their country," Hagel said. 
   In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated Hagel to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration, a nomination that was confirmed by the United States Senate.
