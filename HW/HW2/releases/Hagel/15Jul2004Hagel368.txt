SENATE PASSES U.S.-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  The Senate passed the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement (S. 2610) today by a vote of 80 to 16. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted for the trade agreement. The trade agreement passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 314-109. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement will now go to the President for his signature. 
   "This trade agreement is good for jobs and economic development in Nebraska. Expanded and open markets overseas are key to Nebraska's economy," Hagel said. 
   U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement eliminates all duties on U.S. agricultural and food products to Australia. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, total U.S. exports to Australia in 2003 were $13 billion. The trade agreement is projected to create an additional $2 billion in overall U.S. exports each year. In 2003, the U.S. exported almost $700 million in agricultural products to Australia. 
   Nebraska exports to Australia have consistently grown from $36 million in 1999 to over $62 million in 2003. Over 300 Nebraska jobs are supported directly from trade with Australia. There are five Australian owned companies in Nebraska that employ nearly 500 people.
