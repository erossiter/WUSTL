SBA ANNOUNCES SMALL BUSINESSES IN ALL NEBRASKA COUNTIES ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER ASSISTANCE LOANS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that small, non-farm businesses in all 93 Nebraska counties may now apply for low-interest disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). These disaster loans will offset economic losses caused by drought, hail, tornadoes, extreme heat and high winds. By law, SBA makes disaster assistance available to counties that have been designated as disasters by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. USDA has designated all counties in Nebraska as disaster counties. Gov. Dave Heineman requested the disaster designations. Sen. Hagel sent letters to Secretary Johanns supporting the Governor's requests.  
   "Nebraskans have suffered through years of continued drought conditions. The ongoing hardships have resulted in losses in revenue for many of Nebraska's small businesses. Today's announcement is an important step for small businesses across the state to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses that would have been met if not for the poor conditions on the ground," Hagel said. 
   Small businesses may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $1.5 million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which could have been met had the disaster not occurred. For more information on eligibility and how to apply, please visit www.sba.gov/disaster or call toll-free (800) 659-2955. 
   The deadline to apply for these loans is May 28, 2007.
