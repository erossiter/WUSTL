SEN. HAGEL HONORED BY AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS FOR COMMITMENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today received the Champion of Children Award from the American Association of School Administrators (AASA).  
 During the 2005 AASA National Conference on Education in San Antonio, TX, Hagel was recognized for his work on education issues, specifically his work to fully fund the federal government's commitment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Hagel spoke via satellite from Washington, D.C. to the group of AASA members, which included members from Nebraska. 
   "The American Association of School Administrators plays an important leadership role in improving the education of our young people. I am honored to accept the Champion of Children Award. I will continue to work hard on behalf of the committed parents, teachers, school administrators, and AASA members to fully fund Congress' commitment to IDEA," Hagel said. 
   When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, it promised to provide states with 40 percent of the costs needed to educate children with disabilities. Unfortunately, Congress has never fulfilled its funding promise and today IDEA is one of the largest unfunded federal mandates on states. Hagel has worked to increase funding for IDEA from $2.3 billion in FY 1996 to $10.6 billion in FY 2005, which is about 19 percent of the funds needed to meet IDEA mandates. 
   This year, Hagel will re-introduce legislation to make full funding for IDEA mandatory.
