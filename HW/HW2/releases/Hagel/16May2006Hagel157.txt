SEN. HAGEL: ROLE OF HEDGE FUNDS IN OUR CAPITAL MARKETS
  Opening Statement by U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel: Role of Hedge Funds in our Capital Markets
   "Today's hearing will focus on the 'Role of Hedge Funds in our Capital Markets.' The intent of this hearing is to educate and inform the Congress and the American people on this growing sector of our financial markets. 
   According to the Economist magazine, a hedge fund is defined as a managed pool of capital for institutional or wealthy individual investors that employs one of various trading strategies in equities, bonds or derivatives, attempting to gain from market inefficiencies and, to some extent, hedge underlying risks. Charles Mingus, an American jazz bassist and composer once said, "Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity." Suffice it to say, we're looking for creativity from our witnesses today.  
   Alfred Jones is credited as the father of hedge funds; he established the Jones Hedge Fund in 1949. Roy Neuberger and Benjamin Graham are also credited for laying the foundation for the industry. However, hedge funds did not begin to gain popularity until the 1960s. 
   In 1969, almost 200 hedge funds managed $1.5 billion in assets. Since then, the growth of the hedge fund industry has exploded, with most of the growth occurring in the past decade. Currently, over 8,000 hedge funds manage over $1trillion in assets. 
   Today's hearing will look at the benefits and risks of hedge funds to investors and our economy. We will explore the current oversight of hedge funds; the level of transparency; the different types of investors; and the cause for the explosive growth of this industry over the last decade. The hearing will also examine the current dynamic of the over-the-counter derivatives market and assess the growing risks and benefits of this industry. We will look at the different types of derivatives offered; the main users of derivatives; potential concerns for investors; and the industry's impact on our capital markets. Finally, we will consider whether the federal government should play a greater oversight and regulatory role in these areas, and also assess the risks of over-regulation. 
   In today's global economy, large amounts of money can be transferred in a moment's notice and it is important that our investors have confidence in the systems and funds that transfer and administer their investment and assets, as well as a good understanding of both their investment benefits and risks. Just as important is keeping our capital markets here in the United States strong and dynamic and the envy of the world. 
   I welcome our witnesses today who will help us explore these important issues. Our first two panels feature representatives from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. We will look at the work the President's Working Group is doing on these issues.
