CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM ACRES TO BE RELEASED FOR GRAZING IN SIOUX COUNTY
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has released Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands in Nebraska for emergency haying and grazing to provide some relief for farmers and ranchers from the damage incurred to pastures and grazing lands from the recent wildfires. Today's announcement authorizes emergency grazing of CRP acreage in Sioux County. Sen. Hagel wrote a letter yesterday to Secretary Johanns in support if this designation.  
   "Wildfires have caused severe damage to the pastures and grass lands in western Nebraska. Producers in the area need every available source of feed for their livestock. The ability of cattle owners to begin grazing on CRP acres is critical. I appreciate Secretary Johanns' action on this urgent issue and I urge USDA to consider the release of CRP acres for emergency grazing in all remaining Nebraska counties that have been severely impacted by the ongoing drought as soon as possible," Hagel said. 
   To be eligible, a county must have suffered at least a 40 percent loss of precipitation, pasture, and forage production from normal levels. More information on this program is available at: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/pas/
