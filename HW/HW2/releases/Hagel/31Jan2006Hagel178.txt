SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding the death of Coretta Scott King, wife of Dr.  
 Martin Luther King, Jr. Hagel introduced King in February 2005, with his son Ziller, during the program launch of Generation Engage, a bipartisan grassroots initiative to involve more young Americans in politics and public policy: 
   "Coretta Scott King was an example of the power of an American voice. She was a voice for nonviolent social change and justice in America. Through her vision, passion, and commitment to a cause larger than her own self-interest, she was an example of what you can become in America. Coretta Scott King was one of our nation's most influential and respected leaders. She will be missed. 
   "Lilibet and I will keep her family in our thoughts and prayers."
