SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON JAPANESE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO RE-OPEN JAPANESE MARKETS TO U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today after a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato this morning to discuss the Japanese Government's decision to resume importation of U.S. beef. The Japanese Government's decision came following the recently completed inspection of all authorized beef processing plants in the United States. Ambassador Kato presented Senator Hagel with a letter outlining the Japanese government's decision to resume accepting imports of beef from cattle up to 20 months old.  
   "This is an important victory for Nebraska and the entire U.S. beef industry. Japan is a critical market for Nebraska's beef producers. We must now work to re-gain the confidence of Japanese consumers until the market has been fully re-opened to all U.S. beef products. U.S. beef is the highest quality, safest beef in the world, and it is critical for Nebraska's producers to have full access to the Japanese market. I will continue to work with Secretary Johanns to open markets which remain closed to U.S. beef," Hagel said. 
   In addition to meeting with Kato this morning, Senator Hagel met with senior officials from the Japanese Embassy to discuss the resumption of U.S. beef exports into Japan last week. In May, Senator Hagel met with the Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso and Ambassador Kato to discuss the resumption of U.S. beef exports into Japan. On October 28, 2005 Senator Hagel hosted Ambassador Kato on a tour of beef producing and processing plants in Nebraska.
