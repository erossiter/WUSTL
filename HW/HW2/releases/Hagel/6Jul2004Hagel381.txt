EPA SELECTS NEBRASKA TOWNS FOR ARSENIC TESTING PROGRAM
  Today, Sen. Chuck Hagel announced the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has selected Lyman and Stromsburg, Nebraska to serve as demonstration sites for arsenic reduction technologies in drinking water.  
   "Maintaining water quality is vital to Nebraska. This program will help Nebraska's small communities comply with EPA standards in a cost effective way. This will be an important program for both Lyman and Stromsburg," Hagel said. 
   In 2001, the EPA changed the existing water quality standard for arsenic by reducing the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water from 50 parts per billion (pbb) to 10 pbb. The standard is scheduled to take effect in January 2006. 
   The EPA has established a program of grants for public water systems to assist small communities to comply with the new arsenic standards. A key part of the program is year long full-scale demonstrations of commercially available treatment technologies at selected water systems throughout the country. 
   The EPA will work with Lyman and Stromsburg to implement arsenic reduction technology. The EPA will finance the cost of the demonstration system, with the city paying for personnel and maintenance costs. The technical and economic data gathered from the demonstration projects will be used to help small communities across the country select technologies to meet the new arsenic standard.
