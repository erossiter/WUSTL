SENATORS REACH AGREEMENT WITH WHITE HOUSE ON PATRIOT ACT
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined Sens. Sununu (R-NH), Durbin (D-Il), Craig (R-ID) and Murkowski (R-AK) today in announcing that they had negotiated an agreement with the White House on reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act. In December, the senators opposed a House-Senate Conference Report on reauthorization of the Patriot Act because it did not provide sufficient protections for the rights of innocent Americans. The current Patriot Act is set to expire on March 10, 2006. The Patriot Act provides important tools for law enforcement to use in fighting terrorism.  
   "Over the last several months, we have worked hard to negotiate a Patriot Act reauthorization that provides all the tools necessary to fight terrorism, while also protecting the civil liberties of Americans. What we have announced today is a responsible agreement that strikes the appropriate balance between protecting our security and protecting our rights," Hagel said.
