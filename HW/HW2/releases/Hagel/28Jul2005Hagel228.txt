SENATE PASSES SEN. HAGEL'S RESOLUTION TO DESIGNATE AUG. 16 'NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY'
 A resolution introduced by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) designating August 16, 2005 as "National Airborne Day" passed the Senate last night by unanimous consent.  
 August 16, 2005 will be the 65th Anniversary of the first official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon. The resolution was co-sponsored by Sens. Bingaman, Cantwell, Burns, Inouye, Johnson, Dole, Boxer, Landrieu, Alexander, Snowe, Clinton, Reid, Cochran, Burr, Isakson, Hatch, Reed, Kerry, Lugar, Gregg and Roberts. 
   "Over the last 65 years, U.S. airborne forces have performed important military and peace-keeping operations throughout the world, including Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. August 16th is a day to celebrate and thank Airborne veterans and Airborne units for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and for the ideals of duty, honor and country they embody," Hagel said. 
   On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test Platoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The Parachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed the first official Army parachute jump on August 16th. The success of the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne contingent that has served from World War II until the present. 
   Last year, Hagel introduced Senate Resolution 322 to designate August 16, 2004 as "National Airborne Day," which passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Members of the 82nd Airborne Division Association recognized Hagel last year in appreciation for his efforts to designate the date as "National Airborne Day."
