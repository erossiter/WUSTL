SEN. HAGEL SENDS LETTER TO SECRETARY JOHANNS IN SUPPORT OF GOVERNOR'S DISASTER DECLARATION REQUEST FROM USDA
  Please find attached a letter Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) sent to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns today in support of Gov. Dave Heineman's request for drought disaster declarations from the USDA.  
   The Honorable Michael O. Johanns 
  Secretary 
  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
  1400 Independence Avenue, SW 
  Washington, DC 20250 
   Dear Secretary Johanns: 
   I write to support the request of Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman for a Secretarial Natural Disaster Designation for eight counties in the State of Nebraska. Several years of ongoing drought and high winds have caused significant losses to crops and pastures in these areas. 
   Governor Heineman is requesting public assistance for the following eight counties: 
   Chase Furnas Perkins 
  Dundy Hayes Red Willow 
  Frontier Hitchcock 
   Additionally, I applaud Thursday's announcement that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved emergency grazing on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands in three Nebraska counties. Emergency grazing on CRP lands is critical to help producers who need every available option to feed livestock. 
   I request your immediate consideration for the early release of CRP acres for emergency grazing in all remaining Nebraska counties that have been severely impacted by the ongoing drought. 
   Thank you for your consideration of my requests. 
   Sincerely,
