SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON DEATH OF SEN. THOMAS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement this morning regarding the death of Sen. Craig Thomas (R-WY):  
   "This is a sad day for all of us. Craig Thomas was a neighbor and a friend who committed his remarkable life to his country and his state. I will be forever grateful to him for being one of the first U.S. Senators to campaign for me in my 1996 race for the Senate, when few thought I had a chance to win. I had an opportunity to work closely with Craig Thomas on the Senate Foreign Relations and Energy Committees. He worked hard, was always prepared and was the kind of Senator the people of Wyoming could be proud of every day. 
   "If service is the highest American value, then Craig Thomas leaves a legacy that speaks volumes. He leaves his country and his state better because of his service. Craig Thomas was a straight-shooter. Being a Marine and having been raised on a ranch in Wyoming...what else could he be? 
   "Lilibet and I offer our prayers to Susan Thomas and the Thomas family."
