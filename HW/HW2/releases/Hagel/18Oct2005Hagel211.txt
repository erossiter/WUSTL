SEN. HAGEL, GOV. HEINEMAN SEND LETTER TO USDA SECRETARY JOHANNS ABOUT FARM SERVICE AGENCY CLOSURE PLANS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman sent a letter today to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns requesting that the U.S. Department of Agriculture reconsider the closure of Farm Service Agency offices in Nebraska under the FSA Tomorrow plan.  
   Attached is the letter sent to Johanns. 
   October 18, 2005 
   The Honorable Mike Johanns 
  United States Department of Agriculture 
  1400 Independence Avenue 
  Washington, DC 20250 
   Dear Secretary Johanns: 
   We respectfully request that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reconsider the closure of Farm Service Agency offices in Nebraska under the FSA Tomorrow plan. 
   Farmers and ranchers from across Nebraska have contacted our offices to express their concerns about these closures. We cannot support a plan that will undoubtedly burden agriculture producers, who must regularly work with the FSA office in support of their operations. While the opportunity to conduct business via the Internet may eventually reduce the need for some face-to-face visits, we do not believe this is a viable alternative at this time. 
   Again, we ask that USDA reconsider its plan to close FSA offices in Nebraska under the FSA Tomorrow proposal. We look forward to working with you and agriculture groups to develop a comprehensive plan that includes clear goals that will improve FSA service nationwide. 
   Sincerely, 
   Chuck Hagel 
  United States Senator 
   Dave Heineman 
  Governor of Nebraska
