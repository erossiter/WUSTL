SEN. HAGEL INTRODUCES RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIETNAM MEMORIAL
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) introduced a resolution today commemorating March 26th as the 25th anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The bill has 53 cosponsors. Hagel, a twice-wounded Vietnam veteran, and former Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration, spoke at the 1982 groundbreaking for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. On March 26th, Hagel will speak at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund's ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the groundbreaking for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  
   "The creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial marked the beginning of a healing process for a nation, and veterans, divided by the war. Now, every year millions of Americans come to this monument to pay their respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. While the debate over our involvement in Vietnam and the conduct of the war will continue for years to come, the Memorial demonstrates the appreciation all Americans have for those who serve. It honors the warriors, not the war," Hagel said. 
   In 1997, the U.S. Senate passed S. Res. 87, a resolution introduced by Hagel and former Senator and fellow Vietnam veteran Bob Kerrey (D-NE), which commemorated the 15th anniversary of the groundbreaking for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
