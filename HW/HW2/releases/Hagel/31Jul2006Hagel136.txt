NEBRASKA RECEIVES FEMA FUNDING FOR FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will provide emergency fire management assistance grants to the state of Nebraska for Dawes and Sioux Counties. FEMA will pay for 75 percent of disaster mitigation costs for fires currently threatening communities in these Nebraska counties. Hagel was briefed twice by Nebraska Gov. David Heineman over the weekend and is scheduled to receive a briefing from officials on the ground in Chadron this afternoon.  
   "The fires in Western Nebraska have created an extremely dangerous situation in both Dawes and Sioux Counties. It is critical that resources at the local, state, and federal levels of government be coordinated to meet this threat. The work being done on the ground by Nebraskans to battle these fires and limit the damage is heroic," Hagel said. 
   The grant is funded through FEMA's Fire Management Assistance Grant Program and is for the "mitigation, management, and control" of fires that threaten enough destruction to justify declaration of a major disaster.
