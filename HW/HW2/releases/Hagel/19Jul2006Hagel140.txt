SENATE PASSES WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ACT
  The U.S. Senate passed today the Water Resources Development Act by a voice vote. This legislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to construct various projects for improvements to U.S. waterways, including improvement and expansion of existing locks on U.S. rivers, environmental restoration projects, and flood damage reduction projects. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) supported authorization of several Nebraska projects that were included in the bill.  
   "This bill authorizes important waterway projects in Nebraska addressing flood control, environmental restoration and Endangered Species recovery. The targeted programs address significant needs in Nebraska communities. Additionally, this legislation addresses needed improvements in waterway infrastructure that will help Nebraska's agricultural producers bring their goods to market," Hagel said. 
   The bill includes the following projects for Nebraska: 
   * $12 million for watershed planning, water resource assessments, and environmental restoration and flood damage reduction projects in the Lower Platte River basin; 
   * Authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study on how best to mitigate losses to habitat, recover Endangered Species, and to restore the ecosystem in the Missouri River; while 
   * Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to establish a committee made of representatives from federal, state and local agencies to advise the Secretary on the above-mentioned study; and 
   * Authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to perform Endangered Species recovery and habitat-loss mitigation activities in the Upper Missouri River basin 
   The Water Resources Development Act will now go to a House-Senate conference.
