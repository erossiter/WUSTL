SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES NEW YORK RESIDENT AS SUMMER INTERN
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Robert Diamond of New York, New York, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Robert will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Diamond is a sophomore at Princeton University majoring in International Relations and Public Policy. He plans to attend law school after graduation in pursuit of government work. 
   "Working for Senator Hagel is an excellent opportunity. I look forward to experiencing the legislative process up close," Diamond said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
