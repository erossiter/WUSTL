SENS. HAGEL, CLINTON INTRODUCE LUNG CANCER RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) introduced a resolution today calling on the President to declare lung cancer a national public health priority by increasing funding for lung cancer research, developing early detection lung cancer screening programs and appointing an advisory committee to oversee and coordinate efforts to reduce lung cancer mortality rates.  
   "Lung cancer is the most lethal form of cancer for men and women in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 900 Nebraskans will die of lung cancer in 2006. We have made great advancements in prostate and breast cancer survival rates; we must commit ourselves to making the same progress in lung cancer survival rates," said Hagel. Nebraska will be the first in the nation to initiate a state-wide screening program for lung cancer. 
   "Despite the gains we have made in cancer treatment and research, we have made far too little progress in addressing lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in our nation. As part of our overall battle against cancer, we must improve our research, treatment and detection efforts in order to increase the five-year survival rate beyond 15 percent," Senator Clinton said. 
   The Hagel-Clinton legislation lays out a multi-agency action blueprint for reducing lung cancer's high mortality by at least 50 percent within the next 10 years. Both senators emphasized the need for a carefully coordinated approach among the federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Department of Defense, in focusing on earlier detection and more effective treatments. 
   "By coming together and working together as a team, we can make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans who have been affected by this disease," said Lung Cancer Alliance President Laurie Fenton.
