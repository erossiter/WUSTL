SENATE PASSES TAX BILL CONFERENCE REPORT
  Today, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) Conference Report by a vote of 69 to 17. Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) voted in favor of the bill. The legislation will reduce European Union tariffs on over 1600 U.S. exports to Europe, including agricultural products, provide new manufacturing incentives and tax cuts to make up for the repeal of the current international tax schedules, and includes incentives to increase renewable fuels production. 
   "This bill includes important provisions to enhance America's competitive position in the world, increase energy production and conservation, and expand rural investments for states like Nebraska," Hagel said. 
   Several tax incentives that would directly affect Nebraska were included in the bill: 
   * Extension of ethanol producer tax credits through 2010 and funding of those tax credits from general revenues. Currently, they are funded through the Highway Trust Fund; 
   * Creation of a new biodiesel tax subsidy through 2006; 
   * Expansion of income rules that allows income to be deferred on livestock sold due to drought, flood or other weather-related conditions; 
   * Extension of tax credits to facilities that produce fuel from landfill gas, agricultural and animal waste, refined coal, and coal byproducts; 
   * Extension of tax credits for solar and wind power generators, and for the production of energy from agricultural, livestock, geothermal sources and municipal solid waste. 
   The House has passed the conference report, and the bill now goes to the President for his signature.
