SEN. HAGEL: SUPPORT OUR TROOPS DURING HOLIDAYS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel announced today two opportunities to help our troops serving overseas during the holidays.  
 The Army and Air Force Exchange Service's (AAFES) "Gifts from the Homefront" and "Help Our Troops Call Home" programs allow individuals to make direct contributions towards the morale of deployed troops by purchasing certificates or phone cards for service members. 
   "As a soldier in Vietnam and then as the President of World USO, I saw firsthand how important American caring is to our troops. Gifts from home are an excellent way to boost troop morale during the holidays and let members of our Armed Forces know we appreciate all they do in defense of our freedom," Hagel said. 
   "Gifts from the Homefront" certificates allow service members to purchase items from Exchanges throughout Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. Service members can purchase exactly what they need including CD's, DVD's and snacks. The "Help Our Troops Call Home" program allows individuals to purchase phone cards for troops to use to call home from AAFES call centers. 
   Nebraskans who would like to purchase "Gifts from the Homefront" certificates can go on-line at www.aafes.com or call 1-877-770-4438. "Help Our Troops Call Home" phone cards are also available on-line at www.aafes.com or by calling 1-800-527-2345. These gifts can be addressed to "any service member" or individual service members.
