SEN. HAGEL TO RE-INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO REFORM OVERSIGHT OF FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that he planned to re-introduce legislation next week to improve oversight of Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE).  
 In 2003, Hagel introduced this legislation (S. 1508) with Sens. John Sununu (R-NH) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC). Their bill served as the vehicle for GSE reform legislation passed last year by the Senate Banking Committee. The Senate did not act on the Committee passed legislation.
   "Since we first introduced this legislation in 2003, the gross mismanagement of GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has become glaringly apparent and dangerous. The need for a world-class regulator to increase the safety and soundness of the GSEs has never been clearer. A new independent GSE regulator is critically important and in the best interests of the housing and finance markets, investors, and the American taxpayer," Hagel said. 
   The legislation would:
   * Create an independent world class regulator to oversee the safety and soundness of the housing enterprises;
   * Give the new regulator the authority to close down a failing GSE and protect against a taxpayer bailout;
   * Give the new regulator greater discretion in raising capital standards to protect against insolvency;
   * Give the new regulator approval power over new programs and activities proposed by a GSE;
   * End presidential appointments to the board of directors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and would require all Federal Home Loan Bank directors to be elected.
   "We cannot allow this real problem to continue to drift any longer. The Congress must act this year to pass responsible GSE reform legislation," Hagel concluded.
