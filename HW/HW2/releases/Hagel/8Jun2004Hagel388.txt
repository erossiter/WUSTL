SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES 26 COUNTIES ADDED FOR DISASTER AID
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has declared additional Nebraska counties a disaster area following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred at the end of May.  
 Governor Mike Johanns requested the additional counties be added to the list last week. Sen. Hagel sent a letter in support of Johanns' request.
   "The storm damage across Nebraska is devastating. Communities across several counties have suffered losses. It is important that the communities receive federal funds to recover from this emergency. I thank President Bush and FEMA for responding quickly to the request," Hagel said.
   There are two types of FEMA funds, Public Assistance and Individual Assistance. Counties receiving both Individual Assistance and Public Assistance include: Adams, Clay, Dodge, Jefferson, Thayer, Washington, Webster and York. Counties receiving Individual Assistance only include: Buffalo, Butler, Douglas, Fillmore, Franklin, Hall, Hamilton, Johnson, Kearney, Nuckolls, Otoe, Pawnee, Sarpy, Saunders, and Seward. Counties to receive Public Assistance include: Blaine, Boone and Cuming. Cass, Gage, Lancaster and Saline counties were declared a disaster area by the President in the initial declaration and qualify to receive both Public and Individual Assistance. 
   Individuals seeking additional information and applications for the aid can call FEMA at 1-800-621-3362.
