SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON HIS VOTE TO CONTINUE DEBATE ON FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today voted to continue debate on the Federal Marriage Amendment. The motion to continue debate, which required 60 votes, failed by a vote of 48 to 50. Below is a statement from Sen. Hagel regarding his vote and his position on the Federal Marriage Amendment:  
   "There is much misinformation about this amendment. I believe the American people would have benefitted from continued debate and a further understanding of this deeply complicated and important issue. 
   "Marriage between a man and a woman is an honored social and sacred institution that dates back thousands of years. It is a religious as well as a civil commitment. It is for this reason that I am opposed to same sex marriage. However, the constitutional amendment we considered today was premature and unwise. 
   "Americans and Nebraskans have been presented with a false choice between amending the Constitution of the United States or allowing same sex marriage across our country. That is not the choice we are facing. Currently there is federal law which denies federal recognition of same sex marriages and allows states to ignore same sex unions licensed elsewhere. Also, 38 states, including Nebraska, have either banned same-sex marriage or passed laws refusing to recognize same sex marriages performed elsewhere. 
   "Over our nation's history, social policy issues have been best handled by the states. Every American should be hesitant to let the federal government take rights away from the states. If court decisions take away the ability of states to govern the issue of same sex marriage, we may need to address the issue through a constitutional amendment one day, but not today. Amending the constitution, the founding document of our nation, should always be a final option, not a first."
