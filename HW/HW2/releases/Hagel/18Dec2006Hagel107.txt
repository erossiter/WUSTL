SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES KIMBALL NOMINEES TO U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY
  Sen. Chuck Hagel nominated Christopher A. Gardner and Brenden C. Rageth, both from Kimball, Nebraska for admission to the United States Military Academy.  
   Applicants were required to meet with one of three regional academy selection committees that Hagel has set-up to assist him in the evaluation of academy candidates. They were judged on their high school transcripts, academic achievement, ACT/SAT scores, career motivation, self-assurance, leadership, extra-curricular and community activities, and an essay on the Academy Honor Code, "We will not lie, steal or cheat nor tolerate among us anyone who does." The four academies will make their selections for the class of 2011 from these appointees. 
   "I am proud to announce these academy nominations from Kimball. These outstanding young people will be one of our nation's leaders in the 21st century," said Hagel. 
   Gardner attends Potter-Dix Public Schools and is the son of Lyle Gardner and Carol Ramsey. Rageth attends Kimball Senior High School and is the son of Brent Rageth and Kristi Hiles-Smith.
