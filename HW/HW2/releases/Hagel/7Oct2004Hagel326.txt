SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS LEGISLATION PROTECTING MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM FINANCIAL FRAUD
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) has cosponsored legislation to prevent abusive sales practices directed at our military servicemen and women from taking place on military bases.  
 The legislation seeks to curb the exposure of military personnel, especially young recruits and junior officers, to misleading and deceptive sales practices. Earlier this week, the House of Representatives passed a similar bill (H.R. 5011) by a vote of 396-2. 
   "It is critical that servicemen and women who sacrifice for their country not be exploited or taken advantage of through dishonest business practices. We must ensure that America's military personnel are offered first-rate financial products so they can provide for their families and invest in their futures," Hagel said. 
   The legislation would prohibit a type of outdated mutual fund, known as a "contractual plan," which is sold almost exclusively to military personnel. These funds have imposed up to a 50% sales commission assessed against the first year of contributions. The bill also gives state insurance regulators clearer jurisdiction over the sale of financial services on military bases and requires the Department of Defense to establish a central registry for tracking insurance agents who violate the law.
