SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES GORDON, NEB., NATIVE AS SUMMER INTERN
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Merici Vinton of Gordon, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Merici will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Vinton will graduate from the University of Colorado at Boulder in August with degrees in Political Science, International Affairs, and Russian Language. She was active in student government for four years, and managed a student-run night club on CU-Boulder's campus. 
   "Working for such a well respected Senator will be a great opportunity. I hope to learn as much as possible about the constituents of Nebraska - and the daily activities of the Senate during my time here," Vinton said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
