SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT's SPEECH TO NATION ON IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) issued the following statement tonight regarding President Bush's address to the nation on immigration reform: 
   "I support everything the President said tonight. His speech covered all the critical issues that are part of this problem; bringing law enforcement to our borders. I was especially pleased he used the Senate bill as a model for comprehensive immigration reform. I thought the President spoke clearly, directly and was very convincing. Now we must go forward and take the next two weeks to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate."
