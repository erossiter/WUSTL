SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES LINCOLN, NEB. RESIDENT AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Christian Huebner of Lincoln, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Christian will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Huebner is a junior studying Creative Writing and Philosophy at Saint Olaf College in North Field, Minnesota. He participates in several activities, including choir, the English as a Second Language tutoring program, and intramural kick ball. Huebner also writes for his campus newspaper and leads a bible study group. 
   "I hope to learn how a person who loves his state and country can work to better these-within government and from the outside. I want to deepen my understanding of our government's history, increase my knowledge of its current affairs, and ask as many questions as possible to prepare myself for future service," Huebner said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
