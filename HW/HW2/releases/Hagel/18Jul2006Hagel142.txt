SEN. HAGEL COSPONSORS BILL TO EXEMPT MANURE FROM EPA REGULATION
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) joined a group of Senators today in introducing legislation that would exempt animal manure from being subject to regulation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund laws. The Superfund laws are administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This legislation would exempt animal manure from being subject to regulation, and ensure that Superfund laws are not applied to animal feeding, farming and ranching operations. On June 23, Hagel discussed the introduction of this legislation with Nebraska cattlemen at Ole's in Paxton.  
   There have been recent attempts, through litigation, to place farms under EPA cleanup and liability provisions, which would restrict the use of manure in agricultural operations. Manure has been used as a fertilizer by Nebraska's agriculture producers for years. Additionally, the agriculture industry already operates under strict federal and state guidelines regulating water, soil and air quality. 
   "Animal manure is rich in nutrients and valuable for crop production. Manure is not a hazardous substance and should not be subject to regulation. This is common-sense legislation that will benefit Nebraska's agricultural producers while maintaining the necessary environmental safeguards," Hagel said.
