SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES CRAB ORCHARD, NEB. RESIDENT AS SUMMER INTERN
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) announced today that Tyler Laflin of Crab Orchard, Nebraska, will join his Washington, D.C. office as a 2004 Summer Intern.  
   "Tyler will be an important part of my Washington D.C. office. I am proud of the internship program we have developed over the last eight years. One of the most important things elected officials can do is give young people an opportunity to become engaged in public service," Hagel said. 
   Laflin begins his second year at Creighton University School of Law in the fall. He is a member of Creighton Law Review and Law Ambassadors. 
   "I'm looking forward to having a better idea of the U.S. Senate and how it works. It's interesting to work with issues Senator Hagel deals with on a daily basis," Laflin said. 
   The second summer intern session began June 28 and ends August 13.
