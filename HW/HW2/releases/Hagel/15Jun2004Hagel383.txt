SEN. HAGEL FLOOD INSURANCE BILL PASSES SENATE
  Today, legislation co-sponsored by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to re-authorize and reform the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until 2008 passed the Senate by unanimous consent.  
   The bill assists communities in preparing for floods and makes policyholders' premiums more equitable. The NFIP is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and provides more than 90 percent of flood insurance policies in the U.S. Currently, communities at low risk for flood, such as North Platte, Nebraska, pay the same NFIP rate as policyholders who experience repetitive flood damage. This bill makes the NFIP more equitable by increasing the rate paid by repetitive claimants who do not take steps to reduce their risk of future flood damage. The bill provides $40 million a year for five years to help those in high-risk areas reduce their flood risk. 
   "The NFIP provides important protection for flood-prone communities across America. Passage of this bill will help those communities better prepare for future floods and help take some of the financial burden off of communities in Nebraska, like North Platte, who are at low-risk for flooding," Hagel said. 
   Last August, Hagel met with North Platte Mayor James Whitaker and other city officials to discuss the impact of NFIP payments on their community. The Senate bill is similar to legislation introduced by First District Congressman Doug Bereuter in the House of Representatives which passed in the House on November 20, 2003. Differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill must now be resolved before it can go to the President for a signature.
