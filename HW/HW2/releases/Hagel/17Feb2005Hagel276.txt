SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING NOMINATION OF JOHN NEGROPONTE AS DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today regarding the President's nomination of U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte to be the new Director of National Intelligence: 
   "I spoke to Ambassador Negroponte this morning. The President has selected a very capable and well-qualified individual to be the Director of National Intelligence. I have worked closely with Ambassador Negroponte over the years and know of his depth of knowledge and wide experience on international security issues. His service as our Ambassador to the United Nations and constant efforts to keep our alliances united as Ambassador in Iraq were critical to the Iraqi elections. He understands the challenges of the 21st Century and the magnitude of threats to America and the world. 
   As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I look forward to continuing my close working relationship with him."
