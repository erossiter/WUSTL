SEN. HAGEL ANNOUNCES BELLEVUE NOMINEES TO U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Chuck Hagel nominated two students from Bellevue, Nebraska for admission to the U.S. Service Academies. Hagel nominated Patrick T. Bennett for admission to the U.S. Naval Academy and Bryan Y. Watson for admission to the United States Air Force Academy.  
   Applicants were required to meet with one of three regional academy selection committees that Hagel has set-up to assist him in the evaluation of academy candidates. They were judged on their high school transcripts, academic achievement, ACT/SAT scores, career motivation, self-assurance, leadership, extra-curricular and community activities, and an essay on the Academy Honor Code, "We will not lie, steal or cheat nor tolerate among us anyone who does." The four academies will make their selections for the class of 2011 from these appointees. 
   "I am proud to announce these academy nominations from Bellevue. These outstanding young people will be our nation's leaders in the 21st century," said Hagel. 
   Bennett attends Bellevue West High School and is the son of Randy and Cathy Bennett. Watson also attends Bellevue West High School and is the son of Thomas and Hyeyong Watson.
