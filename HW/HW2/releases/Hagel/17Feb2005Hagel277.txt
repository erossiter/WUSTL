SENS. REED, HAGEL TO INTRODUCE PLAN TO INCREASE SIZE OF THE ARMY
  Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Jack Reed (D-RI) will introduce legislation to establish a U.S. Army endstrength of 532,400, which is 30,000 soldiers higher than current levels.  
 It will also establish a U.S. Marine Corps end-strength of 181,000 or an additional 3,000 Marines. The legislation requires the Department of Defense to make these new endstrength levels permanent and requires the Department of Defense to pay for it in their budget. 
   "Our current over-dependence on Army National Guard and Army Reserve mobilization is irresponsible policy. This policy threatens to break the United States Army and severely damage our national security. 
   America should not leverage its security interests upon a Reserve and National Guard force that is already over-stressed and over-burdened. There are 100,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard mobilized and serving on Active Duty. An additional 50,000 Army Reserve soldiers have been mobilized. Many of these Reservists are in critical specialty areas and are completing two years on active-duty," Hagel said. 
   Last year, Reed and Hagel introduced legislation to increase the size of the Army by 30,000 soldiers. This legislation resulted in compromise passed by Congress in the Defense Authorization Bill adding 20,000 soldiers to the Army and 3,000 Marines to the Marine Corps.
