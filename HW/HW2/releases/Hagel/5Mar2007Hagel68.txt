SEN. HAGEL VISITS WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), former Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration, again visited service members recovering from war injuries this morning at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Hagel has spoken several times in the last two weeks to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Veterans Secretary Jim Nicholson regarding Washington Post reports of dismal living conditions and Army bureaucratic entanglements hampering the recovery of soldiers at Walter Reed.  
   "What I saw today, as I have seen every time I have visited Walter Reed over the last four years, were injured soldiers whose spirit and commitment represents the best of America. I also saw service personnel at Walter Reed who are dedicated to helping these soldiers rebuild their lives and fixing the problems at their facility. Secretary Gates has acted with appropriate urgency and leadership to fix the problems at Walter Reed and hold those at the highest levels of military and civilian leadership accountable for the problems there. Important Congressional hearings regarding the situation at Walter Reed begin this week. 
   "The American people are justifiably outraged by the problems experienced at Walter Reed. The system is being overburdened by more patients than it was prepared to help. This situation will be fixed," Hagel said.
