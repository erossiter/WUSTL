SEN. HAGEL COMMENTS ON ANNOUNCEMENT THAT U.S., IRAN, SYRIA WILL ATTEND TALKS IN BAGHDAD
  The Iraqi Foreign Minister announced today that Iran and Syria will join U.S. and British envoys at a meeting in Baghdad next month to seek ways to stabilize Iraq. Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) has repeatedly called for regional talks to address the situation in Iraq. Hagel released the following statement today in reaction to the announcement:  
   "This is an important diplomatic initiative taken by the Iraqi government. We will not achieve peace and stability in Iraq without a regional framework that includes Iran and Syria. This conference can be an important first step towards creating that framework," Hagel said.
