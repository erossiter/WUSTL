SEN. HAGEL APPLAUDS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY JOHANNS' DECISION DELAYING BOXED BEEF IMPORTATION FROM CANADA
 Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement today after U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced a decision to delay a portion of a previously published U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rule, which would allow the importation of boxed beef over the age of 30 months from Canada.  
 Last week, Hagel introduced legislation with Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) that would delay the importation of boxed beef over the age of 30 months from Canada: 
   "Secretary Johanns has made a common sense decision. Whether the beef is boxed or alive, it needs to be addressed in a uniform way and we need to deal with both issues at the same time. While resuming normal trade with our beef trading partners is of critical importance, decisions need to be based on science and facts," Hagel said. 
   The U.S. is scheduled to resume importation of Canadian beef under 30 months of age on March 7th.
