SENATE PASSES LEGISLATION HONORING PURPLE HEART RECIPIENTS
  The U.S. Senate passed legislation supporting a "National Purple Heart Recognition Day" last night by unanimous consent.  
 The legislation was introduced earlier this year by Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY). The concurrent resolution honors all service members who have been wounded while serving their country and who were awarded a Purple Heart medal. 
   "The men and women of our armed forces who have received the Purple Heart have gone above and beyond the call of duty in order to preserve America's freedom. The sacrifices made by these men and women have helped create the nation we live in today. 'National Purple Heart Recognition Day' is an appropriate way to honor the enormous sacrifices of yesterday and today's generations of heroes," Hagel said. 
   The Purple Heart - the oldest presently used military decoration in the world - was established on August 7, 1782 during the Revolutionary War by General George Washington. Over the course of its existence, the Purple Heart has been bestowed upon over 1,535,000 people. 
   Last year, the Senate passed legislation sponsored by Hagel and Clinton that supports the goals and ideals of "National Purple Heart Recognition Day" in honoring the American veterans who have earned the military tribute by virtue of their bravery and sacrifice. The House did not act on this legislation.
