SEN. HAGEL ADDRESSES 15TH ANNUAL REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY HONORING GULF WAR CASUALTIES
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) delivered the keynote address today at the 15th Annual Remembrance Ceremony to honor those who lost their lives in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and Provide Comfort. Approximately 200 family members from across the country gathered in Arlington National Cemetery on Sunday to remember their loved ones. In addition to Hagel, General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, His Excellency Sheik Salem Al-Sabah, Ambassador of the State of Kuwait and His Excellency Sir David Manning, British Ambassador, spoke at the event.  
   "Like the soldiers before them, those who lost their lives during the Gulf War answered the call to duty. Today, we honor their service and sacrifice. The courage and sacrifice of those we honor here today must never be forgotten, nor the lessons of war. I ask everyone to join me in honoring America's fallen heroes and their families during this 15th Annual Remembrance Ceremony, and thank all those who have served their country in uniform," Hagel said. 
   The 15th Annual Remembrance Ceremony was sponsored by the Embassy of the State of Kuwait in partnership with The White House Commission on Remembrance. Hagel sponsored legislation in 2000 to establish The White House Commission on Remembrance.
