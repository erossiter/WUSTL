SENATE PASSES SEN. HAGEL RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MILITARY FAMILIES
  The U.S. Senate passed a resolution last night sponsored by Sen.  
 Chuck Hagel (R-NE) designating the week of June 12, 2005 as National Military Families Week to bring attention to the sacrifices being made by the families of members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Rep. John Boozman (R-AR) and Rep. Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) sponsored the companion resolution in the House. 
   "The demands on our service members and their families have been transformed and increased. Too often we forget the sacrifices made by members of the families of our men and women in uniform. It is important to recognize and appreciate the sacrifices family members make while their loved ones are deployed in service to their country," Hagel said. 
   Last weekend, Nebraska families held a welcome home ceremony honoring soldiers from the 530th Military Police Battalion returning from Iraq. There are over 7,700 Nebraskans on active duty, over 8,500 Nebraskans serving in the Reserve Component of our Armed Forces, and over 1,600 Nebraskans in the National Guard and Reserves serving around the world.
