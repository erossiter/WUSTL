SEN. HAGEL HONORED BY NEBRASKA FARM BUREAU FOR COMMITMENT TO AGRICULTURE
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today received the "Friend of Farm Bureau" award from the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. Hagel was honored for his leadership role in the Senate on behalf of agriculture issues most important to the Nebraska Farm Bureau. Hagel has received the "Friend of Farm Bureau" award for every Congress since being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996.  
   "It is my privilege and responsibility to represent the interests of Nebraska's farmers and ranchers in Washington, D.C. I am honored to accept this award and I will continue to work hard on behalf of Nebraska's agriculture community," Hagel said. 
   "Senator Hagel has been a true champion of many issues affecting farmers and ranchers. In particular, his leadership in ushering the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) through Congress has been vital to Nebraska's agriculture community. His relentless efforts to re-open agriculture export markets, and his common sense approach to environmental regulation has benefitted Nebraska's farmers and ranchers," said Nebraska Farm Bureau President Keith Olsen.
