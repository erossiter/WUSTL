SEN. HAGEL PRAISES APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF $3.9 BILLION IN DISASTER AID
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) issued the following statement today regarding the Senate Appropriations Committee voting to include $3.9 billion in disaster assistance to the Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill. The funding will be used for producers who have lost crops or livestock due to drought and other weather-related disasters. Hagel sent a letter to the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee yesterday requesting the funding:  
   "The decision by the Senate Appropriations Committee to include $3.9 billion in disaster aid into this year's appropriations bill provides assistance that is going to be desperately needed this year in states like Nebraska. Working through the accountable appropriations process is the responsible way to provide disaster aid. I will continue to work to ensure that this funding is included in the final bill when it reaches the Senate floor," Hagel said. 
   The Honorable Thad Cochran 
  Chairman 
  Senate Committee on Appropriations 
  Room S-128 
  United States Capitol 
  Washington, DC 20510 
   Dear Chairman Cochran: 
   I write to request the inclusion of disaster assistance for agricultural producers in the FY07 Agriculture Appropriations bill. 
   Agriculture producers in Nebraska are suffering from persistent drought conditions. In some parts of the state, the drought is in its seventh year. This ongoing problem has caused significant losses to crops, pastures, and livestock in affected areas. 
   I support efforts to include roughly $4 billion in assistance to agricultural producers for losses incurred due to drought and other weather-related disasters. 
   Thank you. 
  Sincerely,
