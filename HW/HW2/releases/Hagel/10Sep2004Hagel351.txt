SEN. HAGEL ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNIVERSARY OF 9-11 TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) released the following statement on the anniversary of 9/11:  
   "This weekend marks the third anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks on our country. It is a day when all Americans will reflect on and remember those who lost their lives three years ago. It will be a special day to think about our country, our future, and the great challenges and threats that face this country. 
   But it is also a day to celebrate who we are. This is a great and good nation. Our fabric is strong and the response to this devastating attack on our homeland three years ago has been met with resolution, commitment and belief in who we are...belief in each other. 
   I know it will be a difficult day for the families of those who were lost three years ago but they should be reassured that this country is stronger than it was three years ago. We will never forget those who lost their lives. We mourn the loss, we pray for the families and we are resolved to be an even better nation than before. 
   There will be very important demonstrations across the country remembering those we lost on September 11th and the one played out at the Nebraska football game will be a tremendous event. I talked to Coach Callahan about it and it will be a demonstration all Nebraskans can be proud of. God Bless the United States of America."
