SEN. HATCH ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT'S ONLINE PORN DECISION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's announcement today in the case of Ashcroft v. ACLU. 
   "I am obviously disappointed with Court's pronouncement in the Ashcroft v. ACLU. However, the government will have another opportunity to present its argument in federal court, and I hope that the district court will do what is right to protect our children from perverts and pedophiles who prey on our children online.
   "The exploitation of children continues to be a serious problem in our country and abroad. It goes without saying that we have a compelling interest in protecting our children from harm. Our laws must strike a necessary balance between this goal and the First Amendment. There is no place for sexually explicit materials that are harmful to minors even in our free society."
