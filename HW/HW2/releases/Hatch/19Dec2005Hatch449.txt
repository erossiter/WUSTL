SEN. HATCH: COLLEGE OF EASTERN UTAH WINS GRANT FOR MINING TRAINING CENTER
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) announced today the College of Eastern Utah (CEU) in Price has secured a $2.7 million federal grant from the Department of Labor for an energy training center.  
   "Price is an important energy hub for Utah and for the West," Hatch said. "The new energy training center will go a long way toward helping to ensure that we have the best prepared workers in the field developed, trained and taught right here in Utah. This is a big win for Price and Carbon County." 
   The grant is one of 10 announced by Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao and is part of a broader effort to ensure that our nation has a strong domestically trained work force in our energy sector. Hatch supported CEU's grant request by making personal calls to the Department of Labor and by actively monitoring the progress of CEU's applications. He is working with other areas in Utah, such as Vernal, to win similar grants catered to their specific training needs. 
   According to the Department of Labor, employers expect that up to half of their current workers will retire over the next five to 10 years. Because of current stereotypes, energy careers are often perceived by qualified -- and especially young -- workers as unstable, dirty, and low-skilled, and many are unaware of the many highly skilled, well-paying career opportunities. 
   In the 1980s and early 1990s, many training programs were scaled back or closed because of a downturn in the industry, and programs have not ramped up at the same rate that the industry's need has rebounded. Now, the energy industry is in need of workers who are proficient in math, science and, especially, technology.
