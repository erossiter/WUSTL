SEN. HATCH: AG BILL CONTAINS MILLIONS TO FUND UTAH PROJECTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) helped to secure funding for several important agricultural projects in Utah that were included in a bill approved today by the United States Senate by a vote of 97-2. The Agriculture Appropriations bill also contained several Hatch-sponsored provisions to promote the safety and efficacy of dietary supplements. 
   "Utah's agriculture industry is critical to the state's economy, and this money will help our farmers and ranchers continue in their important role as some of the best producers in the nation," Hatch said. 
   The bill, which was managed on the Senate floor by Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Bob Bennett (R-Utah), contains funding for several Hatch-backed projects that will assist Utah State University (USU) in its agriculture research efforts. 
   "Utah State is one of the top agricultural research institutions in the nation," Hatch said. "Their research benefits all Utahns, and this funding will help ensure they can continue to remain on the cutting edge of agricultural research." 
   As the author of the 1994 law regulating dietary supplements, Hatch included provisions in the bill to ensure consumers have access to affordable, safe, and healthy supplement products. He secured $200,000 to fund the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) voluntary system of adverse event reporting, and required the FDA to report to Congress the cost of implementing a mandatory system. Hatch's provisions also call on the FDA to increase enforcement on products that violate supplement law and to finalize current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. 
   "More than 150 million Americans use dietary supplements to live healthier lives, and many of the top supplement companies are based in Utah," Hatch said. "The law protects consumers from unsafe products, but it must be aggressively enforced. Good manufacturing practices should be the frontline assault against unsafe products, and a mandatory adverse event reporting system would help the FDA act quickly against risky products." 
   The following is a list of Utah-related projects requested by Hatch that were included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill: 
   * $3 million for the Washington Fields Canal Lining Project 
   * $1 million for the Utah Botanical Center at USU, which provides research on low-water consuming plants for use in home landscapes in desert climates 
   * $1 million for USU's Drought Management Initiative, which studies ways to reduce the impacts of drought on agricultural water supply 
   * $970,000 for plant gene and genetic discovery research at USU, which provides genetic research to address drought and conservation issues 
   * $225,000 for pasture and forage research at USU, which gathers information on livestock and pasture management practices.
