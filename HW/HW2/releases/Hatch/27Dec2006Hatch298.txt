SEN. HATCH REACTS TO PASSING OF FORMER PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statements upon learning of the passing of former President Gerald Ford.  
   "President Ford was incredibly gutsy and strong, yet also one of the most decent, honorable and nicest men that I have ever known. He could get along with anyone, and he was someone who could work with both sides. But he also had a high ethical and moral standard from which he would not budge - regardless of the political advantage. I had immeasurable respect for President Ford. My thoughts and prayers are with his dear wife, Betty, and his family at this time."
