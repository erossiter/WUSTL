SEN. HATCH TOUTS BYU COUNSEL GRIFFITH
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today introduced Brigham Young University Counsel Tom Griffith at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee to review Griffith's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  
   "Mr. Griffith has been a dedicated public servant and has demonstrated the sound judgment and temperament necessary to be an outstanding federal appellate judge," said Hatch. "I think he will make a fine addition to the D.C. Circuit." 
   Griffith currently serves as BYU's general counsel and served as counsel to the U.S. Senate from 1995-1999, a span which included the divisive impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. 
   "His work here required him to be nonpartisan in a sometimes highly partisan environment," said Hatch. "By all accounts, he did a superb job. Mr. Griffith consistently exercised sound judgment, objectivity and fairness." 
   Griffith has come under fire from Senate Democrats and liberal special interest groups for allowing his D.C. Bar dues to go unpaid for a time, and for not becoming a member of the Utah Bar while serving as general counsel to BYU. 
   "He certainly did not intentionally neglect to pay his bar dues, and promptly paid the back dues when he discovered the problem," said Hatch, who also pointed out that attorneys serving as in-house counsel do not need to be members of the bar if they practice in conjunction with attorneys who are members. 
   "In the words of former White House Counsel and appeals court judge Abner Mikva, 'This is a whole lot of nothing,'" said Hatch.
