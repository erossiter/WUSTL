SEN. HATCH: LOW-INCOME SENIORS GETTING LOST IN MEDICARE SHUFFLE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has called on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate how the federal government can better transition low-income seniors into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.  
   "The last thing that the chronically ill want to add to their health problems is a headache, but that's exactly what the recent changes are giving to many of our low-income seniors," Hatch said. "As a nation, we have a commitment to provide seniors with quality health care, especially the very poor. As we improve and streamline the way that health care is delivered, we do not want to lose any seniors in the shuffle." 
   The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act placed all "dual eligible" seniors - the poor and the elderly who traditionally qualified for both Medicaid and Medicare - completely under the Medicare umbrella starting Jan. 1, 2006. Hatch is concerned by reports of significant problems that these vulnerable seniors have experienced as their drug coverage is transferred from Medicaid to Medicare. On March 1, Hatch joined with the three other senior Senate leaders on the Senate Finance Committee in sending a letter to GAO Comptroller David Walker requesting that he study the extent of the problems and recommend solutions to quickly remedy the situation.
