SEN. HATCH: SEN. FRIST LEADS OUT IN FAVOR OF ETHICAL STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) expressed his appreciation today for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's (R-Tenn.) support to pass legislation that would make more embryonic stem cell lines available for federal funding.  
   "This is a significant and most-welcome breakthrough, and I am encouraged that with the Majority Leader's support we can expect swift action in the Senate and overwhelming bipartisan passage for legislation to expand ethical embryonic stem cell research. 
   "I commend our distinguished Majority Leader for being willing to raise this important scientific and ethical issue - which is probably one of the most important issues that we face today. Stem cell research gives hope to millions of people who have none. More than 100 million Americans suffer from heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and so many other life-threatening and life-debilitating diseases. I am grateful to have the Majority Leader take this important step for those suffering from these dread diseases and who will be helped by this research. 
   "Our leader in the Senate has given us much to contemplate. I support much of what the Majority Leader has said today, and I intend to study the rest and take it into serious consideration."
