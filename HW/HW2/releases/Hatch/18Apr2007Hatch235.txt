SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after the United States Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Partial Birth Abortion Act passed by Congress in 2003 is constitutional:  
   "This is a good day for the integrity of the Constitution and the sanctity of human life. 
   "As it should have, the Court stuck to the legal issues rather than second-guessing policy in deciding this case. A majority of Justices said the American people and their elected representatives, not judges, should decide this issue. 
   "The Court properly said that the Constitution does not stand in the way of the law reflecting what the vast majority of Americans believe, that this barbaric procedure, which has no legitimate medical purpose, should be prohibited. The Court made the right legal and constitutional decision by deferring to the people's representatives."
