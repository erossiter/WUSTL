SEN. HATCH TO KOREAN AMBASSADOR: LIFT BEEF BAN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) met yesterday with the South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Lee Tae-Sik, during a week of formal negotiations with the U.S. regarding the two nations' Free Trade Agreement. Hatch encouraged Ambassador Lee to end South Korea's trade restrictions on American beef.  
   "Beef is a $700 million-per-year industry for Utah's cattle ranchers," Hatch said. "Korea's restrictions are not necessary. U.S. cattle ranchers take some of the most rigorous health precautions in the world, and I hope the Koreans will recognize this." 
   For many years, Korea was one of America's largest customers for exported beef. Unfortunately in recent years, fears of "mad cow disease" in the United States caused the Korean government to ban all U.S. beef imports, which had been a $790 million market. Now Korea is accepting U.S. beef with a number of restrictions: cows must be under 30 months old and beef on the bone is restricted. 
   "Before the ban, 60 percent of U.S. beef exports to Korea were beef on the bone," Hatch said. "It's high time for Korea to lift the ban and give our ranchers fair access to their beef market." 
   The price of beef has been threatening to drop, so access to South Korea's increasingly affluent 48 million consumers would be a tremendous asset for Utah cattle ranchers. According to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food's most recently available report (2002), value per head of Utah cattle and calves averaged $770 per head. On January 1, 2002, Utah cattlemen had a total of 920,000 cattle and calves on farms and ranches.
