RICHFIELD AIRPORT BILL CLEARS SENATE COMMITTEE
  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee today cleared for Senate consideration a bill sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) that paves the way to expand the Richfield Municipal Airport while providing the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah with money for economic development. 
   "The Richfield airport is vital to southwestern Utah, and now Richfield has moved a big step closer to obtaining much-needed improvements to the airport," Hatch stated. "At the same time, the measure will help the Paiute Tribe acquire land with greater development potential to help boost its local economy." 
   Hatch's bill, the Paiute Indian Land Conveyance Act of 2005 (S. 623), gives the Secretary of the Interior the authority to transfer three small acres of Paiute trust land to Richfield, Utah, at fair market value. The bill is identical to legislation already passed by the House, and when passed by the full Senate, would go to the President for his signature. 
   Originally purchased in 1974 by the non-profit Utah Paiute Tribal Corporation, the land was placed into trust by the Paiute Indian Tribe Restoration Act of 1980, legislation sponsored by Hatch that restored the Paiute Indian Tribe and established a federal trust relationship. The land has gone unused for more than 20 years, and the Tribe readily accepted Richfield's offer to purchase the land to expand its airport. Approval by Congress is the last step necessary to finalize the purchase.
