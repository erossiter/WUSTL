SEN. HATCH SUPPORTS JUSTICE RULING ON XM-SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO MERGER
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today released the following response to the Department of Justice's approval of the proposed merger of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. with Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. The department's Antitrust Division investigated the proposed merger for more than a year before concluding that it is unlikely to reduce competition among radio providers, and therefore will not harm consumers.  
   "The government has a responsibility to protect consumers from monopolies that jeopardize competition," said Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights Subcommittee. "However, the proposed XM-Sirius merger has never appeared to threaten consumers, as satellite radio already competes with terrestrial radio for listeners. I appreciate that the Department of Justice has arrived at this conclusion, which matches my initial analysis of the situation. I am relieved that this merger can now go forward, but I regret that it took so long." 
   The department's findings are available online at http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/March/08_at_226.html.
