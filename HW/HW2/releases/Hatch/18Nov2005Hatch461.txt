SEN. HATCH: MILLIONS COMING TO UTAH IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION FUNDING
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced that Utah will benefit from substantial new military projects included in military construction conference report passed today by Congress.  
   "This funding goes to show that the Defense Department recognizes the superior level of work performed by Utah's military personnel," Hatch said. 
   H.R. 2528, the Military Construction Appropriations conference report, contains the following projects requested by Hatch: 
   * $19.5 million for Hill's Software Engineering Division Facility. Hill is home to one of the nation's top software development and support centers, and Hatch has been a leading supporter of the center since it was in its planning phase. "This is a major victory in our long-term effort to maintain and develop a state-of-the-art infrastructure at Hill," said Hatch. 
   * $9.8 million to consolidate Hill's missile storage facilities. Hill currently stores ICBM parts for the Air Force at storage "igloos" spread out over a large area. Consolidation of the storage facilities will free up land at Hill for other uses. 
   * Restored funding for a veterans' nursing home. The President's budget eliminated a critical grant program to build additional veterans nursing homes. Hatch worked with appropriators to restore $85 million to the program. Utah is home to more than 160,000 men and women who have served in the armed forces, yet its current veterans nursing home supports only 80 beds. Last year Hatch arranged the transfer of 13 acres from the Army Reserve to Utah to build a new nursing home, and this funding will assist the state as it begins construction.
