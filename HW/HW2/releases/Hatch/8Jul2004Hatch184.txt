SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES MILLARD SCHOOL DISTRICT SUNSHINE COALITION GRANT
  Sen. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today announced that the Department of Justice will award a grant in the amount of $74,931 tomorrow, July 9, 2004, to the Millard School District Sunshine Coalition for its efforts in identifying and creating local solutions to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related problems. 
   "Drugs have destroyed too many lives in Utah and across our country," said Hatch.
   "I am pleased to see the Department of Justice taking such an active role in providing the necessary resources to the Millard School District Sunshine Coalition and applaud Attorney General John Ashcroft's commitment to Utah.
   "Efforts such as these ensure that those on the frontline of the war against drugs have the necessary weapons to defeat this enemy. The fight against substance abuse among youth is one of the most important battles our communities face across America," Hatch continued.
   The Sunshine Coalition is a community partnership, which includes community leaders, elected officials and citizens who work together to find solutions for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related problems; and serves people in 10 communities in rural West Millard County.
   The Sunshine Coalition's goals are to reduce substance abuse, and to create a cohesive approach among several agencies and community organizations to encourage anti-drug lifestyles. Efforts include recruiting and training key leaders in prevention planning, providing life skills and mentoring to high-risk youth, offering alternative recreation and outreach programs for the community's youth, and creating links with agencies to establish a successful prevention infrastructure throughout the community.
