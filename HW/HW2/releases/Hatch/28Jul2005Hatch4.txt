$1.8 BILLION COMING TO UTAH FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Bob Bennett today announced that Utah will receive approximately $1.8 billion to fund multi-year highway and transit projects, including expanding I-15 capacity and funding regional commuter rail.  
   "This is the most federal funding ever committed to Utah in a transportation bill and it is long overdue," said Hatch, who served on the Senate-House team that negotiated the final transportation funding bill. "Improving transportation is one of the state's highest priorities because travel on Utah's roads has grown twice as fast as our population. Everywhere I travel in Utah, people talk to me about how much we need these funds. This bill will help Utah improve roads, reduce traffic, and provide more transportation options." 
   "This highway bill provides a tremendous amount of federal assistance for road improvements across the state. As Utah continues to experience unprecedented growth, many of these projects will help alleviate congestion in areas hardest hit," said Bennett, a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee that authorizes a portion of the highway bill. "I am particularly pleased with the $200 million set aside for commuter rail, which will allow UTA to begin construction on the project." 
   "Utah has a powerful team here in the Senate," Hatch said. "We work hard on every funding initiative to make sure our state gets its fair share." 
   Congress is expected to pass a comprehensive highway measure allocating approximately $282 million each year to invest in Utah's highways systems over the next five years. Utah's delegation secured $430 million over five years tied to specific high-priority transit and highway projects throughout the state. 
   The Utah delegation was able to include funding in the bill for Utah State University to operate a University Transportation Center. This center will receive approximately $2 million over the next five years and will greatly improve the statewide knowledge base and transportation research being done in the state.
