UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY MENTOR PROGRAM RECEIVES $989,477 GRANT
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) announced today that Utah State University's Youth and Families with Promise (YFP) program will receive a $989,477 grant from the Small Business Administration.  
   "This program truly puts our resources where they're needed most - helping troubled and wayward youth realize their potential and reach their greatest dreams," Hatch said. 
   The USU program establishes mentors for at-risk youth ages 10 to 14 and their families. The program works with youth and their families with motivation in reading and academic skills, along with facilitating structured recreation and community service activities and association with community youth groups. 
   With more 34 programs in 21 Utah counties, YFP has served more than 700 at-risk youth and another 2,000 of their family members during the last academic year. A college-age volunteer is assigned to mentor each participating youth, and a grandparent-age volunteer couple befriends and mentors the youth's entire family. Participating youth typically are referred to the program by juvenile courts, schools, or churches. 
   "We're grateful that Sen. Hatch was able to get funding for the Youth and Families with Promise program for the fourth straight year," said Tom Lee, a USU family and human development professor and a creator of YFP. "Studies document that youth in the program show significant improvements in academic and social skills, strengthened family bonds, and community attachment. They tend to have decreased involvement in substance abuse and other anti-social behaviors." 
   Based on the program's effectiveness in keeping youth out of trouble, the U.S. Department of Justice has selected YFP for an intensive internal evaluation. This month, the department will begin a formal, three-year assessment of the program's impact as a possible prelude to using it as a national model.
