PRESIDENT SIGNS FDA AMENDMENTS ACT , SEPT. 27
  Although last-minute Senate action on the child health insurance legislation precluded his attendance at today's Presidential signing ceremony for the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) praised the measure which includes a number of provisions of interest to Utahns. The bill contains extensions of the prescription drug and medical device approval user fees, as well as new titles to help ensure food safety, pharmaceutical safety, and provide incentives for development of pediatric drugs and devices. 
   Hatch, former chairman and current member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which oversees FDA policy, was involved in drafting the final bill, particularly provisions related to speeding the approvals of medical devices, prescription drugs, and lower-cost generic drugs, as well as measures ensuring the safety of foods for pets and humans, and dietary supplements. Utah is home to over 100 medical device manufacturers and a similar number of supplement companies.  
   "The safety of our food and drug supplies continues to be an issue of utmost importance to consumers across our nation," stated Hatch. "I worked hard on this bill to strike the right balance by determining safety through scientific evidence, not innuendos or hearsay. With the President's signature many important provisions will now begin working for our consumers." 
   The FDA Amendments Act contains strong, new reporting for adulterated foods - both foods for pets and humans - intended to avert problems such as those from tainted Chinese products earlier this year. Because dietary supplements are legally foods, Hatch ensured that they would be exempt from this new food reporting, since serious adverse health events experienced from supplement use are already required to be reported under a separate law Hatch authored last year. 
   Other provisions which Hatch worked on will: 
   * Continue the user fee for medical device approvals to provide revenues to help speed FDA review of the products. This will help ensure that Utah's more than 100 medical device companies are treated fairly in the reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Modernization Act (MDUFMA), which was also included in the FDA Act. 
   * Strengthen the FDA's ability to safeguard the nation's food supply addressing many of the concerns raised by recent reports of illness and even death from everyday foods such as spinach and peanut butter. This Act improves communication systems about all food recalls, coordinates state and federal activities on fresh and processed produce, and creates a database to help FDA better track patterns of problems and target its limited resources where they are most needed. 
   * Explicitly ratify that dietary supplements are to be regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, and the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, the serious adverse event warning system Hatch authored last year. 
   * Remove certain roadblocks that innovator drug companies may erect to block or delay approval of lower-cost generic drugs. 
   * Reauthorize the Orphan Drug Act, a program Hatch helped enact to foster development of medications for rare diseases. The bill also contained a provision written by Hatch and shepherded through the House by Rep. Jim Matheson to provide an incentive for development of new drugs for new therapeutic uses containing certain constituents of previously-approved medications. In fact, this provision should assist Utah's own Myriad Genetics which is developing an Alzheimer's Drug.
