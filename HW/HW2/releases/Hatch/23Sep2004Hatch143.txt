SENATE VOTES TO EXTEND TAX RELIEF FOR FAMILIES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) made the following statement upon Senate passage of tax cut extensions late tonight by a vote of 92-3: 
   "The Senate passed tax cut extensions tonight that, frankly, were no-brainers. But they do mean hundreds of thousands of Utahns will not face tax hikes on New Year's Day. I'm also pleased that we passed an extension of the research tax credit, which is so important to so many Utah businesses, although I will continue to work to make the credit permanent."
