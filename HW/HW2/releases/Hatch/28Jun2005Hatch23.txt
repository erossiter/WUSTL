SEN. HATCH ENERGY PROVISIONS PASS SENATE
  The United States Senate today passed a comprehensive energy bill with several provisions sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) that could, if enacted, make a real difference for consumers in Utah and throughout the country.  
   "Our nation needs an energy policy that lowers prices, encourages American energy independence, and promotes cleaner and more efficient energy," Hatch said. "My provisions will address all of those things. We're tackling three of the most significant factors in the current energy crisis: increasing domestic oil production, closing the bottleneck at our refineries, and promoting alternative energy resources. This all translates into one thing - greater supply, which will directly impact prices and our energy security." 
   The Senate energy bill includes several provisions from bills Hatch has pushed in Congress: 
   * Clean Efficient Vehicles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies (CLEAR Act, S. 971): The CLEAR ACT provides tax incentives to consumers who purchase alternative-fuel and hybrid-electric vehicles, tax incentives at the pump for the purchase of alternative transportation fuels, and tax incentives for the purchase and installation of alternative fueling equipment. 
   * Oil Shale and Tar Sands Development Act of 2005 (S. 1111): The Senate accepted an amendment to the Energy bill that is a slightly modified version of Hatch's bill to encourage development of fuel from a vast untapped domestic oil reserve in tar sands and oil shale. Energy experts estimate the United States has more recoverable oil from this resource - located mainly in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming - than in the entire Middle East. 
   * Gas Price Reduction Through Increased Refining Capacity Act (S. 1039): This provision would provide for accelerated depreciation for new refineries or for refineries that are increasing their capacity. The economics of refining are so tough that the United States has lost nearly 200 refineries since the last one was built in the 1970s. Domestic refineries are unable to meet American demand, so the country is currently importing refined oil products to make up the difference. Hatch's provision would allow refiners who commit to starting construction on new or expanded refining equipment before 2008 and have new facilities built by 2012 to completely write off their new equipment in the first year instead of over the current 10-year depreciation schedule. 
   * Geothermal and Renewable Resources (S. 1156): This provision would promote geothermal energy, a domestic energy source that could provide energy to more than 22 million homes if fully developed. Experts say Utah has one of the largest underground hot water reservoirs in the nation, and Hatch's measure would provide tax incentives for electricity produced from renewable energy facilities placed in service before January 1, 2008. 
   * Mineral Leasing Act Amendment (S. 53): The provision would increase natural gas production by amending the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the Secretary of the Interior to issue separately, for the same area, a lease for tar sands and a lease for oil and gas. The requirement for industry to obtain leases for both mining and gas extraction activities before gas can be extracted has hampered new production of gas in tar sand areas. 
   The Senate energy bill will now go before a Senate-House conference to negotiate a compromise bill. Congressional leaders are working to have the compromise bill on President Bush's desk by August.
