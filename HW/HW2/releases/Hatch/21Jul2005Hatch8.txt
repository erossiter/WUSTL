SEN. HATCH MEETS WITH JUDGE ROBERTS
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today met with Judge John Roberts of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, President Bush's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 Hatch issued the following statement: 
   "I have known John Roberts for years and think the world of him. Judge Roberts is as fine a nominee as President Bush could have picked for the Supreme Court. We had a terrific conversation this morning for about an hour, and I don't see how anyone can be opposed to this nominee. It's clear why Judge Roberts was considered the premier appellate lawyer in the country: he is as intelligent and articulate as they come. He's a decent, honorable man who listens well, gives thoughtful opinions, and has an easygoing but very focused manner - he has the perfect judicial temperament, in other words. 
   "I was privileged to get to know Judge Roberts well when I chaired the hearings on his nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court. He was first nominated by President George H.W. Bush, and his nomination had sat for 11 years because of partisan obstruction until I was able to push him through after President George W. Bush renominated him in 2003. Judge Roberts handled those hearings with dignity and aplomb, and I am sure he will do the same during his upcoming confirmation hearing. I have every confidence that Judge Roberts will make an outstanding justice on the Supreme Court."
