SEN. HATCH: ST. GEORGE AIRPORT RECEIVES FEDERAL GO-AHEAD
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the final approval needed to begin construction of the much-awaited replacement airport for St. George.  
   "It's Christmas in August," Hatch said. "St. George is booming, and its airport simply can't keep up with the increased demand for much longer. I'll be fighting to make sure the Federal government gives the financial support needed to build the new airport as quickly as possible." 
   St. George determined to build a replacement airport in 1998 because the current airport is unable to expand to meet demand for increased air service. By 2020, the number of one-way tickets purchased is expected to increase by 81 percent. With an expanded facility, that estimate would increase to 158 percent. 
   The FAA's release of its final Record of Decision marks the last step needed to allow Federal dollars to flow for obtaining the property for the new airport. The process had been delayed for years because of endless demands by environmental extremists, which cost St. George $15 million to fight. Hatch brought FAA and St. George officials together last November to facilitate approval of the Environmental Impact Study (EIS), which was completed in May 2006.
