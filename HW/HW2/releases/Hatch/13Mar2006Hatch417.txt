   The selection process for military academies is very competitive. Applicants must demonstrate outstanding performance in academics, leadership, physical fitness, extracurricular activities, and community involvement. Selection criteria include interviews, SAT/ACT scores, class rank, grades, school records, evaluations by teachers and counselors and participation in extracurricular and athletic activities. All the academies place a great deal of emphasis on candidates who can show they have strong leadership skills - both in and out of school. 
   Applicants must be legal Utah residents and U.S. citizens at least 17 years of age, but not past their 23rd birthday as of July 1, 2006. They must also be unmarried with no children or other legal dependents. Some applicants receive multiple nominations and apply to more than one academy, to increase their chances of receiving an appointment.
