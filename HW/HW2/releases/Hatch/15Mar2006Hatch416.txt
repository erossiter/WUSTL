SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON FY 2007 BUDGET
  STATEMENT ON FY2007 BUDGET   
  Statement of Senator Orrin G. Hatch 
  before the United States Senate 
  on S. Con. Res. 83, the Budget Resolution For Fiscal Year 2007
   I would be remiss if I did not make at least a short statement on the budget we just passed. I agree with those who believe that government is simply out of control. We just passed a budget that promises a budget deficit in the vicinity of $400 billion, a truly staggering amount of money. Our Federal government is borrowing in excess of a billion dollars a day to fund the awesome amount of obligations that we have authorized. While I would have preferred a vastly smaller budget today, I know it is simply not politically feasible to do so at this time. I pledge to work toward creating an environment where we can achieve responsible spending and fiscal sanity while meeting our obligations. The budget we have just passed does represent a step, albeit a small one, toward fiscal responsibility. Getting our entitlement spending under control, reining in earmarks and other wasteful discretionary spending, and maintaining the conditions necessary for strong, stable economic growth are all necessary to achieve a balanced budget, and it will take the concerted efforts of each and every one of us to achieve this in the future.
