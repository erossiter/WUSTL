SEN. HATCH NAMES CAMPBELL AS NEW DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today named Chris Campbell as his new deputy legislative director. A former Hatch staff member, Campbell will help implement the Senator's agenda on issues like health, taxes, and international trade policy.  
   "It's great to have Chris back on my team," Hatch said. "Chris has a wealth of experience, both on and off the Hill. He has a proven track record of success, and he's earned people's trust and respect. Chris will be a valuable asset to Utah and the Senate in the years ahead." 
   Campbell spent three years on Hatch's Senate Judiciary Committee staff, covering international trade, business, and economic development issues facing Utah and the nation. Prior to rejoining Hatch's staff, Campbell operated a business consulting firm specializing in business strategy and consulted on numerous Republican political campaigns. Campbell also worked on Hatch's 2000 Presidential and Utah Senatorial campaigns. Campbell's mother and father are from Provo and Hurricane, Utah, respectively. Campbell lived in Pleasant Grove in elementary school, and has traveled extensively throughout the state on his work for the Senator. 
   Earlier this year, Campbell completed an MBA degree from Thunderbird, The Garvin School of International Management. He is also a graduate of the University of California at Santa Barbara where he majored in political science.
