SEN. HATCH ENDORSES INTERNET, MEDIA PRINCIPLES TO FOSTER ONLINE INNOVATION, PROTECT COPYRIGHTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) released the following statement after meeting with representatives from several of the world's leading Internet and media companies, who today announced their joint support for a set of collaborative principles that enable the continued growth and development of user-generated content online and respect the intellectual property of content owners. 
   "Consumers have shown there's enormous demand to share content over the Internet and it's about time these companies band together to ensure it can be done legally," Hatch said. "The protection of intellectual property rights has always been important to me throughout my Senate career. Such collaborative efforts should be a model for the technology and copyright industries as we continue to address complicated challenges in the Internet environment, especially considering today's rapidly advancing technology."
   "I hope the agreement by these leading companies marks a starting point that will garner the attention and support of many more companies," Hatch said. "No doubt, developments such as these serve as a blueprint for future collaborative efforts to safeguard intellectual property rights. I commend all involved and am encouraged that we are working toward a solution to a very serious problem we face both domestically and internationally."
   The involved media companies are CBS Corp., Dailymotion, Fox Entertainment Group, Microsoft Corp., MySpace, NBC Universal, Veoh Networks Inc., Viacom Inc. and The Walt Disney Company. The principles, which are attached and available in full at www.ugcprinciples.com, call for a broad range of constructive and cooperative efforts by copyright owners and UGC services.
