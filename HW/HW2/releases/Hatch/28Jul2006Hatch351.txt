SEN. HATCH: UTAH TRANSPORTATION CENTER WINS $430K GRANT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced a $430,000 grant for the Utah Transportation Center (UTC) at Utah State University. This is the first installment in a four-year award for the UTC to pursue its education, research, and technology transfer goals.  
   "This grant will help Utah State experts pave a road to the future for improving transportation in Utah," Hatch said. "Moreover, grants for projects like this typically create a snowball effect of funds, so I predict this on-going money will help the center develop a funding base over the long haul, not just for four years." 
   The entire Utah delegation worked to include this money in last year's multi-year highway and transit bill, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), designed to improve and maintain the transportation infrastructure in the country. Hatch was a key member of the House-Senate negotiating team that crafted the final version that passed Congress. The UTC plans to use the money to: 
   * Increase its number of students in transportation-related fields, notably civil engineering, as many civil engineers are predicted to retire in the near future 
   * Conduct longer-range, higher-risk transportation studies than the Utah Department of Transportation can typically perform, especially of the I-15 corridor 
   * Better develop USU's transportation research into marketable technology 
   The UTC program is administered by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that works to coordinate research and advance the development and deployment of technology solutions to America's transportation challenges.
