SEN. HATCH: BOOSTING NATION'S GEOTHERMAL ELECTRICITY WILL REDUCE COST OF ENERGY
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today joined with a group of bipartisan senators to push for the accelerated development of geothermal electricity in the U.S. In a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, Hatch and his colleagues pointed to new authorities and funding Congress has provided to the Department of Energy for the advancement of this clean renewable energy.  
   "Geothermal is clean, green, and renewable," Hatch said. "Utah is one of the few states already producing a significant amount of geothermal energy. But we've barely scratched the surface of developing this great resource, and there is no reason to delay going after it." 
   Hatch sponsored a proposal included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided tax incentives for the commercial development of geothermal power generation. 
   As the author of S. 1617, the FREEDOM Act - a bill providing incentives for consumers and manufacturers of plug-in vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles - Hatch is promoting a shift in our transportation sector away from oil and toward the electric grid. 
   "With broad-based deployment of geothermal energy, we will be able power an electric grid more cheaply and cleanly than we can today," Hatch said. "And running our automobiles on that electricity will be better for our nation's economy, environment, and security."
