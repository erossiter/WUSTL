SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES NEW UTAH ARMY RESERVE UNITS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today hosted a meeting of the Utah Congressional delegation where Lt. Gen. Jack Stultz, U.S. Army Reserve, announced creation of a new medical command unit that will be led by a major general in Utah.  
   "Utah will be on the forefront of future Army Reserve medicine," Hatch said. "The new unit will provide opportunities for doctors, nurses, and other health care providers to serve their country in the Army Reserve." 
   Furthermore, according to Lt. Gen. Stultz, the Army is headquartering a new chemical company in the Salt Lake Valley equipped with a Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS). BIDS units are deployed to detect and respond to biological threats by quickly identifying organisms and toxins that can be used as biological weapons and relaying that information to the appropriate military and civilian responders. 
   "As America's enemies pursue offensive biological warfare programs, the Army is increasing its capabilities to respond to such attacks," Hatch said. "I am proud to report that the Army has chosen Utah for this important new unit."
