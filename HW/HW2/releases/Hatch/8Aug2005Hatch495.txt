HOMELAND SECURITY TO REVIEW PRIVATE FUEL STORAGE PROPOSAL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) announced today the Department of Homeland Security will gather information on infrastructure and community needs associated with storing high-level nuclear waste on the Skull Valley Goshutes reservation - a move that could prove key to defeating the proposal by Private Fuel Storage (PFS) for storing waste above-ground and less than 50 miles to the west of Salt Lake City.  
   "Homeland Security needs to see first-hand that placement of an above-ground nuclear storage facility over the entrance of the Utah Testing and Training Range is, by itself, a dangerous situation worthy of investigation by the Department," said Hatch. "However, combined with the threats that we now face in the War on Terrorism, the selection of this site - so close to major population centers and to an international airport - is an unacceptable risk." 
   The decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Michael Chertoff comes after concerted efforts by Hatch to request a consideration of the security implications of the PFS proposal. The DHS Secretary has agreed to provide Utah with what Hatch had asked for in an earlier effort to amend the recently-passed Energy Bill. 
   "Secretary Chertoff, before his confirmation, made a commitment to me that DHS would investigate this matter and the Secretary has re-affirmed that he is a man of his word," Hatch said. 
   Early next week, officials from the Department will visit the Skull Valley site and meet with Hatch, Utah officials, and other interested parties in Salt Lake City.
