BYU COUNSEL GRIFFITH BIG STEP CLOSER TO DC BENCH
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) joined a bipartisan majority in the Senate Judiciary Committee to report favorably the nomination of Brigham Young University Counsel Tom Griffith to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by a vote of 14 to 4.  
   "My colleagues recognize what I've known all along: Tom Griffith is a skilled, thoughtful and experienced lawyer who will make a great judge for the D.C. circuit," Hatch said. "This important court can really use a good man and able lawyer like Tom." 
   Griffith currently serves as BYU's general counsel and served as counsel to the U.S. Senate from 1995-1999, a span which included the divisive impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. 
   "Tom's a member of the Senate family, and he impressed a lot of people here with his great confidence, skill and impeccable integrity," Hatch said. 
   The next step in Griffith's nomination is a vote on the floor of the Senate. During today's Committee meeting Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) indicated the Democrats will not filibuster the nomination.
