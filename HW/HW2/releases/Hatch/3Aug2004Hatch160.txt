SEN. HATCH: AUSTRALIA TRADE PACT GOOD FOR U.S., UTAH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) congratulated President Bush for signing the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement during a Rose Garden ceremony today.  
   "This agreement is good for our state and our country's businesses and workers alike," said Hatch. "The elimination of tariffs in such a major international marketplace will give our firms a distinct advantage over the competition." 
   "The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement will eliminate 99 percent of Australia's manufacturing tariffs, grant tariff-free access to Australia's agricultural market for U.S. exporters, and grant enhanced preferential access to U.S. services exporters," Hatch added. "With the economy of Utah being heavily concentrated in manufacturing, agriculture, and services industries, this agreement will have a very positive impact." 
   "Ambassador Zoellick and the U.S. Trade Representative's staff have done a good job updating the TRIPS and NAFTA intellectual property standards in this agreement," said Hatch. "The extra emphasis being paid to strengthening intellectual property legal and enforcement frameworks will benefit several U.S. industries for years to come." 
   "Australia has been a long-time ally of the U.S. through several different conflicts, including the current War on Terrorism," added Hatch. "We have no closer ally in Asia."
