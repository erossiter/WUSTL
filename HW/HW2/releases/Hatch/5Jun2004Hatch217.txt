   "I am confident Ronald Reagan will be remembered as one of the most inspiring Presidents America has ever had. My heart goes out to Nancy and their children. Now we're truly mourning in America. 
   "I knew him well, and he was a good friend. We worked together to push through the Reagan Revolution, which renewed the spirit of America.
