SEN. HATCH REACTS TO RESIGNATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement on the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general of the United States.  
   "Alberto Gonzales has been the President's strong right arm in fighting terrorists using the tools of law enforcement, and he helped successfully protect the American homeland during his tenure. Beyond that, he has overseen the Department of Justice's efforts to protect children from Internet predators, to combat human trafficking, and to prevent the spread of meth in our communities. 
   "I hope that history will remember Attorney General Gonzales for his honorable service to his country, rather than for the absurd political theater to which some critics have subjected him."
