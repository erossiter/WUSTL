SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVES JUDGE MUKASEY
  Today Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee in approving the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States by a vote of 11-8.  
   "Judge Mukasey is qualified and ready to lead," Hatch said. "We need to act now to confirm Judge Mukasey so he can lead the Justice Department and protect Americans. He has the integrity and commitment to the rule of the law that my Democratic colleagues have said is essential. His background as a prosecutor and a judge, and his expertise in national security and terrorism cases, equip him to make independent judgments about the issues facing America at this crucial time in our history." 
   Judge Mukasey spent 16 years in private legal practice, four years as a federal prosecutor, and 19 years as a federal judge. He has direct experience with national security and terrorism issues, having presided over high-profile terrorism cases. 
   Hatch said that Judge Mukasey will be a "strong and independent" Attorney General, and he urges Democratic Senators to apply the same standards that they applied to past Democratic nominees to Mukasey as his nomination advances. In the last 30 years, the Senate has taken an average of three weeks to confirm an Attorney General nominee, but Democrats have forced Mukasey to wait almost seven weeks and counting before a vote by the full Senate.
