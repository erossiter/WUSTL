SEN. HATCH: PRO-GROWTH POLICIES BOOST TAX REVENUE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) reported today that the national deficit for FY 2006 will be only $260 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) August report. In October, the CBO forecast a deficit exceeding $400 billion, but thanks to continued strong economic growth, tax revenue has surged for the second consecutive year.  
   "Some have criticized Congress for lowering taxes while our nation has to pay for emergencies like two wars and hurricane recovery," Hatch said. "But many critics miss the fact that the president's tax cuts have boosted productivity, which ultimately increases household income as well as the amount of money flowing into the government's coffers. These numbers show that Congress's pro-growth policies have kept the economy on the right track." 
   Hatch put the $260 billion deficit in perspective, as less than 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product - a lower rate than deficits from 1980 to 1995. Tax revenue as a proportion of GDP is 18.4 percent, which is higher than it was during that period and above the long-run average for the past 30 years. 
   Tax revenue is nearly $500 billion higher this year than it was in 2004 - an increase of 30 percent in two years. This year, corporations paid 27 percent more in total tax revenue than they did last year, and individuals paid 15 percent more. 
   "Economic growth is not the cure of all that ails our society, but it makes solving the problems we do have a lot easier," Hatch said. "A balanced budget is much more attainable when the economy is strong and generating healthy revenue growth, and we need to do all we can to make sure that continues."
