SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON DEATH OF ELMA G. 'PEM' FARNSWORTH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) released the following statement today on the death of Elma G. "Pem" Farnsworth.  
   "Pem Farnsworth was a wonderful woman, loving wife and mother, and tremendous ambassador for Utah. She spent many years preserving the legacy of her husband, Philo, and delighting in his many scientific accomplishments, including the breakthroughs that led to the invention of television. Pem was a instrumental force in getting a statue of Philo placed in Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol - one of two representing Utah. She was a truly terrific woman and I know she will be very missed by her family, friends, and our great state."
