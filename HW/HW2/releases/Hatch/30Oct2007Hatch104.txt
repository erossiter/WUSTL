SEN. HATCH DEFENDS NORD'S PERFORMANCE AS CPSC CHAIRWOMAN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement in response to calls for the resignation of Nancy Nord as Acting Chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.  
   "I disagree with my colleagues calling for the resignation of the Acting Chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Basically, Chairwoman Nord is being criticized for doing her job. She proposed legislation to strengthen the agency and has worked for the tools and resources the agency needs. She has also highlighted her concerns that provisions of legislation under consideration will divert resources away from the agency's core product safety mission. This kind of candor from public servants who tell it like it is best serves the American people."
