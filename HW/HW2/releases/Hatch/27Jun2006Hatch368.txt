SEN. HATCH'S FLAG AMENDMENT MISSES PASSAGE BY ONE VOTE
  A Constitutional amendment empowering Congress to ban flag desecration missed the mark by a razor-thin, one-vote margin in the U.S. Senate this evening. Although the vote on Sen. Orrin G. Hatch's amendment was 66-34, two-thirds, or 67 votes, are required for adoption. The amendment has passed the House of Representatives six times, including last year, and this is the closest the amendment has ever come to passing.  
   Hatch said: 
   "This amendment would give back to Congress the power the Supreme Court usurped from it 17 years ago when five unelected justices rejected 200 years of statutes that protected Old Glory. This amendment wouldn't change the Constitution, it would restore it to what it was before the Supreme Court altered it. 
   "While banning flag desecration is important to the majority of Americans, this amendment is about more than the flag. It's a message to activist judges that enough is enough. This amendment is a way for Congress to stand up and say to the Supreme Court we won't sit idly by when you to usurp the power of the people. Fifty state legislatures have petitioned Congress for this amendment, and passage of it would have given power of their nation's greatest symbol back to them. 
   "This is a setback, but it's not a final defeat. For protecting the Stars and Stripes, I will not give up and I will not surrender."
