DECISION TO MOVE MOAB TAILINGS FINAL
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) supported the Department of Energy (DOE)'s announcement today that moving 12 million tons of radioactive waste in Moab is now the official policy of the Federal government.  
   "Millions of people near Moab and throughout the Southwest have good reason to fear for their drinking water," Hatch said. "We shouldn't have this radioactive waste so close to the Colorado River. The DOE made the right decision to move this pile to a safe location." 
   In April, DOE issued draft language stating its preferred alternative for cleaning up the site is to remediate the groundwater and transport the tailings pile and other contaminated materials to the Crescent Junction disposal site. Today, however, DOE made public its final environmental impact statement (EIS), following a 90-day public comment period. 
   The 12 million tons of tailings sit 750 feet from the Colorado River and are residue from a uranium mill that ceased operations in 1984 and was taken over by the DOE in 2000. Moab's facility is the only DOE-decommissioned uranium mill that has not been cleaned up, and the DOE had previously considered as one of its alternatives capping the waste and storing it onsite. 
   Last month, the Senate passed an energy and water appropriations bill that included $28 million for the Department of Energy to begin the process of moving the radioactive mill tailings pile, and Hatch is working to ensure the funding remains in the final funding bill that is considered by Congress. 
   "It will take millions of dollars to move the pile, and providing funding for this project is one of my highest priorities," Hatch said. "We've talked about this for years. Now we need to move beyond talk and provide money to start cleaning up the mess."
