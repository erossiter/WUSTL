COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. HATCH BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA LAND EXCHANGE BILL
  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee today approved a bill sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to allow the exchange of two small parcels of land between the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Utah National Parks Council and Brian Head Ski Resort.  
   "This is a small land exchange, but it will go a long way in helping Utah's Scouts more fully enjoy their Scouting experience," Hatch said. "The Scouts have been working for more than 20 years to get this land so they can improve their camp. The additional land will allow the Scouts to expand their archery and rifle ranges at Parowan's Camp Thunder Ridge and make them safer for the boys. The land is clear and flat, which will make a better campground. This will be a tremendous help to the Boy Scouts program in Utah." 
   In 1983, the Bureau of Land Management gave the BSA roughly 1,300 acres near Parowan, Utah, for a Boy Scout camp. Under the agreement, land cannot be sold or exchanged without Congressional action. Hatch's bill, S. 476, would allow the BSA to give 120 acres on the south end of the camp to Brian Head in exchange for 120 acres on the eastern side of the camp, including 40 acres inside the camp's boundaries.
