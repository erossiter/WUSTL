SEN. HATCH: CONGRESS PASSES BILL TO PREVENT FRIVOLOUS FIREARMS LAWSUITS
  The House of Representatives today passed legislation co-sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to provide protection for gun manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits. The Senate passed the measure, S. 397, the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, on July 29 and it is expected to be signed into law by President George W. Bush. 
   "This bill cracks down on junk lawsuits that are overwhelming law-abiding small businesses that are central to our military and those who wish to exercise their Second Amendment rights," Hatch said. "True negligent behavior will always be punishable and result in liability. But soon unscrupulous trial lawyers will no longer be able to besiege the firearms industry with a flood of frivolous lawsuits."
