SEN. HATCH INTRODUCES GUN SAFE BILL
  During a late-session flurry of legislative activity last week, Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) introduced a bill to help responsible gun owners keep their families safe from accidents and malfeasance by encouraging the purchase and use of gun safes. 
   "While we must always be vigilant in protecting our rights - especially our Second Amendment rights - it is also critical that we encourage responsible exercise of those rights," said Hatch, who introduced the bill on Friday, July 29. "This bill would promote the safe storage of firearms by providing a 25 percent tax credit toward the purchase of a gun safe - up to a maximum of $250." 
   The bipartisan Child Protection and Home Safety Act of 2005 has widespread support among Utah law enforcement, including the Utah Sheriff's Association, the Utah Police Corps, and the Utah Highway Patrol Association. Numerous national organizations have also lent their support, including the National Association of Police Organizations and SAVE, the Suicide Awareness Voice of Education. 
   "This bill will help prevent guns from being stolen out of their owners' homes and used to commit crimes," said Hatch. "It will also help prevent children from accessing their parents' firearms, and hopefully help prevent terrible tragedies from occurring. I'm optimistic my colleagues will give it their unqualified support."
