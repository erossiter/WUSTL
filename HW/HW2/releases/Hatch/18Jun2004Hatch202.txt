SEN. HATCH: JOHNSON BEHEADING 'BARBARIC, COWARDLY'
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) released the following statement today regarding the reported beheading of American Paul Johnson in Saudi Arabia:
   "The barbaric murder of Paul Johnson today is something that no civilized society condones, and that no human being with a conscience can tolerate. That Mr. Johnson was an innocent civilian, in Saudi Arabia only to do his job and provide for his family, underscores the brutality and utter lack of morality of the enemy. Such cowardly acts will never defeat the civilized world, and will only strengthen our resolve to prevail in the global war on terrorism."
