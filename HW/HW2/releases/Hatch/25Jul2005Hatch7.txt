SEN. HATCH PUSHES FOR HILL AFB PROJECTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) took to the floor of the U.S. Senate today to promote two projects vital to the long-term success of Utah's Hill Air Force Base: the Air Force's Depot Maintenance Strategy and the F/A-22 Raptor fighter jet program.  
   "The future of Hill and the future of these two programs are intertwined," said Hatch. "The programs' success won't make or break Hill, but if the Department of Defense pursues these as they should, Hill will be in excellent position for many years to come." 
   Hatch delivered two separate speeches, the first praising the Department of Defense (DoD) Authorization bill, which allocates significant funding for Hill's state-of-the-art software center. 
   "In a sense, Hill software center has been a victim of its own success," Hatch said of the center, which is in the top 2 percent of software centers in terms of performance. "The Air Force has been calling on the center to do more and more, and this bill allocates the needed funds - more than $57 million for Fiscal Year '06 - to expand and strengthen the center." 
   Hatch's second speech touted the Air Force's revolutionary F/A-22 Raptor fighter project, which is designed to maintain American dominance of the skies for decades to come. Hill will be providing depot maintenance on the F/A-22. 
   "Over the past year and a half, I have made trips to two air force bases to be briefed in detail on the capabilities of the F/A-22," said Hatch. "I am absolutely convinced that this extraordinary aircraft is vital to future American national security. It's the most maneuverable aircraft in the skies today. It is equipped with supercruise engines. It has truly impressive stealth capabilities. And, it is a superior bomber as well as fighter. I hope the F/A-22 program will receive the full support of every member of Congress."
