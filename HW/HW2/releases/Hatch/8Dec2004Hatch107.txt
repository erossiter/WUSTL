SEN. HATCH JUDICIARY PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN FINAL INTELLIGENCE BILL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today expressed satisfaction that the final package adopted by the Conference Committee incorporated many anti-terrorism tools advocated by the Senate Judiciary Committee, including two Hatch-sponsored bills.  
   "We have taken an important step toward securing our country against another terrorist attack-but the road is a long one, and there will be many steps to follow," said Hatch on final passage of the intelligence reform bill. 
   Hatch added, "I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to further strengthen our security by tackling the difficult issues of immigration reform left unresolved in this legislation." 
   The final bill also includes Hatch provisions to protect military families from false statements about the death or capture of their loved ones and to penalize those who perpetrate terrorist hoaxes.
