DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NEEDS LEADERSHIP, NOMINEES DESERVE FAIRNESS
  Senior Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) released the following statement in response to the announcement of nominations for top Department of Justice leadership posts.  
   "I'm glad the White House and the Attorney General are moving quickly to complete the leadership team at the Department of Justice," Hatch said. "Attorney General Mukasey needs qualified, experienced people, such as these, to help him lead the department. I hope the Senate puts the crucial mission of the Justice Department and the interests of the American people ahead of partisanship." 
   The announced nominees include Grace Chung Becker, a former Judiciary Committee counsel to Hatch, to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. She is currently a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division, working on an important new initiative on human trafficking. 
   "Grace is a fine lawyer and a good person," Hatch said. "Her experience in the legislative branch and as a prosecutor will be invaluable as she continues to advance the protection of civil rights."
