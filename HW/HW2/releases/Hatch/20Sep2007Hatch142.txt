SEN. HATCH TAPS USDA TO BOOST STAFF FOR FARM BILL NEGOTIATIONS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced that Taylor Oldroyd has joined his team on loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where Oldroyd has worked for five years. Oldroyd will augment Hatch's current staff on agriculture and other resource issues, specifically as the Senate debates the 2007 farm bill.  
   "Given his experience in Washington and his deep Utah ties, Taylor has been able to hit the ground running in my office," Hatch said. "I predict he will be a great asset to my legislative agenda for Utah's agriculture needs as the Senate considers the next farm bill." 
   Oldroyd earned his bachelor's degree in political science and later a master's of public administration from Brigham Young University. While at the USDA, Oldroyd worked for the Rural Development and Natural Resources Conservation Service agencies. His public service in Utah includes time as deputy mayor for the city of Provo, director of governmental affairs for the Salt Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, and deputy district director for Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah). 
   "Working for Sen. Hatch is an exciting new opportunity, and I'm eager to fight for Utah's agriculture producers and land-use issues," Oldroyd said. "I've been in Washington for several years now, but Utah is my home, and I appreciate the chance to help Sen. Hatch." 
   Oldroyd, a native of Provo, Utah, is married to Meredith Wright, of Provo, and they have five children: Jefferson, Liberty, Starly, Abigail and Quincy.
