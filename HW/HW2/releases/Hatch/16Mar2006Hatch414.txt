SEN. HATCH: GOV. KEMPTHORNE A FAIR, INTELLIGENT MANAGER
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement following the announcement that Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne has been nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as Secretary of the Interior.  
   "Utah has more than our fair share of public lands, and having a good Interior Secretary is vital to our state," Hatch said. "Dirk understands the needs of local communities that are so heavily affected by these public lands. He's a fair, intelligent manager, and I know that should he be confirmed by the Senate, he'll fight to protect our lands and promote wise use of our resources." 
   "Dirk's going to be a key factor in our state's efforts to block the Skull Valley site in Tooele," Hatch said. "I'm looking forward to working closely with him to make sure this reckless proposal doesn't go forward."
