SEN. HATCH PROPOSAL PROTECTS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has proposed a budget amendment aimed at keeping Congress from scaling back Medicare recipients' health-care choices.  
   As outlined by Hatch on the Senate floor late Wednesday, the amendment, if passed, would prevent Congress from damaging the Medicare Advantage program that has expanded health-care choices for millions of Americans. 
   "Simply put, my amendment would prevent Congress from limiting coverage choices for Medicare beneficiaries," Hatch said. "It also may not reduce the benefits of those who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans." 
   Since its establishment by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, the Medicare Advantage program has provided Americans in rural states such as Utah and Iowa with the same health benefits once reserved only to their urban counterparts. 
   Hatch noted the program provides for a range of additional benefits - vision, dental care, annual physical exams and hearing aids, among others - not available under traditional Medicare. He further lauded the effectiveness of Medicare Advantage's chronic-care plan for beneficiaries with diabetes, congestive heart failure and other chronic illnesses. 
   "Today, beneficiaries across the country - whether they live in a rural state like Utah or urban area like Boston - have better coverage choices," Hatch said. "Today, beneficiaries are offered more choices, more benefits and lower out-of-pocket costs. Today, most beneficiaries are satisfied." 
   In urging his Senate colleagues to support his amendment, Hatch cautioned against rolling back health-care choices to pre-Medicare Modernization Act levels. 
   "We all need to remember that these policy decisions were made on a bipartisan basis. These bipartisan decisions helped achieve these impressive results. And these results should be protected, Hatch said.
