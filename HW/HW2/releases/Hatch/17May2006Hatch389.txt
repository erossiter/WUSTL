SEN. HATCH: NO CITIZENSHIP FOR FELONS, REPEAT OFFENDERS
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today put his support behind an amendment that will prevent illegal alien felons and repeat offenders from earning U.S. citizenship.  
   "Citizenship should be a privilege, not a right," Hatch said. "We can't afford to grant this privilege to those who don't respect the law and have proven they would be a detriment to our society." 
   The amendment, championed by Senators Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), would prevent any felon or criminal alien convicted of three or more misdemeanors from receiving any legalization benefits considered in the immigration bill, S. 2611. Illegal immigrants who failed to comply with an ordered removal would also be barred from receiving these benefits. The amendment does not create any new offenses or criminalize illegal immigrants. 
   The measure was blocked during previous attempts to pass immigration reform legislation, and Hatch insisted the measure be included before agreeing to move forward on a bill. Today, the measure unanimously passed the United States Senate.
