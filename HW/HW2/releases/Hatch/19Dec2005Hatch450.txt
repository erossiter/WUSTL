SEN. HATCH ACTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM PORN
  Late last Friday, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) introduced legislation to strengthen an important tool for protecting children from the exploitation of child pornography.  
   "Children are pornography's most vulnerable and most devastated victims," Hatch said. "Abusing children through early exposure to pornography has life-long effects. Even worse, however, is the actual use of children to make sexually explicit material. Those who produce sexually explicit material are breaking the law if that material depicts children, and this bill enhances our ability to bring these pornographers to justice." 
   Federal law prohibits using children to produce visual depictions of either actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct. Those who produce this material must keep records regarding the age of performers and must make those records available for inspection. Hatch's bill, S. 2140, strengthens this record-keeping statute in four ways: 
   * Defines actual sexually explicit material consistently with corresponding sections in the United States Code. The current law incorporates only four of the five definitions outlined in other sections. 
   * Applies the same record-keeping requirements to those who produce depictions of simulated conduct. Current law applies only to those who produce depictions of actual conduct. 
   * Explicitly states that refusal to permit inspection of age-related records is a crime. Current law only requires maintaining the records, but it provides no penalty for refusing to disclose them. 
   * Provides a meaningful and targeted definition for what it means to produce sexually explicit material. The definition includes activities such as filming or photographing someone, duplicating or reissuing images for commercial distribution, and managing the sexually explicit content of a computer site. It specifically exempts those not involved in hiring, managing, or arranging the performers' participation, along with those involved in web-hosting services when the provider does not manage sexually explicit content. 
   "If we are serious in protecting children from being exploited by child pornographers, we need a workable, practical law that's enforceable," Hatch said. "This is a straight-forward, common-sense bill that will strengthen this important tool for protecting children." 
   Hatch's bill is the result of extensive discussions with the Department of Justice, representatives of the motion picture industry and Internet companies, which all helped to refine the bill before it was introduced.
