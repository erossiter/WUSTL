SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON GUANTANAMO BAY SUPREME COURT DECISION
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following reaction the Supreme Court's decision on Rasul v. Bush.  
   "I am troubled with the prospect of foreign aliens who are captured on the battlefield and are being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba having access to our court system. Instead of fighting a war on the battlefield, it appears that critical military decisions could be second-guessed by attorneys in a courtroom." 
   "Today's Supreme Court rulings greatly complicate our fight against terror. Although the real impact of these cases is yet to be seen, these procedural roadblocks may prove to significantly hamper the ability of the President and the United States to fight and win this unconventional war. I believe Justice Scalia's dissent in the Rasul case raises valid questions regarding the jurisdiction of any federal court over the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Today's decisions, regrettably, only add to the confusion and ensure an explosion of litigation over the war on terrorism."
