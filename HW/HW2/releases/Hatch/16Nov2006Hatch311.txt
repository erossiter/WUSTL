SEN. HATCH WANTS TO 'FEED AMERICA THURSDAY'
  Senate unanimously passed a resolution today sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) designating the Thursday before Thanksgiving, November 16, 2006, as "Feed America Thursday." This marks the fifth year the Senate has commemorated this day. 
   "This has become a great tradition," Hatch said. "It's a way of suggesting how we as a nation can truly capture the spirit of Thanksgiving. This is an opportunity to help others, so that everyone has something to be thankful for on this great holiday." 
   Co-sponsored by Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah), the resolution, S. Res. 603, encourages Americans to go without two meals on Nov. 16 and donate the money they would have spent on food that day to a charity or religious organization of their choice. The charities and churches, accordingly, are encouraged to feed the hungry with the funds received. The two Utah Senators introduced the bill in September. 
   The contributions this resolution encourages will serve the needs of those who suffer from hunger in the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture has reported that 11.9 percent of households, or 38.2 million people, including 13.9 million children, live in food-insecure households. The DOA has reported that 14.8 percent of households in Utah are food insecure. These individuals do not have an adequate supply of food throughout the entire year.
