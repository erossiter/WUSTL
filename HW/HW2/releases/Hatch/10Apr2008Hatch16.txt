SENATE OKS HATCH BILL TO BOOST JUAB COUNTY'S WATER RESOURCES
  The U.S. Senate today passed legislation, authored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), allowing Juab County to complete water resource development projects with Central Utah Project funds. The legislation was included in the Public Lands bill (S. 2730). 
   "Utah's rapid growth must be matched by rapid expansion of its limited water resources," Hatch said. "The residents of Juab County need - and deserve - this bill for their water development projects."
   Under the original plan for the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project, several counties in central Utah, including Juab, were to receive supplemental water through an irrigation and drainage delivery system. Over the years, however, the planning requirements for the Bonneville Unit have changed and most of the water allocated to the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project is planned for use in Wasatch, Salt Lake, and Utah counties at present.
   Many central Utah counties have elected not to participate in the plan and no longer pay the requisite taxes. Juab County, however, has remained active in the Central Utah Water Conservancy District's efforts and has paid millions in property taxes to the District. Unfortunately, the County has yet to reap any of the benefits of its membership.
   Hatch's bill, the Juab County Surface and Ground Water Study and Development Act of 2007, would amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act to allow Juab County to receive Central Utah Project (CUP) funds. Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah) is a co-sponsor.
   "For many years, the citizens of Juab County have deposited money to the Central Utah Project, and it's time for that investment to pay-off," Hatch said. "This bill will finally allow them to reap the rewards they deserve, so in Juab County there will be no taxation without irrigation."
