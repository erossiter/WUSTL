REIT AMENDMENT HELPS INVESTORS BUILD COMMUNITIES, SEN. HATCH SAYS
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today lauded the passage of his amendment to the housing stimulus bill adopted by the Senate, saying it will give small investors a larger stake in helping the nation's real-estate sector prosper.  
   Hatch's amendment, part of HR 3221, which the Senate adopted today by an 84-12 vote, changes the tax code to simplify the rules for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), thus aiding small-scale investors as they get involved in income-producing real estate ventures that create wealth and thriving communities. 
   "Entrepreneurs across the country deserve the opportunity to wisely invest their money in commercial real estate, which until REITs came along was mostly the province of private partnerships that often excluded ordinary men and women," Hatch said. "The amendment makes it easier for them to do that by bringing REIT law into conformity with changing times." 
   REITs, Hatch continued, now account for more than a billion dollars in property in Utah and provide many investors in the Beehive State with the opportunity to have a greater ownership stake in their community. 
   Hatch's amendment, among other things, brings REIT rules into conformity with the rules governing mutual funds and gives investors more flexibility in managing their assets.
