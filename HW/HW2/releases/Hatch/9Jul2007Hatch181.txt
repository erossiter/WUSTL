SEN. HATCH: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELPING UTAH FIREFIGHTERS AGAINST MILFORD FLAT INFERNO
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement on the Milford Flat Fire - which has already blackened more than 300,000 acres - and the other fires currently threatening lives, homes, and the rural economies in Utah.  
   "What we're seeing is a witch's brew of heat, extremely dry air, and strong winds that have set the West Desert ablaze in the single largest fire in Utah's history," Hatch said. "Our hearts go out to those already affected by these flames, which have endangered lives, forced some to evacuate, and destroyed property and wilderness. I am grateful for the brave firefighters on the ground who have put themselves in the path of these infernos to protect more populated and forested areas of the state." 
   Hatch reported that the Federal government has committed its resources to help combat Utah's fires. Congress has appropriated $1.5 billion to pay for Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management efforts to fight wild-land fires on Federal lands this year. Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover 75 percent of the costs state and local governments will incur fighting the Milford Flat fire. 
   "I appreciate how quickly the Federal government reacted to Utah's request to help with the costs of battling this fire," Hatch said. "Our counties are going to have a long enough road ahead of them recovering from the fire damage. The FEMA money will help keep a natural disaster from becoming an economic disaster as well."
