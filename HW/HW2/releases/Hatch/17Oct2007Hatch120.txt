SEN. HATCH PARTICIPATES IN MUKASEY AG HEARING
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today participated in the Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing of Judge Michael Mukasey, President Bush's nomination to be Attorney General of the United States. Mukasey has given almost 40 years of service in America's legal system, and has an extensive background in terrorism issues and cases that make him specifically qualified to serve as Attorney General.
   Hatch specifically questioned Mukasey about how the Department of Justice can ramp up its prosecution of obscenity and pornography cases.
