SEN. HATCH VOTES AGAINST TROOP WITHDRAWAL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today released the following statement after the United States Senate passed a war spending bill that included a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq:  
   "Too many Senators seem to be worried about winning the 2008 election when we should be working to win the Iraq war," Hatch said. "Look, we all want to bring our troops home, but the reality is that the challenges in Iraq will likely not be resolved so easily. So we shouldn't kid ourselves that withdrawing our troops suddenly will make things better. We all know that if we pull out our troops prematurely, Iraq would be a failed state offering a safe haven for terrorists." 
   The bill, H.R. 1591, narrowly passed the Senate by a 51 to 47 vote.
