  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement upon news of the passing of President Gordon B. Hinckley, leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.  
   "I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of President Gordon B. Hinckley. He was a beloved Prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His life was a true testament of service, and he had an abiding love for others. His wit, wisdom, and exemplary leadership will be missed by not only members of our faith, but by people of all faiths throughout the world." 
   "He was an articulate leader and defender of our Christian principles; and had a unique gift and way about him to communicate with people from all walks of life, and all religious persuasions. I truly loved this wonderful man. I know that he is happily reunited with his sweet wife, Marjorie, who he has greatly missed. I am sure there is a loving reunion in heaven with Marjorie and with so many others with whom he has served. Elaine and I feel deeply privileged to have known such a remarkable man and been touched in so many ways by his life and example."
