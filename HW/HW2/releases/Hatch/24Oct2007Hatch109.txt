SEN. HATCH VOTES TO CONFIRM JUDGE SOUTHWICK
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today joined a majority of his fellow Senators in voting to confirm Judge Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Southwick's nomination had been stalled since January. Enough Democrats voted with Republicans to overcome a procedural hurdle, with a 62-35 vote, to enable the Senate to give Southwick a straight up-or-down vote of 59-38. Hatch hopes this indicates a trend of fairer treatment toward judicial nominees.  
   "Judge Southwick is one of the finest judges I've seen in my entire time in the U.S. Senate," Hatch said. "The man has demonstrated tremendous qualifications and character. After 12 years on the bench, Judge Southwick has shown that he will interpret the law according to the role given him, rather than legislating from the bench and exceeding his authority as too many activist judges have. Moreover, he volunteered for service in Iraq when he was old enough to have children serving in Iraq. It's pathetic that he's had to wait as long as he did to get an up-or-down vote. I appreciate that he will now have the chance to do on the Fifth Circuit court what he has done so long in so many other capacities - serve his country."
