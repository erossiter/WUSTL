SEN. HATCH COMMENDS SENATE PASSAGE OF BILL TO CREATE NATIONAL SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), today praised the Senate's passage of S. 2154, the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Database Act of 2004.  
   "The problem this bill addresses is simple, yet great-there is no public national sex offender registry," Hatch said. "Each state maintains its own registry of sex offenders, but there is no national database for the public to search. This measure will help us protect our children from perverts and pedophiles who prey on our most innocent." 
   "After last year's abduction of Dru Sjodin in North Dakota, Senator Dorgan introduced this bill to address a problem with our sex offender registry," continued Hatch. "I was pleased to support this legislation when it was referred to the Judiciary Committee and was happy to work with Senator Dorgan to improve the language of the final bill." 
   Dru's law directs the Attorney General to make available to the public, via the Internet, a national registry of sex offenders. It also requires each state to provide timely notice to the state's attorney general of the impending release of a high-risk sex offender; and upon such notification, the state's attorney general is required to consider whether to institute a civil commitment proceeding. States must intensively monitor for at least 1 year any high-risk sex offender who has not been civilly committed and has been unconditionally released from incarceration.
