SEN. HATCH: MIERS BRINGS DIVERSITY, DEPTH TO COURT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement following the nomination of White House Counsel Harriet Miers to be the next associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "Harriett Miers will bring diversity and depth to the Court," Hatch said. "She has broad professional experience that will provide a fresh perspective from outside the insular walls of the judiciary. As White House Counsel, she has been overseeing the process of choosing judges who will interpret, but not make, the law. Throughout her life, she has been dedicated to the law and has always set an example of integrity, accomplishment and service. It's important that we don't prejudge the nominee; I hope the Senate again shows the American people that we can conduct a dignified and thorough confirmation process."
