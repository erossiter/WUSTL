SEN. HATCH: EXTREME DECISION IS 'EGREGIOUS ACTIVISM'
 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today commented on the decision by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to appeal the recent ruling by a U.S. District Court Judge in Pennsylvania in U.S. v. Extreme Associates to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals:  
   "Fighting the scourge of obscenity requires both a real strategy to enforce the federal obscenity laws and, as in this case, aggressive defense of those laws. I applaud Attorney General Gonzales for identifying obscenity prosecution as a real priority for the Department of Justice, and for coming to the swift defense of our federal statutes banning obscenity distribution. The First Amendment is not an altar on which we must sacrifice our children, families, and community standards. Obscene material that is not protected by the First Amendment can and must be prohibited. 
   "The decision in United States v. Extreme Associates striking down the federal obscenity statutes is an egregious, and dangerous, example of judicial activism that cannot be allowed to stand. Judges who take the law into their own hands, who make up constitutional "rights" in order to strike down laws they oppose, undermine the people's right to have their values shape public policy and define the culture."
