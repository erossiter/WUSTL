SEN. HATCH RALLIES WITH SENATE TO CELEBRATE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAEL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) joined a broad, bi-partisan coalition of Senators cosponsoring a resolution to commemorate the modern State of Israel's 60th anniversary, and to reaffirm the United States' bond of close friendship and cooperation with Israel. The Senate approved the resolution unanimously late last night. 
   "For six decades, the United States and Israel have been friends and allies," Hatch said. "We have maintained a relationship based on shared democratic values, common strategic interests, and mutual respect. Israel is a strong and trusted ally and an important strategic partner. We are sympathetic to the challenges Israel faces and reaffirm our friendship and support."
   The resolution reaffirms the Senate's support for Israel's right to defend itself and its diplomatic efforts to pursue peace with its neighbors. It also commends the people of Israel for their remarkable achievements in building a new state and a pluralistic, democratic society in the face of terrorism, hostility, ostracism and belligerence from many of their neighbors.
