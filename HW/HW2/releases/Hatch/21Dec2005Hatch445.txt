CONGRESS PROVIDES MILLIONS TO HILL AIR FORCE BASE, BORDER SECURITY
  The U.S. Senate today passed legislation providing funding for the Department of Defense over the next fiscal year, which includes millions of dollars for several key programs at Hill Air Force Base (HAFB). 
   "Hill is one of the top-flight depots in the Air Force, and this funding will go a long way towards making it even more vital to the nation's military," Hatch said. "We're building on successful programs and implementing others that will strengthen Hill's ability to deliver for the men and women in the U.S. Air Force."  
   In addition to funding for Utah's military installations, the conference report to H.R. 2863, the FY 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, contains $1.14 billion in emergency supplemental funding for critical investments in border security. This funding targets shortfalls in vehicle replacement, law enforcement communications, air fleet modernization and construction. 
   "Illegal immigration should be met with vigorous law enforcement, not a wink-and-a-nod," Hatch said. "Congress has already authorized 2,000 more border patrol agents to protect our borders and provided millions to train state and local police officers to enforce federal immigration laws. This additional funding will step up our ability to enforce the laws on the books and strengthen our borders." 
   Following are Utah projects requested by Hatch that were included in the spending bill: 
   Hill Air Force Base 
   * $5.4 million - F-16 Avionics Intermediate Shop Depot Replacement: F-16 avionics are currently repaired at Hill using 20-year-old avionics equipment that are increasingly more costly to maintain. A new AIS with state-of-the-art technology has been developed, reducing the time needed to evaluate the F-16 equipment by 62 percent. These funds will be used to purchase the new equipment, Rack-Mounted Improved AIS, R-IAIS. Hill received $3.9 million in FY 2005. 
   * $4.2 million - Productivity Improvements for Landing Gear Overhaul Technologies (PILOT): The PILOT program is designed to bolster Hill's expertise in maintaining the landing gear systems on the Air Force's aging aircraft. Landing gear maintenance is among the highest priorities of every major command within the Air Force. 
   * $4.2 million - Aging Landing Gear Life Extension (ALGLE): Hill is responsible for 70 percent of the Air Force's landing gear maintenance work. ALGLE is a continuing program that addresses many of the critical issues facing landing gear maintenance, which has already generated cost avoidance in excess of $900 million. This is the third year Hill has received funding for this program. 
   * $2.5 million - Science and Engineering Lab Data Integration (SELDI): SELDI supports all intercontinental ballistic missiles and most aircraft maintenance performed at Hill. SELDI provides a maintenance and logistics information management tool that improves missile and aircraft readiness and safety. Through SELDI, personnel can track lab results relating to maintenance and overhaul operations, as well as equipment failures. These results provide for proactive aircraft inspection and maintenance. 
   * $1 million - Air Craft Defect Detection and Performance Management Application: This funding will allow Hill to use a new platform to better track mechanical malfunctions in aircraft. This will improve repair capabilities and lower long-term repair costs, as well as provide enhanced detection of safety related issues. 
   National Guard 
   * $3.5 million - Senior Scout: Funds will be used to upgrade and improve the intelligence gathering system utilized by Utah National Guard. 
   Protecting the Troops 
   * $2.5 million - Full Spectrum Active Close-In Layered Shield (FCLAS): FLACS is a new technology using radar to detect an incoming kinetic energy weapon, anti-tank missile or rocket-propelled grenade. Once the incoming object is identified, FCLAS fires an explosive projectile to destroy the threat at a safe distance.
