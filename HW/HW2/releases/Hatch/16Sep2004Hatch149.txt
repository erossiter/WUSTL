SENATE APPROVES STATE PARK TRANSFER TO BEAVER COUNTY
  Last night, the U.S. Senate passed Sen.Orrin Hatch's (R-Utah) bill to transfer Minersville State Park ownership to Beaver County, Utah.  
 The bill, S. 2285, would help alleviate the financial burden the current owner, the State of Utah, faces in association with the maintenance of the park. 
   "I'm pleased this bill has moved one step closer to enactment," Hatch said. "The park has $1 million worth of facilities, including a boat ramp, a dock, campsites, and other camping amenities. This bill will help to keep the park open and allow families in Beaver County to continue enjoying these facilities." 
   "Local officials are best equipped to handle the day-to-day management of the park," Hatch continued. "Transferring the property to Beaver County will allow these officials to keep the park accessible and ensure that it continues to be an excellent recreational retreat, a superb fishery, and a great place to visit." 
   The State of Utah managed the park for more than 40 years, but, faced with budget deficits, agreed to transfer park management to Beaver County. However, the Bureau of Land Management noted that the property itself had not been acquired through the Recreation and Public Purposes Act process, which would restrict Beaver County's management plan. Hatch's legislation, which now awaits consideration by the House of Representatives, would eliminate that restriction by transferring ownership of the property to Beaver County.
