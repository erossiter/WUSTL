SEN. HATCH BRINGS UTAH'S NCLB CONCERNS TO EDUCATION SECRETARY
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today met with Education Secretary Margaret Spellings to try to facilitate an agreement between Utah and the Department of Education on No Child Left Behind (NCLB).  
   "Secretary Spellings and I had a meaningful discussion about No Child Left Behind," Hatch said after Spellings met with him in his office this afternoon. "We're still doing all we can to ensure the Administration and State officials will reach a compromise and Utah will not lose millions of dollars in federal funding." 
   With Utah at the forefront of the debate on NCLB, Hatch raised Utah's concerns about maintaining flexibility for Utah within NCLB and making sure the state receives sufficient funding to fulfill the law's high standards. 
   "I encouraged the Secretary to remember that the very point of the negotiations is to ensure that the children of Utah get the very best education possible," Hatch said. "I'm going to monitor this very closely and work with state leaders and the Administration to make sure Utah's voice is heard in Washington."
