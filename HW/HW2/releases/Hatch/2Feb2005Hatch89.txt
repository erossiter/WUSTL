SEN. HATCH BILL WOULD HELP FAMILIES FILTER FILTH
  Last night, the United States Senate passed the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 (S. 167), a bill sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to help parents protect their families from inappropriate material in movies as well as make other necessary changes to federal copyright laws. 
   "Parents should have control over what their children see, not movie studios in Hollywood," Hatch said. "This bill ensures that parents will have access to technology that filters through the crude and violent scenes that always seem to creep into what would otherwise be good films." 
   Hatch's bill resolves some ongoing disputes about the legality of what many call "jump-and-skip" developed by technology companies, including Utah-based ClearPlay, which permit family-friendly viewing of films that may contain objectionable content. 
   S. 167 also closes some significant gaps in our copyright laws that are feeding some of the piracy so rampant on the Internet. 
   "All too often, new movies and songs are distributed on the Internet before they are even released," Hatch said. "My bill provides a uniform federal law - instead of a patchwork of state statutes - to help crack down on what is clearly theft of these creative works." 
   In addition to the technology and intellectual property provisions, Hatch's bill also contains a measure to reauthorize an existing program for the preservation of certain historically and culturally significant films. 
   The bill is co-sponsored by Senators Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), John Cornyn (R-Tex.), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).
