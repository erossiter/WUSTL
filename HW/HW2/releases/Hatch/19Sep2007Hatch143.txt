SEN. HATCH SUPPORTS PERMANENT AGRICULTURAL DISASTER RELIEF
  Today Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee joined with Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the Chairman of the Committee, to support the establishment of a Permanent Disaster Program for farmers who suffer from natural disasters. The move is a reaction to the difficulty of responding to agriculture disasters individually on an almost annual basis, leading to Congressional responses that are sometimes unbalanced, and too late.  
   Hatch's prepared remarks at the press conference follow: 
   I am pleased to join Sen. Baucus and my other colleagues to support Permanent Disaster Relief. Let's end the annual Congressional circus act of responding to every natural disaster individually. Let's pass a permanent disaster program that is dependable, equitable and responsive. 
   In Utah, we have agricultural disasters almost every year. Farmers in my state never know what Mother Nature may send their way, and my goal is to provide them greater stability. It is important that we find a reasonable way to pay for permanent disaster assistance so I look forward to working with Sen. Baucus to find appropriate off-sets. 
   I am pleased to join one of Utah's agriculture leaders, Art Douglas, and look forward to working with him on this and other agriculture issues. The concept has the strong support of the Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Union, the woolgrowers, cattlemen, fruit growers, and dairymen.
