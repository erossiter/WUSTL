SEN. HATCH: DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY LISTENED TO UTAHNS, CANCELED DIVINE STRAKE TEST
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today expressed his profound relief upon learning that the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has decided to cancel its plans to conduct the Divine Strake test at the Nevada Test Site.  
   "I couldn't be more relieved," Hatch said. "Everybody in Utah can rest easier tonight knowing that the government listened. No one's going to be harmed by this test. This decision is a result of so many people standing firm to ensure that we didn't repeat the mistakes of the past. I'm so glad that DTRA did the right thing in the end." 
   DTRA had planned a large-scale, open-air conventional explosive detonation close to previous nuclear weapons tests in Nevada. Upon learning last spring that the test would send a mushroom cloud 10,000 feet, Hatch partnered with Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) to press DTRA and the Department of Energy (DOE) - through letters and meetings in Hatch's office - to provide clear answers explaining how a test of that magnitude would be able to contain the spread of radioactive particles from earlier tests. 
   Because of their efforts, test officials considered alternative locations for the test, held public briefings in St. George and Salt Lake, and withdrew their initial environmental assessment to conduct additional research on the safety of the test. Each step helped educate officials on the serious concerns Utahns had about the test and postponed the test as officials worked to address these concerns. 
   Hatch commended the thousands of Utahns who provided formal comments to DTRA, attended public briefings, voiced their concerns at public hearings sponsored by Gov. John Huntsman Jr., and expressed their opposition through their elected representatives in the Utah State Legislature.
