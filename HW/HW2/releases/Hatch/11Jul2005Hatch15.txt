SEN. HATCH: COURT ERRED IN STRIKING PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement today in reaction to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision last Friday in Carhart v. Gonzales, which upheld a lower court's ruling that the Partial Birth Abortion Act passed by Congress in 2003 is unconstitutional:  
   "Once again, a court has failed to protect innocent life. This decision is another unfortunate example of an activist judiciary with little respect for the policy judgments of the American people's elected representatives. 
   "Partial-birth abortion is an inhuman, immoral procedure in which a near-viable baby is partially delivered, then killed just inches from being fully born. Permitting such a procedure not only violates core constitutional values of liberty and equality, it degrades our entire society by denying the basic dignity of these children. 
   "Last week's decision in Carhart rejected a deep national consensus on the necessity of banning this horrible procedure, as evidenced by the overwhelming vote in favor of the Partial Birth Abortion Act in both houses of Congress. As an elected lawmaker, it was very disappointing to read the Eighth Circuit Court's dismissal of the findings of fact supporting that legislation. After numerous hearings, we had concluded that there is never any medical necessity for partial-birth abortion. More recent studies have confirmed our judgment. Make no mistake: What happened with this decision was judges substituting their policy conclusions for those of an elected and accountable Congress. For the sake of innocent life, as well as our constitutional system of government, I hope the Supreme Court will correct this decision."
