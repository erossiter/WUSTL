SEN. HATCH: PRESERVE FOUR CORNERS HERITAGE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has introduced a bill to designate some of the most significant, accessible archaeological sites in the Four Corners region as a National Heritage Area.  
   "The history of the Four Corners region is unique and important to Utahns and the nation, and its archaeological sites are remarkably well preserved," Hatch said. "Designation of these historic sites will bolster the economies of Utah communities in the region." 
   Hatch's bill, the Trail of the Ancients National Heritage Area Study Act of 2005 (S. 1414), begins the process of giving Federal recognition to the Four Corners area following the newly established guidelines for National Heritage Areas. This designation allows local communities, non-profit and private organizations, and governments to partner together to plan and implement projects that conserve and highlight the cultural sites and landscapes within the Four Corners area. 
   Six years ago, Congress voted to support a partnership among Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and the Federal government to construct an Interpretive Center at the intersection of the Four Corners. This Center has recently opened, and Hatch sees designating the surrounding region as a National Heritage Area as the logical next step to provide geographic and interpretive coherence to the region's remarkable landscape and the important cultural sites dispersed within it. Designation of the area would not impose restrictions on private property or require acquisition of additional Federal land. 
   The measure is co-sponsored by Sens. Bob Bennett (R-Utah), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), and Wayne Allard (R-Colo.).
