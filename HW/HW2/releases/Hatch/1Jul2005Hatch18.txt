SEN. HATCH: SANDRA O'CONNOR SERVED CAUSE OF JUSTICE WITH CARE, INTEGRITY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the second-ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, issued the following statement upon the resignation announcement of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:  
   "Justice O'Connor has served the cause of justice on the federal and state benches for almost three decades. She has approached her duties as an individual judge, and as a member of the judicial branch as a whole, with care and integrity. Her exemplary life reflects so much of what is good about America. I am honored to call Justice O'Connor a good friend. 
   "Justice O'Connor has been one of the most influential justices in history. She has been the pivotal fifth vote in so many important cases, on both sides of the equation. Justice O'Connor is highly respected, and deservedly so. 
   "The American people are tired of the confrontational partisanship that has characterized the judicial confirmation process in recent years. When President Bush nominates someone to replace Justice O'Connor, the Senate must fulfill its constitutional responsibility to treat the nominee fairly with a full debate on the merits and then an up-or-down vote."
