SEN. HATCH REACTS TO BOOKER/FANFAN DECISION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision today in U.S. v. Booker and U.S. v. Fanfan:  
   "I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Supreme Court today held that sentencing facts in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that increase a defendant's maximum sentence must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   "Let me say, however, that I appreciate and commend the Court for giving strong consideration to an amicus brief that I filed with two of my colleagues in the Senate. It is clear from Justice Breyer's remedy portion of the majority opinion that the Court gave careful consideration to our views prior to issuing its interim remedy of advisory guidelines. 
   "The Court's opinion is more than 100 pages long and obviously will take some time for all of us to review carefully. It is too soon to say whether the Court's interim advisory guidelines will be appropriate in the long run or whether it will simply take us back to the sentencing regime in place prior to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. 
   "In fact, as the Court recognized, the ball is now in Congress' court. We will need to examine our options carefully in light of Booker/Fanfan. I look forward to working with my colleagues to find the most appropriate legislative response."
