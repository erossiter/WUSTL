SEN. HATCH: REPORT GIVES FRESH LOOK AT DIFFICULT SITUATION
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after the release of a report prepared by the Iraq Study Group:  
 "We clearly needed a fresh look at a very difficult situation, and I'm looking forward to reading the report in detail. This is the first of several reports - including proposals being developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council - that will give the Administration new ideas on how we can obtain our goals in Iraq. 
 "We will soon have a new Secretary of Defense, and Dr. Gates affirmed yesterday he is going to look at all the options. In all the years I have known him, Dr. Gates has always impressed me. He is a pragmatist who is committed to finding the best way to succeed in Iraq. 
 "I want to commend the Iraq Study Group for working in such a bipartisan manner. My fear is that partisans in Congress will use this one proposal to arm-chair quarterback the President and his policies, rather than work together to complete our mission."
