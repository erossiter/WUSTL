IRAQIS SAFER WITHOUT AL-ZARQAWI - A 'HATED GANGSTER'
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement on the death of terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi:  
   "This was a very good day for the Iraqi people, for our coalition in Iraq, and for our fight in the global war on terror," Hatch said. "Zarqawi was a hated gangster who fueled the sectarian violence in Iraq. He killed thousands of Iraqi civilians, for the sole reason of thwarting the Iraqi people's efforts to form a stable government and live in peace. 
   "Just based on what I've read, this operation had to have been a joint operation. The Iraqi people and their forces have been working closely with us to track down Zarqawi. It's a victory for them, as it is for us."
