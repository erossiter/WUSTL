SEN. HATCH REINTRODUCES RICHFIELD AIRPORT BILL
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced legislation today that paves the way to expand the Richfield Municipal Airport while providing the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah with money for economic development.  
   "This bill solves the dilemma that Richfield faces making its airport meet the needs of those in southwestern Utah," Hatch said. "At the same time, the measure will help the Paiute Tribe acquire land with greater development potential to help boost its local economy." 
   Hatch's bill, the Paiute Indian Land Conveyance Act of 2005, gives the Secretary of the Interior the authority to transfer three small acres of Paiute trust land to Richfield, Utah, at fair market value. Hatch sponsored similar legislation last Congress, which had passed the House and was close to passing the Senate when then-Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) held it up. 
   "This bill is a win-win for all involved," Hatch stated. "I was disappointed when we couldn't get this measure passed in the last hours of the 108th Congress, and I will do everything I can to get this bill sent to the President for his signature as soon as possible." 
   Originally purchased in 1974 by the non-profit Utah Paiute Tribal Corporation, the land was placed into trust by the Paiute Indian Tribe Restoration Act of 1980, legislation sponsored by Hatch that restored the Paiute Indian Tribe and established a federal trust relationship. The land has gone unused for more than 20 years, and the Tribe readily accepted Richfield's offer to purchase the land to expand its airport. Approval by Congress is the last step necessary to finalize the purchase.
