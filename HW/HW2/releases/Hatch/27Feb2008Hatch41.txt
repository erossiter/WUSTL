SEN. HATCH REACTS TO PASSING OF CONSERVATIVE ICON BUCKLEY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement today upon news of the passing of William F. Buckley, the conservative icon and political commentator whose eloquence and erudition were legendary.  
   Excerpts are as follows: 
   "As someone who knew Bill, as someone who admired Bill, and as someone who learned a great deal from Bill, I would be remiss if I did not say a few words about this extraordinary man and his extraordinary life." 
   "The life of William F. Buckley Jr. reads like something from one of his many fiction novels. Simply put, there was no conservative movement until William F. Buckley Jr. and the [National Review] magazine he founded and cultivated." 
   "By 1980, these conservative ideas had become a majority, one that put Ronal Reagan in the White House." 
   "Bill was no doubt combative, but I think most would say he was always having fun 
  He was a real intellectual, but no dour academic." 
   "When he made his longshot run for mayor of New York City and was asked what he would do if he won, he responded, 'Demand a recount.' " 
   "I loved the man. He made us a better country. He was a great American who led a great American life, and America will miss him. He had an enormous influence on me." 
   "I want to offer my condolences to the Buckley family, all of you, and Bill, are in [our] prayers." 
   "This senator from Utah will miss him deeply."
