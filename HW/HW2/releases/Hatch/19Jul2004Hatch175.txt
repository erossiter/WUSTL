SENATE APPROVES DESIGNATION OF HANSEN BUILDING
  The U.S. Senate approved Monday a bill to name an Ogden federal building for James V. Hansen, the former congressman from Utah's First District.  
   "The name of Jim Hansen will bring a level of trust, a level of fairness, and a level of understanding to all who enter this building," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). "His name will continue to be synonymous with excellence in public service in Utah." 
   The measure, which has already been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, was passed by unanimous consent Monday evening. It will designate the federal building at 324 Twenty-Fifth Street in Ogden as the James V. Hansen Federal Building. 
   "Over the course of his life, Congressman Hansen has built a reputation as a decent, common-sense, hard-working public servant," Hatch said. "He is respected by members on both sides of the aisle as a straightforward, rational lawmaker who works hard to reach sensible solutions." Hansen served as Chairman of the House Resources Committee and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee when he retired in 2002.
