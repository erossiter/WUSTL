INTEL REFORM PASSES SENATE
  The United States Senate approved overwhelmingly tonight by a 96 to 2 vote a bill to overhaul the nation's intelligence agencies. Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a senior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement: 
   "This is a good start, but let's be realistic - this bill has to be the beginning, not the end of reform. A piece of legislation will not provide greater security, in and of itself. 
   "We have created a new structure in the intelligence community, and that's important. But real reform will come when we have strengthened our ability to understand, penetrate, co-opt and neutralize the threat of armed groups such as Al-Qaeda. Giving greater authority and flexibility to a new National Intelligence Director will help, but only if he uses them to develop a new strategy that gets better results. 
   "I strongly believe that Al-Qaeda will be defeated in the coming years. But a realistic analysis of the world we live in today should remind us that, even when Al-Qaeda is defeated, we will still face the threat of other armed groups. Nations that have developed a strategic advantage to understand, penetrate, co-opt and, when necessary, destroy armed groups will better protect their national security. I expect this legislation restructuring our community will enhance its ability to respond to the threats of today and tomorrow, and I dedicate myself to continued oversight to ensure that this will be the case. 
   "I wish to commend my colleagues on the Senate Government Affairs Committee, particularly Chairman Collins and Ranking Minority Member Lieberman, for shepherding a very complex bill to its passage today."
