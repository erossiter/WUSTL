SEN. HATCH URGES SENATE TO PASS STEM CELL BILL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) joined the Coalition for Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR) for a press conference with patients and the Senate sponsors of the stem cell research bill H.R. 810, to highlight the one-year anniversary of the House vote on H.R. 810 and to urge Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) to bring the bill up for a vote.  
   The focus for the event is the effect just one year has had on patients, and CAMR lined up patients to speak on how stem cell research could alleviate their medical problems, such as Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries.

  for the 
  Stem Cell Press Conference 
  May 24, 2006
   I want to thank everyone who has spoken today for sharing their experiences with us. 
   Their message is clear: Patients are waiting. 
   And there's no need for them to wait any longer. It's high time for the Senate to act. 
   This research can save lives, and we need to expand the number of stem cell lines derived from embryos voluntarily donated after they are no longer needed for fertility treatment. This will help our nation's top researchers move forward in dramatic ways to try to find treatments for the millions of people that are waiting for cures. 
   Now is the time to for all of us to come together and get this passed so we can move forward with this potentially life-saving research. 
   Patients are waiting. They have already waited too long. It is time for us to vote.
