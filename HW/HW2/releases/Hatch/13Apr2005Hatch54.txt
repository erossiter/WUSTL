SEN. HATCH: UTAH MUST BE ALLOWED TO BAN NET GAMBLING
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today urged President Bush's nominee to be the next U.S. Trade Representative, Rep.  
 Rob Portman (R-Ohio), to improve the negotiation and litigation record of the U.S. in World Trade Organization (WTO) cases, especially in light of a recent ruling that said the U.S. and states like Utah may not outlaw Internet gambling. 
   "If the WTO system is to work in benefitting all involved, we can't be forced to bow to the wishes of some obscure island nation and allow our citizens to gamble over the Internet," said Hatch. "It is difficult enough to keep kids away from the lure of easy money. We simply cannot allow other countries to circumvent U.S. and Utah state gambling laws." 
   A WTO Dispute Resolution Panel recently ruled that the U.S. cannot block other countries from providing gambling over the Internet to U.S. residents, even in states like Utah where gambling is illegal. The Carribean island nation of Antigua had contested the U.S. policy before the WTO. 
   "It's a big concern when the U.S. loses cases like this before the WTO, and unfortunately, it seems to be happening with alarming regularity," said Hatch. "I told Rep. Portman that this is a major problem, and he agreed with me and said it would be a top priority for him should he be confirmed." 
   Hatch also expressed his concern to Portman over other WTO cases, including one in which a WTO panel ruled against the U.S. and in favor of the South Korean government's attempts to subsidize computer memory chip production, which could affect Utah chip manufacturers.
