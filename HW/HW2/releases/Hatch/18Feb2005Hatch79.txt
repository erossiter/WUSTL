NATIONWIDE AMBER ALERT SYSTEM VITAL TOOL TO PROTECT CHILDREN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) commended the Department of Justice (DOJ) for expanding the AMBER Alert system in all 50 states.  
 Hatch was a principal sponsor of legislation to create this nationwide network for the child-abduction alert system, and yesterday DOJ announced that Hawaii became the final state to finalize its AMBER Alert plan. 
   "The AMBER Alert system is a critical tool that helps to protect our nation's most vulnerable children," Hatch said. "We have seen several successful examples already of this program in Utah and other states in bringing children safety back home to their parents. Now that every state a system in place, communities across America can work together to search for and recover missing children."
