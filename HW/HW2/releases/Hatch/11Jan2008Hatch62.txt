SEN. HATCH: ARMY RESERVE STATIONING NATIONAL COMMAND IN UTAH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced that the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) is relocating to Utah its Readiness Command headquarters, which supplies leadership, training, and deployment oversight to Army Reserve units across the country.  
   "Stationing the Readiness Command here will allow Utahns in the Reserve to continue to make great contributions to national security," Hatch said. "The command will provide guidance and support to units across the country with day-to-day operations and training. The Army Reserve answers the nation's call to serve, and I know that Utah members will continue to fulfill this calling spectacularly." 
   The Readiness Command, currently stationed in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, will be operational in Utah by October 1, 2008. As the USAR's 96th Regional Readiness Command already in Fort Douglas, Utah, is slated to be disestablished by the next round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the national command will move into the 96th's office space and provide continuity for Army Reserve personnel in the area. Moreover, the new Readiness Command will provide advancement opportunities for both officers and enlisted personnel within the Army Reserve. 
   "Having the Readiness Command in Utah will give our Army Reservists the chance to stay in uniform and continue their careers up the chain of command," Hatch said. "Without an opportunity like this, it would be more difficult for Utah Reservists to continue their service and achieve higher positions in the military hierarchy. This is a great win for Utah."
