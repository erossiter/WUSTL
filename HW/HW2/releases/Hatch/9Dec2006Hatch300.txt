CONGRESS PASSES SEN. HATCH'S SUPPLEMENT AER BILL
  In the last vote of the 109th Congress, the House of Representatives gave final approval to legislation that would require manufactures to notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of all serious adverse events for dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. Authored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), and sponsored by Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) in the House, the legislation is expected to be signed into law by the President.  
   "This bill strikes the right balance between necessary regulation and over-regulation," Hatch said. "This new legislation complements the 1994 supplement law I authored by providing Federal authorities with an additional tool to identify when serious problems occur. At the same time, Hatch insisted the law not restrict consumers' access to supplements." 
   The bill, S. 3546, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, would require manufacturers, packers or distributors of OTC drugs or dietary supplements in the United States to tell the FDA within 15 business days any reports of a serious adverse event associated with their products. Serious events include those that result in death, a life-threatening experience, inpatient hospitalization, disability or incapacity, birth defect, or medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of these outcomes. 
   "Nearly 60 percent of Americans regularly use dietary supplements to maintain or improve their healthy lifestyles," Hatch said. "They have benefited from a growing, vibrant supplement industry. This bill is the right thing to for a responsible industry to do for consumers. They should have the confidence that a significant mishap reported to a company will be taken seriously, and that the government will take it seriously too."
