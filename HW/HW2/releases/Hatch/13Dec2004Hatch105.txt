SEN. HATCH: LEAVITT WILL BRING COMPETENCE, COMPASSION TO HHS DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today lauded President Bush's nomination of EPA Chief and former Utah Gov.  
 Michael O. Leavitt to be the new Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
   "Mike Leavitt will bring competence and compassion to the people's agency. This nomination is great news for Utah and for our nation. 
   "President Bush could not have selected a better person to meet the challenges HHS faces. Mike is a proven leader and a top-notch administrator. He is bright and intelligent, and he works well with all sides. We saw this time and time again in Utah with Mike Leavitt's unparalleled leadership on issues like Medicaid, welfare, and especially child health and Indian health. 
   "There is no question that Health and Human Services is going to face numerous challenges in the coming years - including implementing the new Medicare prescription drug program, restraining Medicaid's growth while maintaining its safety net, keeping a high level of support for biomedical research, ensuring an adequate supply of vaccines, making sure prescription drugs are safe and affordable, and implementing welfare reforms. 
   "Mike is simply one of the best leaders I've ever known. With health and human services issues so important to America, Mike's unique combination of steadiness and vision will be just the right prescription for this critical post."
