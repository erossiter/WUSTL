SEN. HATCH: SUPPORTING CHIP IS MORALLY RIGHT THING TO DO
  Sen. Hatch expresses regret that Pres. Bush vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization bill. With him, left to right, are Senators Reid, Baucus, Grassley, and Rockefeller.  
   Washington - Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today responded to President Bush's official veto of plans to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which covers children whose parents make too much for Medicaid, but not enough for private insurance. Hatch was part of a bipartisan coalition on the Senate Finance Committee that crafted a compromise to continue CHIP for the 6.6 million children currently in the program, and expand it by $35 billion over five years to extend coverage to nearly four million more low-income, uninsured children. 
   "For 10 years, CHIP has worked remarkably well in helping children who otherwise would not get the medicine and doctor visits they need to grow up strong. I know that the President wants to provide health care for low-income children, as he did with CHIP when he was governor in Texas. I regret that this has become a political battle. Unfortunately, I believe that some have given the President bad advice on this matter, because I believe that supporting this bipartisan compromise to provide health coverage to low-income children is the morally right thing to do. I hope that we can muster enough votes to overturn this veto."
