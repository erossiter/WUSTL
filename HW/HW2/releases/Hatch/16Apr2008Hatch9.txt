SEN. HATCH WELCOMES POPE BENEDICT TO AMERICA
  Senator Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement to welcome Pope Benedict XVI to America. 
   "Pope Benedict's first trip to the United States is a historic occasion," Hatch said. "In a world too often rent by division and bitterness, millions of Americans have discovered in Pope Benedict's ministry a renewed witness to the power of hope and love to cultivate peace in this world. I wish His Holiness success in rekindling hearts to faith in a world that grows cold to decency.
   "On behalf of all Utahns, I want to thank the pontiff for his worldwide and ecumenical humanitarian efforts, as well as his powerful testament to the value and inherent dignity of all persons. The Catholic Church has played an important role in Utah's history: Catholic priests first set foot in Utah in 1776, the first Catholic Church was built in 1871, before Utah was even a state, and today Catholicism is the second-largest denomination in Utah."
