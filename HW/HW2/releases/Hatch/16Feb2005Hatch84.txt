SEN. HATCH PRESSES AGRICULTURE CHIEF FOR FLOOD AID
 In a visit with newly installed Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today delivered a letter requesting assistance in securing Administration support for including aid to Washington and Iron Counties in the Tsunami Supplemental Flooding bill that the President requested of Congress. 
   "If we have a billion dollars for flood victims in Southeast Asia," Hatch said, "we should be able to find several million to aid and protect our own."
