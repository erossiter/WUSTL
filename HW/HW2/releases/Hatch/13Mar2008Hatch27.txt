SENATE APPROVES SEN. HATCH'S TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AMENDMENT
  The Senate Thursday unanimously approved an amendment to the 2009 Fiscal Year Budget Resolution to allocate $9 million for the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) program.  
   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), sponsor of the amendment, said the federal TBI program was too valuable not to fund. The program, which Hatch and Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) helped create in 1996, was not covered under the president's Fiscal Year 2009 budget proposal. 
   "This is the only program that exists to help this vulnerable population," Hatch said. "It is a relatively small program, budget-wise; but that should not be a reason to ignore its significance or to let it fall by the wayside." 
   Hatch said TBI is a "silent epidemic" that can strike anyone of any age without warning. 
   "It is defined as brain damage from externally inflicted trauma to the head resulting in significant impairment to an individual's physical, psychosocial and cognitive functional abilities," he said. "TBI may also be caused by explosives, and medical experts have described it as the signature wound of the Iraq war. Up to two-thirds of injuries in the Iraq war may be brain injuries." 
   The TBI program comprises surveillance and research activities at the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health, as well as grants through the Health Resources and Services Administration to fund state demonstration products to improve access to health and other services, and for protection and advocacy systems.
