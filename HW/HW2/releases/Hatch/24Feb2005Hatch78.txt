SEN. HATCH DISAPPOINTED, NOT SURPRISED BY NRC DECISION
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) expressed his disappointment at today's decision against Utah's concerns for storing high-level nuclear waste at Skull Valley.  
 Earlier today, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rejected the State of Utah's assertions that the above-ground Skull Valley site is too risky because 7,000 overflights occur each year over the site by armed F-16 single-engine jets from Hill Air Force Base for bombing runs at the Utah Test and Training Range. 
   "I strongly disagree with the Board's decision, but to be honest I expected it to go this way," Hatch said. "There seems to be a bias within the NRC in favor of the nuclear industry on this issue, and we have already set our sights on other ways to stop this plan." 
   With the Licensing Board's role now completed, the determination whether to issue the requested license now goes to the five Commissioners who head the NRC, who will also hear any appeals. A summary of today's decision may be obtained from the NRC's web site at http://www.nrc.gov/what-we-do/regulatory/adjudicatory/pfs-aircraft05.pdf.
