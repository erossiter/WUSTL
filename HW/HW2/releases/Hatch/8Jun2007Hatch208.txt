SEN. HATCH: DON'T END IMMIGRATION DEBATE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after voting against cutting off debate on comprehensive immigration reform late Thursday night: 
   "I couldn't support the bill the sponsors tried to force through last night. The good in it was completely overshadowed by its glaring flaws. Some of its provisions are unworkable and ineffective. And most people believe it is far too lenient on those who broke the law to get here, and we must be fair to those who are in the process of immigrating the right way.
   "That doesn't mean the status quo is acceptable. It isn't! Our borders must be secured through capable and workable enforcement practices. A limited guest worker program must be created for our American - and specifically Utah - businesses in need of foreign workers. I believe we can find a fair, compassionate and lawful way to deal with the illegal immigrants already in this country, most of whom are decent, hard-working people. And for any immigration system to work, we must distribute visas and green cards in a more fair and efficient way.
   "Our immigration problems have been dramatically increasing over the course of more than two decades. It will take more than the week and a half the Democratic leadership allowed to pass a bill, since we have such a wide array of views in the Senate. We should not quit trying to solve these problems, and we need more time to reach a consensus that Utahns and people throughout America could accept."
