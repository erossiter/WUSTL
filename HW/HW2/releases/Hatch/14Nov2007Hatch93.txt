THREE UTAH COUNTIES ELIGIBLE FOR FARM SERVICE AGENCY EMERGENCY LOANS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has designated Rich, Summit, and Daggett counties as qualifying for agriculture disaster assistance, putting them under consideration for low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) due to drought. FSA will consider each application on its own merit by taking into account the extent of the losses, security available, and repayment ability. Local FSA offices can provide affected farmers with further information.  
   "I appreciate the Department of Agriculture's swift action in granting disaster designation to these three north-eastern Utah counties," Hatch said. "Utah is the second driest state in the country, and when a severe drought hits, it's vital that our farmers have access to emergency loans." 
   Severe drought losses also spurred 11 Wyoming counties to request disaster designation from the USDA. The remaining counties in Wyoming, as well as counties in Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota have received contiguous disaster county designations. This means that farm operators, meeting eligibility requirements, in these counties will be considered for emergency loans through FSA.
