SEN. HATCH: PORNOGRAPHY IS NOT FREE SPEECH
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today decried attempts to cloak obscene materials as free speech, affirming that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and is a toxin that pollutes our society.  
   "The First Amendment is not an altar on which we must sacrifice our children, families, and community standards," Hatch said in a Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee hearing on obscenity prosecution. "The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment at all." 
   "Those who produce and distribute obscene material profit from the abuse and degradation of others," Hatch continued. "This material can be very addictive and harmful. It pollutes our culture, and technological developments such as the Internet make spreading that pollution easier than ever. Demanding that the federal government aggressively, consistently, and fairly enforce these statutes is simply an effort to protect basic human dignity." 
   Today's hearing centered on a recent court decision that struck down federal obscenity laws by inventing a previously unknown right, a mutated version of what he called "a right to sexual privacy" that is not in the Constitution and has no legal precedent. 
   "The material in this case is at the extreme fringe of obscenity - the worst of the worst," Hatch said. "I understand the films they produced depict rape, torture, and murder. Women in these films are actually, physically beaten. I was stunned when the judge used this case to strike down federal obscenity laws."
