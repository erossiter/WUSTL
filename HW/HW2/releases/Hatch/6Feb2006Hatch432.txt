UTAH LAW REVIEW PUBLISHES SEN. HATCH ON FILIBUSTERS
 Sen. Hatch has always believed that the filibuster, or extended debate, is an important part of the legislative process, but has no place in the judicial confirmation process.  
 Since he was first elected, the Senate has voted on 37 motions to end debate on judicial nominations. Sen. Hatch not only voted to end debate all 37 times, on both Democratic and Republican nominees, but has actively participated in the ongoing debate over this important issue. 
   During the Clinton administration, when he chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch denounced judicial nomination filibusters on the Senate floor, calling them a "travesty" and urging his fellow Senators to oppose them. In 2005, with a Republican in the White House, Senator Hatch gave a series of major Senate floor speeches outlining why judicial nomination filibusters were unprecedented, unfair, and unconstitutional. 
   Senator Hatch has also published columns in national print and on-line publications on the subject. In January 2006, the Utah Law Review published Senator Hatch's extensive analysis of judicial nomination filibusters. This scholarly article both analyzed the political and constitutional issues raised by the filibusters themselves and placed the filibusters within the broader context of the debate over judicial appointments and judicial power. This article, which outlines both the cause and the cure for this crisis, can be found below.
