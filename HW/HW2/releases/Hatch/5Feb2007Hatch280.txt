SEN. HATCH PROMOTES SANDGREN TO COUNSEL ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced he has promoted Matthew Sandgren to the position of counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. A former legislative assistant, Sandgren will now advise the Senator on immigration, intellectual property, and pharmaceutical-related legislation.  
   "Matt is very valuable part of my team, a real credit to the people of Utah," Hatch said. "He has a wealth of experience, and I was eager to promote him to my Judiciary Committee staff. He's a committed public servant, and I anticipate more great work from him for Utah and this country." 
   A member of the Utah State Bar, Sandgren earned a Juris Doctor degree from The University of Tulsa College of Law and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree from The George Washington University Law School. He clerked with Holstein, Taylor, Unitt & Law in Riverside, Calif., and has authored a number of publications in legal reviews. Sandgren previously advised Hatch on labor, small business, U.S. Census, and transportation issues. 
   "I've always enjoyed the fast pace of Sen. Hatch and his staff," Sandgren said. "The Capitol Hill environment is one of the most thrilling I've ever been in, and I appreciate the opportunity to work with those people who are shaping public policy for their fellow citizens. I look forward to broadening my legal portfolio with the responsibilities Sen. Hatch has entrusted me." 
   Sandgren is a native of Provo, Utah, and earned his bachelor's degree at Brigham Young University. He is married to Kamae Bradburn Sandgren.
