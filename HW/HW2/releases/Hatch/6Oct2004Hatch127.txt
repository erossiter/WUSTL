SENATE PASSES SENS. BIDEN-HATCH'S BILL TO BAN DESIGNER STEROIDS
  Tonight the United States Senate unanimously approved legislation sponsored by Sen.  
 Joe Biden (D-Del.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that closes the loophole allowing the sale of steroid precursors, which show little effective difference from illegal steroids. 
   "Steroid products are dangerous," Hatch said. "They hurt the public health. They are giving sports a black eye, and they endanger kids. So, it's a no-brainer that outlawing steroid lookalikes will protect the public health." 
   The bill, S. 2195, gives the Drug Enforcement Agency the authority to add androstenedione (also known as "andro"), tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), and other steroid precursors to the list of anabolic steroids that are classified as Schedule III controlled substances. 
   "To me, it should be simple: If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck - it's a duck," Hatch said. "Under this bill, clever chemists will no longer be able to dodge the law by disguising their chemicals to skirt the legal definition of a steroid. Our bill gives DEA the power to schedule nearly any steroid precursor now or in the future - giving the law flexibility so we don't have to play catch-up with every new andro look-alike that comes along." 
   The bill is strongly supported by a broad cross-section of the medical and sports communities, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, National Football League, National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League. The legislation also has the strong support of government enforcement agencies that are responsible for protecting our youth from dangerous substances.
