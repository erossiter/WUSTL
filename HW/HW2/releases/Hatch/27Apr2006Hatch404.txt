SEN. HATCH: CAREFUL REVIEW OF DATA NEEDED TO DETERMINE SAFETY OF NEVADA TEST
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after receiving a detailed briefing by his top military and nuclear policy aides. The aides returned from an on-site visit Wednesday to the designated site for a proposed large-scale, open-air explosive detonation scheduled for June 2 in Nevada.  
   "I don't want any testing to harm Utahns again, and I'm still concerned about a bomb test so near to past nuclear test sites. We asked some tough questions about the safety of the upcoming test, and, for the most part, it appears the government had good answers. 
   "But I'm skeptical about taking the word of test officials, given what happened during the last nuclear tests. We've found inconsistencies in the draft environmental assessment, and we asked to see the data they are using so we can go over it with a fine-toothed comb. We'll also take a look at some outside data and expertise, too, before deciding if this test can be conducted safely. 
   "After our briefing, I'm not confident the public has enough information about this. Today, I'm asking the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Department of Energy to provide a thorough public briefing to my constituents in Southern Utah so they have full knowledge of what will take place should this test go forward. My staff learned safety details from test officials that could have helped the public if they had been released long ago, and the good people downwind of the site need to hear them."
