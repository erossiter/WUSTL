SEN. HATCH: CHEMICAL WEAPONS SHOULD NOT CROSS STATE LINES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) joined efforts to ensure virulent chemical weapons stockpiles remain out of Utah.  
 Hatch cosponsored S. 186, a measure by Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) to block funding a Department of Defense study to ship chemical weapons from Army depots in Colorado to Utah's Deseret Chemical Depot in Tooele County. 
   "Transporting these weapons across state lines is illegal, and rightly so," Hatch said. "These are volatile, deadly chemicals that would pass right through highly populated areas in Utah, and there's no way we could guarantee their safety." 
   The Department of Defense is contemplating changing its policy of destroying chemical weapons where they are currently stored. Currently, Deseret Chemical Depot is one of eight Army installations that stores chemical weapons and has been steadily working to meet its goal to destroy all its munitions by 2012. 
   "These weapons are safe and contained where they are," said Hatch, "and we are on target to eliminate them completely without placing our communities at risk."
