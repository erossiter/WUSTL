SENATE HOPES TO 'FEED AMERICA THURSDAY' ON NOV. 15
  The U.S. Senate has designated today, the Thursday before Thanksgiving, as "Feed America Thursday," on which all Americans are encouraged to sacrifice two meals and to donate to charity the money they would have spent on food. The Senate resolution to "Feed America Thursday" was sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah).  
   "It is simply inexcusable that, in the most prosperous nation on Earth, so many children go to bed hungry at night," Hatch said. "While there are often disputes as to how we should address these problems, I believe there are steps that every American can take to help those in need." 
   According to the Department of Agriculture's most recent numbers, roughly 35 million Americans, including 12 million children, live in households that do not have an adequate supply of food. Hatch hopes this nationwide effort, promoted by a number of charitable organizations, will foster a greater spirit of selflessness and sacrifice to help those in need. This is the sixth year the Senate has passed Hatch's resolution, which was cosponsored by Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah).
