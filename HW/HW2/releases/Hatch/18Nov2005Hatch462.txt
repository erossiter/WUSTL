SEN. HATCH: RICHFIELD AIRPORT BILL CLEARS CONGRESS
  The United States Senate today approved legislation sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) that paves the way for expanding the Richfield Municipal Airport while providing the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah with money for economic development. The bill is now headed to the President for signature.  
   "This bill is a win-win for all involved," Hatch said. "This solves the dilemma that Richfield faces making its airport meet the needs of those in southwestern Utah. At the same time, the measure will help the Paiute Tribe acquire land with greater development potential to help boost its local economy." 
   The Paiute Indian Land Conveyance Act of 2005 gives the Secretary of the Interior the authority to transfer three acres of Paiute trust land to Richfield, Utah, at fair market value. Hatch and Cannon introduced companion bills in the Senate (S. 623) and the House (H.R. 680), and the measure passed the House of Representatives on March 14. The bill was stalled in the Senate because of Indian gaming concerns, which Hatch successfully addressed and secured the bill's passage through the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Senate floor. 
   "Representative Cannon has been a great leader on this in the House, and we were committed to making this happen for Richfield this year," Hatch said. 
   Originally purchased in 1974 by the non-profit Utah Paiute Tribal Corporation, the land was placed into trust by the Paiute Indian Tribe Restoration Act of 1980, legislation sponsored by Hatch that restored the Paiute Indian Tribe and established a federal trust relationship. The land has gone unused for more than 20 years, and the Tribe has readily accepted Richfield's offer to purchase the land to expand its airport.
