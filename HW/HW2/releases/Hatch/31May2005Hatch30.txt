SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS SEN. HATCH'S RELIGIOUS LIBERTY LEGISLATION
  The U.S. Supreme Court today upheld legislation authored by Sen.  
 Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that requires prisons to give reasonable accommodation to inmates' religious practices. The Court upheld Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) sponsored by Hatch and signed into law in 2000 by President Bill Clinton. 
   "This was a big win today - not just for the devout, but for American society, which benefits from the stability and morality that religious practice brings to our people," said Hatch. "Religion is a critical component of our society, and the Supreme Court recognized that this bill protects religious expression without promoting it." 
   The Court unanimously upheld RLUIPA's prohibition against any government imposing "a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution" without a compelling reason and using the least restrictive means possible. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the ruling upholding RLUIPA's constitutionality in the case, titled Cutter v. Wilkinson. 
   "The free exercise of religion is the heritage of all Americans, and I will continue to defend this fundamental freedom," said Hatch, who co-authored a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.
