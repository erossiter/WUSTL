SEN. HATCH PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS BILL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, praised the Senate's passage of H.R. 4417 which provides a one-year extension of the Oct 26, 2004 deadline for implementation of the biometric passport program among the 27 visa waiver countries.  
   "Implementation of the biometric passport program will be an important resource in our fight against terrorism and we should be vigilant in our efforts to fully implement the program," said Hatch. "However, we are faced with the reality that the biometric passport deadline of October 26, 2004 will not be met." 
   "Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary Tom Ridge requested an extension to the current biometric passport deadline of October 26th, 2004," said Hatch. "Congress carefully evaluated the request in an effort that included a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing." 
   "This legislation is an important example of Congress and the Administration working together to resolve an important issue," concluded Hatch. "We will continue to work together in our mutual commitment to the safety of the American people and our fight against terrorism."
