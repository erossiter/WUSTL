UTAH CRIME VICTIMS OFFICE RECEIVES $2.9 MILLION GRANT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced Utah's Office of Crime Victim Reparations in Salt Lake City has received a $2.9 million grant to aid the recovery of crime victims.  
   "Justice for crime victims means much more than putting criminals behind bars," Hatch said. "Utah's program has helped many victims pay their medical bills, recover lost wages, and receive counseling." 
   The grant is funded through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), which established the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) that oversees state and Federal programs designed to benefit victims of crime. According to the OVC, state compensation programs throughout the nation paid crime victims and their families $455 million in benefits in the federal fiscal year 2003.
