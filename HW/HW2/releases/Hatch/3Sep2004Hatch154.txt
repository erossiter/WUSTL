LOGAN/CACHE AIRPORT RECEIVES $530,000 GRANT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) announced today that the Department of Transportation (DOT) will award a $530,000 grant to the Logan/Cache Airport as part of the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP).  
   "This funding is a vital step in helping Logan and Cache County upgrade the existing airport to attract a commercial carrier to Northern Utah," Hatch said. "Leaders throughout the county have worked tirelessly to get regularly scheduled passenger service to this area, and this money will go a long way in making it a reality." 
   Several thousand small community airports apply for SCASDP funds each year. Despite the intense competition for grant money, the Logan/Cache Airport received the entire amount requested from DOT.
