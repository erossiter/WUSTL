SEN. HATCH: UTAH'S QUEST FOR A FOURTH SEAT PASSES IMPORTANT SENATE HURDLE
  A key Senate committee today overwhelmingly approved a bill that would grant Utah a fourth seat in the House of Representatives. Sponsored by Sens. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007 (S. 1257) cleared the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee by a 9 to 1 vote.  
   "The Senate took an important step today in bringing Utah a fourth seat in Congress," Hatch said. "The broad, bipartisan support for this bill raises my hopes that we'll be able to pass this bill through the full Senate. This was a victory for democracy and a victory for bipartisanship." 
   Today's action in committee was the last step in the legislative process before S. 1257 goes to the Senate floor. The bill will also upgrade the status of the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate in the House to a Representative with full voting privileges. Earlier this year, the House approved similar legislation for Utah and D.C.
