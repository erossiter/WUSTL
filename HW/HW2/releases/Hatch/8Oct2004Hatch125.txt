SEN. HATCH PRAISES HOUSE PASSAGE OF ANTI-ATROCITY ALIEN DEPORTATION ACT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today praised the House of Representatives for passing the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act.  
 This alien enforcement measure was accepted as an amendment to the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Implementation Act (H.R. 10). It permits the deportation of those who commit torture, murder, or obscene violations of religious freedom. 
   "We have a long-standing tradition of offering refuge to many victims of torturous acts abroad," said Hatch. "Thousands of these victims live in the United States today. Yet it is estimated that we also have over a thousand torturers living in our country, some side-by-side with the very victims of their gross offenses. This cannot be tolerated." 
   "This legislation will render those who participate in acts of torture, as well as those foreign government officials who engage in particularly severe violations of religious freedom, inadmissible and deportable - at any time," Hatch continued. "Under this critical legislation, human rights abusers will no longer be able to seek or maintain refuge in our country. Moreover, this legislation broadens the mandate of the Justice Department to investigate, prosecute and remove any alien who has participated in torture and genocide abroad. I applaud my colleagues in the House of Representatives for passing this important piece of legislation today. It is both a critical weapon in the war on terror and a vital step toward reforming an immigration system to include additional enforcement measures." 
   Senator Hatch, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), ranking Democrat member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representatives Mark Foley (R-FL) and Gary Ackerman (D-NY) introduced the bipartisan and bicameral effort March 2003.
