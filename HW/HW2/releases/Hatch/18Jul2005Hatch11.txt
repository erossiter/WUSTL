SEN. HATCH: CRAWFORD HAS VISION TO LEAD FDA THROUGH CRUCIAL PERIOD
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) joined a bipartisan majority in the Senate to confirm Dr.  
 Lester Crawford as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by a vote of 78-16. 
   "Dr. Crawford is a demonstrated leader, someone with a strong knowledge of science and an unwavering commitment to promoting and protecting the public health," Hatch said. "He will be an outstanding commissioner." 
   Hatch visited with Crawford prior to his HELP (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) Committee hearing and expressed his concerns that the FDA improve its processes for reviewing drug applications and ensuring drug safety. The Senator also encouraged Crawford to closely monitor advances in genetics, pharmacology, and related fields that will soon challenge our conventional regulatory approaches. 
   "The FDA is at a crucial juncture in its history, and Dr. Crawford has the vision and expertise to guide the agency through its many responsibilities and challenges," Hatch said. "I know him well, and he is committed to strong regulation and vigorous oversight of our food and drug supplies."
