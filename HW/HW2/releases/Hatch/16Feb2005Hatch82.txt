SEN. HATCH URGES SENATE TO PROTECT AMERICANS FROM GENETIC DISCRIMINATION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) called on the Senate to pass a bipartisan bill he cosponsored that would ban discrimination by employers and insurance providers based on genetic information.  
   "Congress needs to assure Americans their DNA will not be used against them," Hatch said. "We need to be very careful how genetic information is used. No one should avoid genetic tests that could save their lives because they fear they will be denied a job or insurance." 
   "Unfortunately, some people have already been hurt by others knowing their genetic information," Hatch continued. "The fear of discrimination is a big threat not only to improving health now, but it also threatens the future advances in genetic research and technology that are needed to understand, treat, and prevent disease." 
   The measure, S. 306, would prohibit employers from hiring and firing based on genetic information, along with forbidding health insurance plans from denying eligibility or enrollment based on genetic information or charging higher premiums based on the genetic information of individuals or their families. The bill is identical to a bill that passed the Senate unanimously during the 108th Congress, and the Senate is expected to debate the measure this week. 
   This is just one part of a package of reform measures Hatch helped to develop last Congress as a member of a Senate task force on health care and the uninsured. The task force worked to identify a series of proposals - based on the sound principles of increased choice, competition, and fiscal responsibility - for improving care, controlling costs, and providing health care to more Americans.
