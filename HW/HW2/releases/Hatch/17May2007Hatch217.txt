SEN. HATCH REACTS TO IMMIGRATION DEAL
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today made the following statement about the proposed comprehensive immigration bill that will be considered by the Senate next week: 
   "It's encouraging to have a bipartisan breakthrough on immigration. But it's a big bill - well over 1,000 pages. I need to look at it carefully, talk to Utahns, and get their views on this complex proposal before deciding whether to oppose or support it."
