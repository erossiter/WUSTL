SEN. HATCH RETURNS TO WASHINGTON FOR HEARINGS ON 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Republican on the Select Committee on Intelligence, returned to Washington from Utah this week for hearings in each committee regarding the 9/11 Commission Report.  
 Congress is in recess until September 7, 2004. 
   "I requested that the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee return to Washington during the Congressional recess because the discussion of the portions of the 9/11 Commission's Report and recommendations that relate to areas under our jurisdiction such as border security and the role of the FBI in the field of counterintelligence are too important to put on hold until next month," said Hatch. 
   As chairman, Senator Hatch keeps a busy schedule of hearings spanning the committee's wide jurisdiction. The past three years have included many hearings on terrorism and national security in the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, 2001. 
   Tomorrow, Friday, August 20, 2004, Chairman Hatch will preside over a field hearing in Salt Lake City, Utah on "The Medical Liability Crisis and its Impact on Patient Care."
