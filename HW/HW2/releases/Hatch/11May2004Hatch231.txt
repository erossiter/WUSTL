KEY SEN. HATCH PROVISIONS PASS SENATE IN TAX BILL
  The U.S. Senate passed today critical legislation that makes corrections to U.S. tax laws in order to bring them in line with international trade rules.  
 Several provisions authored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) were in the bill, including: the CLEAR Act, which encourages consumers to purchase advanced technology automobiles (such as hybrid electric vehicles), alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles; an extension of the Research Tax Credit, which expires next month, and is designed to spur investment in research-related jobs; and a provision to bring fairness in taxation to the American archery industry, which employs more than 500 Utahns.
   "This was a must-pass bill," said Hatch. "American exports are being hit with increasing trade sanctions by the Europeans. I'm very pleased that we finally overcame the delays by a minority of senators and got this bill through. I have also worked very hard for years to get the CLEAR ACT enacted into law, which will do more to move us toward energy independence and cleaner air than any legislation ever offered in this country."
