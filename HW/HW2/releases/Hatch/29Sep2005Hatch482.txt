SEN. HATCH: SENATE WISELY CONFIRMS ROBERTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today made the following statement on the Senate's 78-22 vote to confirm Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States:  
   "I predict John Roberts will be one of the great Chief Justices in our nation's history. This vote should have been 100-0. But 78 senators applied the right standard in evaluating a judicial nominee - a non-political standard - and that's a good sign. 
   "I hope more of my fellow senators will approach the next nomination with a greater appreciation for the non-political nature of the judiciary. The opposition to Judge Roberts has been purely political."
