BANKRUPTCY REFORM SIGNED INTO LAW
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) was at the White House today as President George W. Bush signed landmark bankruptcy reform legislation into law. Today's action marked the first major reform in bankruptcy laws in more than 25 years.  
   "This law strikes a necessary balance between holding people accountable for their debts and not overtly punishing those who come into difficult circumstances," said Hatch, who played a major role negotiating the legislation in Congress. "The underlying idea is simple - if you can pay, then you should pay. Too many people have abused the system in the past, and everyone else had to shoulder their debt for them. Now we have a law that encourages people to put their financial houses in order" 
   Among several provisions, S.256, The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, establishes a means test to determine which debtors filing for bankruptcy can afford to pay back some of their debt and which cannot. 
   "I know some people are concerned about how this law might hurt those who truly cannot pay their debt," Hatch said. "Let me be clear - no one should be harmed because of a catastrophic medical condition or an unexpected military deployment. When all is said and done, it is estimated the means test will exempt close to 90 percent of debtors from repaying their debt. So who's left? Those who can afford to pay at least some of their debts, and this law makes sure they do. That's only fair, and fairness is what this legislation is all about."
