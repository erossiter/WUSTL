SEN. HATCH INTRODUCES BOY SCOUT LAND EXCHANGE BILL
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today introduced the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Land Transfer Act of 2005. Sen.  
 Hatch's bill will allow the exchange of two small parcels of land between the BSA Utah National Parks Council and Brian Head Ski Resort. 
   "The Boy Scouts have a long tradition of instilling strong values in young men, and this small land exchange will allow them to more fully help these young men learn and grow," Hatch said. "The Scouts have been working for more than 20 years to get this land so they can improve their camp. With this land transfer, the Scouts will be able to increase the safety of their rifle and archery ranges and provide access to flatter ground for camps." 
   In 1983, the Bureau of Land Management gave the BSA roughly 1,300 acres near Parowan, Utah, for a Boy Scout camp. Under the agreement, land cannot be sold or exchanged without Congressional action. Hatch's bill would allow the BSA to give 120 acres on the south end of the camp to Brian Head in exchange for 120 acres on the eastern side of the camp, including 40 acres inside the camp's boundaries. 
   "This is a great move for both parties," Hatch said.
