SEN. HATCH PROMOTES JOHNSON TO POSITION OF LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced he has promoted Jacob Johnson to the position of Legislative Assistant on his personal staff. Johnson will help the Senator implement his agenda on a variety issues, including transportation, housing, small business, commerce, and Indian affairs.  
   "I appreciate everything Jacob has done for me, and I'm looking forward to what he'll do in this new position," Hatch said. "Jacob is a hard worker and has an extensive knowledge of Utah issues. Utahns can be proud of the job he's doing to help their state." 
   Johnson started working for Hatch as an intern in 2002. He became a staff assistant for Hatch when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, then came to the Senator's personal staff as a legislative correspondent, then legislative aide. In his service, Johnson has met with constituents and others on Hatch's behalf, helped draft speeches and press statements, and prepared the Senator for hearings and meetings. 
   "The last five years with Sen. Hatch have been exhilarating, and I'm excited about the new responsibilities he's given me," Johnson said. "It might sound a little corny, but I really do love serving this country and helping my fellow Utahns. I miss the mountains and the deserts, but Sen. Hatch's office makes a nice home away from home." 
   Johnson graduated in 2001 from Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah, with a degree in business management. Originally from Castle Dale, Utah, Johnson and his wife, Susan, are expecting their first child later this year.
