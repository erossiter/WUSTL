SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES THREE TRANSPORTATION GRANTS FOR UTAH NATIONAL PARKS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) will award three grants to Arches and Zion National Parks, totaling more than $1 million, for critical Alternative Transportation in Parks and Public Lands (ATPPL) projects.  
   "Our state's natural beauty has long drawn Utahns and tourists alike to its many National Parks," Hatch said. "By providing equal access and visitor accessibility to these areas while conserving their natural, historical, and cultural resources, Utah's visitors and residents will be able to enjoy fully Utah's wilderness. I congratulate the staff of Arches and Zion for winning these grants." 
   These grants will provide funding to plan, expand, and construct much-needed alternative transportation projects: $774,000 was awarded to the Bureau of Land Management Moab Field office, Arches National Park to construct a transit hub on the north end of Moab; $151,000 was awarded to Zion National Park to expand the visitor center shuttle-bus stop; and $150,000 was awarded to Zion National Park to fund a shuttle-service planning study. 
   The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) appropriations for the Alternative Transportation in Parks and Public Lands are authorized by Section 3021 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act. 
   The program's goals are to promote and maintain natural, historical and cultural resources; cut back on congestion and pollution; improve tourism accessibility and experience; and ensure access to everyone, including persons with disabilities.
