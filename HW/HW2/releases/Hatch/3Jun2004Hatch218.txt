SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON TENET RESIGNATION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) had the following comment on the resignation of George Tenet as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency: 
   "I have just learned of Director Tenet's resignation. George did not discuss this with me prior to his announcement, so I know no details of his decision, and accept his reasons.
   "I have known George Tenet for a long time, since he was a staff member on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in the 1980s, rising to staff director under David Boren. I supported his nomination to Director of Central Intelligence in 1997.
   "I know from working with him as DCI that George Tenet was one of the first people in Washington to take seriously the threat of Al-Qaeda. During his tenure, we were attacked, and we responded, and the CIA led in many of our initial responses. When the dust settles, I think people will recognize the many contributions George Tenet made to the war on terror. I understand why the President had confidence in him."
