SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES TWO-STAR GENERAL STAYING AT HILL
  Senior Air Force officials confirmed to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today that the Secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force Chief of Staff had rejected a proposal to eliminate the two-star commanding officer positions at the nation's Air Logistics Centers, including Hill Air Force Base. Under this discarded plan, the wing commanders at Hill would have reported directly to a three-star general at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. 
   "Asking Hill to do its job without a two-star general would have been like asking a football team to play without a quarterback," Hatch said. "I expressed great trepidation to senior Air Force personnel when I learned about this plan, and I appreciate their prompt and well thought-out response. Once again, the Air Force has made the smart decision."
