SEN. HATCH BACKS BILL TO LOWER HEALTH COSTS FOR UTAH
 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today placed his support behind a bill to allow business and trade associations to band together and offer group health insurance to small business owners and working families. Hatch joined a majority of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee in approving S. 1955 by an 11 to 9 vote.  
   "The high cost of health coverage is the top concern for small-business owners, and this bill will help them negotiate for the benefits they need, at more affordable prices," Hatch said. "With this bill, more Utahns will be able to afford insurance for the first time, and small employers will see their health insurance costs reduced by an estimated $1,000 per employee." 
   Working with Hatch and others, HELP Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) was instrumental in negotiating this landmark legislation that allows more small businesses and trade associations to offer affordable health insurance coverage to their employees on a national or regional basis. The Committee's bill preserves the primary role of states in protecting consumers and allows employers more options in the health plans they provide for their employees. 
   "I've heard from people on all sides of this issue, and we've tried to address many of their concerns," Hatch said. "This isn't a perfect bill, but it's an important first step toward controlling costs and covering more people."
