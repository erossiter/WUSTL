SEN. HATCH PRAISES PASSAGE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SAFETY ACT
  Sen. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today praised the United States Senate's passage of HR 218, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act which permits qualified current and retired law enforcement officers to carry a concealed firearm. 
   "While police officers may not remember the name and face of every criminal he or she has locked behind bars, criminals often have long and exacting memories which make officers a target in or out of uniform; active or retired; on duty or off," Hatch stated.
   "Our local news and hometown newspapers have shown us time and time again that the dedicated men and women in law enforcement answer the call of duty even when they're not on the clock," continued Hatch.
   "Since our police officers are never off duty, this legislation will not only provide officers with a legal means to protect themselves and their families when they travel, it also enables active duty and retired law enforcement officers to respond to crises wherever and whenever they arise," said Hatch.
   Senators Hatch, Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-CO), and Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) co-sponsored the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003. This legislation permits qualified current and retired law enforcement officers to carry a concealed firearm. Importantly, this legislation scrupulously protects states rights by recognizing a state's ability to authorize private persons to forbid or restrict the possession of firearms on private property or allowing state law to prohibit possession of a firearm on state or local government properties, installations, buildings, bases or park.
   Hatch also praised the tireless efforts of the Fraternal Order of Police, the world's largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, and President Bush who actively supported the passage of this legislation.
