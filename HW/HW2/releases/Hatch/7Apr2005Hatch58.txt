EDUCATION SECRETARY ANNOUNCES GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR NCLB
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today praised Education Secretary Margaret Spellings' announcement that states will have greater flexibility within the federal No Child Left Behind law, as long as states show they are raising achievement.  
 Spellings, at Hatch's invitation, is scheduled to be in the state Friday, April 15, to meet with Hatch, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., Utah leaders, educators and parents to discuss one of the most hotly contested issues facing the state. 
   "I want to thank Secretary Spellings for leading the Education Department to acknowledge that states need additional flexibility within No Child Left Behind," said Hatch. "I'm eager to talk with her, Gov. Huntsman, and other Utah officials next week to determine what this means for our state. We all want what is best for Utah schoolchildren." 
   Spellings will be in Utah all day Friday to visit Utah schools and meet with state leaders to discuss the problems and successes associated with state efforts to implement No Child Left Behind. At an event today in Washington, D.C., Spellings also announced that states are still expected to comply with the basic principles of NCLB - increased accountability, comprehensive student achievement, better information access, and better qualified teachers. 
   "States that show results and follow the principles of No Child Left Behind will be eligible for new tools to help them meet the goals of getting every child achieving at grade level by 2013-14," said Spellings. "It's a shared responsibility."
