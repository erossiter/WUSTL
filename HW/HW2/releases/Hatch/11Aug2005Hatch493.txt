SALT LAKE TO RECEIVE $500K LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANT
  Salt Lake-area law enforcement agencies will receive $528,048 in federal funds for fighting crime through a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program, according to Sen.  
 Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). 
   "Faced with a rapidly-growing urban population, Salt Lake area law enforcement authorities have their hands full and their budgets stretched to the limit," said Hatch. "These funds will help ease the strain and provide the latest equipment for the men and women who help keep Salt Lakers safe." 
   The money will go to both Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County law enforcement agencies through DOJ's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG), which allows states, tribes, and local governments to support a broad range of activities in preventing and controlling crime based on local needs. 
   According to the Department, Salt Lake City will spend their share of JAG funds on K-9 dogs, laptop computers, tasers, training, and other programs and supplies. Salt Lake County will purchase tasers, cameras, crime scene equipment, surveillance and monitoring devices, and other equipment.
