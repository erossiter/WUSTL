SEN. HATCH REACTS TO RUMSFELD RESIGNATION
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement following the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense:  
   "The American people spoke yesterday, and we can't ignore them. They made it clear they are not pleased with our progress in Iraq. 
   "Secretary Rumsfeld has been resolute and focused on securing victory in Iraq, but the President now believes our nation would be best served by a fresh perspective guiding our military. I respect the President's decision. 
   "I have known Robert Gates for years, and he is a tough, open-minded man. Intelligence is central to our national security, and the nation will be well-served with a Secretary of Defense who has served as a former CIA director and deputy national security advisor. I will do everything I can to help his nomination. 
   "There's no question that our efforts in Iraq are vital to our security. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to be successful so that we may bring our sons and daughters home confident that they have made America safer."
