SEN. HATCH PRAISES SENATE ON JUSTICE ALITO'S CONFIRMATION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today made the following statement on the Senate's 58-42 vote to confirm Justice Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court: 
   "Samuel Alito's appointment will strengthen the judiciary and the rule of law. The narrow partisan vote for such a highly qualified and respected jurist, however, did not strengthen the confirmation process. 
   "I hope that yesterday's firm rejection of the judicial filibuster will make such disreputable actions a thing of the past so that the Senate can return to a more principled, less political, approach to judicial selection."
