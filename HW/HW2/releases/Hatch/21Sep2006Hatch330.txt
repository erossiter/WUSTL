CONGRESS APPROVES CHILD WELFARE IMPROVEMENT ACT
  Yesterday, Congress approved the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) was a cosponsor of the bipartisan bill, which would increase funding and financial accountability in federal child welfare services. The bill (S. 3525) is an agreement between House and Senate plans to reauthorize and improve child welfare services for the next five years. The measure now proceeds to President Bush before it becomes law.  
   "Everyone in Congress agrees that we can't ignore our nation's most valuable asset - our children," Hatch said. "Sometimes we disagree about the best way to help those children, but this act is a meeting of the minds from across the political spectrum. We were able to put partisan differences aside and do what was best for kids." 
   The bill would invest $40 million per year in grants to address the corrosive problems of methamphetamines on families and children. Also, the bill requires states to hit a goal of visiting 90 percent of children in foster care every month, which experts have linked to better outcomes in Child and Family Service Reviews, or else federal funding is withheld. 
   "In the war we're fighting against drugs, methamphetamines are the most appalling weapons of mass destruction we've ever seen," Hatch said. "It tears families down faster than we can build them back up, so we've got to put the brakes on meth as best we can." 
   The bill aims to increase accountability in child welfare services by requiring states to report actual - not proposed - spending, limiting administrative expenditures, and ending prohibiting the federal government from reimbursing states with administrative costs that exceed 10 percent. The bill also adopts the Bush Administration's proposal to provide vouchers for mentoring services for the children of prisoners.
