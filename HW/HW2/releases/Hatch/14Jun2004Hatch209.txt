SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE CASE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, issued the following regarding today's United States Supreme Court's decision in the case of Newdow v. U.S. Congress:  
   "This was a correct but unsatisfying decision. 
   "I am pleased with the result of the decision and with the Court's proper focus on the procedural posture of the case. At the same time, it is unfortunate that the technicalities of the case prevented a ruling on the merits of the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. 
   "I continue to be outraged by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in Newdow v. U.S. Congress which struck down as unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, because the Pledge contains the phrase, "under God." I find the opinion an outrageous example of judicial activism and overreaching. 
   "The purpose of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was to proscribe the establishment of a particular religion and to prohibit government from discriminating against one religion by favoring another. But it was certainly never intended to mandate that government ban religious sentiment and culture from all aspects of public and civic life."
