SENATE PASSES ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX FIX
  Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) joined with 87 other senators late today to pass legislation to keep 21 million Americans, including more than 100,000 Utahns, from paying the Alternative Minimum Tax in 2007.  
   "If the Senate had failed to finally act on this crisis today, millions of Americans might have had to write checks to Uncle Sam for thousands of dollars," stated Hatch. "That is definitely not my idea of a great Christmas surprise." 
   Hatch took to the Senate floor earlier today to highlight this problem and encourage his colleagues to move on this issue immediately. He warned that to delay any longer would risk "billions of dollars in tax refunds being delayed because of inaction." The IRS has warned Congress that if the law is not changed, as many as 38 million Americans would face significant delays in getting their tax refund checks because of the time it will take the IRS to reprogram its computers. 
   "Utahns depend on their refunds," Hatch added. "Undermining that confidence is much worse than a lump of coal in a stocking. . .They assume they are getting that tax refund. And they assume they are getting it on time. Further delay is no longer acceptable." 
   The Senate bill, if passed by the House, will increase the thresholds for the alternative minimum tax to keep the number of AMT payers at the 2006 level. Unlike a bill brought before the Senate earlier in the day, the bill contains no tax increases, something Hatch stated strongly he would not support. "The Democratic plan to offset the AMT with permanent tax increases ought to fail," said Hatch. "I cannot support a plan that prevents a tax increase on millions of Americans by raising taxes on others, nor should we be putting the economy at risk by passing unnecessary tax hikes." 
   Hatch now says Congress needs to get down to the real business of repealing the AMT.
