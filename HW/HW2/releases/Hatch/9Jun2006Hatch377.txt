BUSH NOMINATES TOLMAN AS UTAH'S TOP FEDERAL ATTORNEY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today applauded President George Bush's nomination of Brett Tolman to serve as U.S. Attorney for Utah.  
   "The U.S. Attorney for Utah is a key position for our state, and Brett is the right person for the job," Hatch said. "He's an experienced Utah lawyer with an impressive background, and he's earned the respect of the law enforcement community in Utah and D.C. Brett's devoted to public service, and his track record proves he'll be an all-star lead prosecutor for Utah." 
   A Provo native, Tolman served as Hatch's counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee and was selected to continue leading the committee's crime and terrorism unit under the current Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Penn.). 
   In the Senate, Tolman helped enact the PATRIOT Act reauthorization and a 2004 DNA bill that provides much-needed funding and assistance to help prosecutors realize the full potential of DNA technology to solve crimes and protect the innocent. He has also worked on bills to fight gang crime, protect children from pornography, and reauthorize programs at the Justice Department and Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
   Tolman graduated from Brigham Young University's law school and joined the U.S. attorney's office in 2000, where he was honored by the Department of Justice for his leadership of Utah's Project Safe Neighborhoods program that helped take guns off Utah's streets.
