SEN. HATCH: DOE SEEKS CONTRACTOR TO MOVE MOAB TAILINGS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today applauded the Department of Energy (DOE) for taking steps to hire a contractor to clean up the radioactive mill tailings pile near Moab, Utah. Hatch helped secure $28 million in 2005 to fund the project, which will move the tailings away from the Colorado River, a critical water supply for Utah and its surrounding states.  
   "After years of talk, we'll soon have someone cleaning up this mess," Hatch said. "It's a complicated project, and I'm very encouraged that the Department of Energy is taking this step. It makes it easier to imagine a day when the people of Moab can be freed from the threat of this gigantic poisonous pile hanging over their heads." 
   Tasked to clean up the site in 2001, DOE issued its decision to move the pile to Crescent Junction, Utah, in September 2005 after Hatch and others in the Utah delegation successfully persuaded DOE that moving the pile was in the best interest of the nation. 
   Today, DOE released a Request for Task Proposals (RTP) to select a contractor, which will be responsible for designing and installing the tailings-removal waste handling systems, relocating the tailings to the Crescent Junction Site, and reclaim the Moab Site to appropriate standards. The RTP is available at http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/Moab. DOE expects the project to be completed over the next five years.
