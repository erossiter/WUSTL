SEN. HATCH SEEKS LAND FOR GARFIELD'S TURN-ABOUT RANCH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today introduced legislation to enable Garfield County's Turn-About Ranch to secure 25 acres of land that Congress inadvertently gave to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 1999.  
   "The Turn-About Ranch is a great success, helping countless at-risk youth throughout Utah," Hatch said. "This bill would help the ranch give full attention to the kids, rather than worry about the legal limbo Congress put them in." 
   During a major land exchange in 1999 between the State of Utah and the BLM, 25 acres that had been leased to Turn-About Ranch were erroneously included in a survey and became BLM land. Because government-owned land administered by the BLM surrounds the private land, the only way to resolve the trespass is through legislation. Hatch's bill would correct the trespass conflict and give the owners of the ranch the opportunity to purchase the land at fair-market value. 
   Since 1995, Turn-About Ranch has graduated some 500 troubled and at-risk teenagers through an intense program of training and rehabilitation. The ranch employs some 35 Garfield County residents, and the Turn-About Ranch program has strong support from the local community and the local civic leaders in the area.
