COMPENSATION PAYMENTS FOR DOWNWINDERS MARK HUGE MILESTONE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today highlighted the tremendous progress the United States government has made in compensating Americans affected by nuclear testing decades ago. This week, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program reached a huge milestone - more than $1 billion has been paid as compensation to more than 15,000 downwinders, uranium miners, and ore transporters afflicted by radiation exposure.  
   "Each payment from RECA shows the nation's commitment to helping victims of radiation exposure," Hatch said. "Thousands of Utahns were harmed by nuclear testing, and we can never do enough to right this. But I have fought for years to see that they receive some measure of compensation for their suffering." 
   The Department of Justice, which oversees the RECA program, reported that $1,002,039,052 has been paid to 15,108 individuals and families of those who have contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases as a result of their exposure to radiation from nuclear testing. The RECA program is administered to those affected in Utah and 10 other states and pays up to $50,000 for downwinders, up to $75,000 for on-site participants, and up to $100,000 for uranium miners who qualify for compensation. To date, RECA has compensated 3,731 Utahns with payments totaling $213,943,745. 
   On January 27, 1951, the United States exploded a nuclear weapon at the Nevada Test site. This test was the first of 100 nuclear weapons exploded in the atmosphere between 1951 and 1962. U. S. citizens have paid a heavy price for America's safety, including those living downwind from the Nevada Test site, working on-site at the test site and other sites where nuclear weapons testing occurred, and those who mined, transported and processed the uranium ore necessary to build these nuclear weapons. 
   In the years following the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, it became very clear that the weapons testing had serious health consequences for those exposed to radiation. On October 5, 1990, Congress passed the RECA legislation, which Hatch wrote and sponsored, and the program was expanded through a law he authored in 2000.
