SEN. HATCH FACILITATES RELEASE OF ADMINISTRATION DOCUMENTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement on the release of legal memoranda regarding the application of laws relevant to individuals detained and interrogated as suspected terrorists:  
   "Comity is better than confrontation. 
   "The release of these documents is a productive step in seeing that the Congress and American public are getting all of the key facts and thinking behind how we will keep America safe and bring suspected terrorists to justice. 
   "Despite the attempts by some to politicize this critical national security issue, the Judiciary Committee and administration are working together to provide the Congress the information it needs without jeopardizing the safety of our troops and citizens or the President's ability to receive candid advice from senior advisors. 
   "In discussions with Attorney General John Ashcroft and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez, I encouraged the Administration to provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with documents relevant to our oversight responsibilities over the war against terrorism." 
   Last week, the Judiciary Committee rejected a subpoena resolution offered by Committee Democrats.
