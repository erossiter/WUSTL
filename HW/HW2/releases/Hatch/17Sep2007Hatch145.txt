SEN. HATCH HIRES LANCE WALKER AS LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) announced he has hired Lance Walker as a Legislative Assistant in his Washington, D.C., office. Previously serving with U.S. Rep. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) for five years as a Senior Legislative Assistant, Walker now advises Senator Hatch on foreign affairs, commerce, transportation, and housing issues.  
   "Lance's track record has proven he is an adept policy adviser," Hatch said. "With his sharp mind and hands-on political and research experience on the Hill, I have no doubt that Lance will be a valuable addition on my staff to support my work for Utahns." 
   Walker, a graduate of the Brigham Young University Marriott School of Management, holds a B.S. in Business Management/Information Systems. During his previous work on Capitol Hill, Walker's work with the House of Representatives included identifying legislative opportunities, matching constituent needs with congressional support, and researching key legislation. 
   "I welcome this opportunity to work for Sen. Hatch and contribute to his service for Utah," Walker said. "It's a privilege to continue my career on this side of the Capitol. I enjoy the quick pace of a Congressional office and appreciate this chance to help Sen. Hatch with a spectrum of legislative issues." 
   Walker's past experience includes business management and analysis for Virginia-based companies. Walker and his family, wife Kelly and their two daughters, reside in Virginia.
