SEN. HATCH SPEAKS ON SENATE'S SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  The U.S. Senate today approved reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program by a vote of 67-29. A bipartisan, bicameral compromise, the House approved the bill earlier this week. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), an author of the original CHIP legislation 10 years ago, released the following statement:  
   "The CHIP program works for America's children," Hatch said. "Because of this law six million children are receiving the health care they need to become healthy, productive citizens. When something works we must do everything in our power to continue its success. The bill we voted on today is a good compromise that addresses viewpoints from both sides of the aisle in the Senate, and between the House and the Senate. I urge the President to let it stand, so we can help four million more of our nation's children. This is what it is all about - helping those who cannot help themselves." 
   The CHIP Reauthorization Act maintains all of the key policy provisions of the bill passed by the Senate in August, including a cap on new spending of $35 billion. Hatch helped to draft the legislation as Ranking Member of the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care.
