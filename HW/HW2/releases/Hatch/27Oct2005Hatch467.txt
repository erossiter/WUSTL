SEN. HATCH ON WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL MIERS WITHDRAWL: I'M SORRY IT CAME TO THIS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement following the withdrawal of the nomination of White House Counsel Harriet Miers to be the next associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "I'm sorry it came to this. The Senate has the Constitutional duty to evaluate whomever President Bush will nominate to replace Justice O'Connor. When we do, politics must not undermine the principles and standards we apply to every judicial nomination. I believe President Bush will keep his promise to appoint a justice who will interpret the law but not legislate from the bench."
