SEN. HATCH: BUSH GAVE BOLD, VISIONARY SPEECH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) had high praise for President Bush's State of the Union speech, delivered tonight before Congress and a national television audience.  
 Hatch issued the following statement: 
   "President Bush's speech was just as bold as he is. He is a man who means what he says and says what he means - and he said a lot tonight. I hope my colleagues in Congress heard him because he can help us find solutions to some of America's most difficult problems. 
   "Tonight the President laid out the broad framework of his agenda, and he is leaving it to Congress to fill in the details. He is a tough negotiator, but he listens to Congress and doesn't lose sight of the overall goal. I have some great ideas on how to improve on his ideas, and I am going to work with my colleagues in Congress to get the job done."
