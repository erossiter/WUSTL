SEN. HATCH TO HELP FORGE COMPROMISE ON TRANSPORTATION BILL
 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was named as one of 10 Senate Republicans to the House-Senate conference committee that will draw up the final bill to fund highway and transportation infrastructure.  
 The conference committee held its first meeting today.
   "I've been frustrated at the slow progress of this bill," Hatch said. "We have serious transportation needs in our country, and especially in Utah. Everywhere I travel - from Logan to St. George, Tooele to Moab - I'm reminded of how desperately our communities need these funds. We need to act quickly to pass this bill through Congress."
   The Senate passed S. 1072, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003, on February 12, 2004. The bill provided $318 billion over six years to support investment in the nation's highways and transit systems. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Hatch worked to secure the highest funding possible without raiding the general funds or cutting other government programs. Instead, the Senate Finance Committee cracked down on fuel tax evaders and made other changes to tax law to produce the money needed.
   "I hope the conference committee can catch the spirit of what we have done in the Senate Finance Committee," Hatch said. "We need to roll up our sleeves and find a way to solve this difficult transportation problem facing our nation."
