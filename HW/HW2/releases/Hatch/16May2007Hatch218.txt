REP. HATCH: AIR FORCE NAMES NEW HILL GENERAL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch's (R-Utah) today announced that the Air Force has recommended Brig. Gen. Kathleen Close to become the new commander of the Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill Air Force Base (HAFB). Hatch hosted the Senate Air Force Depot Caucus in the Capitol today, where he met with Close, who will replace Hill's outgoing Maj. Gen. Kevin Sullivan. Sullivan has been nominated for a lieutenant general position in Washington, D.C. If confirmed, Close will become a major general.  
   "I am very impressed with Gen. Close," Hatch said. "She's an exceptional leader with a distinguished record of leading Air Force maintenance operations. Hill is a world-class depot, and Gen. Close is going to help keep it that way." 
   Based on the Air Force's recommendation, President Bush is expected to nominate Close for Senate confirmation to the post soon, and Hatch promises to expedite her confirmation process once it reaches the Senate. If approved, Close would be the first ever female commander for Hill Air Force Base. Its Air Logistics Center is Hill's largest unit and, with a staff of 23,500, Utah's largest single-site employer. 
   "Gen. Close is thoroughly committed to the Air Force's depot strategy and will continue the good work of Gen. Sullivan," Hatch said. "Utahns will be fortunate to have a leader of her caliber amongst them."
