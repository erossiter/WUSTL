CONGRESS PASSES PLAN TO SAVE AS MUCH AS $335 MILLION ON F-22A RAPTOR
  The United States Senate today unanimously approved the Defense Authorization conference report, which contained a measure sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to procure 60 F-22A Raptors over the next three years through a multi-year contract. The Raptor is maintained at Hill Air Force Base (HAFB), and using a multi-year contract - rather than buying year by year - could save taxpayers as much as $335 million.  
   "The F-22 Raptor is among the most impressive pieces of technology in our nation's Armed Forces, and everyone agrees that the Air Force should have these 60 Raptors," Hatch said. "It just makes sense to save millions by buying in bulk now." 
   The multi-year would bring the total fleet of Raptors to 183, the number prescribed by the Bush Administration. Hatch continues to press his colleagues to meet the Air Force's goal to bolster the Raptor fleet from 183 to 381, given the ever-increasing demands on America's military. 
   HAFB personnel perform maintenance work on the Raptor, including construction of the horizontal stabilizing portion of the aircraft's tail. The Raptor will bring more jobs to HAFB, as base personnel are experts in using the composite materials that incorporate the plane's stealth technology. 
   "The Air Force knows that when they want a job done right, they need to come to Utah," Hatch said. "For depot maintenance, no one comes close to Hill."
