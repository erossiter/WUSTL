SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES $11M FOR SMALL UTAH COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) announced that Utah will receive more than $11 million in federal Community Planning Development (CPD) grants to enhance livability in communities throughout the state. Utah leaders obtain these grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to expand housing and economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons.  
   "A nation as large as ours is only as strong as its individual communities," Hatch said. "CPD grants empower local leaders with the resources and the flexibility to put their visions into action and help their constituents." 
   One of CPD's underlying principles is that local officials know how best to help the people they serve, so the federal government places execution of the grant programs in local hands. Use of this $11 million is at the state of Utah's discretion to distribute among smaller towns. Larger municipalities, such as Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Provo, and others, apply directly for CPD, but rural areas with lower populations do not. 
   The FY 2006 CPD grants for Utah include: 
   * $6,511,627 for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons. 
   * $3,783,080 for HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) grants to help expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low- and very low-income families with grants to meet local needs and priorities. 
   * $593,887 for Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters. 
   * $112,000 for Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) grants to provide housing assistance and related supportive services to local units of government, states, and non-profit organizations to benefit low-income persons medically diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and their families. 
   * $57,305 for American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) grants to promote homeownership opportunities by providing resources for downpayment and closing-cost assistance to low-income and minority households. 
   Hatch has long been a strong proponent of CPD's successful community-driven approach. When proposals for budget cuts recently threatened to slash CDGB's funding levels by $1 billion - 25 percent of its budget - Hatch sent a letter to Sen. Judd Gregg, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, in defense of the CDBG program. 
   "In these times, it's important to rein in government spending," Hatch said. "But I take an 'if it isn't broke, don't fix it' approach to programs that are as successful as CDGB at invigorating our economic base and standard of living."
