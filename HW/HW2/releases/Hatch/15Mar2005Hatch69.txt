SEN. HATCH: DEMOCRATS ALREADY EXERCISED NUCLEAR OPTION
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after learning of a threat by Senate Democrats to bring the Senate to a standstill if Republicans seek a remedy to the judicial nominations crisis:  
   "The Democrats have it backwards - they exercised the nuclear option last Congress by launching an unprecedented filibuster campaign against judicial nominees. They broke with a long-standing tradition of giving judicial nominations that reach the Senate floor an up or down vote, and we simply want to restore that tradition. 
   "Now some Democrats are threatening to hold hostage the American people's legislation to maintain their ability to rig the judicial confirmation process. That's unfortunate, especially since last election cycle proved that self-serving partisan obstruction is not a winning electoral strategy. They don't have to go down that path. There would be no conflict, no problem in need of a solution, if the Senate returned to its tradition of debating and voting on judicial nominations."
