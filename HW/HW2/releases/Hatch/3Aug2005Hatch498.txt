POLL SHOWS NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF UTAHNS SUPPORT FLAG AMENDMENT
  Results of a poll released today by the Citizens Flag Alliance show strong support among Utahns for an amendment to the United States Constitution protecting the flag from desecration.  
   "There's no question that the people of our state are as patriotic as they come," said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). "When I travel across Utah, people from Logan to St. George tell me, 'Thanks for fighting to protect the flag.'" 
   Hatch is lead sponsor in the Senate of an amendment to the Constitution which would allow Congress and the States to enact laws protecting the flag from desecration. The poll released today shows that 69 percent of Utahns support Hatch's effort, and 78 percent of Utahns say protecting the flag is somewhat important or very important to them. 
   "For generations, Congress and the states prohibited physical misuse of the flag," said Hatch. "Utah had just such a law. Then, in a series of misguided, activist Supreme Court decisions, this right to protect the flag through legislation was taken away from the people. About a decade ago, the Utah Legislature nearly unanimously urged the congressional delegation to support a constitutional amendment that would restore the right of Utahns and other Americans to protect the flag. For that reason, I introduced the Flag Protection Amendment, and I will continue to champion it until it passes."
