SEN. HATCH: BUSH PROPOSING PRAGMATIC AGENDA
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after President George W. Bush addressed the nation in his State of the Union address:  
   "The President laid out a pragmatic agenda tonight. Seeing Speaker Pelosi sitting behind him was a stark reminder of the change in Washington, and the President was smart to focus on a few key areas that he believes could see action in a Democratic-led Congress. I was struck by how far he's moving to meet the Democrats half way - time will tell if the Democrats intend to work with him or against him. 
   "The President was right to focus on energy security. Many of his proposals - expanding renewable and alternative fuels - would build on laws I authored in 2005. That was a good start, and we're seeing progress. But much, much more can be done. 
   "I was intrigued by the President's health-care proposal that he proposed tonight. I think it's unfair that the Democrats already seem to be dismissing this without vetting the details. It's a fresh idea that we should study carefully. 
   "I fully support the President's goal to increase the strength of our military throughout the world by increasing the active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 over the next five years. This plan would help alleviate the strain on our overstretched military. 
   "And the President also reiterated his new course of action in Iraq. I believe it is an intelligent approach, though there are no easy answers to this. I suspect that our approach will continue to evolve over time."
