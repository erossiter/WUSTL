SENATE APPROVES MARSHALL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT
  The U.S. Senate approved Tuesday H.R. 2768, a bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of Chief Justice John Marshall. Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sponsored companion legislation in the Senate. 
   "This is a much-overdue tribute to the most important and longest-serving United States Chief Justice," said Hatch. "Throughout his 34 years on the Supreme Court, he authored more than 500 opinions - more than any other Chief Justice in history. Many of his decisions shaped America's constitutional law and history and are still cited today. He was a distinguished leader who left an indelible legacy." 
   H.R. 2768, which has already been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, was passed by unanimous consent Tuesday evening. It will allow for the production of 400,000 coins in 2005 bearing the likeness of Chief Justice Marshall and will attach to the sale of each coin a $10 surcharge. The sale of these coins could produce nearly $4 million to support the Supreme Court Historical Society. 
   "I believe minting a coin is a fitting honor for this great Chief Justice," Hatch said. "We have never minted a coin focused on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the least understood of the three branches of government - yet it has tremendous impact on the rights of everyone in America. This coin will help to preserve the history of the Court and assist in educating the nation about the vital role the Court plays in our government." 
   The coin will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the birth of Chief Justice Marshall, which will take place in 2005.
