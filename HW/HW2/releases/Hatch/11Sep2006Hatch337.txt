SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION IN HUD GRANTS FOR PROVO
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced more than $3 million in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants for supporting the Provo community. 
   "These grants provide local leaders with critical funds, and the flexibility to use them according to their discretion," Hatch said. "I know Mayor Lewis Billings will make good use of these resources to better the lives of many in Provo."
   The grants include $1.7 million in Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which provide funds to state and local governments for housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public improvements, and economic development projects in communities. CDBGs also expand economic opportunities for low-income persons.
   Other grants include $1.35 million for the HOME program, which allows community leaders to expand the supply of quality, affordable housing for poor and very poor families. A new initiative under HOME is the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI), which helps low-income and minority households cover closing costs and down payments for home purchases. Provo received $24,000 for ADDI.
   "These funds empower local leaders to give the less fortunate a much-needed boost," Hatch said. "Utah's communities can count on HUD funds to help revitalize their neighborhoods."
