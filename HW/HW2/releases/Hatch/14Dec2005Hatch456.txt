BLM BEGINS IMPLEMENTING SEN. HATCH OIL SHALE BILL
  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) yesterday announced its plans to implement oil shale and tar sands legislation sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) that was included in the comprehensive energy law enacted last summer. 
   "The BLM is moving quickly to start tapping into Utah's vast oil resources," Hatch said. "The recent spike in gas prices is a clear sign that we need to increase domestic oil production. We have more oil in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming than in all the Middle East, and the tar sands operations in Canada have demonstrated that it's very economical to develop these resources. We need to access the vast resources we have in the West, and we need to do it soon." 
   According to the U.S. Department of Energy, recoverable oil shale in the western United States exceeds one trillion barrels and is the richest and most geographically concentrated oil shale and tar sands resource in the world. 
   To begin accessing these resources, the BLM will implement a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for oil shale and tar sands leasing activities on federal lands in the West. This EIS will amend existing Resource Management Plans in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming to provide increased oil shale and tar sands leasing activities in those states. 
   The BLM also announced that it will hold a series of public meetings beginning in Salt Lake City on January 11, 2006.
