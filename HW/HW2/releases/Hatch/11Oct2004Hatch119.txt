CONGRESS APPROVES $7.7 MILLION FOR HILL AFB PROJECT
  Today the United States Senate approved the conference report for the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill (H.R. 4837), which contains $7.7 million in funding for an ICBM Propellant Analysis project at Ogden's Hill Air Force Base pushed by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). 
   "For too long now, Hill Air Force Base has performed exceedingly high-quality ICBM maintenance work with facilities that don't live up to that standard," said Hatch. "This complex will allow Hill to expand their workload and upgrade their equipment, as well as increase the life of these weapons and provide more accurate data analysis. Clearly, this complex is necessary for Hill to best support our forces." 
   The House of Representatives approved the conference report yesterday. The measure now awaits the signature of the President.
