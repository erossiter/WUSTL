SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES NEW VETERANS' COMMUNITY OUTPATIENT CLINIC IN WESTERN SALT LAKE VALLEY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to open a new community-based clinic in the Western Salt Lake Valley, which will enhance access to VA health care for veterans of Utah. The clinic was among 38 approved in 22 states by VA Secretary James Nicholson. 
   "Utahns have been on the front lines of military conflicts of the 20th and 21st Centuries," Hatch said. "Having this new clinic in Salt Lake will help ensure that we provide for the health and security of Utah's veterans - especially those with service-related disabilities and those who require the Department of Veterans Affairs' specialized services."
   The new facilities, called community-based outpatient clinics, or CBOCs, will become operational in 2007 and 2008. Services available at the Salt Lake clinic will include comprehensive primary care, health promotion, maintenance, routine/urgent care procedures and education.
   "VA is committed to providing world-class health care to the men and women who have served this nation," VA Secretary Jim Nicholson said. "These new clinics will bring VA's top-notch care closer to the veterans who have earned it."
   With 153 hospitals and more than 700 community-based clinics, VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the country. VA's health care budget of more than $34 billion this year will provide health care to about 5.5 million people during nearly 800,000 hospitalizations and 60 million outpatient visits. The CBOC's highest priority is to improve access to care for high priority enrolled veterans. Improved quality of care will reduce waiting times for follow-up care, in addition to improve waiting times at the parent hospital.
