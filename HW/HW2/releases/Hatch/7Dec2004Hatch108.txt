OGDEN FEDERAL BUILDING TO BE NAMED AFTER FORMER REP. HANSEN
  The U.S. Senate approved today a bill to name an Ogden Federal building for James V. Hansen, the former Congressman from Utah's First District.  
 The House of Representatives approved the bill, H.R. 3147, on April 21, 2004, and the measure now goes to the President. 
   "The name of Jim Hansen will bring a level of trust, a level of fairness, and a level of understanding to all who enter this building," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). "His name will continue to be synonymous with excellence in public service in Utah." 
   Hansen served in Congress for 22 years - the longest-serving House member in Utah's history - and was Chairman of the House Resources Committee and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee when he retired in 2002. 
   H.R. 3147 is a companion measure to the Senate bill sponsored by Hatch that had passed the Senate earlier this year. It designates the Federal building at 324 Twenty-Fifth Street in Ogden as the James V. Hansen Federal Building. 
   "Over the course of his life, Congressman Hansen has built a reputation as a decent, common-sense, hard-working public servant," Hatch said. "He is respected by members on both sides of the aisle as a straightforward, rational lawmaker who works hard to reach sensible solutions."
