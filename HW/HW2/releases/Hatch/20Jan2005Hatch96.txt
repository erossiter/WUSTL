SENATE CONFIRMS NEW EDUCATION CHIEF
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) joined his Senate colleagues today in confirming Margaret Spellings, President Bush's choice to be the new Secretary of Education, by voice vote. 
   "This is a key position at a key time," said Hatch. "As I travel around Utah, there is no single issue of greater concern than education. I have been impressed by the President's complete confidence in Ms. Spellings and her ability to serve our nation and its most valuable asset, our children. 
   "I was particularly pleased that during her hearing before the Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) Committee, Ms. Spellings accepted my invitation to personally visit Utah to meet with legislators and educators," Hatch added. "We look forward to her visit."
   Hatch noted that Utah has been in the forefront of the debate and was one of the first states to contemplate opting out of the controversial and revolutionary No Child Left Behind law (NCLB), due in part to concerns about retaining state control and objections to federal mandates without sufficient funding.
   "Make no mistake, I am a strong advocate for local control of education and want to make sure that there is sufficient flexibility for our states within NCLB," said Hatch. "But even those who don't agree with everything in NCLB admit that it has brought focus on making sure every child is progressing, and spurred innovative approaches to tracking student achievement.
   "I trust that the Department of Education will keep open the lines of communication with the states and localities as we work together to ensure that, truly, no child is left behind," Hatch said.
