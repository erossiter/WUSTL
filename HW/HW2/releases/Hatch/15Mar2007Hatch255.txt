SEN. HATCH BILL TO EXPAND REACH OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the federal health centers program, which provides low-income and underserved patients access to affordable health care through community health centers. The bill has 16 cosponsors.  
   "These centers are worth every cent that the federal government invests in them," Hatch said. "They save lives. They provide preventive health care that keeps people out of hospitals. By reauthorizing this program, we will allow health centers to provide low-cost health care to many more uninsured and underinsured individuals." 
   Established more than 40 years ago, the program has placed community health centers in medically underserved areas to provide care to 15 million Americans, most of whom have limited or no access to health insurance. Hatch's bill - the Health Centers Renewal Act of 2007 - would reauthorize the program for another five years. 
   Utah's 24 community health centers are located throughout the state, serving close to 85,000 patients, 96 percent of whom live below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. In many of Utah's rural areas, health centers are often the only health care provider. 
   "Utah's health centers are a vital safety net," Hatch said. "For thousands of Utahns, health centers are their only link to essential health care. We need to make sure they continue to have access to quality, affordable health care." 
   At the start of his administration, President George W. Bush made a goal to have 1,200 new or expanded centers. Congress has increased funding accordingly since 2001 to provide service to 4 million additional patients and has added new or expanded facilities in more than 750 communities nationwide. Hatch's bill would continue this expansion, with the goal to help health centers reach 30 million patients by 2015.
