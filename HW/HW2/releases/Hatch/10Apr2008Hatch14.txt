LEGISLATION MOVES NATION TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, SEN. HATCH SAYS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), today applauded the Senate's passage of the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act, an amendment to housing legislation adopted on the Senate floor.  
   "I believe we are approaching the tipping point where renewable sources of electricity make sense from a practical and economic standpoint," said Hatch. "The Senate has done something important today by pushing our nation further forward in the march toward energy independence." 
   Hatch was the original sponsor of the renewable production tax credit extension that passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and was also an original cosponsor of this effort to extend these incentives. 
   The provisions the Senate passed today would extend, for one year, tax incentives promoting clean and renewable electricity production using wind, geothermal, solar, landfill gas and other qualifying clean energy sources. The proposal also extended incentives for energy efficient buildings and homes. 
   While pleased with the act adopted by the Senate, Hatch said more remains to be done. 
   "We also cannot forget to address our need for more transportation fuels, which will soon reach a crisis point if we ignore it," Hatch said. "Renewable energy will play an important role in the not-too-distant future, but presently, more than 97 percent of our transportation fuels come from oil. We need to promote more domestic oil production, more alternative fuels, and a shift toward a greater use of the electricity grid for transportation with battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles."
