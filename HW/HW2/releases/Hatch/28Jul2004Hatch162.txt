ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT HONORS UTAH PROJECT SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS TASK FORCE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today announced that Attorney General John Ashcroft has selected the Utah Project Safe Neighborhoods Task Force for the prestigious Attorney General's Award for Outstanding Contributions to Community Partnership for Public Safety.  
   "I am pleased to learn that the Utah Project Safe Neighborhoods Task Force has been selected to receive the prestigious Attorney General's Award for Outstanding Contributions to Community Partnership for Public Safety," said Hatch. "Our Utah law enforcement's tough-on-crime approach parallels what I have always advocated: protect the rights of law abiding citizens to keep and bear arms and strictly enforce our gun laws." 
   "Under the noteworthy leadership of U.S. Attorney Paul Warner the Utah Project Safe Neighborhoods Task Force has worked hard to implement a statewide initiative and has made Utah a national leader in combating violent gun crime," continued Hatch. 
   "As a result of their work, and the widespread cooperation between federal, state, and local prosecutors and law enforcement officers, Utah has experienced a substantial decrease in gun violence," said Hatch. "I commend all of the people who have worked diligently in the fight against gun violence and am pleased that their efforts are being appropriately recognized." 
   The award will be personally presented by Attorney General Ashcroft on July 28, 2004 in Washington, D.C., to John Huber, Project Safe Neighborhoods Coordinator; Larry Marks of the Utah Department of Public Safety; Jeff Sarnacki of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms; and Lynette Gurr, the wife of former Police Chief Cecil Gurr who was violently gunned down by an armed felon.
