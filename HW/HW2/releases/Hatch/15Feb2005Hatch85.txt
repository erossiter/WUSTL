BUSH HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today supported Judge Michael Chertoff to be the next Secretary of Homeland Security as the United States Senate voted unanimously to confirm the nomination.  
   "Few people - if any - know the legal and security issues involved with the war on terror as well as Judge Chertoff," Hatch said. "I have worked closely with him since the trying days after September 11th, and he is one of the best leaders in the country to help defend our nation from terrorism." 
   Today's vote marks Chertoff's fourth Senate confirmation. He was confirmed less than a year ago as a judge on the 3rd Circuit of Appeals, a lifetime appointment. 
   "Few lifetime-appointed judges leave the bench before retirement," Hatch said. "But Judge Chertoff is not a man who will shirk from his duty. His nation called and asked him to sacrifice. He answered that call - as he has done throughout his career - and stood up to be counted. Judge Chertoff has time and again set the standard by which others will have to follow, and I have no doubt he will do so again with this new assignment."
