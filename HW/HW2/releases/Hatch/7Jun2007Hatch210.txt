SEN. HATCH HAILS HOUSE PASSAGE OF STEM CELL BILL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following response to the House of Representatives' passage of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, by a vote of 247-176. In April, the Senate passed S. 5, which, if enacted into law, would allow the Federal government to fund research into human embryonic stem cells.  
   "Each year support grows for the use of federal funds to support ethical embryonic stem cell research. This year that support may be strong enough finally to enact legislation. If not, I think it will be soon."
