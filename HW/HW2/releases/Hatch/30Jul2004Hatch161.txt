REP. HATCH COMMENTS ON LEAKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement in response to media inquiries about leaked classified information regarding former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds.  
   "While I will not comment on the contents of this classified document, I have faith that the Department of Justice Inspector General's Office will do its best to determine what happened here. FBI Director Robert Mueller is very well respected because he is willing to listen to others about ways to improve the FBI and takes seriously any recommendations. If anything improper occurred, I have every confidence that he will do the right thing here."
