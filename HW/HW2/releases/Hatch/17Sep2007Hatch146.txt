ATTORNEY GENERAL CONFIRMATION SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT POLITICAL GAMES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) released the following statement today regarding the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to serve as the Attorney General of the United States.  
   "The Senate should focus on Judge Mukasey's qualifications, his almost 40 years of service in America's legal system, through a process that respects the separation of powers," Hatch said. "I know some in this body want to use nominations to fight unrelated policy or political battles. Those fights are for the legislative process or the oversight process, but not the confirmation process." 
   Hatch hopes that Mukasey will receive a fair, efficient confirmation process, free from partisan demagoguery. In Hatch's tenure, the Senate has confirmed nine Attorneys General, with an average review time between nomination and confirmation of three weeks. Hatch hopes that, given how well established Mukasey's reputation is, the Senate will live up to this standard.
