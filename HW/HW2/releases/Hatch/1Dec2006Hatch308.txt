UTAHN APPOINTED TO MINER SAFETY PANEL
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today congratulated mining engineering Professor Felipe Calizaya of the University of Utah for his appointment to a national panel to explore mine safety. Calizaya will be one of six members of the panel.  
 "As a mining engineer, Dr. Calizaya has 35 years of experience under his belt, nationally and internationally, protecting the safety of miners," Hatch said. "His expertise, both in academia and the private sector, will be a tremendous benefit to miners in the U.S. We're lucky to have him at the University of Utah, and the country is lucky to have him on this panel." 
 A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee - which oversees mining practices - Hatch led the Utah delegation in August recommending Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt appoint Calizaya to the panel. A federal panel to investigate the safety of belt-air coal mining practices is mandated by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act of 2006, which was passed in response to the January mine disaster in West Virginia.
