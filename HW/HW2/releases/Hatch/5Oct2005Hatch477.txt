SEN. HATCH NAMES NEW PRESS SECRETARY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has promoted Peter Carr as his press secretary, replacing Adam Elggren, who recently departed for a position with the United States Attorney's office in Utah.  
   As press secretary, Carr will manage press requests and other media affairs for the Senator. Carr was a life-long resident of Utah before arriving in Washington in April 2002 to work in Hatch's press office. 
   "I can't say enough good things about Peter," Hatch said. "He is smart, dedicated, sincere and helpful to Utahns who contact our office. Peter has been a valuable member of my press operations for the past three years, and with this promotion he will be a tremendous asset in this key position." 
   A former student body president at Woods Cross High School, Carr received his bachelor's degree in public relations from Brigham Young University BYU and is currently a master's degree candidate in public policy from George Mason University. Carr spent two years working at a Salt Lake public relations firm before joining Hatch and interned for the Utah State Legislature, Davis County Clipper, and Marriott School while at BYU.
