SEN. HATCH TOUTS NEW REPORT ON BENEFITS OF PLUG-INS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) pointed to the results of a study released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) which finds that the widespread use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the United States would likely reduce greenhouse gases and improve air quality.  
   Hatch is the author of S. 1617, the FREEDOM Act, a bill that provides strong incentives for the U.S. manufacture and consumer purchases of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Provisions of the FREEDOM Act were included in the Energy Advancement and Investment Act of 2007, the tax package which the Senate Finance Committee approved in June. 
   "This report by EPRI and the NRDC is the first serious assessment of the impact plug-in hybrids would have on our environment and energy security," Hatch said. "The results increase my confidence that we should promote a shift away from liquid fuels and toward the greater use of electricity in our transportation sector. Electrons have been proven to be much cheaper, much cleaner, and more abundant than liquid fuels. And we can produce electricity here at home." 
   According to EPRI and the NRDC, the purpose of the report is to understand the nationwide environmental impact of potentially large fleets of plug-in hybrids, which will use electricity from the grid as the primary fuel source. Specifically, the study examined how greater use of plug-in hybrids would improve air quality in the 2010-2050 time frame.
