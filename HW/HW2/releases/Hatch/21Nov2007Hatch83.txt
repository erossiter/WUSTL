SEN. HATCH: THIS IS TIME TO PAY GRATITUDE FOR OUR FREEDOMS
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today released the following Thanksgiving message. 
   "This week as a nation we celebrate the bounty with which we have been blessed. The annual Thanksgiving holiday is a time for Americans to offer particular gratitude for our freedoms, our prosperity, and our heritage. It is also a time for us to be mindful of those men and women who are far away from their homes this season to protect our country. May God bless them and their families this holiday season."
