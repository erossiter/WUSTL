SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE REPORTS BILL TO BOOST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM'S POTENTIAL FOR DNA TECHNOLOGY
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today announced that late this evening the Senate Judiciary Committee reported S.1700, the "Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003."  
 This bipartisan effort will provide funding and assistance to the criminal justice system in order to realize the full potential of DNA technology to solve crimes and protect the innocent. 
   "DNA technology has the power to protect the innocent and convict the guilty and will move our criminal justice system into a new era of increased fairness and efficiency," said Hatch. 
   "This bipartisan legislation is a forward-looking measure," continued Hatch. "With this comprehensive proposal, we will ensure the use of DNA technology and protect the public safety. I hope that in the final days of the 108th Congress, we can continue to work in good faith so that the full Senate can pass this important measure." 
   "This bill, which enacts the President's DNA technology initiative, announced by Attorney General Ashcroft on March 11, 2003, will provide over $1 billion in funding and assistance over the next five years to realize the full potential of DNA technology to solve crimes, protect the public and exonerate the innocent," continued Hatch. 
   "Justice, in many instances, is waiting in evidence rooms and forensic laboratories across the country," said Hatch. "This crucial measure will provide our law enforcement and criminal justice officials with necessary and long-overdue tools."
