SEN. HATCH: NEW IRAQ STRATEGY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after President George W. Bush provided the American public with his new strategy for the war in Iraq:  
   "The President has articulated a fundamental change in strategy designed to win the war in Iraq. 
   "For too long, we have been using conventional warfare tactics to fight an insurgency. This is a different kind of war. Our strategic objective must be to provide the Iraqi people with a secure environment. Only then will they be able to rebuild government institutions and develop a growing economy. 
   "We need to integrate our efforts first by clearing insurgents from an area and then maintaining a robust U.S. and Iraqi security force that helps to provide basic services such as power and clean water to the people in that area. In addition, the Iraqi government must live up to its responsibility to help us maintain that secure environment. 
   "This is what the President is proposing, and I believe it is an intelligent approach. But let's be honest - there are no easy answers to this, and I suspect that our approach will continue to evolve over time. 
   "Yet it's crucial that we succeed in Iraq. Retreat is not an option, and I think the President made that case strongly. We have to win this. If we walk out of there without accomplishing our mission, Iraq will become a breeding ground for Al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations. We can't allow that to happen."
