SEN. HATCH PRAISES ENACTMENT OF OFFICERS' GUN LAW
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, praised President George W. Bush who today signed into law the Law Enforcement Officers' Safety Act which permits qualified current and retired law enforcement officer to carry a concealed firearm.  
   "Today is a good day for the good guys-those dedicated men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives for the public everyday-and a bad day for the bad guys who make violence and crime their life's work," said Hatch who was at the White House while the President signed the bill into law. 
   Senators Hatch, Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-CO), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) co-sponsored the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003. The law permits law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms, but also scrupulously protects states rights by recognizing a state's ability to authorize private persons to forbid or restrict the possession of firearms on their property.
