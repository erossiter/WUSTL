SEN. HATCH APPOINTS NEW LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is pleased to announce that he has promoted Jace Johnson to be legislative director in his Washington, D.C. office. 
   "There's nobody better than Jace, with his Utah roots and tremendous political and business experience, to help our office make sure Utah's interests are represented to the fullest," Hatch said. "With his background and ability, Jace will be able to work with Utah's leaders to coordinate a legislative agenda that will help all Utahns." 
   A Brigham Young University graduate, Johnson has spent the past two years serving as a key aide to Hatch on a wide range of issues, including transportation, trade, welfare, and telecommunications. Before joining Hatch's office, Johnson was instrumental in building the Corvis Corporation, a fiber-optic telecommunications company, from a small business to a large international corporation that raised $1.2 billion in an initial public offering in July 2000. 
   "What's impressed me about Jace is his ability to capitalize on his business savvy to forge compromises and pass difficult legislation," Hatch said. "He shares my vision for Utah, and I know he will quickly gain the trust and respect of those he works with throughout the state and back in Washington." 
   Johnson first worked for Hatch in 1994 before earning his MBA from George Washington University. Prior to working at Corvis Corporation, he served as a Manager of Finance for VISA InterActive, a wholly-owned subsidiary of VISA International. He has extensive experience growing businesses and working with management and employees to build effective organizations.
