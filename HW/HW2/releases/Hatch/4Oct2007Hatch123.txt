SEN. HATCH: CEDAR CITY SET TO FLY ONCE AGAIN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) announced today the U. S. Department of Transportation has selected Sky West Airlines to restore commercial air service to Cedar City, Utah.  
   "This is terrific news," Hatch said. "This community has been suffering greatly because of unreliable service for the past several months. When Mesa filed its notice to suspend service, I began working with U. S. Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters and urging her and the Department to carefully consider Utah's needs when considering replacements. I am pleased they have responded and once again provided our citizens with air service which is vital to the economy and quality of life of Cedar City." 
   SkyWest will offer 12 nonstop round trips each week to Salt Lake City. 
   "Prior to Mesa Airlines, Cedar City had a long history with SkyWest providing commercial air service that was reliable and appreciated by residents," added Hatch. "It is gratifying to know that this relationship will begin again and residents will be able to enjoy the reliable service they had come to appreciate." 
   In related news, the Department of Transportation today also announced that it had selected Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. to take over air service to Moab and Vernal. The airline will offer 12 nonstop or one-stop round trips each week to Denver from both cities.
