SEN. HATCH CELEBRATES YOUNG AMERICANS WITH DIA DE LOS NINOS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch's (R-Utah) resolution to recognize April 30th as "Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans," S. Res. 177, passed the U.S. Senate yesterday by unanimous consent. Many nations, especially within Latin America, celebrate Dia de los Ninos on April 30, in recognition and celebration of their countries' children. Many American Hispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on this day by celebrating Dia de los Ninos in their homes.  
   "In my state of Utah, Dia de los Ninos brings events and special programs to schools, libraries, cultural centers, and even hospitals," Hatch said. "The designation of a day to honor the children of the Nation will help us affirm the significance of family, education, and community." 
   This resolution calls on the American people to join with all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and states across America to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities in subsequent years on April 30. 
   "Children celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day, so this gives grown-ups a day to celebrate the next generation," Hatch said. "This special recognition of children provides us with an opportunity to reflect on their futures, help shape their dreams, and find comfort in the support of their family members and communities." 
   Joining Hatch as original cosponsors to this resolution are Senators Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Ken Salazar (D-Colo.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).
