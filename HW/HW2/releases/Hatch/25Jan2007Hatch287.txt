   As a U.S. Senator, Hatch annually recommends an elite group of candidates for each vacancy at the Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, CO; the Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD; the Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, NY; and the Military Academy, West Point, NY. 
   "The battlefields of the 21st Century require men and women of courage, ambition, and intelligence," Hatch said. "I know these young leaders will help win those battles and defend America. It's an honor to help launch them on their way." 
   The selection process for military academies is very competitive. Applicants must demonstrate outstanding performance in academics, leadership, physical fitness, extracurricular activities, and community involvement. Selection criteria include interviews, SAT/ACT scores, class rank, grades, school records, evaluations by teachers and counselors and participation in extracurricular and athletic activities. All the academies place a great deal of emphasis on candidates who can show they have strong leadership skills, both in and out of school. 
   Applicants must be legal Utah residents and unmarried U.S. citizens at least 17 years of age, but not past their 23rd birthday as of July 1, 2007, with no children or legal dependents. Some applicants receive multiple nominations and apply to more than one academy, to increase their chances of receiving an appointment.
