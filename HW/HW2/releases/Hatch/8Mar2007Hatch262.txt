SEN. HATCH FIGHTS FOR COMMUNITY-BUILDING GRANTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today voiced opposition to funding cuts for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which provide funds to state and local governments for low-income housing, public improvements, and economic development projects. Hatch sent a letter to Senate Budget Committee leaders Sens. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), urging them to provide adequate funding for CDBGs.  
   "Thousands of local governments, counties, cities, towns, and communities are served by the CDBG program each year," Hatch wrote in the letter. "These funds help communities find solutions to their housing needs and empower the less fortunate. Utah's communities should be able to count on CDBG funds to help revitalize their neighborhoods." 
   The CDBG program is one of the most effective Federal programs to revitalize neighborhoods, and the program has made a real difference in the lives of thousands of low- to moderate-income individuals. Last year, Utah received more than $4 million in CDBG money. 
   In FY 2007, the government approved $3.8 billion for the program, but the FY 2007 continuing resolution reduced funding for the program by $400 million. President Bush's FY 2008 budget proposes to cut funding even further to $3.04 billion. 
   "While I support the President's efforts to rein in the budget deficit, I do not believe we should balance the budget on the backs of local communities," Hatch said. "Utah's communities rely on CDBG funding to help revitalize neighborhoods, and these cuts would severely impact the very communities with the greatest need."
