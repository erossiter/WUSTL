SEN. HATCH SAYS STEM CELL VETO DISAPPOINTING
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today vowed to continue his fight for increased federal support of embryonic stem cell research following President George W. Bush's decision to veto S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   "This veto was expected, but it's still disappointing," Hatch said. "Support continues to grow - both in Congress and in the public - and it's only a matter of time before the federal government gets fully behind this research."
   A longtime proponent of embryonic stem cell research, Hatch said he would back an attempt by Senate leadership to override the veto in the coming weeks.
