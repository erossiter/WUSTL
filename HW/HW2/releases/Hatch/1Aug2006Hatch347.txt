SEN. HATCH: AGENCY HEAD OPENS DOOR TO NEW DIVINE STRAKE SITE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today met with Dr. James Tegnelia, Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), about the proposed Divine Strake test, which will use conventional explosives, at the Nevada Test Site. Hatch has long expressed concern about the proximity of the site to previous nuclear testing sites. During the meeting, Dr. Tegnelia told Sen. Hatch that DTRA will "look into the possibility of other locations" for the Divine Strake test. 
   "I had a constructive meeting with Director Tegnelia," Hatch said. "I believe he now clearly understands the unique sensitivities that the people of Utah have regarding this subject. I am also very pleased that DTRA will now consider moving the experiment to a different location."
   In a separate announcement, DTRA informed the Utah Congressional Delegation that the earliest that Divine Strake experiment could be conducted would be at least "several months" into 2007. The agency also announced that it had ceased physical preparations at the site.
