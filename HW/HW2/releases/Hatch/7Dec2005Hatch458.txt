CONGRESS APPROVES BEAVER COUNTY LAND TRANSFER
  Yesterday, the House of Representatives approved legislation sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) to transfer Minersville State Park ownership to Beaver County, Utah, and allow the county to enhance this popular attraction. 
   "This is great news for Beaver County," Hatch said. "Congressman Cannon and I have worked with Beaver officials and the state for a long time to resolve this because we all agree that local officials are best equipped to manage the park. By acquiring this property, Beaver County will continue to make the park an excellent recreational refuge, a superb fishery, and a great place to visit." 
   For more than 40 years, the State of Utah managed the area known as the Minersville State Park. The state agreed in 2002 to transfer park management to Beaver County; however, the Bureau of Land Management noted that the property itself had not been acquired through the Recreation and Public Purposes Act process, which would restrict Beaver County's park management plan. Hatch and Cannon introduced companion bills in the Senate (S. 52) and the House (H.R. 679), and the measure passed the Senate on July 27. The legislation removes the federal restrictions by transferring the park ownership to Beaver County. 
   Hatch has been pressing to convey the land to Beaver County for more than two years, and the measure will now be forwarded to the President for his signature.
