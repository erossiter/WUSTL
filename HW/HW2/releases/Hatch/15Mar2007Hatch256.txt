SEN. HATCH LAND EXCHANGE BILL TO IMPROVE PAROWAN'S CAMP THUNDER RIDGE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today introduced legislation to allow the exchange of two small parcels of land between the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Utah National Parks Council and Brian Head Ski Resort. The additional land will allow the Scouts to expand their archery and rifle ranges and offer better camping areas at Parowan's Camp Thunder Ridge.  
   "This small land exchange will make it an even better experience for Utah's Scouts at Camp Thunder Ridge," Hatch said. "They'll have larger, safer shooting ranges, and additional clear, flat land for camping. BSA and Brian Head want to make the swap, but Congress needs to approve before the exchange can go through. This will be a tremendous help to the Boy Scouts program in Utah." 
   In 1983, the Bureau of Land Management gave the BSA roughly 1,300 acres near Parowan, Utah, for a Boy Scout camp. Under the agreement, land cannot be sold or exchanged without Congressional action. Hatch's bill would allow the BSA to give 120 acres on the south end of the camp to Brian Head in exchange for 120 acres on the eastern side of the camp, including 40 acres inside the camp's boundaries.
