SENATE BILL CONTAINS $7.7 MILLION FOR HILL AIR FORCE BASE PROJECT
  Last night, the United States Senate unanimously approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill (H.R. 4837), which contains $7.7 million in funding for an ICBM Propellant Analysis project at Ogden's Hill Air Force Base pushed by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). 
   "For too long now, Hill Air Force Base has performed exceedingly high-quality ICBM maintenance work with facilities that don't live up to that standard," said Hatch. "This ICBM Propellant Analysis Complex would allow Hill to expand their workload and upgrade their equipment, as well as increase the life of these weapons and provide more accurate data analysis. Clearly, this complex is necessary to allow Hill to best support our forces." 
   A conference committee will now negotiate the differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 4837.
