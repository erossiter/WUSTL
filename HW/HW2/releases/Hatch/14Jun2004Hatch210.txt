SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON SUWA CASE: FINALLY, LAND MANAGERS CAN MAKE LAND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS
 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) praised today's decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA).  
 This morning, the Court unanimously overruled the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, finding that federal land managers should have flexibility to adjust land management plans.
   "It's about time we started letting land managers make land management decisions," said Hatch. "We've about had it in Utah with environmental groups trying to micromanage, through the courts, decisions that should be left to the professionals on the ground. Today, the Supreme Court has said, 'Enough is enough, let's let the professionals do their jobs.'"
   In its decision, the Court ruled that the Bureau of Land Management is not constrained to follow its own management plans but should have the flexibility to change their plans with changing circumstances and priorities.
