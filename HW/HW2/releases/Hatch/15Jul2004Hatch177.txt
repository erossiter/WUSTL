SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON SIGNING OF IDENTITY THEFT BILL INTO LAW
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today praised President Bush at the signing of HR 1731, The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, into law.  
 Senator Hatch joined President Bush for The White House ceremony in the Roosevelt Room and issued the following statement: 
   "The fight against identity theft is among the greatest challenges facing law enforcement officers today. 
   "Identity theft is not only one of the fastest growing crimes in America, it is also one of the most sinister. Victims are left to face investigations by credit card companies, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies - while the real offender remains behind the scenes, unless and until the victim succeeds in clearing his or her good name. 
   "In addition to ensuring that victims have adequate means by which they can restore their identities, we also need to effectively stem the steady growth of identity theft. The signing of this bill will provide meaningful tools to the Department of Justice so that this problem can be attacked on all fronts."
