SENATE BILL INCLUDES $66 MILLION FOR SOUTHERN UTAH FLOODING
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today praised the Senate Appropriations Committee for including a recommendation for $66 million for flood damages in Utah in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill.  
   "During my visits to the flood damaged area, I knew immediately that this was the level of natural disaster that merited significant federal assistance," Hatch said, "I've worked very hard to convince Chairman Thad Cochran that Washington County deserves relief in the supplemental. I made clear to the chairman that this was my highest appropriations priority this year." Hatch had joined Senator Reid in a letter last week to Appropriations Committee Chairman Cochran (R-Miss.) asking that money for flood victims in Utah and Nevada be included in the Supplemental. 
   "This money will go to the Natural Resource Conservation Service to help them restore the flood damage caused to the river beds of the Virgin and Santa Clara Rivers," said Hatch. "Washington County residents deserve the protection this work will give them after what they've been through."
