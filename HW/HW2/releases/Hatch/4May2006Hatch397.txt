UTAHNS CAN JOIN IN IMPORTANT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE DISCUSSION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today urged Utahns to participate in a nationwide discussion on how best to improve our health care system. This Saturday, the Citizens' Health Care Working Group will seek the input of Utahns at the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown Hotel as it prepares a report for Congress.  
   "We need to bypass all the parochial interests and come together to deal with our urgent health crisis," Hatch said. "Nearly 300,000 Utahns lack health insurance, and that grew by 40,000 over the past year. The Working Group gets outside Washington and hears from everyday citizens about what they like and don't like about the current system. Our goal, when the process is finished, is to find a national consensus on how best to improve health care in America." 
   Hatch joined Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to create the Citizens' Health Care Working Group as part of the "Health Care that Works for All Americans" law. This law gives Americans the chance to weigh in online and at town hall meetings - like the one in Salt Lake City this weekend - about how to best address the challenges facing the current health care system. The Working Group will use the information from these meetings to prepare a report for Congress that could be the basis for legislation. 
   All Utahns interested in the state of America's health care system are invited to attend Saturday's meeting, which will be held at the Salt Lake City Marriott Downtown Hotel, 75 South West Temple from 8:00 a.m. until noon. The public can also provide input by visiting www.citizenshealthcare.gov and sharing their views online. 
   The Working Group was first authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
