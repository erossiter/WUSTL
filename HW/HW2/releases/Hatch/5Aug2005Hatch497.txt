PROVO CITY TO RECEIVE GRANT TO COMBAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Orrin Hatch announced today that Provo City will receive a grant of $483,158 to strengthen the safety of victims of domestic violence, dating violence and child abuse living in rural areas by enhancing partnerships with community agencies who respond to crimes of violence against women and child abuse.  
 This grant program implements certain provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) which Sen. Hatch sponsored and passed in 1994. 
   "I am gratified to see VAWA providing tremendous benefits to my home state," stated Hatch. "This program will help protect some of our most vulnerable citizens from domestic violence and child abuse. It also helps coordinate the vital efforts of those working on the front lines to combat the scourge of these acts of violence. I firmly believe that working together we can make a tremendous impact on discouraging and preventing violence, as well as help provide important services to those who are unfortunately victims of these cowardly and violent acts." 
   Provo City will partner with the Provo Police Department, the Center for Women and Children in Crisis, the Centro Hispano, the Children's Justice Center, and the Utah County Domestic Violence Coalition. The project is designed to achieve five objectives: support and supervise a Child Victim Assistant to work with non-offending parents and children who are victims of domestic violence; provide crisis intervention and assistance through the criminal justice process; coordinate resources and service to address immediate and long term needs of victims of domestic violence; provide training for County police officers; and provide additional community education and awareness programs.
