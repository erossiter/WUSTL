SEN. HATCH APPOINTED CONFEREE TO ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was named today as a member of the House-Senate conference committee that will draw up the final comprehensive energy bill.  
   "For too long, Congress has failed to pass an energy bill, but I believe this is the year that we'll get it done," Hatch said. "The President has made enacting a comprehensive bill a priority, and Congress has passed legislation with strong bipartisan support. I have a number of provisions in the Senate bill that I believe will make a significant impact on prices and enhancing our energy security." 
   The Senate passed an energy bill, H.R. 6, which contains a number of provisions to increase energy production, increase conservation, diversify fuel supply and employ new technologies. Hatch authored several of these provisions, which are listed below: 
   * Clean Efficient Vehicles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies (CLEAR Act, S. 971): The CLEAR ACT provides tax incentives to consumers who purchase alternative-fuel and hybrid-electric vehicles, tax incentives at the pump for the purchase of alternative transportation fuels, and tax incentives for the purchase and installation of alternative fueling equipment. 
   * Oil Shale and Tar Sands Development Act of 2005 (S. 1111): The Senate accepted an amendment to the Energy bill that is a slightly modified version of Hatch's bill to encourage development of fuel from a vast untapped domestic oil reserve in tar sands and oil shale. Energy experts estimate the United States has more recoverable oil from this resource - located mainly in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming - than in the entire Middle East. 
   * Gas Price Reduction Through Increased Refining Capacity Act (S. 1039): This provision would provide for accelerated depreciation for new refineries or for refineries that are increasing their capacity. The economics of refining are so tough that the United States has lost nearly 200 refineries since the last one was built in the 1970s. Domestic refineries are unable to meet American demand, so the country is currently importing refined oil products to make up the difference. Hatch's provision would allow refiners who commit to starting construction on new or expanded refining equipment before 2008 and have new facilities built by 2012 to completely write off their new equipment in the first year instead of over the current 10-year depreciation schedule. 
   * Geothermal and Renewable Resources (S. 1156): This provision would promote geothermal energy, a domestic energy source that could provide energy to more than 22 million homes if fully developed. Experts say Utah has one of the largest underground hot water reservoirs in the nation, and Hatch's measure would provide tax incentives for electricity produced from renewable energy facilities placed in service before January 1, 2008. 
   * Mineral Leasing Act Amendment (S. 53): The provision would increase natural gas production by amending the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the Secretary of the Interior to issue separately, for the same area, a lease for tar sands and a lease for oil and gas. The requirement for industry to obtain leases for both mining and gas extraction activities before gas can be extracted has hampered new production of gas in tar sand areas.
