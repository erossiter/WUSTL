HELP COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. HATCH SUPPLEMENT-CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT
  Adverse event reporting legislation sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) easily cleared its first hurdle today. The measure, which would create a mandatory reporting system for serious adverse events associated with dietary supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, was favorably reported by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and will now go before the full Senate.  
   "This is a good bill that helps the Food and Drug Administration immediately respond to serious problems," Hatch said. "I'm grateful the Committee moved so quickly on this bill. We all know that the vast majority of supplements and over-the-counter drugs are safe, but this bill will help protect consumers from serious health risks should they arise." 
   The bill, S. 3546, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, would require manufacturers, packers or distributors of OTC drugs or dietary supplements in the United States to tell the FDA within 15 business days any reports of a serious adverse event associated with their products. Serious events include those that result in death, a life-threatening experience, inpatient hospitalization, disability or incapacity, birth defect, or medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of these outcomes. 
   S. 3546 has broad bipartisan support, along with the backing of supplement and consumer-protection groups such as the Consumer's Union, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the National Nutritional Foods Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the American Herbal Products Association, and the United Natural Products Alliance.
