SEN. HATCH PRAISES ARREST OF ECOTERRORISTS IN UTAH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today praised Utah law enforcement for their efforts in the battle to bring ecoterrorists to justice.  
 The efforts resulted in the recent arrest of two individuals in connection with arson at a West Jordan, Utah lumberyard and at Brigham Young University. 
   "Today is a good day for law abiding citizens, and a bad day for the ecoterrorists," said Hatch. 
   "Several months ago I called on the FBI, ATF, and United States Attorney Paul Warner to vigorously investigate, indict and prosecute the ecoterrorists responsible for the attacks on the lumberyard in West Jordan and BYU," continued Hatch. "I am pleased with the announcement from Mr. Warner that his office, together with a litany of federal, state and local police forces, has indicted the persons they believe responsible for the fires at the lumberyard and BYU." 
   "This is a positive step," continued Hatch. "We cannot and we will not stop here. We must continue to track down and prosecute those who believe they can advance their extremist agenda by destroying property, jobs, and lives." 
   Senator Hatch chaired a hearing on May 18, entitled, "Animal Rights: Activism v. Criminality." At the hearing, Hatch stated: "In recent years, some radical activist groups have gone well beyond what any reasonably minded person would consider protest. Their tactics include: vandalizing and pipe bombing research facilities; credit card fraud; threatening employees of businesses and research companies; terrorizing children of employees; and posting death threats against employees as well as employees' names, addresses, and phone numbers on the Internet."
