SEN. HATCH DEFENDS TELECOM IMMUNITY IN FISA REAUTHORIZATION
 Today Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) spoke out in support of legislation granting limited immunity to electronic communication service providers alleged to have assisted the government following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. This legislation previously cleared the Senate Intelligence Committee, which Hatch also sits on, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and is now under consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
