SENS. HATCH, LEAHY TO EXAMINE FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen.  
 Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today announced that they will hold a hearing on July 13, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. in Room 226 of the Senate Dirksen Office Building to examine the recent Supreme Court decision in Blakely v. Washington and its impact on the federal sentencing guideline system. 
   "Several district courts across the country have declared the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional in light of the Blakely opinion," said Hatch. "Obviously, this will potentially have an enormous impact on our criminal justice system. We have the premiere criminal justice system in the world, in part because the sentencing procedures are well settled and uniform." 
   "Whatever changes may be necessary, uniformity and justice must be the driving forces, just as they were twenty years ago when we established the United States Sentencing Commission with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984," continued Hatch. "With that in mind, I intend to closely scrutinize this decision and expect the Department of Justice, the U.S. Sentencing Commission and others to be prepared to address the implications of Blakely in detail." 
   "The Blakely decision is the latest setback for the federal sentencing guidelines," Leahy said. "The Judiciary Committee should take the lead in restoring the guidelines system that Congress created 20 years ago to bring consistency and proportionality to an often arbitrary and unfair process."
