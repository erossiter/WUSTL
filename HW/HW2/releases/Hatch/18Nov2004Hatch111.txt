REPUBLICANS ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT SEN. SPECTER AS CHAIRMAN
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined all of the current Republican members of the Judiciary Committee today to voice unanimous support for Sen.  
 Arlen Specter (R-Penn.) to serve as the next chairman. This comes after widespread concerns about recent remarks by Specter. 
   "People have spoken out about this situation because they want the obstructionism to end so that good judges can be appointed," Hatch said. "I share those priorities, and Senators on both sides of the aisle have heard that message loud and clear." 
   "The question is whether Senator Specter, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will treat President Bush's judicial nominees fairly, insist on up-or-down votes in the full Senate, and support their confirmation," Hatch continued. "Based on his record, the discussions we have had, and his statement today, we all believe he will do just that." 
   Specter issued a statement today that reaffirmed he will not use a litmus test to deny confirmation to pro-life nominees. His full statement may be viewed at http://specter.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&PressRelease_id=673&Month=11&Year=2004 
   Today's announcement made public how the current Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee intend to vote when committee assignments are formally approved at the start of the 109th Congress. The actual vote will take place on January 4, 2005.
