SEN. HATCH MEETS WITH MIERS
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today met with White House Counsel Harriet Miers, President Bush's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 Hatch issued the following statement: 
   "Ms. Miers is a very bright, intelligent woman, and she is well-deserving of this nomination. Some of my fellow conservatives have concerns, but they don't know her as I do. She is an astute woman with a solid sense of what's right and wrong. She is the type of nominee that President Bush has always said he would select -- a strict constructionist who will interpret the law and not legislate from the bench. I look forward to learning more about her judicial philosophy during the upcoming Senate hearings."
