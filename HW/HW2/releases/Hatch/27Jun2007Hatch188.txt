SENATE COMMITTEE CLEARS LANDMARK BIOLOGICS BILL
  The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee today unanimously approved legislation authorizing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve low-cost versions of biologic therapies used to treat cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases. The measure is the result of months of bipartisan negotiations between Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and other top Senate leaders on health care.  
   "Biologics are the future of medicine, and this bill ensures that we will continue to lead the world in biotechnology," Hatch said. "We've achieved a good balance here. We give incentives to continue robust biological development. We allow generic companies to do what they do best - bring lower-cost medications to the market. And we ensure that patients and providers not only have access to low-cost biologics, but that these medications are also safe." 
   Called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2007, the legislation is patterned after the landmark 1984 law authored by Hatch and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) that built the modern generic drug industry. Biologics are not chemical drugs; they are very complicated molecules, such as insulin, that are not easily produced. Since biologics were not covered under Hatch-Waxman in 1984, Hatch saw a need to create a framework for the FDA to follow to bring safe, low-cost versions of biologics to consumers. 
   Key provisions of the bill include the following: 
   * Creates an abbreviated pathway the FDA will use to approve "safe, pure, and potent" biosimilar products, the legal standard for biological approvals. 
   * Gives incentives for innovators to continue developing new breakthroughs in biologics. The incentive is crucial because currently those incentives only lie in patent law. And because the low-cost versions will be only similar, but not identical, it was unclear if all of the innovator's patents would be protected. 
   * Creates a mechanism to resolve legal challenges to the follow-on products. It allows innovators, generics, and the universities that partner with them in developing biologics, to adjudicate expeditiously whether or not follow-on products are violating an innovator's intellectual property rights. 
   * Allows FDA to determine if a biosimilar product is interchangeable, meaning that it could be substituted at the pharmacy level under state law. Under the law, FDA can designate a product as interchangeable if it is biosimilar in composition and action in the body and if the patient is not harmed by switching from one product to another. 
   * Bases its guidance on scientific standards that FDA has always relied on, giving tremendous deference to FDA in developing and administering the new program.
