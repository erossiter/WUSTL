BANKRUPTCY REFORM PASSES SENATE
  Landmark legislation to reform the nation's bankruptcy system was approved by a bipartisan majority of the United States Senate today. Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) praised the bill, the first major reform of bankruptcy laws in more than 25 years. 
   "This bill is about fairness and accountability," said Hatch. "Bankruptcy claims have skyrocketed since the last major bankruptcy reform bill in 1978. We all know about the abuses of the system. Well, that is about to change for the better. 
   "This bill may not lead to a severe reduction in the number of bankruptcies," said Hatch. "But I do believe that it will reduce the number of fraudulent and abusive filings and help educate consumers to keep their financial houses in order." 
   S.256, The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, now moves to the House for consideration.
