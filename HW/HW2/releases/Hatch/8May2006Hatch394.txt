SEN. HATCH COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF HAYDEN TO HEAD CIA
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement following the nomination of Gen. Michael Hayden as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI):  
   "I welcome the President's nomination. General Hayden certainly has the experience to lead the CIA, along with the confidence of many in the intelligence community and the President. 
   "This will be the first nomination to head the CIA since we created the Director of National Intelligence. We're facing significant challenges, and I look forward to hearing how General Hayden intends to work with Ambassador Negroponte and the President to help the CIA better combat those seeking to harm our country."
