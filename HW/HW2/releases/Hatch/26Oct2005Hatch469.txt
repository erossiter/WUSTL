PRESIDENT SIGNS FIREARM PROTECTION BILL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today joined President George W. Bush at the White House as the President signed into law a bill to provide protection for gun manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits.  
 Hatch was a leading co-sponsor of the measure, S. 397, the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. 
   "These junk lawsuits strike at the heart of the Second Amendment in America," Hatch said. "Those who are truly negligent should certainly be held liable for their actions. But many trial lawyers have attacked gun manufacturers for simply providing firearms to our military and private citizens. The right to bear arms is a guarantee backed by our Founding Fathers, and this law ensures that those who make this guarantee possible are not bankrupted by a flood of frivolous lawsuits." 
   S. 397, which passed Congress overwhelmingly, prohibits civil liability actions in any state or federal court against firearms manufacturers, distributors, dealers and importers, and it also dismisses all pending litigation. 
   The law does not apply to lawsuits against those who knowingly sell or transfer firearms intended to be used for a crime, or in cases in which proper use of a defected firearm resulted in physical injury, death or property damage.
