ANOTHER ACTIVIST JUDGE RULES AGAINST PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement in reaction to the ruling by Judge Richard Casey of the Southern District of New York in National Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft.  
   "Partial Birth Abortion not only terminates the life of a viable child, it also dehumanizes a culture that permits it. 
   "The vast majority of Utahns and Americans recognize that Partial Birth Abortion is immoral and impossible to justify. Yesterday's ruling was a step back, but I remain confident that ultimately the Constitution will prevail over these erroneous judicial decisions. 
   "This decision is a disappointment. Judge Richard Casey agreed with the Government that Partial Birth Abortion is 'gruesome, brutal, barbaric, and uncivilized.' He concluded that the unborn child suffers 'severe pain.' And most importantly, he determined that the medical reasons advanced by its extreme advocates were 'false,' 'incoherent,' or 'merely theoretical.' 
   "This district court imposed a 'consensus' test that the government can only fail. The day will never come when there is no 'division of medical opinion' on Partial Birth Abortion or any other medical procedure. If every person in the medical profession must agree for there to be 'consensus,' Congress can never succeed. 
   "The Courts owe greater respect to the congressional judgment, formed through eight years of intense study, that this gruesome procedure is never medically necessary. 
   "We can no longer leave unborn children exposed to this brutal procedure in the erroneous name of justice."
