SEN. HATCH OPPOSES IMMIGRATION DEAL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today voted against allowing the comprehensive immigration reform bill (S. 1639) to move to a final vote. 
   "While there's a lot of good in this bill, it creates more problems than it tries to fix," Hatch said. "I voted against the last immigration 'solution' in 1986. It failed, and this one, in some respects, is worse."
   Hatch raised a number of concerns with the bill, including the structure of the Z visa program, flaws in the electronic verification system, and loopholes in the guest worker and agriculture programs.
   "I was hopeful that with more time, we could find an approach that Utahns and the American people could accept," Hatch continued. "But it's clear that's not the Senate's intent. There's a unified block of Senators who are committed to knocking down any amendment that would address the serious flaws in this bill. The status quo isn't acceptable, but that shouldn't drive us to pass a bad bill."
