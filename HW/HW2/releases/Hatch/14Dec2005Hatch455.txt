SEN. HATCH COSPONSORS ON-SITE STORAGE BILL
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today joined Utah and Nevada Senators in introducing legislation to allow the Federal government to take title and assume liability of spent nuclear fuel on site at reactors.  
 Hatch noted that this is one aspect of a broader approach he proposed as an amendment to the Senate energy bill last July. 
   "This country faces an imminent nuclear waste disposal problem," Hatch said. "That's what led to the lamebrained Skull Valley plan in the first place. This bill is a way to take the pressure off the need for Skull Valley. My support for it does not change my support for Yucca Mountain, although it is clear that I am pursuing other reasonable or acceptable approaches to solving the disposal problem. Rather, it shows that I stand with the Senators from Nevada and Utah in signaling that the government must develop a nuclear waste disposal policy, the sooner the better. My overall strategy is, and will continue to be, to help resolve that problem through promoting safe and reasonable alternatives."
