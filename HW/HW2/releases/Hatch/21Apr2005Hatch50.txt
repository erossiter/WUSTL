SENATE PASSES BILL WITH $66 MILLION FOR UTAH FLOOD RELIEF
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today voted with his colleagues in unanimously approving a Supplemental Appropriations bill that includes $66 million dollars in flood relief for Southwestern Utah, money which Hatch had repeatedly requested since floods devastated much of the area earlier this year. The bill will now move to a conference committee to resolve differences with legislation passed by the House.  
   "During my many visits to the St. George area following the flooding, it became obvious that we were going to need significant federal help," Hatch said. "Not only do we need to repair bridges, roads and other infrastructure, but we need to ensure this doesn't happen again - we know there is a real chance of more flooding early this summer. I've worked very hard to convince Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran that Washington County deserves relief in the Supplemental. I made clear to the chairman that this was my highest appropriations priority for the Supplemental Appropriations bill." 
   Hatch had joined Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in writing a letter last month to Chairman Cochran (R-Miss.) asking that money for flood victims in Utah and Nevada be included in the Supplemental. 
   "This money will go to the Natural Resource Conservation Service to help them restore the flood damage caused to the river beds of the Virgin and Santa Clara Rivers," said Hatch. "Washington County residents deserve the protection this restoration will give them after what they've been through." 
   The bill, H.R. 1268, also contains significant new funding for Border Patrol operations, including new personnel and money for more holding cells. 
   "This bill provides much-needed money for the Border Patrol," said Hatch. "We have simply got to do a better job of enforcing our porous borders. It's a matter of national security as well as a matter of upholding the law."
