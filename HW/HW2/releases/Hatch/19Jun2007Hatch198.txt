SEN. HATCH DECRIES SENATE ACTION ON SO-CALLED EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement in response to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) decision to file cloture on the so-called Employee Free Choice Act (H.R. 800). The act would rob workers of the time-tested right to a private vote when deciding whether or not to form a union, thus exposing workers to potential intimidation and reciprocity by both union leaders and employers, depending on how they vote.  
   "I was a card-carrying member of a AFL-CIO when I was a metal lather in my youth," Hatch said. "I understand the role unions have played in our nation's history and their importance in protecting the rights of workers, but this bill crushes the basic democratic principle of a private ballot. I regret that Democrats seem more interested in catering to Big Labor than they are in workers' rights."
