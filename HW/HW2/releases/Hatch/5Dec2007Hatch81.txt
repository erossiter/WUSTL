SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES TWO NEW IMMIGRATION, CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AGENTS FOR OGDEN CITY
  Senator Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT) announced today that the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has agreed to his request for two additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to be assigned to Ogden, Utah.  
   The Senator received this news today from DHS stating that they will be adding to the Ogden ICE Office a criminal investigator to work in the Office of Investigations, and an immigration enforcement agent to work in Detention and Renewal. 
   "This is huge news for Ogden and their efforts to curb criminal activities related to illegal immigration problems," stated Hatch. "Ogden Mayor Matthew Godfrey has been particularly concerned about the illegal alien criminal gangs which have been proliferating in Ogden. I brought his concerns to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and he responded in a very positive way for Ogden, and for Utah. 
   "In 1998 I was able to get a Quick Response Team (QRT) assigned to Ogden, a city where previously there had been no immigration enforcement presence," added Hatch. "The announcement today is another positive step forward in combating the proliferation of illegal immigrants and the effect it has on our state's communities. These two new agents are very necessary resources at a critical time." 
   Senator Hatch also stated he would be following up with officials in Ogden to make certain agents are in place as soon as possible. Ogden's ICE Office currently has four special agents, including the Resident Agent in Charge; and two immigration enforcement agents.
