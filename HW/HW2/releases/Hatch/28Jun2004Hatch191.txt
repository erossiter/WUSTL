SEN. HATCH ISSUES STATEMENT ON RUMSFELD V. PADILLA DECISION
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following reaction the Supreme Court's decision on Rumsfeld v. Padilla.  
   "Whether a terrorist is an American citizen or a foreign national, a terrorist is a terrorist. Jose Padilla poses an unprecedented threat to our national security and the decision to detain him as an enemy combatant was made to save lives. 
   "Based upon responses from the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense to my inquiries, it is clear that Jose Padilla has had ties to terrorist training camps and Al Qaeda for four years. Padilla became well versed in the use of explosives and conspired with senior Al Qaeda leaders on plans to blow up residential apartment buildings using gas lines and contemplated detonating a "dirty bomb" in the United States. He then traveled to the United States to carry out terrorist attacks on behalf of Al Qaeda. 
   "Today's Supreme Court decision was based on procedural grounds and not if Jose Padilla can be held in the Charleston brig. However, when the time comes for a federal court to address this matter on the merits, I am confident that it will see the unique danger posed by individuals such as Jose Padilla and respond accordingly."
