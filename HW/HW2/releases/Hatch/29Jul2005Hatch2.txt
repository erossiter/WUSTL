SEN. HATCH PUTS THE BRAKES ON TRAFFIC.COM
  The multi-year transportation bill set to pass Congress includes a provision sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that levels the playing field for small businesses in Utah to compete for federal money to collect traffic data. 
   "One large company should not have a monopoly on traffic data collection," Hatch said. "Commuters should benefit from the innovative solutions coming from small businesses in Utah and in other states, not funnel millions of dollars each year to a company that doesn't have to compete for the money." 
   Hatch's provision opens the doors for qualified companies, including Lindon, Utah-based Wavetronix, to receive Federal funding to help collect real-time data on traffic conditions. Currently, a Pennsylvania-based company, Traffic.com, has sole discretion over the funds to develop infrastructure to collect traffic data. Hatch altered the program to allow state departments of transportation to access these funds without requiring them to work with Traffic.com. 
   "Wavetronix is thrilled with this outcome and grateful for the time and effort expended by Senator Hatch on our behalf," said John Wasden, vice president at Wavetronix LLC. "As a small traffic technology company based in Lindon, this new language is important to us because it removes an earmark that gave a competitor unfair advantages in some of our country's largest markets. We have worked to improve this bill for several months and know that without Senator Hatch taking the lead on this issue and using his position and influence, this never would have happened."
