SEN. HATCH TO SERVE ON FOUR TOP SENATE COMMITEES
  Senate Republicans today released committee assignments for the 110th Congress, and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) will remain on the four committees on which he served last Congress: Finance; Judiciary; Intelligence and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).  
   "Nobody has a better portfolio," Hatch said. "It was important to me to stay on all four committees - each one is critical to Utah." 
   Noting that there are fewer committee spots in the minority, Hatch said: "I'm grateful Senate leadership has confidence in my effectiveness in handling the tough issues considered in these four pivotal committees and made the extraordinary move to keep me there." 
   The second-most senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, Hatch will be heavily involved with legislation regarding taxes, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and trade. In addition, his seniority would give him a seat on numerous conference committees that involve taxes, including energy- and transportation-related legislation. 
   Hatch aggressively sought to remain on the HELP Committee next Congress, given its agenda will include issues important to Utah, including access to health care, No Child Left Behind and extending drug and device user fees. He also has a keen interest in dietary supplement issues, which come before the committee. 
   Having served on the Judiciary Committee for 30 years, Hatch is internationally recognized as a leader on legal issues, and he will remain a powerful point man for President George W. Bush as the President seeks to confirm his remaining judicial nominations. 
   Hatch's selection to Intelligence will give him a strong voice in overseeing the War on Terror and other intelligence activities to protect the nation's security and its interests abroad.
