SENATE ACTS TO PROTECT SENIORS FROM FRAUD
  Last night, the United States Senate unanimously approved a resolution co-sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) designating October 2004 as "Protecting Older Americans from Fraud Month." 
   "Scam artists view seniors as prime targets for fraud," said Hatch, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aging. "Seniors are targeted for 'investment opportunities' that leave them victim to identity fraud, bogus health offers, and huge financial losses. 
   "The problem is only getting worse," Hatch continued. "Last year, we saw an 80 percent increase of Internet fraud targeting seniors and an astounding 375 percent increase in money lost through Internet fraud from 2002 to 2003, from $2.7 million to $12.8 million. That's why we're stepping up our efforts in launching a nationwide campaign to protect seniors from fraud." 
   This month, a broad group of federal and private organizations led by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service will launch campaign built around a series of consumer education, awareness, and media events designed to highlight fraud and make seniors aware of the resources available should they become a victim. 
   As part of this campaign, the Postal Inspection Service will release a film, "Dialing for Dollars," featuring an investment fraud scheme that targets older Americans. The film underscores how easy it is for seniors from all walks of life to fall prey to the high-pressure sales tactics of the professional scam artist, and it prompts discussion on both the national and community level to develop strategies to address this problem.
