SEN. HATCH: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REVEALS EXTENSIVE CONTACTS BETWEEN PADILLA, AL QAEDA
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today released information received from the Departments of Justice and Defense regarding enemy combatant Jose Padilla and his extensive contacts with al Qaeda, including several top associates of Osama bin Laden. 
   "The information released today confirms the very real and dangerous threat posed by Jose Padilla," said Hatch. "Mr. Padilla admits that after actively applying for and participating in a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, he proposed to Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, al Qaeda's leading operational planner and organizer, and 9/11 co-conspirator Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, a plan to detonate a nuclear "dirty bomb" as well as commit other terrorist attacks in the United States. He had received funding from them and was in the process of returning to America to carry out this plan when he was detained by U.S. officials at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. I understand this information has been corroborated by other al Qaeda operatives."
   "Unfortunately, this information confirms that America faces very serious threats from enemies both foreign and domestic," said Hatch. "I anticipate a more detailed discussion of this issue, as well as other terrorism related issues, when Attorney General John Ashcroft and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge testify before the Judiciary Committee next week during the oversight hearings."
   The information was provided to Chairman Hatch in response to his written request to Ashcroft on April 22, 2004.
