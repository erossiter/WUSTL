UTAH MARINE HELD HOSTAGE IN MIDDLE EAST
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) released the following statement on the kidnapping of Utah Marine Corporal Wassef Ali Hassoun by terrorists in the Middle East:  
   "Sunday brought terrible news for all Utahns: one of our own has been taken hostage by terrorists in Iraq. I talked to General Michael Hagee, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, Monday morning and was assured this incident is the Corps's highest priority in that troubled region. I will continue to monitor the situation. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers go to the Hassoun family in West Jordan and I know all Utahns join me in praying that our neighbor is delivered from the hands of these criminals."
