SEN. HATCH ASKS FEDS TO GRANT FLOOD AID
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today called on the Bush Administration to grant immediate federal relief aid to Washington County, which has seen its worst flooding since 1862.  
   "The damage in Washington County is unbelievable," Hatch said. "Homes have literally vanished, and some communities are so surrounded by water that we're airlifting supplies to help them survive. They need federal aid to rebuild and restore the infrastructure that's been destroyed by these terrible floods." 
   Following Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s emergency declaration, Hatch contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to expedite aid to Washington County. FEMA is putting together a damage assessment team that will arrive as early as Thursday to tour the area before making a recommendation to the White House. 
   "The community response has been tremendous," Hatch said. "Emergency response teams have been heroic, and neighbors are sheltering neighbors, working together to save their homes and protect their families. But they can't rebuild the community alone. I know the federal government will do everything in its power to help Washington County get back on its feet."
