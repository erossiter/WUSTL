SENATE PASSES SEN. HATCH 'FEED AMERICA THURSDAY' RESOLUTION
  Last night, the United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) that designates Nov. 17, the Thursday before Thanksgiving Day, as "Feed America Thursday." 
   "Too many Americans suffer from hunger each day," Hatch said. "Feed America Thursday gives all of us the opportunity to help those in need so no one will go hungry during this Thanksgiving season." 
   The resolution, S. Res. 314, encourages Americans to sacrifice two meals on Nov. 17 and donate the money they would have used for food to a charity or religious organization of their choice. The charities and churches, in turn, are encouraged to feed the hungry with the funds received. Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah) has sponsored a similar resolution (H. Res. 528) in the House. 
   The United States Department of Agriculture has reported that 33 million Americans, 13 million of whom are children, live in homes that do not have an adequate supply of food. The contributions this resolution encourages will serve the needs of those who suffer from hunger in our nation.
