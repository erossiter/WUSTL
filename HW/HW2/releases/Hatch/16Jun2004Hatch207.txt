SEN. HATCH DENOUNCES APPARENT ECOTERROR ATTACK IN UTAH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today reacted with anger and disgust to the attack apparently committed by environmental extremists on a lumberyard in West Jordan, Utah. 
   "It appears this is the latest of a series of attacks perpetrated by militant extremists who believe they can advance their extreme agenda by destroying lives and jobs," said Hatch. "These are criminal acts, and we need to put a stop to ecoterrorists and to any group giving them aid or comfort."
   "I've asked the ATF and the FBI to go after the perpetrators of this attack with all the resources it takes," Hatch continued. "Just last month, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held hearings on the best way to fight ecoterrorism, and this attack only confirms the need for us to take tougher action against this type of activity."
   At the hearing Hatch chaired on May 18, titled, "Animal Rights: Activism v. Criminality," Hatch stated: "In recent years, some radical activist groups have gone well beyond what any reasonably minded person would consider protest. Their tactics include: vandalizing and pipe bombing research facilities; credit card fraud; threatening employees of businesses and research companies; terrorizing children of employees; and posting death threats against employees as well as employees' names, addresses, and phone numbers on the internet."
   Today, Hatch added: "I am examining the criminal code to determine what changes can be made to give law enforcement agencies the tools and resources they need to combat this version of domestic terrorism."
