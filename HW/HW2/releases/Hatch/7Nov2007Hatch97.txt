SEN. HATCH GETS NEARLY $60 MILLION FOR UTAH ORGANIZATIONS IN DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senator Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT) was able to arrange for tens of millions of dollars for Utah companies and military installations in the final Defense Appropriations Conference Report which should be voted on shortly by the U. S. Senate. 
   "The military and defense work performed in Utah has played a key role for many years in the security and defense of our country," stated Hatch. "I fought hard for the funding I was able to insert in the final Defense Appropriations Bill for Utah's military installations and defense contractors. I know the work they perform is of the highest caliber and worthy of the support of the federal government."  
   The following is a partial list of the items Hatch was able to obtain funding for in the final Defense Appropriations Conference Report:
