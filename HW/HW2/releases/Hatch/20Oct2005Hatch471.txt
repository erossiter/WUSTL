SEN. HATCH: UTAH COMMUNITY, TRANSIT PROJECTS RECEIVE FUNDING IN TRANSPORTATION, TREASURY AND HUD APPROPRIATIONS BILL
 The Senate today passed the Fiscal Year 2006 Transportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Appropriations bill, H.R. 3038, which includes several Utah community development and transportation projects pushed by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah).  
   The bill contains $1 million in economic development funding for community projects Hatch requested for Provo, Eagle Mountain, and Hyrum: 
   * $600,000 for the Provo to build the Provo Community Arts Center. "Utah County has sought for years to have a high-quality arts center to host community and national theater and performing arts," Hatch said. "This funding will help start making this dream a reality: a permanent home for the arts in Provo." 
   * $200,000 for Eagle Mountain for community development and park facilities. "Eagle Mountain is one of the fastest growing communities in Utah," Hatch said. "These funds will help develop a much-needed regional park between the City's two rapidly growing population centers. A park for recreational activities will greatly benefit the many families and individuals in Eagle Mountain." 
   * $200,000 for Hyrum to build the Hyrum Library and Museum Complex. "The Hyrum Library and Museum Complex will provide the community with a vast collection of books, periodicals, videos, and other media, to enrich, entertain, and inform," Hatch said. "No doubt the Library and Museum Complex will greatly help in revitalizing downtown Hyrum." 
   The bill also contains several transit projects requested by Hatch and also Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah), who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and other members of the Utah delegation. 
   "Improving transportation is one of the state's highest priorities, and mass transit is a vital piece to providing more travel options in Utah," Hatch said. "This funding, combined with the millions secured through the transportation bill earlier this year, will make a significant impact on increasing our transit capacity." 
   Among the projects funded in today's bill are: 
   * $9 million for commuter rail 
   * $4.25 million for statewide bus and bus facilities 
   * $3 million for Regional Bus and Bus Facilities: Intermodal Terminals, including Gateway TRAX station 
   * $1 million for a Transit Center at 9400 South in Sandy 
   * $750,000 for a West Valley City Intermodal Terminal 
   * $500,000 for Sun-Tran Operations and Maintenance Facility Expansion 
   * $500,000 for Utah Intermodal Transit Hubs 
   * $500,000 for a Mid-Jordan Light Rail Transit Line 
   * $250,000 for a Westminster College Intermodal Transportation Facilities Expansion for Shuttle Buses
