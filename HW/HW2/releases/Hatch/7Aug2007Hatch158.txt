SEN. HATCH ISSUES STATEMENT ON ONGOING EFFORTS TO RESCUE MINERS TRAPPED IN GENWAL MINE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today issued the following statement about the ongoing mission to rescue six trapped minters at the Genwal Mine in Huntington, Utah.  
   "We're all anxious that this valiant recovery operation will succeed. There are six Utahns trapped under tons of rock who still need our prayers and support so we can find them, and I'm not going to give up hope until they find them. 
   "I've just talked with Acting Deputy Secretary of Labor Howard Radzely who assured me the federal government is committed to provide the resources necessary to bring these miners home safely. He also committed to working with me and the rest of the delegation to address any issues that may come out of this. 
   "It has been a difficult two days for the local and federal officials on the front lines, and I have been in touch with the Mayor of Huntington and other local officials, and let them know I stand ready to help in any way I can on the federal level. In addition, I have been briefed by officials from the Mine Safety and Health Administration and will continue to receive updates from them. I have also directed the appropriate members of my staff to be on the ground at the site to inform me completely of their needs."
