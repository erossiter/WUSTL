SEN. HATCH: U.S. NEEDS JOHN BOLTON AT U.N.
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued the following statement following the appointment of John Bolton to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations:  
   "The President's decision today was necessary and well within his rights. John Bolton's nomination was turned into a circus by a handful of Senators who- once again - abused the filibuster to prevent a qualified man to serve the President. 
   "The President has a constitutional right to nominate key people to his foreign policy team, and he has a constitutional right to make a recess appointment to ensure that a top position in this team is filled after being blocked for partisan reasons. 
   "We need a U.N. ambassador, and the President nominated someone with extensive diplomatic and foreign policy experience. This is a man that is so experienced that he's been confirmed by the Senate numerous times - including by those who now, conveniently, find him unacceptable. John Bolton has every reason to hold his head high when he arrives in New York to carry out the work the President nominated him to perform at the United Nations."
