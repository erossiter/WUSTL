SEN. HATCH OUTLINES HIGH TECH PRIORITIES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today joined the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force in outlining priorities for the 110th Congress to strengthen the American economy and improve quality of life through technological advancement. 
   "Our economy depends on innovation," Hatch said. "Over the last several years we have enjoyed economic prosperity, largely driven by the technology sector. However, the future success of the United States in today's global marketplace boils down to this simple question: Do we have the technology we need to win?"  
   Hatch's agenda for keeping America on the front of an ever-accelerating technological frontier includes an extended, ideally permanent, research tax credit; free trade agreements to remove unfair barriers in overseas markets; and streamlining the nation's patent laws. Last week, Hatch helped introduce a bipartisan, bicameral patent bill, S. 1145, to update current patent laws to provide much-needed reform for patent seekers and patent holders. 
   "We need a strong patent system to protect new ideas and American investments in innovation and creativity," Hatch said. "S. 1145 isn't perfect, but it's a perfect compromise between Republicans and Democrats in both houses. I hope that everyone on this task force, and every Republican in the Senate, will work with me to refine - and enact - this important bill this Congress." 
   The following is the full policy agenda that the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force will pursue this Congress: 
   Improve Quality of Life through Technology 
   * Promote widespread deployment and use of broadband technology by minimizing regulation on innovative new Internet services 
   * Ensure that next generation broadband products and services are delivered to all Americans through sound spectrum policies that maximize efficiency of this scarce resource 
   * Reform the Universal Service program to ensure the delivery of communications services to rural America while eliminating waste, fraud and abuse 
   * Allow more Americans to enjoy the digital revolution by ensuring that the hard date for completing the DTV transition is not extended 
   * Support effective data security legislation that both deters cyber crime and maximizes the protection of privacy without imposing unnecessary burdens on industry 
   * Urge passage of legislation that will drive the adoption of an interoperable health information network and facilitate industry-wide interoperability standards 
   * Support biotech and nanotech industries and promote a mechanism or process of technology transfer to the commercial marketplace 
   * Promote teleworking to strengthen families, improve homeland security preparedness and reduce highway congestion 
   Strengthen the Economy through Sensible Fiscal Policy 
   * Make permanent the Internet Tax Moratorium 
   * Promote a permanent R&D tax credit 
   * Repeal the regressive Federal Excise Tax on telecommunications services 
   * Accelerate and rationalize depreciation schedules for technology and broadband equipment to encourage deployment of products and services 
   * Promote a sensible tax policy for interstate communications services and technologies by eliminating the discriminatory tax policies imposed by some state and local governments 
   * Protect exciting new broadband and digital technologies and services from premature government regulation; instead encourage enforcement and market-based solutions 
   * Reduce the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's compliance burdens and impacts on small companies and mitigate unintended consequences of the Act that are impacting innovation and contributing to capital flight 
   * Encourage the private sector to develop energy efficient data centers, software and appliances, as a way of reducing both energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions 
   Eradicate Barriers to Innovation 
   * Promote legislation that will enhance America's competitiveness by improving student achievement and encouraging students to pursue and graduate with degrees in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields 
   * Reform H1-B visas and retain highly skilled workers and students, particularly in STEM fields 
   * Encourage aggressive enforcement of existing intellectual property laws and cooperative investigation between private industry and the Department of Justice, FBI, and other agencies 
   * Enhance existing intellectual property laws to provide greater protection to one of America's most valuable economic resources 
   * Eliminate patent fee diversion to ensure funds are available to modernize the Patent and Trademark Office and increase the number of examiners so that U.S. entrepreneurs receive swift, precise responses to secure their intellectual property 
   * Promote patent reforms that ensure patents continue to provide strong incentives for innovation and economic growth 
   Eliminate Barriers to Trade 
   * Renew Presidential Trade Promotion Authority so that consumers and producers may both continue to benefit from barrier-free trade in IT products and services, especially over the Internet 
   * Support the completion and adoption of additional Free Trade Agreements, boosting American jobs and economic competitiveness 
   * Ensure that new trade agreements require foreign governments to adequately protect U.S. intellectual property rights, provide transparency in the regulatory process, protect companies from unfair trade practices, and take effective enforcement action against piracy 
   * Expand the Information Technology Agreement that was created in 1997 to remove tariffs on high tech products.
