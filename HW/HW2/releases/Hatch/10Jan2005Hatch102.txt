UTAH TO GET NEW IMMIGRATION COURT, JUDGE
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has announced that the U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has agreed to his recommendation to open an Immigration Court and add an immigration judge in Salt Lake City, Utah.  
   "We must protect our borders and be vigilant in the enforcement of our immigration laws. I am pleased that DOJ, under Attorney General John Ashcroft's strong leadership, has responded to my recommendation to open an Immigration Court in Utah," said Hatch. 
   "Utah's need to address immigration issues is evident in our dramatic increase in immigration cases," continued Hatch. "The number of new cases before the Immigration Court in Denver has grown from approximately 340 in 2000 to more than 1,000 cases in 2003." 
   "This effort will support our local Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in processing criminal aliens and others who need to be seen by an immigration judge," said Hatch. 
   "Creating an immigration court in Salt Lake City will permit local immigration officials to address the existing and growing caseload and also provide the opportunity for Utah immigration cases to be heard in person before a judge," he concluded.
