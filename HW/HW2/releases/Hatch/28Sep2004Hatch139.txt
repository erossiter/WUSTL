SENATE PASSES SEN. HATCH'S 'FEED AMERICA THURSDAY' RESOLUTION
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement regarding the United States Senate's passage of a Senate resolution designating Thursday, November 18, 2004 as "Feed America Thursday."  
   "In the most prosperous nation on earth, it is inexcusable that millions of our children go to bed hungry at night," said Hatch. 
   "Each day millions of Americans - many of them children - suffer from hunger," continued Hatch. "Feed America Thursday not only encourages Americans to help those in need, but it also promotes a spirit of selflessness and sacrifice vital to our strength as a nation. I urge every American to join me in feeding the hungry and affirming the values that make our nation great. 
   "This resolution encourages Americans to sacrifice two meals on November 18, 2004 and donate the money they would have used for food to a charity or religious organization of their choice. The charities and churches, in turn, are encouraged to feed the hungry with the funds received," said Hatch. 
   The United States Department of Agriculture has reported that 33 million Americans, 13 million of whom are children, live in homes that do not have an adequate supply of food. Hunger among children is especially devastating because it has a serious impact on physical growth and brain development.
