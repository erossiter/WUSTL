SEN. HATCH: WASHINGTON COUNTY TO RECEIVE $3.5 MILLION IN ADDED FLOOD RELIEF
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has added $3.5 million to the $6 million the agency had already put toward the flood effort in Washington County, Utah.  
   "The NRCS has been heroic from day one of this flood," Hatch said. "This is one government agency that has really dug deep to help get Washington County back on its feet." 
   The NRCS is responsible for restoring the riverbeds of the Santa Clara and the Virgin rivers, which is necessary after the flood to ensure that further flooding doesn't occur. 
   "A record snowpack is waiting to come down these two rivers this spring," Hatch said. "I'd like to thank the NRCS for doing everything in their power to make sure our citizens will be protected when it happens."
