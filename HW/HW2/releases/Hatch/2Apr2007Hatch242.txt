SEN. HATCH BATTLES FOR CLEAN CITIES PROGRAM
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) this week reached across party lines to join with Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) to fight for the Department of Energy's Clean Cities program, which promotes increased use of alternative fuels to reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve air quality. The two Senators worked together to collect the signatures of a bipartisan group of 18 Senators on their letter Thursday to the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, urging it to double the projected funding level for Clean Cities for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008.  
   "Fuel diversity equals energy security," Hatch said. "We need more hybrids and cars that run on natural gas, propane, ethanol, electricity, and bio-diesel," Hatch said. "The success of a program like Clean Cities will improve the environment and strengthen our nation." 
   Grants from Clean Cities are the primary means of federal support for alternative fuel vehicle technology and deployment. Clean Cities coalitions facilitate alternative fuel purchases and install fuel infrastructure. In their letter, the Senators said more support for these coalitions is the key to accelerating American transition from oil to domestic fuels. Hatch and Clinton hope that the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member, Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Pete Domenici (R-NM) will support these goals and boost funding for Clean Cities from the Bush Administrations suggested $9.6 million to $20 million. 
   Hatch has long been a support of alternative energy solutions. In 2005, he was the author of the CLEAR Act, which provides tax incentives for hybrid-electric and alternative-fuel vehicles. The incentives are helping to promote the advanced technologies such as plug-in hybrids commercially viable.
