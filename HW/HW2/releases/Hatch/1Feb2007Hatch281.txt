SENATE PASSES TAX RELIEF FOR UTAH SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today gave his support to minimum wage legislation that included several important tax relief measures to help Utah's small businesses. H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, included provisions inserted by Hatch to assist S-corporations and passed the Senate by a vote of 94 to 3.  
   "Small businesses shouldn't have to bear the brunt of a minimum wage increase," Hatch said. "Without relief from the cost of a hike in the minimum wage, many small businesses may be forced to lay off workers or cut back hours. The Senate bill strikes the right balance. Small businesses are the engines of economic growth and this tax relief will help them to do what they do best - keep and create jobs." 
   Hatch has long expressed concerns that raising the minimum wage would hurt small businesses without effectively improving living standards for the nation's working poor. He continues to support increased education and job-training programs to help increase take-home pay. However, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee that wrote much of H.R. 2, he helped package a moderate minimum wage increase together with targeted tax relief for small businesses. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the minimum wage increase would impose $4 billion in new costs on the private sector in 2009 and $5.7 billion in 2010. Because small businesses employ half of today's workers in the private sector, without tax relief these businesses could be forced to lay off workers to absorb the increased costs. H.R. 2 includes Hatch's provisions designed to lessen the tax and regulatory burden for businesses that elect subchapter S status, which helps small businesses with 100 or fewer shareholders to avoid onerous tax rules that impose a second layer of taxation on profits. Hatch's subchapter S reforms include: 
   * Excluding capital gains from passive investment income. 
   * Improving the treatment of bank director shares. 
   * Allowing recapture of bad debt reserves. 
   * Reforming the treatment of sale of interest in a qualified subchapter S subsidiary. 
   * Eliminating all earnings and profits attributable to pre-1983 years. 
   Hatch also supported additional tax relief to help mitigate the costs of increasing the minimum wage, including: 
   * Permanently changing the tax code to allow more businesses to simplify their bookkeeping by allowing them to use the cash method of accounting for tax purposes. 
   * Allowing small businesses to write off as much as $112,000 in the first year for equipment purchased. 
   * Expediting property owners' deduction of the cost of making improvements to a restaurant or to leased property. This would also apply to improvements made to owner-occupied retailer space and for the construction of new restaurants. 
   * Establishing a certificate program for companies that provide and oversee employees for other corporations. The certification would require these companies to meet certain standards set by the IRS. Businesses that contract with certified professional employer organizations would be assured they would not be liable for those taxes already paid to the certified professional employer organization. 
   * Extending a tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce.
