SEN. HATCH ANNOUNCES $6.5 MILLION IN HUD GRANTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today announced more than $6.5 million in community-building grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The grants will serve populations in Salt Lake County, Ogden, and Taylorsville.  
   "These grants provide communities with vital resources," Hatch said. "The flexibility of these grants empower local leaders to call the shots, and the results have been outstanding." 
   The grants include more than $4 million in Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which provide funds to state and local governments for housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public improvements, and economic development projects in communities. CDBGs also expand economic opportunities for low-income persons. 
   Other grants include the HOME program, which contributes to quality, affordable housing for poor and very poor families. A new initiative under HOME is the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI), which helps low-income and minority households cover closing costs and down payments for homes. 
   Salt Lake County received $4.42 million total - $2,476,974 (CDBG), $1,800,680 (HOME), $37,409 (ADDI). Salt Lake also received $105,647 for the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program, which improves the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters. 
   Ogden received $1.7 million total - $1,175,193 (CDBG), $531,652 (HOME). Taylorsville received $384,486 (CDBG). 
   "These funds help communities find solutions to their housing needs and empower the less fortunate," Hatch said. "Utah's communities can count on HUD funds to help revitalize their neighborhoods."
