  LDS Church President Gordon B. Hinckley was awarded the Medal of Freedom today by President George W. Bush at an afternoon ceremony in the White House. Sen.  
 Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who attended the ceremony, issued the following statement:
   "What a tremendous occasion this is. Nobody deserves this honor more than President Gordon B. Hinckley. He has stood as a beacon of decency and service throughout his life. He has traveled the world exhaustively, representing the highest ideals - freedom, brotherhood, peace, the sanctity of life - wherever he goes. President Hinckley has played a key role in advancing the cause of religious freedom in societies that have never known the concept. He is a great man, and it gratifies me to see another great man - President Bush - honor him on his birthday, of all days." 
   President Hinckley turned 94 today.
