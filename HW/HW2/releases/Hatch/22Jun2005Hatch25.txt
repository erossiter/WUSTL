SEN. HATCH: SEND FLAG AMENDMENT TO STATES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today called on the Senate to approve a Constitutional amendment to protect the U.S. flag after the House of Representatives voted 286 to 130 in favor of the amendment.  
   This amendment only does one thing - restore the power of Congress to protect the flag if it chooses to do so," Hatch said. "This was the status quo for more than 200 years until five unelected Justices found an unknown constitutional right to desecrate the flag." 
   "The American people want this," Hatch continued. "Polls show 75 percent of Americans support the amendment. Every state in the union has petitioned Congress to pass it. Now the House has voted in favor of this amendment six times, and I believe this is the year that the Senate will join the House to send it to the states for ratification."
