SEN. HATCH: BUSH STRONG LEADER IN CHALLENGING TIMES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) had high praise for President Bush's State of the Union speech, delivered tonight before Congress and a national television audience. Hatch issued the following statement:  
   "I liked what I heard. President Bush is a strong leader in challenging times. Utahns know that, and they're backing him even when times get tough. He's got some great ideas we ought to take a look at on energy, education, and the economy -- just what America needs right now. President Bush knows he can count on me and the good people of Utah when he needs it. 
   "Utahns believe President Bush is the right leader to fight the War on Terror. He's doing everything he can to defend this nation, and we're fighting an enemy like none we've ever faced. He also discussed education, which is the number one issue in Utah. We realized early that we need to invest in math and science to give our kids the edge they need in today's economy. I'm glad President Bush is focusing on initiatives that will ensure America continues to lead the world in talent and creativity. President Bush also realizes our need for energy security, and Utah's going to play a major role in America's energy future. We're sitting on a vast reserve of domestic oil supply in oil shale and tar sands, and we have tremendous resources of renewable energy. 
   "Utah's economy is strong, and we want it to keep growing. President Bush is right -- low taxes and reduced spending are the best ways to keep the economy going strong. But Utahns also share President Bush's concern about our nation's health care system. Nearly 20% of working adults in Utah lack insurance, and those lucky enough to have it are worried about the skyrocketing premiums. If there's one issue that could do without partisanship, this is it."
