SEN. HATCH HAILS UTAH, BYU FOR WINNING FEDERAL SMART GRANTS
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today is congratulating Utah students and educators for their success in winning National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grants. According to information released by the U.S. Department of Education, Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, leads the nation in SMART Grants, with 1,584 recipients in the 2006-07 academic year. Moreover, Utah is No. 3 in the nation for total dollar awards from SMART Grants with $11.4 million, behind only California and New York.  
   "It speaks volumes about the quality of education and students in Utah that a state with such a small population was able to win so many of these grants," Hatch said. "I want to commend the students, faculty, families, and particularly the financial aid offices of Utah's colleges and universities for their success this year. The language, engineering, and science departments at BYU have done an outstanding job in bringing these federal awards into our state." 
   SMART Grants provide up to $4,000 per year, depending on need, to eligible students in their third and fourth years of undergraduate studies in physical, life, or computer sciences, mathematics, technology, or engineering, or in a foreign language determined critical to national security. The student must also have maintained a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in coursework required for the major. The SMART Grant award is in addition to the student's Pell Grant award. A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Hatch helped create the SMART Grant in the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005. 
   "SMART Grants are an investment in America's future," Hatch said. "They provide needed support to students in fields that are vital for our continued economic health and our national security. By encouraging students to pursue these majors, we will maintain our competitive edge in the world." 
   The Department of Education aims to increase the number of students receiving SMART Grants. For more information, go online at: http://www.senate.gov/cgi-bin/exitmsg?url=http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/SmartGrants.jsp
