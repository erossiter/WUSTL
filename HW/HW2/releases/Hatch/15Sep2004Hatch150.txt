WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER FUNDING EXTENDED
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) joined his Senate colleagues late Tuesday night in unanimously voting to renew funding for the nation's Women's Business Centers (WBC), including the center at the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce.  
   "This funding was critical - these centers needed this money to keep their doors open, retain staff, and continue programs that help women grow their businesses," Hatch said. "Thousands of women in Utah have benefited from our Salt Lake center, and I'm committed to ensuring that thousands more get that chance." 
   Tuesday's vote freed up the remaining $4 million already appropriated for WBCs, providing approximately $70,000 to each of the 53 centers across the country in operation for five or more years. The vote does not include funding for the 2005 Fiscal Year, which is still under negotiation in Congress. 
   Administered by the Small Business Administration's Office of Women's Business Ownership, the WBC program supports women in starting and building successful businesses.
