SEN. HATCH: HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS EXPERIENCING TREMENDOUS GROWTH
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) today highlighted the success of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), with 4.5 million Americans now covered under HSA-eligible health plans. That marks an increase of 1.3 million - or 40 percent - within the past year.  
   "That's tremendous progress, especially since HSAs became available just three years ago," Hatch said. "HSAs are changing the way we think about medical coverage. More people want control and choice in their health care." 
   HSAs employee-owned accounts and participants and their employers can save pre-tax dollars and withdraw them - tax free - for medical expenses. According to a newly released survey by America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), HSA enrollment in the individual market rose from 855,000 in January 2006 to 1.1 million in January 2007, and enrollment in the group market increased from 1.4 million to almost 3.4 million that same year. Twenty-seven percent of new enrollees in the individual market were previously uninsured. And the large group market is turning toward these plans as well - increasing enrollment from nearly 680,000 in 2006 to 2 million in 2007. 
   Hatch has been a strong supporter of HSAs since helping to enact legislation that brought them to the health care market in January 2004. Last Congress, he introduced legislation that was the foundation for critical improvements and expansions of HSAs to make them more user-friendly for employees and businesses, including: 
   * Allowing rollovers to an HSA from existing HRAs and FSAs 
   * Simplifying personal contribution limits 
   * Requiring the government to complete cost of living adjustments earlier in the year to provide individuals and employers with more time to modify their plans 
   * Authorizing full contributions for mid-year enrollees 
   * Allowing families to "seed" an HSA with funds from an IRA 
   * Giving employers the opportunity to make greater contributions to the accounts of non-highly compensated employees. 
   These provisions were included in H.R 6111, which was signed into law on December 20, 2006. The AHIP survey may be viewed http://www.senate.gov/cgi-bin/exitmsg?url=http://www.ahipresearch.org/PDFs/FINAL%20AHIP_HSAReport.pdf.
