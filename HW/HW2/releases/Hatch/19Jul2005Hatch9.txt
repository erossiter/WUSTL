SEN. HATCH: ROBERTS OUTSTANDING PICK
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the second-ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, issued the following statement upon nomination of Judge John Roberts, Jr., to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court:  
   "John Roberts is an outstanding pick. He is a brilliant Constitutional lawyer with unquestioned integrity. He's the kind of judge that all of us want - someone committed to applying the law impartially rather than legislating from the bench. 
   "By picking Roberts, the President fulfilled his responsibility under the Constitution, after an unprecedented outreach to members of the Senate. Now the Senate must fulfill its constitutional responsibility to treat the nominee fairly with a full debate on the merits and then an up-or-down vote."
