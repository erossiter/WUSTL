SEN. HATCH HELPS FREE UP $38.5 MILLION FOR UTAH ROAD PROJECTS
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) joined with Senate colleagues today in approving a highway bill that frees up $38.5 million for vital Utah road projects. 
   Approved by an 88-2 margin in the Senate, H.R. 1195 makes technical changes and modifies descriptions for more than 400 projects in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users that Congress (SAFETEA-LU) adopted in 2005.
   SAFETEA-LU contained nearly $200 million for Utah road projects, the most federal dollars ever committed to Utah in a transportation bill. Hatch's changes in H.R. 1195 release $38.5 million of that total - money needed to keep pace with the state's growing population and transportation needs.
   "We improved the project descriptions in the original SAFETEA-LU so that funds could be used on road projects in critical areas," Hatch said following the Senate's vote. "This will be of great benefit to Utah and other states across the nation. SAFETEA-LU has helped improve and expand our national transportation infrastructure to meet the increasing demands on the system."
   The Senate version of H.R. 1195 must be approved by the House before it can be sent to the President for his approval.
