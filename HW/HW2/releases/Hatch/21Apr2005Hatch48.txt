SEN. HATCH PUSHES FOR FUNDS TO MOVE MOAB TAILINGS PILE
  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) today called on the Senate to provide the funding needed to move the radioactive mill tailings pile currently sitting on the bank of the Colorado River across from Moab, Utah.  
   "A decade of studying and talking about this issue has not moved the pile one inch," Hatch said. "It's time to move beyond talk and get this done." 
   In a letter sent to Senator Pete Domenici(R-N. Mex.), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, Hatch asked for $56 million for the project, which would be funded through the Department of Energy (DOE). The President's budget currently requests $28 million for the project, but Hatch noted this estimate was based on capping the tailings in place. Now that DOE has decided the removal of the tailings is the best alternative, Hatch is requesting that the budget be enhanced by an additional $28 million to fully fund remediation for Fiscal Year 2006. 
   "DOE finally recognized the need to move the pile," Hatch said. "Now Congress needs to ensure they have the money to do it. While it won't be easy to come up with funding this year, I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of moving this pile now that the DOE has called for this action."
