SENATE COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. HATCH TAX RELIEF FOR UTAH SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) included tax reforms to help Utah's small businesses and community banks in the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007, which was reported by the Senate Finance Committee today.  
   "Small businesses are the engines of economic growth and these reforms will help them to do what they do best - create jobs," Hatch said. "We're targeting existing onerous rules and restrictions that thwart many small businesses in Utah from selecting tax advantages that will improve their viability." 
   Hatch's provisions are designed to lessen the tax and regulatory burden for businesses that elect subchapter S status, which helps small businesses with 100 or fewer shareholders to avoid onerous tax rules that impose a second, punitive layer of taxation on profits. Hatch has been an advocate for S corporations since he joined the Senate Finance Committee, and the provisions included in today's bill were part of a larger S Corporation reform package (S. 3838) he introduced last Congress. 
   The main purpose of the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007 is to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 in increments over the next two years. Recognizing that Utah small businesses may find the higher minimum wage to be a burden, Hatch fought to include his and other tax provisions to lessen the impact. The Act includes the following Hatch-sponsored subchapter S reforms: 
   * Excluding capital gains from passive investment income. 
   * Improving the treatment of bank director shares. 
   * Allowing recapture of bad debt reserves. 
   * Reforming the treatment of sale of interest in a qualified subchapter S subsidiary. 
   * Eliminating all earnings and profits attributable to pre-1983 years. 
   Subchapter S status is especially popular with the nation's community banks -including 10 in Utah - which often face higher costs of capital than their larger competitors. Many banks that want to remain independent and focused on the community that they serve have embraced this particular corporate structure and have thrived as a result. 
   "This is an essential vehicle that allows dividends to be paid to shareholders without the potential of double taxation," said Douglas L. DeFries, Executive Vice President of Bank of Utah. "The banks that elect Sub S status signal to the community they are in the community to stay for the long term." 
   The S corporation as currently structured, however, can be difficult to navigate and is rife with complications that can jeopardize a company's preferred tax status. Any S corporation is at risk of finding itself inadvertently in violation of the Byzantine tax rules that govern it and as a result trigger a potentially ruinous tax bill. Hatch's provisions would simplify some of the arcane S corporation rules and lessen the penalties for nadvertently violating other rules.
