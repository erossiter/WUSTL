Congressmen Charles Bass  R NH  and Jeb Bradley  R NH  today announced that the House and Senate has approved  18 5 million for two construction projects benefiting NH military personnel   10 5 million for the completion of the New Hampshire National Guard Joint Forces and Civil Support Team headquarters in Concord  and  8 1 million for the construction of a new acoustic testing and calibration facility at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard    The funding is included in the 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that passed both the House and Senate today and now awaits the President s signature to become final   Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  stated   Currently the Air National Guard State Headquarters is located at Pease  fifty miles away from the office of the Adjutant General in Concord    The National Guard Joint Forces is far too spread out and in many cases using buildings and office space inadequate for its needs    The completion of a comprehensive facility where the Joint Forces can work under one roof is great news and will lead to greater efficiency and coordination          As the entire Northeast Congressional delegation has been saying for years  the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard continues to distinguish itself from any other shipyard in the country with its excellent work and outstanding record    The Shipyard will now be able to construct a new facility and continue to serve the Navy with the highest level of service found at any of our nation s shipyards       Senator Sununu stated   The Citizen soldiers of the New Hampshire National Guard play a vital role in supporting missions across the globe  be it in Iraq  Afghanistan  the U S  Gulf Coast  or most recently  Southwestern New Hampshire    The rehabilitation and expansion of the Concord Joint Forces headquarters will provide more adequate facilities for the Guard to perform the training necessary to stay ready to support military and homeland security missions whenever and wherever they are needed    The Navy relies on the most up to date acoustic technology to safely perform its missions around the globe   Sununu continued     The new  state of the art acoustic test and calibration facility   made possible through this funding   will allow for the testing of underwater acoustic sensors for the Navy prior to installation on many  different types of naval surface ships and submarines            Many of our state s brave service members have served or are presently serving overseas  in the Gulf region hit by Hurricane s Katrina and Rita  and right here in New Hampshire in the effort to rebuild parts of Southwestern New Hampshire that were damaged during the recent floods   said Congressman Bass     Working with the New Hampshire delegation on behalf of these brave and generous service members is among my most gratifying accomplishments    Congressman Bradley stated   I am pleased to see these projects included in the bill    The Joint Headquarters has been a top priority of the New Hampshire National Guard for several years and the acoustic facility will enhance Portsmouth Naval Shipyard as the premiere submarine maintenance facility in the nation        The  Phase II funding of this essential project enables us to continue on with  the transformation  and consolidation of  our  New Hampshire National Guard Joint Force Headquarters and Joint Operations Center    said Maj  Gen   Ret   Joseph Simeone   Deputy Adjutant General of the New Hampshire National Guard     This former Army aviation facility will also house the newly assigned Civil Support Team  These state of the art facilities will enhance our capabilities for rapid response to state and federal officials  for Homeland Security missions in the U S  and overseas    This project is the result of funding from  both State and Federal budgets for Phase I and Phase II       We are grateful to New Hampshire s congressional delegation for their work in getting the federal  appropriation passed for Phase I and II  their understanding and support  of the importance  of this project was critical    It will allow us to remain a relevant military force in the defense of our state and our nation  for the foreseeable future   Simeone added     Funding for New Hampshire projects included in the 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill       10 5 million   NH National Guard Joint Forces and Civil Support Team Headquarters   The current  headquarters  of the NH National Guard Joint Forces is spread among several aging and inadequate facilities    The new headquarters at the National Guard facility in Concord will transform the current Aviation Support Facility into the Joint Forces headquarters    New Hampshire has also been announced as the recipient of a Civil Support Team  a 22 member team designed to support and combat Homeland Security issues  and the new headquarters will house their personnel and equipment as well  The completed renovations will hold the NH National Guard Army  Air  and Combined Task Force Headquarters  as well as the New Joint Operations Center to support the NH Office of Emergency Management        8 1 million   Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Acoustic Testing and Calibration Facility   These funds will allow the Shipyard to construct a new acoustic test and calibration facility  used to test and certify hydrophone transducer equipment used by all U S  Naval surface ships and submarines and U S  Coast Guard ships  which are vital to all aspects of undersea warfare and surveillance    Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is the sole Navy activity performing acoustic testing for transducers and hydrophones    The new facility will include a two story steel structure surrounding the test tank and control center  and will help consolidate personnel as well as eliminate background noise              249166
