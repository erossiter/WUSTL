                                                                                Wednesday  July 13  2005       WASHINGTON  DC     Recognizing the intensifying threats to the nation   s coral reefs  U S  Senators Daniel K  Inouye  D Hawaii  and John Sununu  R N H   introduced legislation today to boost the resources and damage prevention measures needed to ensure the reefs    long term health      From recreational overuse to abandoned vessels  reefs along U S  coasts are experiencing substantial physical damage  much of which is preventable   Given the reefs    significant benefits to ocean ecosystems and coastal economies  the resulting damage presents dire environmental and economic implications         Coral reefs are under intense pressure from both burgeoning coastal populations and the millions of tourists who visit our coasts each year     said Sen  Inouye  co chairman of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee      Threats range from land based sources of pollution  overfishing  marine debris  recreational overuse  wayward and abandoned vessels  alien species introduction  coral bleaching and the increased acidity of our oceans         To reverse the current trends  the legislation will make several updates to the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000  including increased funding for coral reef conservation  support for community based protection efforts  and new authorities for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  to address vessel groundings and imminent coral damage           Coral reefs are among the most complex and fragile ecosystems on the planet     said Sen  Sununu  chair of the Commerce Committee   s National Ocean Policy Study      Following last month   s hearing on Threats to Coral Reefs  I   ve worked closely with Senator Inouye to craft this important legislation           The legislation increases the annual authorized funding levels for coral reef conservation efforts through NOAA  authorizing  30 million in fiscal year 2006 and increasing to  35 million in fiscal years 2009 2012   The bill expands the Coral Reef Conservation Grant Program to reflect the emerging needs and the increased authorizations levels        The program provides grants to seven coral reef jurisdictions     Hawaii  Guam  American Samoa  the Northern Mariana Islands  Florida  Puerto Rico  and the U S  Virgin Islands   Funding for such grants will be directed primarily toward projects that address emerging threats and will give priority to local action strategies      Further emphasizing the value of locally designed coral reef protection measures  particularly in island communities  the legislation calls for a Community Based Planning Grant program  which will help local communities develop and implement coral protection plans derived from traditional or island based resource management concepts   It also reduces the non federal matching funds requirement from 50  to 25   recognizing the limited funds available to small communities      Emergency response efforts are a central concern to Senators Inouye and Sununu  The bill grants NOAA express authorization to lead emergency response actions to prevent or mitigate imminent coral reef destruction from vessel impacts or other physical damage   Currently  no public entities have the authority to respond to vessel groundings when there is no viable owner or the circumstances are not covered under authorities such as the National Marine Sanctuaries Act or the Oil Pollution Act      There are as many as 145 abandoned vessels in the Pacific Ocean and over a thousand in the Atlantic that pose a threat to coral reef habitats  according to NOAA   s Abandoned Vessel Project   In many cases  current law does not provide NOAA the authority or the funding to remove and dispose of the vessels and mitigate the coral damage   Given his previous efforts to remove a number of abandoned vessels from reefs in the Pacific  Sen  Inouye recognized the critical need to close these gaps in authority and funding        The bill   s emphasis on prevention activities stems from the Senators    conclusion that it is more costly to remove these vessels than to prevent mishaps in the first place   Prevention efforts in the Florida Keys have demonstrated that installation of beacons and navigational aids can significantly reduce the coral grounding incidents         The    Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2005    will not only help improve our response to the damage caused by ships grounding on coral reefs  but help prevent these collisions from occurring in the future     said Sen  Sununu         In addition to being the home of millions of plants and animals  coral reefs are a vital part of the U S  economy  generating millions of dollars and jobs each year     said Lynne Hale  director of The Nature Conservancy s Global Marine Initiative     This legislation will go a long way in ensuring that coral reefs remain healthy and continue providing precious resources for the millions of Americans who depend on them for their livelihoods         Sen  Inouye continued     There is much more that can be done to protect our coral reefs  and the legislation we introduce today puts in place the necessary resources  measures  and authorities to improve our efforts   I look forward to working with Sen  Sununu to move this legislation through the Senate quickly           The bill has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee            NOTE TO REPORTERS   NOAA   s Web site includes several
