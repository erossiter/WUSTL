WASHINGTON  U S  Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  R NH  today announced that a new Job Corps Center in New Hampshire has been approved by the Department of Labor   The Center will be located in Manchester and when completed will serve 500 students  300 who would live on campus   The center will provide academic assistance  career technical training  high school diplomas  and GED certification with the goal of getting students into the workplace       Today s announcement serves as the end of the technical site review  The land acquisition phase will begin in March and April   The target date for completion of this project and for students to start attending classes is 2010   Currently  New Hampshire is one of two states nationwide that does not have a Job Corps Center   The New Hampshire Job Corps Center Task Force presented the Department of Labor with a proposal to become the first Homeland Security Job Training Center  serving to provide government agencies  healthcare institutions  high technology companies  manufacturers and transportation and power service institutions with highly trained and motivated individuals        Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education  who has been supporting funding for the Job Corps Center through the appropriations process for a number of years  stated   This is great news for New Hampshire and a significant step forward in providing much needed resources for students statewide   Job Corps Centers are invaluable resources that provide a range of programs and training  helping more individuals get jobs and participate in our state s growing economy   This proposal  to focus New Hampshire s Center on homeland security related jobs  also demonstrates New Hampshire s innovative spirit of entrepreneurship   It has taken years of hard work at the local and state level  and I commend all those who have worked on this for their dedication  and will continue to work with them to bring this project to fruition       Senator Sununu  who has worked with state and local officials as part of his longtime advocacy for bringing the Department of Labor program to New Hampshire  stated   This announcement is great news for New Hampshire students who are looking to become more competitive in today s job market and for businesses across the state that are in need of skilled workers   A Job Corps Center in Manchester will help young people gain access to academic credentials that are essential for launching and maintaining successful careers   Moreover  the fact that this Center is the first of its kind in the country to feature homeland security training and education programs provides an opportunity for students to develop skills in an area that is of great importance to our state and nation   Rather than traveling to Job Corps Centers in other states as some have previously done  students will now be able to prepare for successful careers closer to home   With the ability to earn high school or general equivalency diplomas   and with the opportunity to receive technical training   these students will be prepared to contribute productively to New Hampshire s diverse economy       Manchester Mayor Frank Guinta stated   I was delighted this morning to receive the fantastic news that the City of Manchester has been awarded a Job Corps Center to be located at Hackett Hill   Thanks to the hard work of Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  Mr  Richard Anagnost and the New Hampshire Job Corps Center Task Force  and our own dedicated city staff  we are today poised to play host to a center that will soon produce the educated work force we need for the jobs of tomorrow   This center will also be a great aid in our efforts to lower the school dropout rate   I congratulate everyone involved in this initiative and recommit the support of the City of Manchester for this important project       New Hampshire Labor Commissioner George Copadis stated   A New Hampshire Job Corps Center will help attract new companies to New Hampshire while providing our less fortunate young people with a new opportunity to join New Hampshire s workforce  Senator Gregg and Senator Sununu s key roles in this project has served New Hampshire very well  and Governor John Lynch s strong support for alternative programs such as Job Corps has helped in the effort   This announcement is great for business  great for our young people and great for the economy of New Hampshire       Michael Power  President of the New Hampshire Workforce Opportunity Council stated   The New Hampshire Job Corps Center will be the most advanced educational and training facility for new workers in the country  and

become proud and productive members of society  Many people have worked for so long for this award  but special thanks have to go to Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu for their ability to make this facility a reality       Dick Anagnost  Chair of the New Hampshire Job Corps Task Force stated   Today s announcement is the result of years of dedicated work by literally hundreds of businesspeople  educators  and elected officials  The Job Corps Task Force is very grateful to Senator Gregg s tenacious work to bring a Job Corps Center to New Hampshire  I would also like to thank Senator John Sununu  who has worked with Senator Gregg to make our Job Corps Center a reality  This facility will specialize in Homeland Security related occupations in health care  high technology and inspection and protections services and be the first of its kind in the nation       Gary Long  President and CEO of Public Service of New Hampshire stated   I am very pleased to see that our Job Corps Center proposal has been successful  The New Hampshire Job Corps Center will be a major new education and training facility for New Hampshire  Our state s employers  especially those in the high growth high demand areas of our economy will now have a new source of educated  trained and dependable workers  I am particularly grateful to Senator Gregg s leadership and the work of Senator John Sununu on this project and look forward to a state of the art facility in Manchester                268685
