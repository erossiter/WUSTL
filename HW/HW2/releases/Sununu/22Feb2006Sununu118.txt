called on National Marine Fisheries Service  NMFS  Director Dr  William T  Hogarth to provide an explanation regarding a casual dismissal of a request to analyze a groundfish fishing regulatory proposal that may mitigate impact on New Hampshire   s small vessel fishermen    Although the New England Fishery Management Council agreed to consult experts to determine if this alternative approach could achieve targeted fishing reductions  NMFS   s Northeast Regional Office reportedly declined to provide any resources to an analysis of the proposal  In his letter to Hogarth  Sununu called for an immediate review of whether NMFS   s budgetary resources are so tight that it is unable to evaluate proposals that impact the resource  the environment  and fishermen  The letter also seeks answers to a number of questions regarding an existing fishing disaster relief program     The text of the letter follows     Dear Dr  Hogarth    On February 2  2006  the New England Fishery Management Council voted to tentatively approve Framework 42 to Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan   The components of the framework  if approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service  are intended to impose new restrictions on groundfish fishing in New England in order to further address the status of certain stocks and consequently the respective fishing mortality rates of these stocks   These specific restrictions likely will have a devastating impact on smaller fishing vessels  especially those fishermen from New Hampshire  by significantly reducing allocated days at sea to potentially unsustainable levels      As part of the Council   s consideration  a proposal was made by an outside party as an alternative regulatory measure to those previously prepared for the Council   As initially presented  this proposal has the potential to mitigate some of the harmful impact on small vessel fishermen while still meeting conservation and resource rebuilding obligations     The Council ultimately agreed to submit this proposal to a panel of scientists to determine whether it meets the necessary targeted reductions in fishing effort   However  I have been informed that staff of the Northeast Regional Office refused to dedicate any resources or participate in the analysis of this proposal in preparation of the Council   s April meeting   If accurate  this is deeply troubling and suggests a disregard for the New England fishery  the life and status of the resource  the environmental community  and the fishermen and their corresponding communities      I respectfully request that you review this matter immediately to determine whether the budgetary resources of the NMFS are so difficult as to prevent adequate participation by the Northeast Regional Office in the analysis of this alternative regulatory measure   Accordingly  please provide a written status report to me on this matter no later than February 28  2006      Separately  the serious impact of the proposed framework requires an exploration of all available options provided under current law   Specifically  I request that you provide answers to the following questions    1  Does section 312 a  of the Magnuson Stevens Act currently apply in cases where there is a commercial fishery failure due to a decision of a regional fishery management council     2  How many times has this section been exercised and under what circumstances     3  Under what circumstances has this provision been triggered by a governor of a State     4  What funding currently exists under this section    5  In passing the    Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2005    late last year  the Senate Commerce Committee proposed amending section 312 of current law to make explicit that it may be used in circumstances caused by    regulatory or judicial harvest restrictions imposed to protect human or the marine environment      Does such an amendment clarify current law or expand current law to be used for additional purposes    I thank you in advance for your timely response    Sincerely         John E  Sununu    251812
