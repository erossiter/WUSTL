Nearly every other day  a child dies in a non traffic vehicle accident  backed over by a driver who couldn   t see behind their vehicle  strangled in a power window or killed when an automobile inadvertently shifts into gear   Today   s announcement is an important step toward preventing tragic deaths that we know are preventable with existing technology at relatively low cost   We have introduced legislation to make brake locks mandatory in all new cars and we are pleased that automakers agree action is needed   However  there is more we need to do to make vehicles safer for kids and we will continue to press for enactment of our legislation  the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act         Every vehicle without backover prevention technology has a blind zone behind it  some as large as 51 feet long according to testing by Consumer Reports   Our bill would require all new cars to have a rearward visibility standard that will help alert drivers to the presence of a child behind a vehicle   In addition  our legislation would require that power windows reverse direction when they detect an obstruction to prevent children from being trapped  injured or killed by vehicle power windows   Our bill would also require that data on non traffic vehicle accidents be collected and would help raise awareness among parents of these dangers through a child safety information program           It is critical that we prevent these tragedies from happening to other families   By taking simple  cost effective  common sense steps we can have safer cars and safer kids across America               FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     CONTACT  LINDSAY JACKSON   August 17  2006                                                                                          202 225

Representative Packy Campbell  R  Straf  3   National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Nicole Nason and automobile industry representatives  announced new voluntary standards for automobile Brake Shift Interlock  BSI  to prevent unnecessary tragedies  The new safety standard will help reduce the incidence of accidents resulting from the rollaway of parked vehicles with automatic transmissions  such as when children move the shift mechanism out of the  Park  position  It will also provide for the public disclosure of which vehicles are already in compliance  allowing consumers to become educated about their purchase       I am pleased that I was able to help Packy Campbell advocate for such important consumer safety provisions and that all parties were able to come together to adapt these common sense changes in a timely fashion  The new standard will help eliminate the risk of tragedy related to rollaway accidents   stated Congressman Bass   I believe this vital initiative is a positive step forward in ensuring that children are safe around cars  Packy should be commended for his efforts        Preventing non traffic vehicle accidents is a critical public safety matter  and with some modest  cost effective steps  others need not suffer the loss of a child   said Senator John Sununu  who has also worked to help facilitate a new BSI standard     Packy Campbell has shown that one citizen can make a difference in this mission  I will continue to work with him and all who are committed to protecting our children       The new standard was made possible due to cooperation between the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers       This voluntary agreement is good news for consumers  good news for parents concerned about safety  and shows that with the right leadership  change for the better can be brought about in a way that benefits all   said Nicole R  Nason  administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration       Automakers are installing brake transmission system interlocks to help protect children  as well as people outside the vehicle who might be hurt if a child moved a vehicle out of  Park    said Fred Webber  President   CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers     Children and car keys should always be separated  but brake interlocks are an extra measure of protection for everyone         I am truly thankful for this agreement  amazing results like this can happen when government agencies  private industry and elected officials work together in an honest effort to solve problems and improve society   concluded Rep  Packy Campbell  who lost a child in a rollaway tragedy   We in New Hampshire are blessed to have fine leadership in Congressmen Bass and Senator Sununu and I look forward to continuing to work with them to promote the solid  result oriented leadership exemplified in this agreement  This agreement will not bring Ian back  but it does help console our family knowing that it won t happen to someone else  In this agreement  all manufacturers agreed to design a safety feature to make sure young children imitating adult behavior would not result in a tragic accident  and I am truly thankful for that              261943
