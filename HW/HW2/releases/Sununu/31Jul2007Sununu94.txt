Sununu  DEDICATING THE HILLSBOROUGH  NEW HAMPSHIRE POST OFFICE IN HONOR OF OFFICER JEREMY TODD CHARRON  Mr  SUNUNU  Mr  PRESIDENT  I rise to honor a fallen officer of the   Epsom  New Hampshire Police Department  Officer Jeremy Todd Charron  by introducing a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility at 11 Central Street in Hillsborough  New Hampshire  as the Officer Jeremy Todd Charron Post Office  During Jeremys high school years at Hillsborough Deering High School  he grew into a leader  quickly becoming active in all aspects of the school community  His peers voted him Most Spirited and elected him class president  At the same time  he had convinced eight classmates to join the Marines with him following graduation  Together  they would dedicate their weekends to training for their future service in the Marine Corps  Sadly  Jeremys dream was cut short  On August 24  1997  the morning after he attended the funerals of New Hampshire State Troopers Leslie Lord and Scott Phillips  Officer Charron was responding to a report of a suspicious car  which contained two men  Tragically  while Officer Charron questioned one of the men  the individual pulled out a gun and opened fire  Although Jeremy was wearing a bullet proof vest  one of the bullets struck him in an unprotected area  Despite his fatal wounds  Jeremy heroically returned fire until he collapsed  forcing his two killers to abandon their car and steal a near by truck that could be identified by police  eventually leading to their capture   Had Jeremys dreams not been cut short at the age of 24  he would have achieved his goals of becoming a State Trooper and having a family of his own  Jeremys murderers stripped our nation  the State of New Hampshire and the community of a true patriot  citizen  and role model  as well as a loving friend and family member  Ten years have gone by since Jeremys passing and a new generation of seven nieces and nephews know Jeremys stories  People of Hillsborough  New Hampshire still have stories to share and lessons to learn from their very own American hero  As the years move forward  the citizens and future generations of Hillsborough will always remember Jeremy and share anecdotes about his life when they visit the Officer Jeremy Todd Charron Post Office Building         After graduating high school in 1992  Jeremy entered the Marine Corps and proudly served his country for four years  As his enlistment term drew to a close  he had a new aspiration  which was to become a New Hampshire State Trooper  and looked forward to starting a family  To achieve this objective  Jeremy enrolled at the New Hampshire Technical College in Concord to study Criminal Justice  and was hired by the Epsom  New Hampshire Police Department as a part time and then full time police officer   Born on March 18  1973  Officer Charron was the third of five children to Bob and Fran Charron  Originally from Pittsfield  New Hampshire  Jeremy and his family moved to Hillsborough in 1977  Throughout his early life  Jeremy grew intensely goal orientated  a trait that persisted throughout his shortened life  and by the time he had reached second grade he knew his calling was to one day serve as a United States Marine  Although he was an outstanding athlete in many sports  he excelled at playing defense on the soccer field  The same tenacity that Jeremy used on the soccer field  he carried with him off the field  One poignant example of Jeremys developing leadership occurred as a friend lost his hair from cancer treatments and was teased by fellow classmates  While it may have been easier for most students to ignore the taunting of other classmates  Jeremy actively defended his friend  Throughout Jeremys life  he stood up for what he thought was right and protected those who could not defend themselves    280068
