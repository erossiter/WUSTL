    United States Senators John Sununu and Judd Gregg  R NH  today  9 19  announced Senate passage of the    New England Wilderness Act of 2006     legislation to designate 34 500 acres of White Mountain National Forest land in the Sandwich Range and Wild River areas as    wilderness     Sununu authored the Senate legislation and Gregg is lead co sponsor of the bill  which was introduced on March 28  2006      In November of 2005  the Forest Service recommended the designation of additional acreage as    wilderness    in its Management Plan for the White Mountain National Forest  The    New England Wilderness Act of 2006    incorporates the recommendations of this Management Plan by designating approximately 23 700 acres in the area of the Wild River as    wilderness    and adding approximately 10 800 acres to the existing Sandwich Range Wilderness  The land would remain as White Mountain National Forest land under the protection of the National Wilderness Preservation System  Wilderness areas consist of federal lands that are permanently closed to such activities as mining  logging  road construction  vehicular traffic  and building construction  By law  the establishment of new wilderness must be approved by Congress      Senator Sununu stated     The Forest Service Plan represents a consensus view of how best to protect land in the White Mountain National Forest while ensuring the Forest   s traditional mixed use role  Senate passage of this legislation is a tremendous step toward solidifying this agreement  I encourage the quick consideration of this bill by the House of Representatives  and  look forward to working with Congressmen Bass and Bradley and all parties concerned to make sure New Hampshire wilderness is permanently protected for generations to come            Local and state officials  citizens groups and other concerned individuals have been working for a number of years toward the goal of designating more wilderness in the White Mountain National Forest  I commend their dedication toward permanently protecting land in the Sandwich Range and the Wild River area     work that is one step closer to coming to fruition with the passage of this bill         Senator Gregg stated     New Hampshire   s landscapes and natural resources are a big reason why our state is such a great place to live and raise a family  as well as such a big draw for visitors who love the outdoors   By designating more than 34 000 acres of new wilderness  this bill will help further protect our state   s environment and represents a balanced approach on how we manage the White Mountain National Forest   The swift passage by the Senate also signals the understanding in Congress of the need for this legislation  and I will continue to work for its passage          Jane Difley  President Forester of the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests  stated     This is terrific news for New Hampshire and for the White Mountain National Forest  The Wilderness designation is the first of several steps to fully implement the White Mountain National Forest Plan  On behalf of the 10 000 members of the Forest Society  I commend Senators Sununu and Gregg for their strong support of not only the Wilderness Act  but the entire WMNF plan            The combination of the 34 500 acres to be designated as Wilderness  along with the traditional mixed use role of the White Mountain National Forest overall is consistent with the founding vision of the Forest Society  which calls for the wise use of New Hampshire   s forests and their complete reservation in places of special scenic beauty     Difley added      Richard Minard  President of New Hampshire Audubon    Senate passage of the  New England Wilderness Act of 2006  attests the national significance of New Hampshire s remaining wild places and the value that we all place in keeping those lands wild  New Hampshire Audubon celebrates the bill s adoption and the leadership of Senator John Sununu and Senator Judd Gregg  By designating parts of the Sandwich Range and the Wild River areas as wilderness  the bill fulfills the vision of a broad coalition of New Hampshire residents and protects wildlife habitat for generations of Granite Staters to come       Julie Wormser  Appalachian Mountain Club s Policy Director  stated   We re delighted to hear of the passage of the  New England Wilderness Act of 2006  Throughout their careers Senators Sununu and Gregg and their colleagues in Vermont have been strong champions for the White Mountain and Green Mountain National Forests and the multiple use approach to managing them   The areas included in this legislation are beautiful places our members and others enjoy for hiking and backpacking  wildlife viewing  and the solitude of the backcountry experience  This legislation represents the culmination of nearly a decade of collaboration among hundreds of local residents  the US forest service and our members of congress   Today the senators have given us all something to cheer about       Dan Yetter  co founder of the Friends of Wild River  a volunteer group of New Hampshire residents  stated   This makes me so happy  We have been working with the forest service and the congressional delegation for nearly nine years  and to see this bill pass the Senate is truly a dream come true   I love the Wild River Valley for its seclusion  its quiet  its unbroken vistas  and the inescapable sound of running water from the dozens of brooks and streams that tumble down the valley   I hope Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg one day can take a break from their busy schedules and come celebrate their efforts with us in the new Wild River Wilderness Area    There are currently five    wilderness    areas in the White Mountain National Forest  Of these  four are in New Hampshire  the Presidential Range Dry River Wilderness  the Great Gulf Wilderness  the Sandwich Range Wilderness  and the Pemigewasset Wilderness  The Caribou Speckled Mountain Wilderness is in the State of Maine    The    New England Wilderness Act of 2006    includes an amendment by Senator Patrick Leahy  D VT  that incorporates a modified version of a Vermont wilderness bill that was introduced earlier this year by Senators Leahy and Jim Jeffords  I VT     Under this amendment  some 47 700 acres of forest land on the Green Mountain National Forest would be designated as wilderness    This includes additions to four current wilderness areas and the creation of two new areas    This amendment also formally designates a new 15 000 acre Moosalamoo National Recreation Area for hiking  biking  snowmobiling  and a variety of other outdoor activities        30      263394
