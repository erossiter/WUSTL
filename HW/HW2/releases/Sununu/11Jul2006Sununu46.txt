STANDARDS  LEAD TO MORE CHOICE IN INSURANCE PRODUCTS FOR CONSUMERS

DC     United States Senator John Sununu   R NH   who introduced the    National Insurance  Act of 2006    with Senator Tim Johnson  D SD  on April 5  2006  issued the following statement on the comprehensive legislation to allow life and property casualty insurers to choose federal rather than state charters under an    optional federal charter    regulatory system       The Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs  of which Sununu and Johnson are members  took up the subject of Insurance Regulatory Reform at a hearing on Tuesday  July 11         This hearing provides a welcome opportunity for Committee Members to examine the issue of insurance regulatory reform  including the legislation that Senator Johnson and I have put forth to improve the regulation of life and property and casualty insurance     said Sununu     I look forward to reviewing the specifics of the    National Insurance Act of 2006    with the witnesses today and at additional hearings expected to be held this summer and fall            Unlike the modernization of banking and securities of the late 1990s under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act  the insurance industry remains subject to a patchwork of state regulations that have stifled competition  innovation  and growth     said Sununu     The existing governing system spreads across more than 50 jurisdictions and has proven burdensome and expensive for all concerned  A more uniform regulatory environment mirroring the highly successful dual banking system is long overdue and stands to substantially improve the environment for those who buy  sell  and underwrite life and property and casualty insurance              State commissioners may have hoped to achieve uniformity and market based reform within the state regulatory scheme  but those improvements have simply not occurred and are not expected in the near future     Sununu continued     Streamlining an overwhelming and tangled web of state rules for financial regulation  licensing  policy forms  rates  and market conduct exams under an    optional federal charter    system will encourage greater competition  Moreover  new and innovative insurance products will become available to the consumer more quickly              Editor   s Note    A detailed summary of the Sununu  Johnson    National Insurance Act of 2006    is attached and provides specific details of the bill                OUTLINE OF NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT  NIA  OF 2006   Optional Federal Charter and Regulation   Establishes a parallel  federal system of regulation and supervision for insurers and insurance producers  agents and brokers   similar to the dual banking system   Insurers and producers are free to elect federal or state regulation  charters and licenses   States would maintain responsibility of regulating state licensed insurers and producers      The Office of National Insurance   An independent Office of National Insurance is created within the Department of the Treasury  similar to the OCC and OTS  and its Commissioner would be appointed by the President for a five year term  subject to the advice and consent of the Senate       National Life Insurers and National Property and Casualty Insurers   The NIA authorizes the chartering of two different types of insurance companies  National Life Companies and National Property and Casualty Companies   The underwriting of life insurance and P C insurance is separated  but a holding company is permitted to own both a National Life Insurer and a National P C Insurer       National Agencies and Federally Licensed Producers   The NIA authorizes the chartering and licensing of National Insurance Agencies and the licensing of federal insurance producers   A National Agency would be authorized to sell insurance for any federally chartered or State licensed insurer   A federally licensed insurance producer could sell insurance in any State on behalf of any National Insurer or a State Insurer   Additionally  a State licensed insurance producer could sell insurance on behalf of any insurer  including National Insurers  operating within the State in which the producer holds a license      Conversions Between State and Federal Status   State licensed insurers would be free to convert to a national charter   Likewise  National Insurers would be free to convert to a State charter        Applicable State Law   The activities and operations of federally chartered and licensed entities would be primarily subject to federal law   However  National Insurers and federally licensed insurance producers would be subject to certain categories of State law   These categories include   1  State tax laws   2  State unclaimed property and escheat laws   3  State laws related to participation in assigned risk plans and other mandatory residual market mechanisms that are designed to make insurance available to those unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market  and  4  State laws that provide for compulsory coverage of workers    compensation or motor vehicle insurance      Regulatory and Supervisory Powers   The Commissioner has a comprehensive set of supervisory and regulatory powers   National Insurers are subject to examinations every three years  and National Agencies and federally licensed producers are subject to examination in response to a complaint or evidence of a violation of the law or regulations   National Insurers are subject to risk based capital standards  investment standards  and asset and liability valuation requirements that are based upon model laws and regulations developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  NAIC    National Insurers are subject to an independent audit committee requirement  limitations on dividends  and limitations on transactions with affiliates      Enforcement Powers   The Commissioner is given enforcement powers patterned after those available to the federal banking agencies  permitting him her to   1  revoke or suspend a charter or license   2  issue a cease and desist order  including an order that mandates affirmative actions  such as the sale of assets or the hiring of new management   3  remove or suspend individual officers  directors  controlling shareholders  agents and consultants  and  4  impose civil fines of up to  1 million a day for violations of law or regulations or improper conduct      Ombudsman   An Ombudsman is established within the Office of National Insurance and shall act as a liaison between the Office and any person adversely affected by the Office   s supervisory and regulatory activities   Powers of the Ombudsman include   1  assuring that complainants are encouraged to come forward and that confidentiality is preserved   2  staying any appealable decision or action with prior consent of the Commissioner  and  3  reporting any weakness in policy or procedures and recommending changes for improvement      Consumer Protection   There is established a Division of Consumer Protection within the Office of National Insurance   The Commissioner is directed to issue market conduct regulations to prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts and practices by National Insurers  National Agencies and federally licensed insurance producers   At a minimum  these regulations must address the advertising  sale  issuance  distribution and administration of the insurance policies and products of National Insurers  as well as claims under such policies and products   The Commissioner is directed to establish a Fraud Division within the Office  and makes the commission of a    fraudulent insurance act    a federal crime   The NIA subjects National Insurers to federal antitrust laws      Self Regulatory Organizations   The Commissioner is authorized to register and oversee self regulatory organizations for federally chartered and licensed insurers  agencies and producers   Key powers of the Commissioner  such as chartering and merger and conversion determinations  may not be delegated to a self regulatory organization      Receiverships for Rehabilitation or Liquidation   The Commissioner may place a National Insurer into receivership for rehabilitation or liquidation for a number of circumstances  including the insolvency of a National Insurer   The Office of National Insurance must be appointed as the receiver  and as a receiver  the Office is given all of the powers of the Insurer   The Commissioner is directed to issue regulations governing receiverships that are based upon the Uniform Receivership Law adopted by the Interstate Insurance Receivership Compact Commission in September 1998        Guaranty Fund   Additionally  National Insurers  as a general rule  must belong to the State guaranty associations in each State in which they offer insurance   These associations assume obligations to policyholders  up to certain limits  when an insurer is placed into receivership   If a State guaranty association does not provide policyholders with a level of protection equivalent to NAIC model standards  a National Insurer must join the National Insurance Guaranty Corporation  established under the NIA  which would provide such protections to policyholders   The Corporation would have separate accounts for life insurance and property and casualty insurance  and similar to State guaranty associations  would be post funded with assessments of its member companies    258423
