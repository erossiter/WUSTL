the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Terrorism  today  7 27  delivered remarks at the briefing hearing on United Nations Peacekeeping Reform  held in Room 419 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building      Witnesses at the briefing hearing  which follows the full Committee   s July 21  2005  hearing on United Nations    reform  included  Prince Zeid  Jordan  Permanent Representative to the United Nations  Jane Holl Lute  United Nations    Assistant Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations  and Philo Dibble  Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations    At the Wednesday briefing hearing  Members examined various proposals for United Nations reform  including the Zeid Report  as well as measures proposed by the High Level Panel  the Secretary General   s    In Larger Freedom    report  the Gingrich Mitchell report  and relevant United Nations reform legislation      Sununu   s opening statement reads         This afternoon  it is my distinct pleasure as chairman of the International Operations and Terrorism Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be hosting a combined briefing and hearing on United Nations peacekeeping reform   In so doing  I wish at the outset to acknowledge with thanks the support of Chairman Lugar who is a strong champion of comprehensive UN reform and who hosted a hearing on UN reform  including peacekeeping reform  on July 21st   This session is intended to follow up on that hearing   I am particularly pleased three such distinguished officials have agreed to brief or testify respectively before this Subcommittee    I look forward to hearing their views on how we can make UN peacekeeping more efficient  effective  and faithful to the UN   s founding ideals and the challenges of our modern world          The expectations placed on UN peacekeepers have grown tremendously over the past six decades and the UN    as well as its Member States    has sometimes had a difficult time adapting   Perhaps the biggest changes have come in the last decade and a half since the end of the Cold War   As the recently released report of the Congressionally mandated Task Force on UN Reform notes     Between 1948 and 1990  the United Nations initiated some eighteen peacekeeping operations   Between 1990 and today  the Security Council  with the support of the United States  has initiated more than forty peacekeeping operations      The Task Force report  which former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell chaired  goes on to state      As of late March 2005  there were nearly 70 000 international military and policy forces serving in seventeen UN peacekeeping missions      But it is not just a matter of the number of operations  it is their complexity   Peacekeepers in many cases are being asked to intervene in the wake of devastating civil wars to rebuild entire societies         Peacekeeping is the UN system   s biggest single budget item   The approved budget for the period ending June 30  2005  stood at nearly  4 billion  and was likely to rise significantly for 2005 2006    The total assessment on UN members for peacekeeping  of which the United States pays almost 27   is well in excess of the separate assessment for the UN regular budget         Not surprisingly  peacekeeping reform is not a new topic   One of the most important milestones in peacekeeping reform was the 2000 report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations which UN Secretary General Kofi Annan commissioned    The so called Brahimi Report offered several dozen recommendations to strengthen management of peacekeeping operations   It went a long way as the Secretary General notes in his own UN reform report from March 2005     In Larger Freedom     toward restoring Member State confidence in peacekeeping   Nevertheless  it did not address all the problems as persistent reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeeping personnel made clear         In July 2004  Secretary General Annan asked the respected Permanent Representative of Jordan  His Royal Highness Prince Zeid Ra   ad Zeid al Hussein  a former civilian peacekeeper himself and the ambassador of one of the major UN troop contributing countries  to act as his adviser in addressing this scandal   The Secretary General subsequently asked Prince Zeid to prepare a comprehensive report for the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations   The report  issued in March 2005  sets forth its findings and recommendations under four broad categories   1  the rules on standards of conduct   2  the investigative process   3  organizational  managerial and command responsibility  and  4  individual disciplinary  financial and criminal accountability   The UN General Assembly endorsed the Zeid Report last month   I am delighted that the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has graciously permitted Prince Zeid to brief this Subcommittee on his report and look forward especially to hearing his views on the key challenges faced in implementing its recommendations   He will be the first briefer         As the Gingrich Mitchell Report  the Secretary General   s    In Larger Freedom    report and the December 2004 report of the High Level Panel on Threats  Challenges  and Change which Secretary General Annan commissioned all make clear  however  the misconduct of certain peacekeepers is only one of the impediments UN peacekeeping must overcome   Gingrich and Mitchell identify five additional areas   First on their list  is    doctrine  planning and strategic guidance for mission deployment      They cite as an example the lack of guidance provided to UN peacekeepers in Haiti   Second  they list    rapid deployment    by which they refer to enhancement of standby forces and prepositioned stocks able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis   Third  they note    the absence of developed country involvement  to include the U S   in blue helmeted operations      Fourth  they cite    information analysis and early warning      UN peacekeepers need real time information if they are to be successful   Fifth  Gingrich and Mitchell enumerate    headquarters staffing and funding for peacekeeping operations     The High Level Panel also highlighted this issue   One of the solutions it proposed was to create a small standing corps of senior police  50 100 personnel  to organize the start up of peace operations         I have invited UN Assistant Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Jane Holl Lute  who had a distinguished prior career in the U S  Army  on the U S  National Security Council and in the non profit sector  to be the second briefer   Again  I must express my appreciation to her superiors in New York for permitting her to address this Subcommittee   I am eager to hear her views as one of the leaders of the UN   s peacekeeping operations on the principal challenges that lie ahead           Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs Philo Dibble will appear on the second panel as a witness   He is a member of the Senior Foreign Service and brings considerable experience  particularly in the Middle East    which has seen a large share of UN peacekeeping operations over the years   I know he will offer a useful U S  Government perspective on our discussion today of the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers but also on the range of other peacekeeping issues   In addition  I would welcome comments on the specific provisions regarding peacekeeping in pending UN reform legislation  including the Coleman Lugar bill  S  1383  and the Hyde Bill  which Senator Smith has introduced in the Senate  S  1394          Before I close  I would like to stress the crucial contribution that United Nations peacekeeping operations make to U S  national interests   The plain truth is that we cannot and do not want to be the world   s policeman  but we do have a great interest in preventing the collapse of states which can then provide sanctuaries to our enemies     UN peacekeepers have been successful in the past in helping states make the transition to peace and security    None of these operations are ever authorized without our concurrence as a permanent member of the UN Security Council   My hope is that the reforms we are discussing today will help to strengthen the UN   s role as a force multiplier and pave the way for a more secure world                 241667
