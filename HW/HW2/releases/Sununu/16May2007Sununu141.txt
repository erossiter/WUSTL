                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act  passes Commerce Committee  moves to full Senate for consideration   Contact  Barbara Riley Jeff Grappone      Wednesday  May 16  2007       WASHINGTON  DC   United States Senator John Sununu s  R NH  fight to protect children in and around new vehicles took a step closer to becoming law on Wednesday  when the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation passed the bipartisan  Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act    S  694   The legislation  which Sununu introduced with Senator Hillary Clinton  D NY  on February 27  now moves to the Senate floor for consideration       The Commerce Committee s action underscores that by taking responsible  affordable steps    such as utilizing backover avoidance technologies  power window auto reverse mechanisms  and brake transmission shift interlocks   we can save lives   said Sununu   I will continue to work with families and friends of those children who have died  safety advocates  automakers  and colleagues to get this important bill signed into law       Senator Nelson stated   We already have the technology  all we need to do now is get these safety devices in cars and save lives       Sununu has worked closely on this child car safety legislation with Farmington  New Hampshire resident Packy Campbell  whose son Ian died tragically in an April 2004 accident   Following committee passage of the measure  Campbell stated   This is a golden opportunity to pass the bill in a timely fashion   Reaching an early compromise is our best hope for accelerating congressional consideration as well as the time frame for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulatory actions   I look forward to final passage and signing this bill into law   We would not be in this encouraging situation except for the remarkable and committed role Senator Sununu has played these past three years in moving the bill through the Senate       In Wednesday s markup  the Commerce Committee approved a substitute amendment to S  694 that was introduced by Sununu and Senator Bill Nelson  D FL   The substitute brings the bill more into line with an agreement reached by automakers  consumer safety advocates  and leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee   The Sununu Nelson substitute provides flexibility to the Secretary of Transportation in establishing standards on power window auto reverse mechanisms and rearward visibility requirements  and ensures that brake transmission shift interlock mechanisms become standard equipment on all vehicles sold in the U S  within 3 years      The  Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act   as passed by the Commerce Committee  directs the U S  Secretary of Transportation to enact changes in the following areas      Power window automatic reverse   Requires a rulemaking process for the Secretary to determine if requiring a power window auto reverse safety standard is  reasonable  practicable  and appropriate   If a determination is made that standards are not needed  notification to Congress is required  and consumers would be made aware of vehicles that do or do not have auto reverse windows      Backover warning   Requires a rulemaking process to begin within 12 months of enactment of the bill so that drivers would be able to detect areas behind their vehicle in order to reduce deaths and injuries  Within 36 months of enactment  the Secretary would have to issue final standards that could be met with additional mirrors  sensor devices  cameras  or relevant technology      Brake transmission shift interlock   Requires that all cars made for sale in the United States as of September 1  2010  be equipped with brake transmission shift interlocks to ensure motor vehicles cannot be shifted out of  park  in any key position without a driver first stepping on the brake      Death injury database    Requires the Secretary to establish and maintain a database of injuries and deaths in non traffic  non crash incidents involving motor vehicles  and make it public      Child Safety Information Program   Requires the Secretary to make information available about hazards to children in non traffic  non crash situations  utilizing the database  in order to help avoid backover incidents  hyperthermia  accidental triggering of power windows and other risks       Deadlines   If the Secretary determines that the deadlines in the bill cannot be met  new deadlines would be established and Congress would be notified by the Secretary why the previous deadlines could not be met        30    274448
