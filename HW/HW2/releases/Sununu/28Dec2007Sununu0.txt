    GREGG  SUNUNU URGE NFL TO EXTEND BROADCAST OF DEC  29 PATRIOTS GAME TO MORE NEW HAMPSHIRE HOMES              GREGG  SUNUNU URGE NFL TO EXTEND BROADCAST OF DEC  29 PATRIOTS GAME TO MORE NEW HAMPSHIRE HOMES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Contact  Barbara Riley      Friday  December 28  2007       WASHINGTON   In a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  U S  Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  R NH  requested the National Football League  NFL  extend coverage of the December 29  2007  New England Patriots vs  New York Giants game to all homes in New Hampshire  WMUR TV  New Hampshires only full power network television station  recently purchased the rights to broadcast the upcoming game between the Patriots and Giants  However  the NFLs copyright and distribution policy would limit coverage of the game to southern New Hampshire communities that are served within WMURs Boston television market  thereby prohibiting coverage to the remainder of homes in the Granite State that fall outside of this Boston market and receive WMUR TV services via cable programming  Senators Gregg and Sununu stated  The NFLs copyright and distribution policies limiting broadcasting of their games to within such a narrowly defined home market needs to be reconsidered in the case of the upcoming Patriots game  New Hampshire is a state served by one fully powered television station  however  viewers in certain parts of the state can only receive WMURs programs and services through cable programming  and would fall victim to the NFLs copyright policy that does not allow distribution of the game outside of the NFL defined home market  In New Hampshires case  limiting broadcast of the Patriots game to a portion of our state just does not make sense  While we respect NFLs policy  the distribution lines for television markets are arbitrary and do not take into account New Hampshires unique situation  This decision may negatively impact and shut out many longstanding and loyal Patriots fans throughout the Granite State who have supported their home town team throughout the season and throughout their lives  As we get closer to a perfect season  Pats fans deserve to see history being made  The NFLs decision needs urgent reconsideration          289981
