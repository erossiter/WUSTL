                                                                                                                        Contact  Barbara Riley      Wednesday  June 14  2006       WASHINGTON  DC     United States Senator John Sununu  R NH  today  6 14  introduced bi partisan legislation that would expand the nationally successful Moving to Work  MTW  program     a demonstration project that has provided public housing agencies  PHAs  with flexibility to develop local approaches that encourage self sufficiency and boost housing choices for low income families  Sununu   s bill  which he introduced with Senators Tom Carper  D DE  and Rick Santorum  R PA   would permanently establish the MTW program  making up to 250 PHAs nationwide eligible to participate in an initiative that has been pioneered in part by the Keene Housing Authority          Too often  one size fits all regulations created in Washington prevent individual housing agencies from responding to the needs of their communities  The Moving to Work program addresses this issue by enabling top performing public housing agencies to better serve their clients through locally developed solutions     said Sununu     Across the country  Moving to Work has provided flexibility that has allowed its participants to create programs that encourage responsibility and personal initiative     helping low income families achieve greater independence and expanding housing opportunities              Congress approved the MTW demonstration program  which included up to 30 participating PHAs  in 1996  The project offers PHAs the opportunity to design and test innovative  locally designed housing and self sufficiency strategies for low income families by allowing exemptions from existing public housing and tenant based Housing Choice Voucher rules  Additionally  the MTW program permits PHAs to combine operating  capital  and tenant based assistance funds into a single agency wide funding source  as approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD        By empowering individual PHAs with greater autonomy over their programming and use of federal funds  the MTW program has been successful in                 reducing costs and achieving greater cost effectiveness of federal expenditures                establishing reasonable rent policies that retain affordable rents  and encourage employment and homeownership                providing incentives to families with children where the head of household is working  is seeking work  or is preparing for work by participating in job training  educational programs  or programs that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self sufficient  and                enabling PHAs to focus on their core housing mission by alleviating them from redundant and burdensome reporting requirements       P  Curtis Hiebert  Keene Housing Authority CEO  said     The Moving To Work Demonstration has made a dramatic positive difference in the way that the Keene Housing Authority administers its federal housing programs  Our tenants  program participants and our community have benefited from the increased flexibility authorized by this program  The MTW Charter program will allow many more local agencies to effectively respond to their local community issues to better assist their families  elderly and disabled populations  The entire housing authority industry is grateful for the attention that Senator Sununu is paying to this vital issue  His MTW Charter Act is legislation that should enable local housing authorities to better serve the low and moderate income citizens of their communities          The    Moving to Work Charter Program Act of 2006    has been endorsed by the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association  the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities  and the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials  Although the legislation helps to modernize how PHAs support their clients  it would not change federal housing quality standards for these entities and would require PHAs to continue assisting a similar number of low income families as they currently serve        Sununu  a member of the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs  is a strong advocate for affordable housing  and has worked extensively with state and local housing agencies on housing issues of importance to New Hampshire  Last month  he introduced legislation that would reduce excessive paperwork and reporting requirements for small PHAs         30
