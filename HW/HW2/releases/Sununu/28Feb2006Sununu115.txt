voted today  2 28  to invoke cloture  end debate  on legislation introduced by United States Senator John Sununu  R NH  that bolsters support for Constitutional rights in the PATRIOT Act  In remarks delivered on the Senate floor prior to the 69 to 30 vote  Sununu said the bill  S  2271  represents a substantial step forward in the long effort to clarify and improve civil liberties protections in the terrorism fighting law  Sununu issued the following statement regarding the bill         I want to touch on the three elements of this bill so that all Senators and the public understand how each of these provisions takes us forward  Maybe the agreement represented in this bill does not move us as far forward as some in the Senate might like  but it moves us forward nonetheless         First  in this bill  we create an explicit review of the gag order that accompanies a 215 subpoena  Some have criticized the fact that there is a 12 month waiting period for taking that gag order before a judge          In our legislation  the SAFE Act  we had a three month waiting period  We asked for a three month waiting period  and we ended up with a 12 month waiting period  That is the nature of compromise  but we did get an explicit judicial review of the gag order  I think the principle that any gag order be given an opportunity for review before a judge is not only a step forward but a victory on principle  and it will guide us in the future when we deal with similar questions         Second  we eliminated language in the conference report that required the recipient of a National Security Letter to disclose the name of their attorney to the FBI  That is a provision that doesn   t occur anywhere else in the law  It is a provision that could discourage people from seeking legal advice  And in the case of a National Security Letter     a subpoena issued without the approval of a judge     we are not talking about a few dozen subpoenas or a few dozen individuals or businesses affected  we are talking about tens of thousands  Striking that requirement regarding the recipient of an NSL notifying the FBI the name of their attorney  I think  again  is a very important step forward not only in encouraging people to seek legal advice but also a very important principle to set down in this bill          A third improvement is clarification libraries engaged in their traditional role of lending books  providing books to patrons in digital format  or providing access to the Internet  is not subject to a National Security Letter  This is an important clarification of Congressional intent  an important clarification of the existing law which  unfortunately  is not clear on this point         It is not clear because the underlying law uses definitions that were written 20 years ago before the age of the Internet  I hope the Judiciary Committee will take up a full review and evaluation of the definitions and the standards regarding technology and the underlying law that is referenced here  In lieu of that  the least we can do is provide clarification as to how and when this law applies to institutions such as libraries  We have done so in a positive and meaningful way          I look forward to passage of the bill  I was pleased to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in getting this done  In doing so  in forcing us to take more time and forcing the Administration to add additional protections for civil liberties to the legislation and putting together a bipartisan group willing to demand these things  we sent an important message  a message that we have a group willing to work in Congress to achieve these improvements and a message to the Administration that when we are dealing with these issues  they need to be engaged and active and working toward consensus from the very beginning of the process           30    251960
