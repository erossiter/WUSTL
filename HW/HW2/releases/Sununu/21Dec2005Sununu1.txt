his support for a three month extension of the USA PATRIOT Act in the event that Congress does not reach a final agreement on the bill   s reauthorization before the end of the year  Sununu  who was joined at a Capitol Hill press conference this morning by Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Chuck Schumer  D NY   released a letter signed by 52 Senators urging Majority Leader Bill Frist to extend the PATRIOT Act to provide Senators with additional time for discussion      The text of the letter follows       December 20  2005      The Honorable William H  Frist  MD     United States Senate Majority Leader     Room S 230  The Capitol     Washington  DC 20510      Dear Mr  Majority Leader       We are writing to let you know of our support of S  2082  bi partisan legislation introduced by Senators Sununu and Leahy  that would provide a three month extension of the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act and the lone wolf provision of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act in the event the Senate is unable to gain agreement on a conference report to reauthorize these provisions         We sincerely hope that House and Senate negotiators will reach agreement this week on a reauthorization bill that balances the needs of law enforcement with civil liberty protections for innocent Americans   However  if such an agreement cannot be reached before both Houses adjourn this week  federal law enforcement officials should continue to have use of the investigative tools of the PATRIOT Act   A three month extension of the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act and the lone wolf provision of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act will accomplish this goal        As you  President Bush  Attorney General Gonzales and others have emphatically noted in recent days  the PATRIOT Act provides important tools for federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prevent terrorist attacks   Therefore  these law enforcement tools should remain in place should our work on final reauthorization legislation take us into the new year         Sincerely    Signatories to the Sununu Schumer Leahy letter include 8 Republicans and all Democrats except for
