                                                                                             Wednesday  February 22  2006       WASHINGTON  DC      United States Senator John Sununu  R NH  today  2 22  announced that the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has selected New Hampshire as one of six locations across the nation to serve in a Low Vision Rehabilitation Services Demonstration Project  The initiative  which will allow Medicare beneficiaries to receive vision rehabilitation therapy in their own homes  was modeled after legislation first authored by Sununu in 2003        It is widely known that blindness and vision impairment contribute to numerous injuries that frequently require hospitalization and extensive treatment  This demonstration project will provide vision impaired seniors with critical rehabilitation services and supply Congress with the information it needs to further determine whether vision rehabilitation should be uniformly available across the country for all Medicare beneficiaries     said Sununu     I am eager to continue working toward the inclusion of additional states as the demonstration progresses  Prevention and intervention are paramount to avoiding these debilitating and costly incidents  and this project will play a role in helping more seniors live safe and independent lives      Sununu announced the initiative at a press conference on Wednesday  February 22 at the New Hampshire Association for the Blind   s McGreal Sight Center in Concord  NH  He was joined by George Theriault  President and CEO of the New Hampshire Association for the Blind  and Janet Akins  a client of the Association   Theriault stated     By learning new skills in the demonstration project  senior citizens who are blind and those who are visually impaired will achieve greater independence and security while living safely at home and with their families  In addition  their participation will play a critical role in helping to determine whether all Medicare recipients will be eligible for coverage in future years          The five year Medicare project will begin on April 1  2006 and run through March 31  2011 and will consist of six demonstration sites     New Hampshire  North Carolina  Kansas  Washington state  New York City  and Atlanta  Georgia   At those locations   low vision rehabilitation services will be provided in the home by vision rehabilitation professionals under the general supervision of a physician  At the conclusion of the study  HHS and CMS will produce a report based on the data collected during the study to determine whether low vision rehabilitation services should be covered nationwide for all Medicare recipients across the country        Protecting vision impaired individuals from injuries in the home  such as hip fractures and burns  not only improves the quality of life for older Americans  but can also save the Medicare program valuable resources     said Sununu     This is an opportunity to give seniors additional independence by helping to cover some of the cost of vision rehabilitation therapy for those who have vision impairment   It helps them accomplish basic tasks like getting around their homes and getting outside their homes and will be the first step to improving the lives of tens of thousands of visually impaired seniors       Sununu is a longstanding legislative advocate for standardizing national coverage under Medicare for vision rehabilitation therapy provided in home by physicians  vision rehabilitation professionals  and occupational therapists   In May 2003  he introduced the bipartisan    Medicare Vision Rehabilitation Services Act of 2003     legislation that resulted in an effort to create a five year  vision rehabilitation services demonstration project   The measure was passed as part of the Senate version of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act  and the subsequent demonstration project was adopted in the conference report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill  which the Senate approved in January 2004   The    Medicare Vision Rehabilitation Services Act of 2003    earned the support of several organizations for the blind and visually impaired including      New Hampshire Association for the Blind  New England College of Optometry  New England Eye Institute  American Academy of Ophthalmology  American Optometric Association  American Council for the Blind  The Glaucoma Foundation  National Council on Aging  Editor   s
