Act Conference Report

                                                                               Wednesday  February 15  2006       WASHINGTON  DC     United States Senator John Sununu  R NH  delivered remarks today  2 15  on the floor of the Senate regarding legislation  S  2271  he introduced on February 10   The measure reflects the agreement that Sununu     along with Senators Larry Craig  R ID   Lisa Murkowski  R AK  and Chuck Hagel  R NE      secured last week with the White House to include additional civil liberty protections in the PATRIOT Act Conference Report  In particular  that package addresses Section 215 subpoenas and National Security Letters  NSLs   and clarifies that libraries functioning in their traditional capacity  including providing basic Internet access  are not subject to NSLs   The conference report  and the proposed changes to the conference report put forth in Sununu   s bill  provide numerous new protections for civil liberties while maintaining the important law enforcement tools needed to investigate terrorists       Sununu delivered the following remarks         Mr  President  I rise today to speak in support of the motion to proceed and in support of the underlying legislation itself  This bill was introduced to make changes  changes to the PATRIOT Act conference report that was delayed at the end of last year  just as we were ready to adjourn for the holidays          That conference report had some flaws and weaknesses  I began focusing on and working on reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act well over a year and a half ago  recognizing that we could do more to improve the original Act  we could make this bill more balanced by adding better protections for civil liberties even as we reauthorized the law enforcement tools in the PATRIOT Act to give law enforcement power to conduct terrorism investigations         I don t think there is anyone in this chamber who believes we should not provide law enforcement with tools necessary to deal with the threat of terrorism  both domestically and overseas  But whenever we give law enforcement new tools  new powers  we want to make sure they are balanced  balanced by the ability of individuals who think they have been singled out unfairly to raise objections in court  balanced by the ability of individuals to seek legal advice  balanced by restricting the use of these tools to ensure they are only used in appropriate circumstances  That is what protecting civil liberties is all about           As the process of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act began well over a year and a half ago  a bipartisan group of senators  including myself  joined to highlight a number of areas where we felt the legislation could and should be improved and strengthened to provide the kinds of protections I mentioned          We spoke with Justice Department officials  not a month or two months before this process began  but  as I   ve said  over a year and a half ago  raising our concerns in a clear  articulate fashion  trying to make certain that DOJ knew full well that there was a bipartisan group that would push to make changes to improve the PATRIOT Act and that we would be willing to stand up for those changes and stand up on principle           Unfortunately  the people who should have been engaged in this discussion process early on simply were not and much of the work was left to the very end of the process  and continued after the law was originally set to expire at the end of last year  As a result  changes that should have been made early were not  and we found ourselves with reauthorization legislation that could not win enough bipartisan votes to gain passage at the end of December          What I wish to do today is to talk about the changes that were made to the PATRIOT Act earlier in the reauthorization process that better safeguard civil liberties  and the changes that are in this underlying legislation that I think will allow us to move forward with some confidence that we have made additional improvements since the cloture vote in December           In the conference report that was delayed  I certainly agree that there were many significant improvements made to the original PATRIOT Act  For example  improvements were made to add clarity to a roving wiretap order to require more specificity as to the target or location of the surveillance to be conducted  Improvement was made to add clarity to delayed notification search warrants  which are search warrants that are conducted without immediately telling the targets of the search          I think delayed notice search warrants are appropriate tools for law enforcement  but at a certain point law enforcement either needs to inform the target of the search or get agreement from a judge to further delay the notification  In the delayed conference report we added clarity  We added a requirement that the target must be notified of a search within 30 days unless a judge agrees to continue delaying the notification          We were successful when we took a stand at the end of last year in moving the sunset period in the draft conference report from a seven year sunset on the most controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act to a four year sunset period  so that 215 subpoena power  a very significant subpoena power for law enforcement to access the most sensitive of records  the lone wolf provisions and the roving wiretap provisions I mentioned  would have to be reviewed four years from now          All of these were improvements to the PATRIOT Act  But a number of us still had many concerns  concerns in three particular areas           First  our most significant concern was and is the breadth of the standard for obtaining a 215 subpoena  We felt     and we still feel     it is unnecessarily broad  It could result in the gathering of information that is not only extraneous  but pertains to innocent Americans  We think that standard should be more narrow so that there be shown that an individual who is a target of this subpoena be connected to a suspected terrorist or suspected spy  The current standard of mere relevance to a terrorist investigation is unnecessarily broad           Second  we feel there should be a clear judicial review  a review before a judge  of the gag order associated with the 215 subpoena  If you are the recipient of one of these subpoenas  that subpoena comes with a restriction on your ability to tell anyone about the subpoena  But you ought to be able to challenge that gag order before a judge           Third  we feel the provision in the conference report that required the recipient of a National Security Letter to disclose the name of their attorney to the FBI was punitive and might have the result of discouraging an individual from seeking legal advice  Over the last six weeks  I have worked with a number of my colleagues  Democrats and Republicans  on changes to the PATRIOT Act  negotiating with the Justice Department  making members of the House aware of what we were pursuing  working with Chairman Arlen Specter  who has been very helpful throughout this whole process  Senator Leahy  Senator Durbin  Senator Feingold have all been part of these discussions and I have worked to share with them the concepts we were working on  the language we were working on in the areas where there were still differences  differences between those who wanted to pass the conference report as it was and those of us who felt we could strike a better balance           In the end  we have worked out an agreement on language that has received bipartisan support and makes changes to the conference report in three areas          First  we add a clear  explicit judicial review process for the 215 subpoena gag order  It is a judicial review process that is very similar to the judicial review process for the National Security Letter gag order set forth in the conference report  I think it is important that we stand for the principle that a restriction on free speech such as a gag order can be objected to in a court of law before a judge  You can at least have your case heard  That does not mean you will win  necessarily  but you can at least have your case heard           Second  we were able to get language striking the requirement that the recipient of a National Security Letter disclose the name of their attorney to the FBI  Again this is a punitive provision  and it could have the unintended effect of discouraging people from seeking legal advice           Third  we added clarification to National Security Letters as they pertain to libraries  Our agreement adds a provision that makes very clear that libraries operating in their traditional role  including the lending of books  including making books available in digital form  including providing basic Internet access  are not subject to National Security Letters          These are three areas that were highlighted as being of concern at the end of last year  I did   and I think the others would agree   we all did everything possible to stay focused on these areas of concern  We made improvements in each of these three areas  I think we ought to be able to move forward now with the reauthorization  knowing full well that in an effort such as this  no party ever gets everything they want  But having shown that there is a bipartisan group of Members of the Senate and I believe Members of the House as well who will look carefully at these measures  who will push hard for improvements  I think the oversight of the PATRIOT Act will be improved  I know that the reporting to Congress as to how this act is used will be improved  Requirements to report on the use of 215 subpoenas and the minimization procedures used to get rid of data and information on innocent Americans collected through 215 subpoenas and National Security Letters are improvements           So I feel confident we have legislation that is a vast improvement over current law in terms of protecting civil liberties  We have oversight that is improved and  frankly  we have a strong coalition within Congress that is committed to doing an effective job in making sure these important law enforcement tools are used effectively but also used fairly           I know not all my colleagues will support this final package  I know in particular Senator Feingold  who has worked extremely hard on this issue  is not able to support this final package  He will speak more eloquently than I can as to the concerns that remain  but among his concerns is the breadth of the 215 standard and the feeling that we ought to be able to agree on and work toward a standard that will prevent fishing expeditions  that will better protect civil liberties but still enable law enforcement to do their job  I share that concern and that goal  but I at the same time recognize we have an obligation to take the many gains we received throughout the reauthorization process and reauthorize this legislation so we can move forward  focus on our outstanding concerns  and focus on the agenda that still sits before Congress           I thank the President for the time and the opportunity to lay out the improvements that are in the package before us  I look forward to the debate and the discussion  but I do hope we can  in a deliberate fashion  complete work on this legislation that now has gained bipartisan support  has gained additional votes from Republicans  including Senator Craig  Senator Hagel  Senator Murkowski  who have raised concerns  Senator Durbin  Senator Feinstein  and others on the Democratic side who have stood with us too since the end of last year in the hopes of improving the balance of the conference report  I think we do the country a service by enacting this legislation now with a commitment to continue to try to improve it wherever we can           30      251585
