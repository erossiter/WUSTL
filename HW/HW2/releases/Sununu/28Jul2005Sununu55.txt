                                                                                  Thursday  July 28  2005       WASHINGTON  DC     The Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs approved today  7 28  bipartisan legislation introduced by United States Senator John Sununu  R NH  that would place images of U S  presidents on a new  1 coin  The full Senate is now set to consider the    Presidential  1 Coin Act of 2005     S  1047   which aims to bolster circulation of the  1 coin and generate billions of dollars for consumers  businesses  and the federal government      Given the success of the 50 state quarter series  the Presidential Coin Program has the potential to prompt widespread use of the  1 coin     generating efficiency that delivers significant savings to the public and private sectors     said Sununu  a Banking Committee member  whose legislation is modeled after the 50 State Quarter Program     In addition to its economic benefits  the  1 coin is a valuable educational tool that will help inspire interest in the history of the leaders of our country  With broad bipartisan support from 70 Senators and the Committee  this legislation now moves to the full Senate  where I will advocate strongly for its final passage      Sununu explained that expanded circulation of a  1 coin could deliver significant cost savings for the private sector     An easy to use  1 coin will help to bring much needed efficiencies to the millions of low dollar transactions that occur each day in our country     saving time and money for businesses and consumers     he said   Additionally  Sununu noted that a  1 coin has the potential to provide savings for the federal government     and the taxpayers who support it     Unlike dollar bills  which have a lifespan of about 18 months  dollar coins can remain in circulation for 30 years or more  By reducing the cost of replacing dollar bills  the federal government stands to realize significant savings  which directly benefits taxpayers     he continued   S  1047 is based on the successful 50 State Quarter Program established by Congress in 1997  That program has helped renew interest in coins  coin collecting and the history of our nation   s states in addition to quadrupling the number of quarters in circulation and earning the federal government billions of dollars  According to the Government Accountability Office  a fully circulating dollar coin would earn as much as  500 million a year for the government  The revenues reflect the difference between the costs of making the coin and the amount of worth it carries in commerce  equaling about  0 80 for each  1 coin   Specifically  the legislation Sununu introduced      Places the images of four U S  presidents on the dollar coin each year  in the order of their service  until all are so honored  starting in 2007       Features the Statue of Liberty on the reverse side of the coin       Locates significant information  such as the date and the so called mintmark  on the edge of the coin      Provides for the Sacagawea coin to continue to be issued during the Presidential Coin Program  upon termination of the program  all  1 coins will revert to the Sacagawea design       Requires the federal government to use the dollar coin in all of its retail operations      Requires that dollar coins be available in convenient forms  including rolls and small bags  enabling businesses to use the coins easily       Takes steps to address problems created by the co circulation of the Susan B  Anthony coin with new dollar coins       Creates a new pure gold bullion coin to honor presidential spouses  generating excitement about the series  and appealing to collectors and investors       Creates a new  pure gold bullion  one ounce coin with the image of the so called    Indian Head    or    Buffalo    nickel     a popular design for investment  and      Calls for the issuing of newly designed pennies to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln    Sununu introduced S  1047 with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid  D NV  on May 17  2005  For a full list of cosponsors  visit thomas loc gov  The U S
