Congressman Jeb Bradley  R NH   today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has included    1 million in funding for the conservation of a significant tract of land at Moose Mountain    Gregg  Sununu and Bradley secured an initial  1 million award two years ago for similar conservation programs at Moose Mountain    The award will work to permanently protect a headwater of the Salmon Falls Piscataqua River and the Great Bay in one of the largest contiguous forests in Southern New Hampshire  The Moose Mountain project is over 2 100 acres in Brookfield and Middleton and is unanimously supported by local communities  The funding is included in the 2006 budget for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Commerce through the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program    With the approval of the measure today  the Appropriations Committee sends the measure to full Senate for its consideration later this year                                                                            Senator Gregg  former Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Commerce and a current member of the Subcommittee  stated     Moose Mountain is an excellent example of local and state environmental stewards identifying critical tracts of land that may be targeted for development and ensuring their future    The protection of Moose Mountain   s environment is critical to the health of the Seacoast  and I am pleased that we have been able to again secure much needed funds to continue to protect areas in New Hampshire that families will be able to enjoy for generations to come                     Senator Gregg created the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection program  funded at  60 million this year and modeled on the successful Forest Legacy program  for the purchase and protection of sensitive ecosystems with the goal of better ensuring their protection from development or conversation         Moose Mountain ranks among New Hampshire   s top natural treasures  and Committee support for this funding takes an important step toward permanently preserving this property for future generations     said Sununu  who as a member of both the House and Senate has been a strong advocate for Moose Mountain conservation efforts     Moose Mountain is a wildlife haven and recreation destination that is located within a fast growing region of our state  Safeguarding it is a priority in the greater effort to preserve the Seacoast area   s long term natural integrity  As the appropriations process continues on Capitol Hill  I will remain a strong advocate for final approval of these important funds             Senator Sununu     while serving as 1st District Congressman     first met Moose Mountain Regional Greenways Members in 2002 to help develop an approach for federal conservation funding  He continued his support for Moose Mountain conservation efforts as a member of the Senate    In an April 20  2005 letter  Sununu urged the Chairman of the Commerce  Justice and Science appropriations subcommittee to include  1 million for the initiative in the Fiscal Year 2006 Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Act                        The conservation measures taken to create the Moose Mountain Greenway is a testament to the strong collaboration between federal  state and local officials  as well as the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests   stated First District Congressman Jeb Bradley   Today s announcement of this federal funding will go a long way in preserving one of the largest undeveloped areas south of the White Mountains                       We are enormously grateful to Senator Gregg for securing funding from the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program for the protection of the Moose Mountain property  and to Senator Sununu and Congressman Bradley for their strong support of the grant     said Jane Difley  Presendent Forester of the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests       It is no exaggeration to say the project would have been impossible without it    The Moose Mountain project is remarkable both for the richness of its resources  and for its sheer size    Thanks to our congressional delegation  today we have taken a huge step forward in protecting this remarkable place forever               We   re absolutely thrilled     said Moose Mountains Regional Greenways Executive Director Joyce El Kouarti       This project has been a long time in the works  and Senator Gregg   s resolute support throughout the process has been essential to its success                  239517
