States Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  R NH  today  7 21  announced Senate Appropriations Committee approval of  900 000 for New Hampshire Community Technical College programs  The Fiscal Year 2007 Labor  Health and Human Services  Education Appropriations bill includes  500 000 for efforts based out of NHCTC   s Concord facility to modernize the colleges    communications system  The Transportation  Treasury  and Housing and Urban Development  TTHUD  Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2007 contains  400 000 for the development of a photonics and laser technology program at NHCTC   s Pease campus  With Committee approval of the funding  the legislation moves to the full Senate for consideration later this year                   Currently NHCTC has a mixture of legacy and disparate network technologies linking their seven campuses together  NHCTC plans to use this money to upgrade their current communications system through three initiatives  The first is to increase bandwidth between the college locations by purchasing routers and switches   Second  they plan to facilitate telecommunications between all seven colleges by standardizing and creating reliable telecommunications between and internal to each college through the purchase of PBX phone systems and network enabled  VoIP  phones  Third  to support intra campus reliable high speed communications  network switches  fiber optic cable  wireless connectivity for laptops and a minimum of category 5e data cable would be purchased       Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  stated     The New Hampshire Community Technical College system provides a diverse curriculum focused on preparing students for many different work force opportunities  This funding will help the entire system modernize a much outdated communication system  providing students and faculty with the most up to date Internet communication abilities  In addition  the funds for the Pease campus will create new high tech learning environments  preparing students for jobs in New Hampshire   s strong high tech community                      At NHCTC Pease  Economic Development Initiative funding provided through the TTHUD bill would be used for the purchase of photonics and laser technology equipment for the establishment of associate and certificate degree programs  The technologies play a critical role in the state   s medical device  communications and automotive industries           The New Hampshire Community Technical College system provides students with a variety of curricula and training opportunities that enable them to fulfill career goals and participate in our state   s high technology economy     said Sununu  who also secured resources for the College as a Member of the House of Representatives     This funding will help to support NHCTC   s ongoing efforts to ensure that students and faculty have access to the most recent technology  At the Pease campus  resources made available through the Economic Development Initiative program will bolster the development of curricula in two areas where there is a growing need for specialized training             This funding will meet a critical technology need at the Community Technical Colleges by helping us keep pace with changing technology and student needs     said NHCTCS Commissioner Bill Simonton      It will help us expand access to our Colleges  improve the capability of our distance learning programs  enable us to offer more web based services to our students  and enhance the security and reliability of our systems  We are grateful to Senators Gregg and Sununu for their support of this vital initiative  which will expand the promise of higher education to more New Hampshire residents          Upon learning of the  400 000 in federal funding  NHCTC Stratham Pease President Thomas Wisbey said     On behalf of the college community  I am thrilled to learn of the appropriation  Senators Sununu and Gregg are terrific supporters of NHCTC and our emerging technologies curricula  At a visit to the college last October  Professor David Miller showed Senator Sununu a demonstration of fiber optic termination and splicing in the fiber optic communications lab  The appropriation will fortify our efforts to build on the elements of Professor Miller   s first level photonics course  and support the design and development of a comprehensive photonics and laser technology education and training center  In 2002  NHCTC   s nationally recognized biotechnology laboratory and education and training center was developed with the support of federal appropriations thanks to Senators Sununu and Gregg  We are fortunate to be able to count on their continued support of NHCTC and our emerging technologies programming at the Pease Tradeport Campus              30        259216
