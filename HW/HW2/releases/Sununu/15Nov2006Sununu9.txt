WASHINGTON  DC     United States Senators John Sununu and Judd Gregg  R NH  today  11 15  announced that the    New England Wilderness Act of 2006     S  4001    legislation to designate 34 500 acres of White Mountain National Forest land in the Sandwich Range and Wild River areas as    wilderness      passed the United States House of Representatives  Sununu authored the Senate legislation  which passed the United States Senate on Friday  September 29  and Senator Gregg co sponsored the measure  The bill now heads to the President   s desk to be signed into law    In explaining the background of the New Hampshire portion of the legislation  Sununu and Gregg said  in November of 2005  the Forest Service recommended the designation of additional acreage as    wilderness    in its Management Plan for the White Mountain National Forest  The    New England Wilderness Act of 2006    incorporates the recommendations of this Management Plan by designating approximately 23 700 acres in the area of the Wild River as    wilderness    and adding approximately 10 800 acres to the existing Sandwich Range Wilderness  The land would remain as White Mountain National Forest land under the protection of the National Wilderness Preservation System  Wilderness areas consist of federal lands that are permanently closed to such activities as mining  logging  road construction  vehicular traffic  and building construction  By law  the establishment of new wilderness must be approved by Congress    Senator Sununu stated     The Forest Service Plan represents a consensus view of how best to protect land in the White Mountain National Forest while ensuring the Forest   s traditional mixed use role  I am pleased that Congress has approved this bill for the benefit of New Hampshire residents and visitors as well as countless generations to come          Local and state officials  citizens groups and other concerned individuals have been working for a number of years toward the goal of designating more wilderness in the White Mountain National Forest  I commend their dedication toward permanently protecting land in the Sandwich Range and the Wild River area     work that will culminate with the President signing this bill into law     Sununu continued    Senator Gregg stated     New Hampshire   s landscapes and natural resources are a big reason why our state is such a great place to live and raise a family  as well as such a big draw for visitors who love the outdoors  By designating more than 34 000 acres of new wilderness  this bill will help further protect our state   s environment and represents a balanced approach on how we manage the White Mountain National Forest   As such  I am pleased that our House colleagues have approved this important legislation and look forward to President Bush signing it into law       Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Jim Jeffords  I VT  also co sponsored S  4001  which in addition to protecting New Hampshire acreage  would designate approximately 42 000 acres of Vermont land as wilderness  The legislation reflects an agreement reached on September 27 by the Vermont Congressional delegation and Governor James Douglas  R     VT     There are currently five    wilderness    areas in the White Mountain National Forest  Of these  four are in New Hampshire  the Presidential Range Dry River Wilderness  the Great Gulf Wilderness  the Sandwich Range Wilderness  and the Pemigewasset Wilderness  The Caribou Speckled Mountain Wilderness is in the State of Maine    Jane Difley  President Forester of the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests  Richard Minard  President of New Hampshire Audubon  Julie Wormser  Appalachian Mountain Club Policy Director  and Dan Yetter  co founder of the Friends of Wild River  a volunteer group of New Hampshire residents  issued the following statements upon the bill   s original passage on September 19   Difley  stated     This is terrific news for New Hampshire and for the White Mountain National Forest  The Wilderness designation is the first of several steps to fully implement the White Mountain National Forest Plan  On behalf of the 10 000 members of the Forest Society  I commend Senators Sununu and Gregg for their strong support of not only the Wilderness Act  but the entire WMNF plan  The combination of the 34 500 acres to be designated as Wilderness  along with the traditional mixed use role of the White Mountain National Forest overall is consistent with the founding vision of the Forest Society  which calls for the wise use of New Hampshire   s forests and their complete reservation in places of special scenic beauty      Minard stated     Senate passage of the    New England Wilderness Act of 2006    attests the national significance of New Hampshire   s remaining wild places and the value that we all place in keeping those lands wild  New Hampshire Audubon celebrates the bill s adoption and the leadership of Senator John Sununu and Senator Judd Gregg  By designating parts of the Sandwich Range and the Wild River areas as wilderness  the bill fulfills the vision of a broad coalition of New Hampshire residents and protects wildlife habitat for generations of Granite Staters to come       Wormser  stated     We re delighted to hear of the passage of the  New England Wilderness Act of 2006  Throughout their careers Senators Sununu and Gregg and their colleagues in Vermont have been strong champions for the White Mountain and Green Mountain National Forests and the multiple use approach to managing them  The areas included in this legislation are beautiful places our members and others enjoy for hiking and backpacking  wildlife viewing  and the solitude of the backcountry experience  This legislation represents the culmination of nearly a decade of collaboration among hundreds of local residents  the US forest service and our members of congress  Today the senators have given us all something to cheer about       Yetter stated     This makes me so happy  We have been working with the forest service and the congressional delegation for nearly nine years  and to see this bill pass the Senate is truly a dream come true  I love the Wild River Valley for its seclusion  its quiet  its unbroken vistas  and the inescapable sound of running water from the dozens of brooks and streams that tumble down the valley  I hope Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg one day can take a break from their busy schedules and come celebrate their efforts with us in the new Wild River Wilderness Area
