                                                                                                 Thursday  March 16  2006       WASHINGTON  DC     United States Senator John Sununu  R NH  backed Senator Judd Gregg s  R NH     Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act     S  1215  during Senate Commerce Committee consideration of the bill on Thursday  3 16   Sununu chairs the Commerce National Ocean Policy Study subcommittee  which initially reviewed the legislation  S  1215  authored by Gregg  would authorize federal funds for the purchase and protection of sensitive coastal ecosystems with the goal of better ensuring their protection from development or conversion      Senator Gregg stated     Recognizing the important and irreplaceable attributes of New Hampshire   s diverse environment and ecosystems  we started the CELP program back in 2001 and believe that Congress must pass this legislation to further build upon the program   s success   This national conservation program leverages state  local and private funding to protect coastal and estuarine areas that are environmentally significant and are being threatened by development   To date  this program has invested over  177 million towards 119 conservation projects in  25 of the nation s 35 coastal states  In New Hampshire  we have been successful in helping several New Hampshire projects through federal dollars secured through the CELP program  including Massacre Marsh in Rye  Hurd Farm in Hampton  and over 2 100 acres at Moose Mountain   I am pleased that the Senate Commerce Committee has again approved this legislation  as they did in the past Congress  and look forward to working with my colleagues to move it along this year   Protection of our natural resources and habitats is absolutely critical to maintaining our rich heritage and quality of life         Senator Sununu stated     New Hampshire   s Great Bay estuary is one of the most diverse ecosystems of fish  wildlife  and plants in the nation     a result  in large part  to our state   s tradition of strong environmental stewardship  Unwavering dedication to conservation at the local and state level and the availability of federal Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection  CELP  program funds have helped protect this sensitive coastal region from the pressures of commercial and residential development  I strongly support Senator Gregg   s initiative because it will help provides future resources for this invaluable mission in New Hampshire and other coastal areas around the country             Ted Diers  Coastal Programs Director  New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services  commended Gregg and Sununu for their support of the measure stating     CELP builds partnerships to protect coastal resources  It is flexible to local and state priorities while recognizing that healthy coasts are a national concern  The New Hampshire Coastal Program is proud to support CELP and appreciates the leadership of Senators Gregg and Sununu on this important legislation         Both the State of New Hampshire and the communities of our coast are convinced that voluntary land conservation is one of the key tools for protecting coastal resources  Over the past five years  the towns in the coastal watershed have spent over  48 million on land conservation  This year alone  the New Hampshire Coastal Program has identified 15 land conservation projects that could be accomplished in partnership with local governments and land trusts  Together these projects would protect some 6 000  acres of our most pristine and highly threatened coastal lands  CELP is one of the few funding sources that are available to protect such lands which  given their proximity to tidal waters  are rapidly rising in price beyond what local communities can afford  CELP has already protected 2 800 acres of New Hampshire in the past four years  Without CELP  many of those lands would have been developed with tremendous impact to our coastal resources       S  1215  introduced by Gregg on June 9  2005  would authorize the CELP program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at a level of  60 million annually for the coming four years  Currently  the program is funded on a year to year basis  Since 2002  the program has protected close to 3 000 acres of New Hampshire land critical to water quality protection  wildlife habitat  and public recreational access      The    Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act    has earned support from the following organizations  Association of National Estuary Programs  Coastal States Organization  The Conservation Fund  International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies  Land Trust Alliance  National Estuarine Research Reserve Association  The Nature Conservancy  The Trust for Public Land  and Restore America s Estuaries      Editors Note  See attached list  from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Service of New Hampshire conservation projects that have previously utilized CELP funding              Hurd Farm  Hampton This 155 acre property   s outstanding agricultural soils  natural woodland habitat  water resources  and historical heritage were protected in May 2005 through the use of conservation easements partially funded through a  500 000 CELCP award  Hurd Farm has over one mile of frontage on Taylor River  a tributary to the ecologically significant Hampton Flats salt marsh  The property includes large freshwater wetlands  productive agricultural fields  hiking trails and unfragmented forest habitat  which together serve as a key conservation anchor between existing and protected lands along the Taylor River  In partnership with the Trust for the Public Land  TPL  and the Rockingham County Conservation  the Towns of Hampton and Hampton Falls passed bond measures in March 2004 to help fund this purchase   The remaining funds were assembled through a  500 000 grant from CELCP  a  400 000 grant from the USDA Federal Farmland and Ranchland Protection Program  and  100 000 from the New Hampshire s Land and Community Heritage Investment Program  illustrating how several grant programs can come together to achieve land protection      Sagamore Creek  Portsmouth This project  completed in October 2003  was successful thanks to a  1 987 million CELCP grant and the partnership between the city of Portsmouth  the Seacoast Land Trust  TPL and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests  The 10 acre Sagamore Creek Headlands property juts into Sagamore Creek  a biologically rich estuary in the coastal zone  The property was on the market for condominium development in 2002  The City now owns and manages the property for habitat protection and low impact recreation  Within a mile   s walk from downtown Portsmouth  the land includes 2 000 feet of frontage on Sagamore Creek  a waterfront walking trail through mature forests  significant wildlife habitat  and dramatic rock outcroppings commanding terrific views of the estuary       Massacre Marsh  Rye This success story  made possible by a  1 484 million CELCP grant and a multi partner effort led by the town of Rye  helps to preserve not only important ecological habitat  but also recreation opportunities and scenic views from nearby travel routes in the coastal zone  The 24 acre property  which lies on across Route 1A from Wallis Sands Beach State Park  was purchased by the town of Rye in November 2004  Massacre Marsh is relatively undisturbed  with salt marsh wetlands and a winding tidal stream bordered by forested upland  The protected property contains at least one rare plant  and four other rare natural communities have been identified nearby in other parts of the marsh       The town matched the CELCP award by acquiring an additional  1 48 million worth of conservation land in the area  The additional land was acquired with approximately  1 1 million from the  5 million land bond the town passed in 2003 and the remainder was donated in the form of a conservation easement to the town       Moose Mountains  Brookfield and Middleton With  1 000 000 in funding from CELCP  FY06   a groundbreaking public private partnership led by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests  SPNHF  protected nearly 2 200 acres in the Moose Mountains of Brookfield and Middleton  NH   Located at the core of one of last large un fragmented forest blocks remaining in New Hampshire   s coastal watershed  the project protected a key headwater of the Salmon Falls Piscataqua river basin  and a significant portion of the rivers    remaining pristine watershed   The Moose Mountain project also protected habitat for a wide variety of native wildlife  particularly species that require a large home range such as moose  deer  black bear  coyotes  and bobcat   The project secured permanent public access to a local and regional recreational resource long been used by the public for hunting  snowmobiling  hiking  bird watching  skiing  and other outdoor recreation        Piscassic Greenway  Newfields The Piscassic Greenway is a 330 acre property and keystone link between two blocks of existing conservation lands that  if protected  will create an open space corridor of more than 2 000 acres stretching from Newmarket to Exeter  The property   s wetland and upland habitats host a rich diversity of plants and wildlife  and with over 1 200 feet of shoreline on the Piscassic River  will safeguard two important drinking water sources for Newfields and Newmarket residents  The popular Manchester Portsmouth Rail Trail runs through the property  and the public has long enjoyed exploring the area   s existing network of trails   This project will complete protection of an area amounting to 7  of the land area in the town of Newfields   CELCP has already contributed  2 million towards this project   s success in its FY 2006 grants cycle   A partnership of the town  TPL and  the Rockingham Land Trust is working to secure additional funding to complete the project         30    252781
