that a key Senate panel has approved  18 5 million for two construction projects benefiting NH military personnel   10 4 million for the completion of the New Hampshire National Guard Joint Forces and Civil Support Team headquarters in Concord and  8 1 million for the construction of a new acoustic testing and calibration facility at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard   The funding is included in the 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill that was approved the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier today   The measure now awaits consideration by the full Senate  A full description of each project is attached      Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  stated     Currently the Air National Guard State Headquarters is located at Pease  fifty miles away from the office of the Adjutant General in Concord   The National Guard Joint Forces is far too spread out and in many cases using buildings and office space inadequate for its needs   And with the excellent news that New Hampshire has been awarded a Civil Support Team  the completion of a comprehensive facility where the Joint Forces can work under one roof is great news and will lead to greater efficiency and coordination           As the entire Northeast Congressional delegation has been saying for years  the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard continues to distinguish itself from any other shipyard in the country with its excellent work and outstanding record   The only acoustic testing and calibration facility currently at the Shipyard is the only one being used by the Navy to certify submarine acoustic equipment   However  the Shipyard will now be able to construct a new facility and continue to serve the Navy with the highest level of service found at any of our nation   s shipyards            Given the ongoing threats to our national security  investing in America   s defense infrastructure continues to be a priority for Congress     said Sununu     The military construction spending bill approved by the Appropriations Committee today includes funding for defense initiatives that are important to our state and the nation  Under the legislation  the New Hampshire National Guard would receive  10 4 million to build a Joint Forces headquarters in Concord     bolstering the Guard   s readiness posture  The bill also includes  8 1 million for the construction of a modern and efficiently configured acoustic test and calibration facility at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  As the appropriations process continues  I will continue to advocate strongly for final approval of these vital resources         Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill    10 4 million     NH National Guard Joint Forces and Civil Support Team Headquarters          The current    headquarters    of the NH National Guard Joint Forces is spread among several aging and inadequate facilities   The new headquarters at the National Guard facility in Concord  will transform the current Aviation Support Facility into the Joint Forces headquarters   New Hampshire has also been announced as the recipient of a Civil Support Team  a 22 member team designed to support and combat Homeland Security issues  and the new headquarters will house their personnel and equipment as well  The completed renovations will hold the NH National Guard Army  Air  and Combined Task Force Headquarters  as well as the New Joint Operations Center to support the NH Office of Emergency Management         8 1 million     Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Acoustic Testing and Calibration Facility      These funds will allow the Shipyard to construct a new acoustic test and calibration facility  used to test and certify hydrophone transducer equipment used by all U S  Naval surface ships and submarines and U S  Coast Guard ships   The new facility will include a two story steel structure surrounding the test tank and control center  and will help consolidate personnel as well as eliminate background noise                241213
