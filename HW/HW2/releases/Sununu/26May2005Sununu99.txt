                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Legislation would mandate discount for Medicaid  other Federal programs   on drugs promoted to consumers with tax deductible advertising   Contact  Barbara Riley      Thursday  May 26  2005       Washington  DC     U S  Senators Ron Wyden  D Ore   and John Sununu  R N H   today unveiled legislation to reduce taxpayers    costs for commonly advertised prescription drugs purchased by Medicaid  Medicare  and other Federal programs   The Pharmaceutical Advertising and Prudent Purchasing Act would require discounts for programs such as Medicaid  to eliminate advertising costs passed on by pharmaceutical companies as part of a drug   s price  drug companies already receive tax deductions from the Federal government for their advertising costs  as do most American businesses   Drugs advertised directly to consumers are among those drugs on which Federal programs spend the most total money for outpatient care  studies have indicated that advertising  not medical need  may have contributed to national upswings in prescriptions for those drugs   For this reason  the Wyden Sununu legislation also requires a report to Congress on how drugs advertised directly to consumers impact Federal programs in terms of purchase volume  cost  and their suitability for patients    medical needs          The government should make smarter use of its purchasing power for drugs advertised directly to consumers   The Federal government provides a tax break for that advertising  and taxpayers shouldn   t have to further subsidize the drug companies    marketing efforts through Medicare and Medicaid     said Wyden      It   s also important to make sure that when the Federal government buys drugs  they   re buying drugs patients need and not just the pharmaceutical flavor of the month   Insisting on prudent spending of tax dollars and getting the best medical outcomes are not mutually exclusive     in fact  they may go hand in hand             It is no secret that advertising affects the utilization     and price     of many prescription drugs     Sununu said      The rising cost of these medicines compels Congress to protect taxpayers  who ultimately fund government drug purchasing programs   Passage of the bill would discourage costly advertising  lower prices negotiated by the government  and provide greater accountability   Moreover  the study called for by the legislation has the potential to yield important insight into the interplay between advertising and drugs purchased by federal programs that could lead to future cost savings         Specifically  the Pharmaceutical Advertising and Prudent Purchaser Act of 2005 would seek to reduce the costs of directly marketed prescription drugs in Medicaid  Medicare and other Federal programs in the following ways         Requiring the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to adjust certain formulas for those drugs in the Medicaid rebate program  which requires drug companies to have a pricing agreement with the Federal government for medicines dispensed under Medicaid   Changes would not occur for any drug for which the manufacturer certifies that no direct to consumer advertising has taken place in the previous 12 months          Requiring the HHS Secretary and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to negotiate a reduced price for other programs for drugs advertised directly to consumers  unless the drug manufacturer certifies that the drug has not been advertised directly to consumers within the past 12 months    This would affect the Public Health Service and related programs administered by the Indian Health Service  the Department of the Veterans Affairs  and the Department of Defense and the Defense Health Program      In addition  the legislation requires an HHS report on ways that Congress and Federal agencies could reduce taxpayers    costs in Medicare  Parts A  B and D  for drugs advertised directly to consumers  and strategies to make sure that drugs are prescribed in Federal programs based on patients    health needs  not on advertising   The HHS Secretary  in consultation with the VA  would also be required to tell Congress             What percentage of drug companies    advertising costs are passed along to Federal programs when they purchase medicines that have been advertised directly to consumers       The 25 most frequently prescribed drugs that are directly advertised to consumers and that are also purchased or reimbursed by Federal agencies      The 25 most expensive prescription drugs that are directly advertised to consumers and that are also purchased or reimbursed by Federal programs      The aggregate amount that drug companies spend to advertise to consumers for the 25 most expensive advertised drugs       Ways that Federal agencies and programs can share information about drugs that are advertised to consumers  including the costs and utilization of these drugs  and     Additional recommendations to help reduce Federal payments for advertised drugs         This sensible savings in this legislation offer relief not only to beneficiaries of programs like Medicaid  but also to states that are stretching their health care dollars and to the citizens footing the bill     said Wyden      It   s time to take out a sharp pencil and eliminate the hidden costs for taxpayers from these advertised drugs             To ensure the long term solvency of Medicaid and veterans health programs  it is essential that we pursue every opportunity to reduce costs     said Sununu     This bill takes important steps to reduce the cost that the government shoulders for drugs advertised directly to consumers     delivering savings directly to taxpayers          For more information on this legislation  please contact Andrew Blotky in Senator Wyden   s office or Barbara Riley in
