to generate billions of dollars for private and public sectors   Contact  Barbara Riley      Tuesday  May 17  2005       WASHINGTON  DC     Bipartisan legislation introduced today  5 17  by Senator John Sununu  R NH  and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid  D NV      the    Presidential  1 Coin Act of 2005        aims to place the  1 dollar coin in greater circulation in the U S  economy and generate billions of dollars for consumers  businesses  and the federal government  The bill would place the images of U S  Presidents on a new  1 coin      Although the United States government currently issues a dollar coin  many Americans don   t know about the coin and don   t use it     said Sununu     This legislation is designed to prompt widespread use of the dollar coin  provide savings to the economy  earn significant funds for the U S  government  approximately  500 million per year according to the General Accounting Office   and spark new interest in the history of the leaders of our Nation         This bill will help the economy in so many ways     said Reid     It creates new dollar coins that will be both prized by collectors and useful for American businesses  It also creates new gold bullion coins that will be made from ore mined in Nevada and other places around the U S  That will help boost the mining industry and create new jobs in rural areas  The new state quarters have already raised about  4 billion for our national treasury  I expect these new coins will be just as popular     and just as profitable       Sununu pointed out that the new program will also save taxpayer money by reducing the cost of keeping cash in circulation        Modeled after the successful 50 state quarter program  the bill I have introduced will get the dollar coin into people   s hands and pockets  in part by ensuring that it is easy to use for both businesses and consumers     said Sununu     Because millions of low dollar transactions occur in our country every day  a widely circulated  1 coin has the potential to provide efficiency that could result in tremendous savings for the economy     savings that are passed on to consumers                  Sununu explained that popularization of the  1 coin could provide savings for the public sector as well     Whereas dollar bills have a lifespan of about 18 months  a coin can do its work for 30 years  By dramatically reducing the cost of replacing dollar bills  the government will realize significant savings         I believe that the Presidential Coin Program will have an effect similar to the 50 state quarter initiative  generating interest in coins  coin collecting  and the history of our nation     said Sununu   Specifically  the legislation Sununu and Reid introduced      Places the images of four U S  Presidents on the dollar coin each year  in the order of their service  until all are so honored  starting in 2007      Features the Statue of Liberty on the reverse side of the coin      Locates significant information  such as the date and the so called mintmark  on the edge of the coin       Provides for the Sacagawea coin to continue to be issued during the Presidential Coin Program      Requires the federal government to use the dollar coin in all of its retail operations      Requires that dollar coins be available in convenient forms  including rolls and small bags  enabling businesses to use the coins easily      Takes steps to address problems created by the co circulation of the Susan B  Anthony coin with new dollar coins      Creates a new pure gold bullion coin to honor presidential spouses  generating excitement about the series  and appealing to collectors and investors      Creates a new  pure gold bullion  one ounce coin with the image of the so called    Indian Head    or    Buffalo    nickel     a popular design for investment  and     Calls for the issuing of newly designed pennies to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln   In addition to Reid  Senators Elizabeth Dole  R NC   Tom Harkin  D IA   Lamar Alexander  R TN   Dick Durbin  D IL   Richard Lugar  R IN   John Ensign  R NV   Jim Bunning  R KY   Max Baucus
