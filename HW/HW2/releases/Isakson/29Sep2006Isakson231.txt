SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON: CONGRESS GIVES FINAL APPROVAL TO DEFENSE FUNDING FOR GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today applauded Senate approval of the fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations Conference Report, a spending bill that includes a number of important provisions for Georgia military personnel and installations. 
    "Georgia's defense community plays a key role in the global war on terrorism and we must ensure that our military personnel have the resources to carry out their missions," said Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "Additionally, there are countless civilian employees in Georgia working to construct the world's most cutting edge weapons systems currently in use by the joint forces. This bill provides much-needed funding and I am pleased that our colleagues recognize its importance."  
   "Georgia's military bases and defense systems manufacturers are critical to our national security and have played a key role in the War on Terror, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington," Isakson said. "One of our most important duties in Congress is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect our homeland and continue the fight for freedom around the world."
