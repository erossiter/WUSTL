SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FRANKLIN ROAD OPERATION WEED AND SEED PROJECT
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Franklin Road neighborhood of the City of Marietta has been tentatively selected as an officially recognized site for the Operation Weed and Seed program, which helps communities with crime problems bring together people and resources to combat crime and improve the quality of life. 
   The Franklin Road neighborhood has one last step - a site visit - to finalize its selection for the U.S. Department of Justice's Operation Weed and Seed program.
   Becoming an officially recognized site will give the Franklin Road neighborhood preference in receiving discretionary resources from participating federal agencies; priority for participating in federally-sponsored training and assistance; eligibility to apply for Weed and Seed funds; and use of the official Weed and Seed logo.
   "Operation Weed and Seed is a successful and important initiative for our communities and at-risk youth," said Isakson. "I appreciate the Department of Justice's assistance in helping the Franklin Road neighborhood."
   "This important program will fund a wide range of community initiatives, such as housing and rehabilitation, support services, and public improvements for the Franklin Road neighborhood," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
   Operation Weed and Seed is a community-based initiative that encompasses an innovative and comprehensive multi-agency approach to law enforcement, crime prevention and community revitalization.
