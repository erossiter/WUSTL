SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR BREMEN SCHOOLS
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Bremen Board of Education will receive a $17,500 grant to implement a school-based drug-testing program to deter youth drug use for students in grades six through 12.  
   The funds will be distributed through the U.S. Department of Education. 
   "This grant is good news for Bremen schools," said Isakson. "Unfortunately, drug testing is becoming more and more important in our schools. We must help to ensure our young athletes and growing students maintain a safe and healthy lifestyle." 
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend the Bremen Board of Education for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need."
