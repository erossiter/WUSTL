  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today issued the following statement on the death of Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.), who passed away earlier today at the age of 65. 
   "Today we pay tribute to the life of Charlie Norwood, the great accomplishments he made on behalf of his district and his tireless effort to bring quality, affordable health care within the reach of every American. 
   "Charlie will be remembered for many things. His tenacity, his great sense of humor, his commitment to his district and to his constituents. But from a political standpoint and from a service standpoint he will be remembered for Norwood-Dingell, the legislation that laid the groundwork for reforms in health care that continue to this day.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Gloria, their family and his countless friends and supporters."
