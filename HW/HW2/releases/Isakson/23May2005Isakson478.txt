SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $3.6 MILLION IN HURRICANE RELIEF
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today announced that Georgia will receive $3.6 million in grants through the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief program to reimburse the state for damage caused by hurricanes Frances and Ivan that hit Georgia in September 2004.  
   "I am pleased Georgia has received these essential funds that will greatly aid the parts of our state that are still recovering from the impact of two devastating hurricanes," said Isakson. 
   "The impact of hurricanes Frances and Ivan was devastating for parts of Georgia," said Chambliss. "I am pleased to see the Federal Highway Administration has recognized the need for these funds to repair some of the damage done by the storms." 
   The emergency relief program provides funding to repair federal highways and roads on federal lands that have suffered serious damage as a result of natural disasters. Following the major hurricanes that struck the Southeast last year, the Administration requested additional funds from Congress to help states repair the roads and bridges damaged by the storms. 
   Eligible repair work includes emergency repairs needed to restore essential traffic, minimize the extent of damage, or protect the remaining facilities as well as permanent repairs necessary to restore the highway to its pre-disaster condition.
