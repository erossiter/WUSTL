SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES SENATE'S APPROVAL OF MULTIYEAR FUNDING FOR F-22A RAPTOR
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's approval of an amendment by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) to grant the U.S. Air Force authority to enter into a three-year multiyear procurement contract for the F-22A "Raptor" aircraft that will save the government an estimated $235 million. 
   Isakson is a co-sponsor of the amendment, which passed by a vote of 70 to 28. The F-22A aircraft is primarily manufactured at the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Georgia.
   "The F-22A is the most sophisticated fighter jet in the world with the latest stealth technology to reduce detection by radar," Isakson said. "The Raptor provides a priceless service to our Armed Services and to our national security. I'm extremely pleased with the Senate's decision to secure valuable savings for the production of these extraordinary aircrafts."
   The amendment authorizes the procurement of 60 F-22A Raptors over three years, in lieu of the standard annual authorization. The long-term commitment to the Raptor could potentially save the U.S. government approximately $235 million.
