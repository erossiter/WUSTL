SEN. ISAKSON COMMENTS ON STATE OF THE UNION
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) tonight issued the following statement following the President's State of the Union address:
   "I'm not sure there has ever been a more euphoric backdrop to a State of the Union address than the elections that have just taken place in Iraq. This President had the vision to engage the world in spreading liberty and democracy, and it was an honor to be on the floor for his address tonight.  
   "This speech was weighted heavily toward domestic issues because President Bush is setting goals that are very admirable for a President going into his second term. At the same time, he is leaving plenty of room on these issues for the kind of rich debate that they all deserve. 
   "On Social Security reform, the President knows that this is a crisis that can be avoided and that it is a system that can be fixed. We know there is a crisis. We know when it's coming. We know there are ways to solve it. When older Americans understand that their benefits are guaranteed and younger workers realize that the President is working to expand their benefits by allowing them to choose personal accounts, I think you'll find both generations very supportive. I applaud the President for recognizing that any reform is going to take good people finding common ground. I look forward to the debate. 
   "On immigration reform, I have great respect for the President but I have some different priorities on this issue. We have got to decide once and for all that we are not going to continue to reward bad behavior. We must demand that people coming here are going to come the right way and be here legally. First and foremost, we need to address the border security issue and the driver's license issue. Once you have tackled those, then I'd be willing to look at the worker permit issue."
