SEN. ISAKSON: LATEST JOB NUMBERS PROVE TAX CUTS WORKING
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today said that the latest economic figures showing that the United States gained more than 200,000 new jobs last month and 5 million jobs during the last three years prove that the tax cuts passed by Congress in 2001 and 2003 are working. Isakson again urged Congress to make the tax cuts permanent. 
   "I feel very strongly that we should continue our nation's unprecedented economic prosperity by making the tax cuts permanent. We absolutely cannot afford to abandon the very strategy that has created over 5 million jobs in the last three years," Isakson said.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today the 211,000 new payroll jobs were created in March. The current unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, which is the lowest mark in more than four years. The federal revenues for Fiscal Year 2005 totaled $2.15 trillion, which is the highest level ever. More than 3 million taxpayers in Georgia will have lower income tax bills as a result of the tax cuts.
   "These numbers confirm what I have always believed -- letting American taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money pays far better dividends than sending that money to Congress to spend on another government solution," Isakson said.
   Isakson was a co-sponsor of the legislation enacting the tax cuts, which Congress passed in 2001 and 2003. He has continued to be a strong supporter of making the tax cuts permanent.
