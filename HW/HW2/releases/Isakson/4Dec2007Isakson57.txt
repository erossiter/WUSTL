SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP REIMBURSE FIREFIGHTING COSTS OF SWEAT FARM ROAD WILDFIRE
  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised authorization of federal funding to help reimburse firefighting costs associated with the Sweat Farm Road wildfire that started in April of this year. The Sweat Farm Road fire affected approximately 104,152 acres of federal, state and private land. Funding has been made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The authorization includes a 75 percent federal cost share to be applied to all fire management reimbursement grants. 
   "Our firefighters, forestry officials, and rangers did a terrific job responding quickly to the fires that threatened this area of our state and notifying our citizens of this disaster," said Senator Chambliss. "I know the people of Georgia appreciated our first responders' diligence and are appreciative of this assistance, which will be critical in helping folks recover from this wildfire."
   "I am grateful for the heroic efforts of the emergency personnel and the firefighters who battled this unwieldy and fast-spreading fire and protected our citizens," Senator Isakson said. "This funding is welcome news." 
   On April 16, 2007, a wildfire started near the City of Waycross in Ware County. The Sweat Farm Road fire threatened 800 homes and businesses in the Waycross area. Five homes were destroyed and approximately 2,100 people were evacuated. FEMA is providing assistance for reimbursement of costs for use of Georgia Department of Defense Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters as well as a C-23 transport as well as related labor, travel, and per diem and pro-rated military mop-up costs. This was one of five federally declared fires fought in Georgia during a six-week period. The total project cost is $1,454,624.37 and FEMA's share is $1,090,968.28.
