SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, DECLARES REAUTHORIZATION TOP LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the No Child Left Behind Act, the landmark legislation that is providing schools with the necessary resources to give all children a quality education, during a hearing on reauthorization of the law in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. Isakson, who serves on the committee, said one of his top legislative priorities for the new Congress will be reauthorization of this Act. 
   "As one of the authors of President Bush's No Child Left Behind law, I have a vested interest in this legislation and its impact on our nation's education system," Isakson said. "Overall, our school systems are improving and our students are receiving more of the educational tools they need to compete in the 21st Century. I am especially pleased with the increased accountability under No Child Left Behind." 
   When Isakson served in the U.S. House, he was one of a handful of lawmakers invited by President Bush in 2000 to help write the No Child Left Behind legislation. Isakson is now a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which has jurisdiction over education issues including the No Child Left Behind reauthorization.
   "No Child Left Behind has demonstrated improvements in the children it set out to help the most," Isakson said. "That being said, I do realize that there are some areas of the law that need revision. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we re-authorize and improve this valuable legislation."
   In 1996, Isakson was tapped by then-Gov. Zell Miller to lead the Georgia Board of Education. Isakson served in that role until he won a special election for the U.S. House in 1999.
