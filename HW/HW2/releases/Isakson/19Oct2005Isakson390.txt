SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES USDA DECISION TO ABANDON PLANS TO CLOSE FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the U.S. Department of Agriculture for its decision to abandon plans to close 713 Farm Service Agency offices, including offices in Georgia. 
   "I am glad the USDA has reversed its decision to close numerous FSA offices," Isakson said. "These offices are very important to our farmers and the closures would have had a significant negative impact on agriculture producers around the state." 
   The USDA originally planned to close 713 of the 2,351 Farm Service Agency offices, which are located in rural counties and connect farmers to government programs that provide payments and loans.
