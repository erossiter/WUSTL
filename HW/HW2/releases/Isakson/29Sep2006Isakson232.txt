SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS PRAISE PASSAGE OF PORT SECURITY BILL
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised passage of bipartisan legislation to secure our nation's ports.  
   "Securing our nation's ports is a vital part of protecting our nation from those who would seek to harm us," Isakson said. "This bill is a critical tool in the fight against terror." 
   "Folks in Georgia know and understand first-hand that our ports are centers for trade and prosperity, and they keep our local, state and national economies moving," said Senator Chambliss. "We know that one of the real vulnerabilities we have from a terrorism standpoint is our ports, because a great amount of cargo moves in and out of these facilities daily. I am pleased that port security is receiving the attention needed in this era of new threats, and I believe this bill provides for us to continue our security efforts." 
   The legislation requires radiation detectors be used on all cargo entering the United States at all U.S. ports and imposes a deadline for the issuance of identification cards for all workers at U.S. ports. The bill also authorizes an expansion of programs to screen inbound cargo and requires an expansion of incident planning already required under previous legislation.
   The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 Conference Report reconciles the Senate version of the bill with the House version. It now goes to President Bush for his signature.
