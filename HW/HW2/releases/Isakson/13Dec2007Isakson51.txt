SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS PRAISE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO KEEP EXPERIENCED PILOTS IN AIR
  U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's unanimous approval of legislation to increase the mandatory retirement age for U.S. airline pilots from age 60 to age 65. 
   "It is absolutely essential that we standardize our airline pilot retirement policy so that it is consistent with the international standard," Isakson said. "I am extremely pleased that the Senate has passed this bill, which will ensure that thousands of our nation's most experienced airline pilots - many of whom live in Georgia - will not be forced out of their jobs unnecessarily." 
   "Georgia is home to many pilots, and until now they have been denied the right to work until 65 - a privilege granted to international pilots who fly in American airspace," said Chambliss. "I'm pleased that this legislation received such strong support and that we will keep our most qualified pilots in the skies longer." 
   The Federal Aviation Administration's Age 60 Rule came under scrutiny after the International Civil Aviation Organization implemented a new international retirement standard of age 65 on November 23, 2006. This new standard allowed foreign pilots over the age of 60 to fly within U.S. airspace while American pilots of the same age were denied the same right.
   The Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act requires the FAA to sunset the current age 60 rule and raises airline pilot retirement age to 65 immediately upon the President's signature. It was unanimously passed in the Senate and the House of Representatives on Wednesday and now goes to President Bush for his signature.
