SENATE PASSES SEN. ISAKSON BILL GIVING GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO CDC, CDC FOUNDATION
  The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation last night by Sen.  
 Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) that gives the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the not-for-profit CDC Foundation greater flexibility in sharing resources and working directly together for the benefit of the CDC. 
   "The CDC Foundation does remarkable work to enhance the advances made by the CDC to fight threats to the health and safety of all Americans," Isakson said. "I'm pleased the Senate has recognized the importance of giving these two organizations the ability to work together more directly." 
   The legislation amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the CDC to permit the Foundation the use of in-kind services such as facilities, utilities and support services. 
   The bill also increases the maximum amount of money the CDC can give to the Foundation from $500,000 to $1.25 million and lets the CDC redefine its fellowships based on a donation amount as opposed to a time amount. For example, the bill would allow the CDC to extend a two-year fellowship when funds from the Foundation would allow for a third year. 
   The CDC Foundation was established in 1995 to connect outside partners and resources with CDC scientists to build programs that can substantially enhance the CDC's impact. As an independent, not-for-profit organization, the Foundation can accept funding and responsibly create programs that help donors and CDC scientists achieve their common goals.
