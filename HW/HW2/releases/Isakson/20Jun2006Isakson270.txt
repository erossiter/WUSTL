SEN. ISAKSON: U.S. MUST REMAIN COMMITTED TO IRAQ, WAR ON TERROR
  Criticizing Democratic efforts to push for specific timelines for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today again stressed how critical it is for America to remain committed to Iraq and to the War on Terror. 
   "It's time we recognize that we're winning a great victory for mankind, not just the Iraqi people. That America went to enforce a U.N. resolution that the U.N. would not enforce. That we deposed a dictator that everybody said was bad," Isakson said in a speech on the Senate floor.
   "We won in Afghanistan over the Taliban, and we are winning in Iraq today over the insurgency headed by Al Qaeda," Isakson said. "Have some of us forgotten 9/11? Have we forgotten the U.S.S. Cole? Have we forgotten the Fatwa when war was issued on America by Al Qaeda? Most Americans haven't."
   Senate Democrats planned to offer amendments this week calling for the United States to pull all troops out of Iraq by a certain date or for a gradual phase out of troops. Isakson said withdrawing troops before Iraq is fully secure or revealing timelines for the withdrawal of troops sends the terrible message to the terrorists and insurgents that America has lost its will. 
   "If we do not stay the course today, if we turn our back, the world will lose again. Once again the sons and daughters of the United States of America are fighting the right war at the right place at the right time for the right reason. For us to talk about timetables or suggest drawdowns or to compromise our commitment is just plan wrong."
