SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF UNION
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) tonight issued the following statement following the President's State of the Union address: 
   "I just returned home two weeks ago from Iraq. It's remarkable the progress that's been made. It's still a very dangerous place but political progress is now also being made. The sacrifices that have been made by the nearly 4,000 young Americans who have been killed there do not need to go unnoticed or unappreciated. I remain supportive of the President's strategy in Iraq, and I believe it is in the best interest of the United States and the free world that we see this through to the conclusion. 
   "I'm glad the President finally delineated the problem when it comes to earmarks. He pointed out tonight that the last-minute, drop them in at the dead of night, conference committee earmarks are wrong. Authorizations are right, but last minute spending of the taxpayer's money without accountability is dead wrong and should be stopped. The President is absolutely right. 
   "The President was right tonight to highlight the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and how critical it is to the security of the United States of America. The petty differences that may be exhibited right now on the floor of the House and the Senate pale in comparison to the importance of knowing who is trying to do harm to the United States. I fully endorse the President's call to immediately pass FISA so we may ensure that the flow of critical intelligence is not disrupted. 
   "As the President said, this year we must reauthorize No Child Left Behind. This landmark law has demonstrated improvements in the children it set out to help the most. I look forward to working with him again to strengthen our nation's public schools, because I believe our commitment to the principles in No Child Left Behind will continue to improve educational achievement around the country in all subject areas."
