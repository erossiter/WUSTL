SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that the Senate has approved $500,000 in funding for the Atlanta Symphony Center, which will serve as the new home for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.  
   The new center will feature a concert hall, studio hall, learning center, full back-of-house amenities and public facilities. Senate appropriators approved these important funds for Georgia as part of the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and D.C. Appropriations Act. The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to work out a final version of the bill. 
   "I am very pleased to see these funds approved for such a valuable project for the state of Georgia," said Chambliss. "The new Atlanta Symphony Center will draw thousands of visitors each year and will provide a substantial boost to Georgia's tourism and economy." 
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for the Atlanta Symphony Center," Isakson said. "This first class facility will firmly establish Atlanta as one of America's leading cultural centers."
