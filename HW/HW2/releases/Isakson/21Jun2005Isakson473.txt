SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR FITZGERALD MUNICIPAL AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Fitzgerald Municipal Airport will receive a $72,000 grant to extend a runway. 
   The grant will extend Runway 01 by an additional 500 feet to increase the length to 5,500 feet. This will allow for a greater safety margin in the operation of general aviation aircraft using the airfield.
   The Federal Aviation Administration will distribute the funds.
   "I am pleased to announce these funds for the Fitzgerald Municipal Airport," said Isakson. "These improvements will allow the airport to do more business and also improve the safety of the airport." 
   "I am pleased to see Fitzgerald Municipal Airport receive the money necessary to improve its facilities to better serve the area and its customers," said Chambliss. "It is important that we keep our airports properly maintained to ensure safety and to ensure that the region continues to thrive."
