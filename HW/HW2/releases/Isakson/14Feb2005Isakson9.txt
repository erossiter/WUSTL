SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE $1.09 MILLION PROJECT TO RETROFIT JESUP CITY, WAYNE COUNTY COMPLEX
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga, today announced that The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved a $1,099,698 grant to assist the city of Jesup and Wayne County, Ga., in retrofitting the City of Jesup and Wayne County Law Enforcement, Emergency Operations Center and 911 Complex. 
   "The 911 system network, local law enforcement, and the network of agencies working together under one roof during times of emergency provide a vital link in emergency response and recovery for Jesup and Wayne County," said Chambliss. "By retrofitting this building complex, we are assuring a safe working environment for all those people involved."
   "We are pleased to announce this important funding for Jesup and Wayne County," said Isakson. "We must ensure that our first responders are able to work together in safe conditions to meet the needs of our communities."
   The project involves a partial demolition and complete wind / tornado retrofit of the existing complex. The existing roof structure and load-bearing walls are not up to the current building code requirements for this region. The retrofit will make the complex structurally sound.
   The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Pre-Disaster Mitigation Competitive (PDM-C) Grant Program provides funds to states, territories, and federally recognized tribes for pre-disaster mitigation planning and preparedness activities. The grant program is one of President Bush's initiatives, administered by FEMA for pre-disaster mitigation planning and projects primarily addressing natural hazards. Funding these plans and projects reduces overall risks to the population and structures, while also reducing reliance on funding from actual disaster declarations.
