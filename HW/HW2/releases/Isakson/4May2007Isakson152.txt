SEN. ISAKSON CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN SECURITY AT WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced he is co-sponsoring legislation to enhance and strengthen security at wastewater treatment facilities by providing local governments with the tools they need to make security decisions.  
   "Protecting our nation's water supply and the infrastructure that ensures its quality is vital to our nation's security and our citizens' health," Isakson said. "This legislation provides much needed resources, particularly for small, rural communities, to assess the vulnerability of wastewater treatment facilities and address security needs." 
   The Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act, S.1303, authorizes grants to conduct vulnerability assessments for entities that treat municipal wastewater as well as grants to address security needs identified in those assessments. 
   The legislation also authorizes funds for the development, expansion or upgrading of an emergency response plan and voluntary participation in a mutual aid and emergency network preparedness agreement. In addition, it provides technical assistance to small treatment plants to conduct vulnerability assessments and meet needs identified in the assessments.
