SEN. ISAKSON DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY FROM VETERANS AFFAIRS IN WAKE OF THEFT OF PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION DATA OF MILLIONS OF VETS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today demanded immediate improvements in accountability and security at the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the theft of data containing the personal identification information of up to 26.5 million veterans. Isakson is a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   "We should immediately install in the various agencies of the government a rule that any breach of secure information or data is immediately reported to the person in charge, and I mean the Secretary of the agency," Isakson said during a joint hearing of the Senate Veterans' Affairs and Homeland Security and Government Affairs committees examining the details surrounding the theft, which occurred May 3 at a VA data analyst's home in Maryland. "Something like this should never go unknown by the boss. The Secretary, to his credit, accepted the blame, and I appreciate his doing that."
   Isakson urged all federal agencies to work together to develop meaningful reform that will ensure that personal information collected by the government remains secure.
   "We have inspector generals to hold us accountable, to find discrepancies and to point out things we need to do," Isakson said. "We have a situation here that clearly demonstrates that changes need to be made."
   Isakson encouraged the VA to act as quickly as possible to minimize the damage the theft could cause.
   "I hope the administration will respond swiftly to ensure the veterans are protected and they get the information they need," Isakson said. "I think it's important the agency comes together with a seamless policy to protect all veterans."
