SEN. ISAKSON VOICES DISAPPOINTMENT OVER SENATE'S FAILURE TO EXTEND PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today expressed his extreme disappointment over the Senate's failure to extend the Patriot Act.  
 Some 16 provisions of the Patriot Acts are set to expire on December 31, 2005. An effort to end the filibuster of the Patriot Act extension failed today by a 52-47 vote. Senate rules require 60 votes to end a filibuster.
   "I am deeply disappointed by the Senate's failure today to pass this legislation that is so critical to our national security.
   "It is a great credit to this nation and the leadership of this country - Republican and Democrat - that in the days following 9/11, Congress quickly put together legislation to empower the American intelligence network and the world's intelligence network.
   "Without the Patriot Act, our intelligence agencies would have been barred from monitoring the activities of suspected terrorists over the internet. The best way to win the war on terror is to continue to empower the intelligence network of the world with the tools that the terrorists already have. 
   "We are fighting the ultimate war between good and evil, and we cannot afford to lose. We haven't had an attack in four years, but we've stopped countless attacks because of the provisions contained in the Patriot Act. We must extend this essential legislation."
