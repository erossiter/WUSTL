SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PASSAGE OF SMALLER EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL FOR WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's passage of a smaller emergency supplemental spending bill that will provide $94.5 billion for the War on Terror and hurricane recovery. 
   "This bill includes essential funds for our men and women in uniform as they continue the fight against terrorism, and it also includes funds for the victims of Hurricane Katrina as they continue to rebuild their lives ," Isakson said. "I am glad the conference committee was able to prevent this bill from becoming a spending spree for special interests."
   In May, when the bill first went through the Senate, Isakson voted against it because the Senate added an estimated $15 billion in unrelated spending to the emergency supplemental. At the time, the President threatened to veto the bill because of the additional spending, and Isakson said he would support the President by voting to sustain such a veto. During negotiations between the House and Senate to resolve differences, the $15 billion in unrelated spending was removed from the bill.
   Isakson also praised the approximately $1.9 billion included in the bill for additional border security measures.
   "The only way to secure our borders is not with promises of authorizations but with the commitment of appropriations," Isakson said. "These funds are, without question, the most significant component to the issue of illegal immigration and gaining control of our borders." 
   The House of Representatives also approved the conference report today. The bill now goes to President Bush for his signature.
