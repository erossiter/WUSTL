SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR EAST CENTRAL TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the East Central Technical College Foundation will receive a $498,252 grant to establish an interactive IP-based distance learning center. 
   The system will link the main campuses located in Fitzgerald and Douglas to end-user sites in Pearson, Ocilla and Rochelle. The system will serve over 15,000 students and residents in Ben Hill, Coffee and Atkinson counties.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program will distribute the funding.
   "These funds for East Central Technical College will give rural residents the necessary resources to improve education in their community," Isakson said. "I will continue working to ensure Georgia communities receive these important types of funds."
   "I am honored to assist East Central Technical College in their efforts to connect students, faculty, and the surrounding community with access to these important resources," said Chambliss. "It is important that Georgia communities continue to promote learning at every level."
