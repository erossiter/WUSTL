 The trip was the first Congressional delegation to visit Iraq following the country's elections on January 30, 2005. Johnny met with senior Iraqi and Coalition officials as well as wounded soldiers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Johnny also visited with troops from across Georgia and thanked them for the wonderful job they are doing in Iraq.
