  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) will receive $263,287 for MARTA's North Line Extension to North Springs and for the procurement of 56 railcars.  
   The funding will be distributed through the Federal Transit Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation and will complete the federal share obligated to MARTA for this project. 
   "MARTA is a vital piece of Atlanta's transportation system and I am pleased to announce this final federal installment of funds to allow MARTA to complete the North Line Extension," Isakson said. 
   "These funds will advance the efficiency of Atlanta's transportation system and benefit everyone who uses the system," said Chambliss. "The continued improvement of our transportation system will help boost economic development and will be a positive contribution to the entire region." 
   This final grant brings the federal share total of the entire project to $370,451,857.
