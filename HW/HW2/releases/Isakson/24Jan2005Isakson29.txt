SEN. ISAKSON URGES BUSH'S NOMINEE FOR VA SECRETARY NICHOLSON TO PUSH FOR ACCESSIBLE HEALTHCARE, EQUAL TREATMENT FOR RESERVISTS, GUARDSMEN
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today urged President Bush's nominee for Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to ensure that reservists and guardsmen who are being called up are being treated equally to active duty personnel in terms of benefits and retirement. 
   Isakson also used the nomination hearing for U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Jim Nicholson to question him about whether he plans to issue any recommendations regarding accessibility to healthcare for veterans.
   "Our nation's veterans have sacrificed tremendously so that my children and grandchildren and everyone in this room and across this nation can live in freedom," Isakson said. "The most important responsibility we have as a Congress is to see to it that the treatment and services we give our veterans are equal to the sacrifice they have made for our country."
   Nicholson's nomination is expected to be voted on by the full Senate this week. Isakson, a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, will vote to confirm him.
   "There is no one in a better position to serve as Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs than a veteran like Ambassador Jim Nicholson who knows the sacrifice and commitment required to be in the military and serve this country," Isakson said. "President Bush has given us an outstanding nominee."
