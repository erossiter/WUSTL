SEN. ISAKSON PUSHES AMENDMENT TO ALLOW PRAYER AT MILITARY ACADEMIES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today co-sponsored and voted for an amendment to ensure that the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy may legally offer voluntary, non-denominational prayer as an element of their daily activities.  
   "The young men and women who attend these military schools are dedicated to our country and work hard to ensure that this nation can live in freedom . It is only right that they have the opportunity to participate in a prayer if they so choose," Isakson said.
   The amendment will permit the superintendents of the three military schools to offer a voluntary, nondenominational prayer at authorized events, within the confines of the policy of the Secretary of Defense and the U.S. Constitution. 
   The Senate's 99-0 passage of the amendment comes in the wake of much publicity over prayers at the military schools. 
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2003 that Virginia Military Institute's mealtime prayers were unconstitutional because they violated free speech.
   The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland and the Anti-Defamation League have asked the Naval Academy to stop its lunchtime prayer based on that ruling, but academy leaders have declined.
   In addition, the Air Force issued a new policy recently that says prayer "should not usually be included in official settings such as staff meetings, office meetings, classes or officially sanctioned activities."
   The Senate amendment was part of the Department of Defense Authorization bill, which is expected to receive final passage in the Senate this week.
