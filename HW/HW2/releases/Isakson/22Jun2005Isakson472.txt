SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE RELIEF FUNDING FOR EMPLOYEES OF BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Department of Labor (DOL) for approving an additional $2,562,110 to the State of Georgia to provide assistance to approximately 900 workers affected by the closure of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company in Macon, Georgia.  
   The funds are part of a previously announced Workforce Investment Act - National Emergency Grant provided by DOL to Georgia.
   "I am pleased to announce that the Department of Labor will provide additional funding to help curb the devastation felt by the 900 employees affected by the closing of Brown and Williamson," said Chambliss. "This is a smart investment in the middle Georgia economy."
   "The workers who have been laid off in middle Georgia deserve our help, and I am very grateful the Department of Labor has committed these additional funds to assist them," Isakson said.
   In November 2003, Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao awarded a National Emergency Grant to the Georgia Department of Labor for up to $4,218,513 to provide employment-related assistance to approximately 900 workers affected by the closure of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company in Macon, Georgia. Two increments totaling $1,054,013 have been provided. Today, DOL announced it is releasing an additional increment of $2,562,110, for a total provided to date of $3,616,123.
