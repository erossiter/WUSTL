SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PROGRESS, URGES RESOLVE IN COMMITMENT TO IRAQ
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., released the following statement after today's hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iraq. Isakson is a member of the committee and listened to more than four hours of testimony by the U.S. commander in Iraq, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker. 
   "General Petraeus and our armed forces deserve great credit for their success during the surge in Iraq. The general has defined a specific way forward with a reduction of troops that would end the surge by the middle of next year and believes he can accomplish the troop reductions without compromising the security gains made over the past nine months. I think General Petraeus has made the absolute best recommendations possible given the situation on the ground in Iraq. 
   "There are signs of progress, but there also have been failures on the political side. Hopefully, the military's success and the improved security will allow the Iraqi government to make progress on reconciliation and hydrocarbon legislation. Our military has accomplished a lot, but there remains work to be done. As General Petraeus said, troop withdrawals can continue with continued success on the ground."
