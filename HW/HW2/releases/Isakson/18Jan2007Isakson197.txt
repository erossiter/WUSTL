SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS MEET WITH BIPARTISAN GEORGIA DELEGATION ON PEACHCARE FUNDING
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today met with a bipartisan delegation from Georgia to discuss the funding crisis facing Georgia's PeachCare for Kids, the state's health insurance program for children. 
   Georgia is one of several states around the country facing a shortfall in funding for its children's health insurance program. Georgia faces a deadline of January 31st to obtain more funding or face the prospect of having to send letters next month to the families of some 270,000 children enrolled in the program that they may not be able to participate after March.
   Isakson and Chambliss successfully obtained a small amount of additional funding last month for Georgia and other states. Both senators told the delegation that obtaining more federal funding and fixing the federal formula for distributing federal dollars to PeachCare is a top priority.
   "I remain committed to working with Saxby and with our House delegation to find more funding in the short term and to fix this funding formula in the long term so that Georgia can continue to serve these children who really need this health insurance," Isakson said.
   "PeachCare is an important program for providing health care services to a large number of uninsured Georgia children," said Chambliss. "A more effective funding system is needed to ensure that these folks don't have to deal with this year after year. I will continue to stay engaged in this effort to determine an efficient solution to this ongoing problem." 
   The delegation, which met with several officials in Washington, presented the senators with copies of resolutions from the state House and Senate urging Congress to provide funding for PeachCare.
   The members of the delegation from Georgia included:
   * Dr. Rhonda Medows, Commissioner, Department of Community Health 
   * Representative Barry A. Fleming, House Majority Whip 
   * Representative Calvin Smyre, House Minority Caucus Chair 
   * Representative Mickey Channell, Chairman, House Health Subcommittee of Appropriations 
   * Representative Pat Gardner, Member, House Health Subcommittee of Appropriations 
   * Senator Horacena Tate, Senate Minority Caucus Secretary 
   * Senator Greg Goggans, Senate Vice -Chair, Appropriations Committee 
   The delegation was joined in its meetings by Pat Wilson, who represents Governor Sonny Perdue in Washington.
