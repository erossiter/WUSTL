SEN. ISAKSON NAMED TO SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) yesterday was named to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, which investigates allegations of misconduct by members and recommends disciplinary action to the full Senate.  
   U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appointed Isakson to the committee to replace the late Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), who passed away from leukemia last week. 
   "We were all very saddened by the death of our friend and colleague Craig Thomas, and I am deeply honored the Republican Leader would ask me to fill his shoes on this critically important committee," Isakson said. "Ethical wrongdoing by members of Congress should not be tolerated, and I promise to bring the same integrity and principles that Craig Thomas brought to the Senate Ethics Committee."
   "Senator Isakson is well respected as a fair and dedicated leader who will serve us well in his new and important role as a member of the Senate Ethics Committee," said McConnell. 
   Isakson also serves on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
