  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the town of Lumpkin will receive a $74,558 grant for Westville Village's History Alive building restoration.  
   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will distribute the funding. Westville Village is a living history museum, which depicts an 1850 west Georgia village with more than thirty authentically furnished pre-Civil War buildings. 
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for Westville Village," said Isakson. "This living history museum is important to teach Georgia's youth and to keep the history and spirit of 1850's Georgia alive."
   "West Village History museum is helping teach future generations of Georgians about our history," said Chambliss. "I am pleased to announce this grant to help the museum." 
   Housing and community revitalization are at the heart of HUD's mission. This grant is part of the Department's plan to meet local needs and expand opportunities for citizens of Georgia and the nation.
