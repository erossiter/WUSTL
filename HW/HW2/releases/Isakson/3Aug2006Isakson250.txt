SEN. ISAKSON CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR GEORGIA REPRESENTATION ON TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY BOARD
  In the wake of today's announcement that the newest nominee to the governing board of the Tennessee Valley Authority is from Tennessee, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today reiterated his concern over Georgia's continued lack of representation on the board. A Georgian has never been nominated to serve on the TVA board. 
   President Bush today nominated William H. Graves of Memphis, Tenn. to serve on the TVA board.
   "I remain deeply concerned that once again a Georgian has not been appointed to the TVA Board," Isakson said. "Since February, when I first raised my concerns over Georgia's lack of representation, the TVA has been very responsive to Georgia and I am grateful for that. However, all states within the TVA service area should be represented on the Board." 
   The TVA delivers power to some 123,000 households in northern Georgia, but no Georgian has ever been nominated to serve on the TVA governing board. In addition to Georgia, the states of North Carolina and Virginia also have never been represented on the TVA board.
   The current TVA board of directors includes four individuals from Tennessee, one from Alabama, one from Mississippi and two from Kentucky. 
   Isakson said that he will continue to push legislation he introduced in February to expand the TVA board from nine members to 13 members and to add a requirement that each state in the TVA service area have at least one seat on the board. The TVA service area serves Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
   "I am committed to passing legislation I have introduced to require that each state in the TVA service area be represented by at least one member of the board, and I look forward to meeting Bishop Graves and receiving his assurance that the issue of representation on the TVA board will be addressed," Isakson said.
