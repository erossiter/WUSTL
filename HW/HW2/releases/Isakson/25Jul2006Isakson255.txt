SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES NAVY'S DECISION TO MOVE USS GEORGIA TO KINGS BAY
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today received word from the U.S. Navy that the USS Georgia, currently located in Norfolk, Va., will be relocated to Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base as of October 1, 2007. It will be the first time the USS Georgia will actually be assigned to a base in the state for which it is named. 
   "It will be wonderful for a Georgia base to house the submarine that bears the name of our great state. The USS Georgia will be a welcome addition to a base whose future and missions are strong," Isakson said. "I believe Kings Bay will be a part of our community for many years to come."
   The USS Georgia was launched and christened on November 5th, 1982. It was most recently based in Bangor, Washington.
