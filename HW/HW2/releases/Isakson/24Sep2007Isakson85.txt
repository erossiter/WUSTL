SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $127 MILLION IN WATER PROJECTS FOR GEORGIA
  U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised Senate passage of water resources legislation that includes over $127 million for critical water infrastructure projects in Georgia. 
   The Water Resources Development Act authorizes Army Corps of Engineers projects dealing with flood control, storm protection, environmental restoration and inland navigation. The actual funding for the projects would come later during the appropriations process. 
   A conference committee report on the bill passed the Senate today by a vote of 81 to 12 and now goes to President Bush for his signature. Isakson serves as Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which had jurisdiction over the bill, and was selected by Senate leadership to participate in the committee that crafted a compromise on the bill.
   "The passage of this bi-partisan, fiscally responsible bill is a tremendous step for Georgia," Isakson said. "It is an investment in safe drinking water. It is an investment in stormwatermanagement. It is an investment in flood control and water resources across the United States of America."
   "The funding authorized in this bill will go a long way toward enhancing the infrastructure in numerous urban and rural communities across Georgia," said Senator Chambliss. "It was a privilege to work with folks across Georgia who brought their needs to our attention, because this is an important investment in the future of our state as we protect against storm damage and flooding, protect our environment, and enhance commerce through navigation. I commend Senator Isakson for his leadership on this bill through his position on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee." 
   The Water Resources Development Act is supposed to be authorized every two years. However, Congress has not re-authorized the legislation since 2000.
   The bill authorizes the following funds for Georgia projects:
   * $20 million for the construction of conveyance systems to connect both existing and planned wastewater infrastructure and facilities for the Metro North Georgia Water Planning District; 
   * $10 million for Savannah Riverfront development; 
   * $6.175 million for environmental restoration of the Latham River in Glynn County; 
   * $5 million for environmental restoration at Big Creek watershed in Roswell; 
   * $24.5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in the cities of Fayetteville, Grantville, LaGrange, Pine Mountain, Douglasville and Carrollton; 
   * $10 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in the Armuchee Valley; 
   * $8 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Chattooga County; 
   * $7 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Meriwether and Spalding counties; 
   * $4 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Albany; 
   * $5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Moultrie; 
   * $8 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in the City of Toccoa and Stephens County;

   The bill also includes language authorizing aquatic ecosystem restoration projects at the Chattahoochee Fall-Line, Longwood Cove and Mountain Park Dam, as well as a land exchange between Lake Allatoona and the Army Corps of Engineers.
   In addition, the bill authorizes several studies, including a study to determine if the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is causing beach erosion at Tybee Island, a flood damage reduction study of the Macon Levee, a water supply study for Meriwether County and a feasibility study to build a joint port operation in Jasper County, S.C. Georgia is working with South Carolina in developing the port.
   The bill also authorizes a management study of the watersheds of the Chattahoochee, Etowah, Flint, Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers lying within the counties of Bartow, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Forsyth, Gwinnett, Hall, Henry, Paulding, Rockdale and Walton.
