SEN. ISAKSON ON CLIMATE CHANGE BILL: NUCLEAR ENERGY MUST BE PART OF SOLUTION TO REDUCE CARBON
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today voted against legislation in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would cap emissions of greenhouse gases, partly because the legislation fails to address the development of all renewable resources, especially nuclear energy, as part of the solution. Isakson also called for the expansion of nuclear energy, which he believes is a clean, efficient and economical alternative fuel. 
   "As we address reducing carbon in the atmosphere and try to improve the quality of our environment, we will talk about next-generation innovative resources. However, we must also take advantage of existing technologies that generate clean, carbon-less energy and use them to meet the challenges of the 21 st century and the challenges of reducing carbon in our environment," Isakson said. "If we don't revitalize, enhance and encourage technologies such as nuclear energy, we will never be able to reach the goals that we seek."
   During a meeting of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Isakson voted against the legislation to cap emissions of greenhouse gases, calling it a mistake to impose such caps on the one hand while excluding a clean energy source such as nuclear on the other. The bill passed the Committee by a vote of 11 to 8 and now goes to the full Senate.
   Isakson offered a comprehensive amendment to the America's Climate Security Act to expand the nation's nuclear energy infrastructure. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 8 to 11. Isakson said he may seek to offer the same amendment when the bill reaches the Senate floor.
   Specifically, Isakson's amendment would have:
   * Addressed the Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program; 
   * Addressed the Standby Support Program; 
   * Addressed the Nuclear Power 2010 program; 
   * Created incentives for domestic manufacturing of nuclear equipment; 
   * Addressed a nuclear energy workforce; 
   * Streamlined the licensing of new nuclear power plants by eliminating the mandatory adjudicatory hearing for uncontested nuclear plant license applications; 
   * Provided for investment tax credits for construction of new nuclear plants; 
   * Created a National Nuclear Energy Council as an advisory council within the Department of Energy with members appointed by Secretary of Energy; 
   * Addressed the issue of spent nuclear fuel, and how to store it; 
   * Outlined the Implementation of the Temporary Spent Fuel Storage Agreement; 
   * Provided for and expedited review procedure for Congressional Review of any temporary spent nuclear fuel; 
   * Amended the existing Nuclear Waste Policy Act to require DOE to enter into spent nuclear fuel disposal contracts for new plants within 60 days of the docketing of a license application; 
   * Addressed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's "Waste Confidence" rule; 
   * Amended the IRS code to clarify that the existing tax credit shall only apply to the first 12,000 megawatts produced; 
   * Addressed the existing uranium stockpiles that the Department of Energy currently possesses, stockpiles which could be used as reactor cores; and 
   * Outlined an additional interim storage plan. 
   Plant Vogtle, which is located in Burke County, Ga., is applying for one of the first Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses for reactor expansion.
