SEN. ISAKSON URGES IMPROVEMENTS IN FEDERAL CONTRACT PROCESS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today urged the Small Business Administration and the General Services Administration to make their services more user-friendly to help America's small businesses seeking federal contracts.  
   Isakson, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, made the comments during a hearing on increasing government accountability and ensuring fairness in small business contracting.
   The federal government is expected to award 23 percent of all federal contracts to small businesses. However, small businesses face a number of obstacles including the quality of data in the Federal Procurement Data System, contract bundling and size standards. 
   "I've heard horror stories from small businesses in my state who try to use the GSA's Federal Procurement Data System during the work day only to find the system inoperable, which leaves many with no choice but to conduct searches in the evening or on weekends," Isakson said during the hearing. "We must make the services offered by GSA and SBA more user-friendly in order for small businesses to benefit."
   In addition to concerns with GSA's Federal Procurement Data System, Isakson said a number of his constituents have complained about the delays in updating contract awards on GSA's website, which Isakson feels prevents businesses from conducting basic market research and from finding potential subcontracting opportunities. 
   Isakson also said SBA must do a better job of implementing its advocacy responsibility and make better use of its existing resources. Isakson believes SBA could make a huge difference in the number of contracts awarded to small businesses by becoming more proactive.
