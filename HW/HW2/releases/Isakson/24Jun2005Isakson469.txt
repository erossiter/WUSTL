SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $2.3 MILLION GEORGIA HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today announced that Georgia will receive a $2,322,633 grant to enhance security and deter threats around potential terrorist targets. 
   This allocation is being made under the FY 2005 Buffer Zone Protection Program, which is intended to help local law enforcement and first responders take steps to make it more difficult for terrorists to attack high priority targets. 
   The funding will be distributed by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. 
   "We have many locations throughout the state of Georgia that are critical to our homeland security," said Isakson. "These funds will help ensure that these resources are protected and Georgia is as safe as possible from terrorist attacks." 
   "These important funds will help protect not only high risk targets from terrorist attacks but the areas around them as well," said Chambliss. "Through this program our state and local officials will be able to expand the zone of protection around potential terrorist targets to ensure that our resources and our citizens are as safe as possible."
