SEN. ISAKSON DENOUNCES REMARKS BY VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT AT UNITED NATIONS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today condemned remarks by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the United Nations General Assembly and co-sponsored a Senate resolution denouncing Chavez's remarks and his harmful, destructive and anti-Democratic actions. 
   "President Chavez demonstrated on Wednesday that there will always be leaders who will attempt to destroy free and democratic countries," Isakson said. "I'm so proud of our president, our country and especially our men and women in the armed forces. It is important now more than ever that we continue our efforts against terrorism and fight for freedom around the world."
   On Wednesday Chavez spoke before the United Nations General Assembly where he referred to President Bush as "the devil" and made unsubstantiated claims that the United States has set in motion a coup in Venezuela. The Senate Resolution, which was introduced Thursday by Senator Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), denounced Chavez's remarks and condemned his anti-democratic actions as leader of Venezuela.
