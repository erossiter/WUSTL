SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $2.48 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR DARTON COLLEGE
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Darton College will receive a $2,484,456 grant to address the needs of the healthcare industry by developing the first online nursing degree program for rural students in the Southeast. 
   The U.S. Department of Labor will distribute the funds through the President's Community Based Job Training Initiative (CBJTI).
   The college will hire four additional nursing faculty members, which will increase traditional program enrollment by 80 to 100 students per year. Funding will also be used to offset rural hospital expenditures that support the online program.
   "This grant is a great triumph for Darton College, its faculty, students and prospective students," said Isakson. "This program will create new jobs and allow more students to receive their degrees in the important field of nursing."
   "Our state and our nation are in desperate need of more nurses," said Chambliss. "I know this innovative on-line training program will help fill that need."
