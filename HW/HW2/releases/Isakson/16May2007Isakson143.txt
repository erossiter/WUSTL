SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $80 MILLION IN WATER PROJECTS FOR GEORGIA
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised Senate passage of water resources legislation that includes $80 million for critical water infrastructure projects in Georgia.  
   The Water Resources Development Act, which passed by a vote of 91 to 4, authorizes Army Corps of Engineers projects dealing with flood control, storm protection, environmental restoration and inland navigation. The actual funding for the projects would come later during the appropriations process.
   Isakson serves as Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which had jurisdiction over the bill, and was a key negotiator in bringing the bill to the Senate floor. The Water Resources Development Act is supposed to be authorized every two years. However, Congress has not enacted the legislation since 2000.
   "The passage of this bi-partisan, fiscally responsible bill is a tremendous step for Georgia," Isakson said. "It is an investment in safe drinking water. It is an investment in stormwatermanagement. It is an investment in flood control and water resources of the United States of America." 
   "The funding authorized in this bill will go a long way toward enhancing the infrastructure in numerous urban and rural communities across Georgia," said Senator Chambliss. "It was a privilege to work with folks across Georgia who brought their needs to our attention, because this is an important investment in the future of our state as we protect against storm damage and flooding, protect our environment, and enhance commerce through navigation. I commend Senator Isakson for his leadership on this bill through his position on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee." 
   The bill authorizes the following funds for Georgia projects:
   * $20 million for the construction of conveyance systems to connect both existing and planned wastewater infrastructure and facilities for the Metro North Georgia Water Planning District; 
   * $5 million for environmental restoration at Big Creek watershed in Roswell; 
   * $10 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in the Armuchee Valley; 
   * $8 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Chattooga County; 
   * $4 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Albany; 
   * $5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Moultrie; 
   * $8 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in the City of Toccoa and Stephens County; 
   * $5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Dahlonega; 
   * $5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Banks County; 
   * $5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in Berrien County; and 
   * $5 million for municipal water, stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in the City of East Point. 
   The bill also includes language authorizing an aquatic ecosystem restoration project at the Chattahoochee Fall-Line and a restoration project at Mountain Park Dam, as well as a land exchange between Lake Allatoona and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   In addition, the bill authorizes several studies, including a study to see if the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is causing beach erosion at Tybee Island, a flood damage reduction study of the Macon Levee and a feasibility study to build a joint port operation in Jasper County, S.C. Georgia is working with South Carolina in developing the port.
   The House passed its version of the legislation in April. The bill now goes to a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two bills.
