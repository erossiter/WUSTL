SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR BRUNSWICK HARBOR DEEPENING PROJECT
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised final Congressional approval of the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill that contains crucial funding for the state of Georgia, including $19.1 million for the deepening of the Brunswick Harbor - a project that is critical to the future of the Brunswick Port and Georgia's economy.  
   "Georgia ports are extremely important to the economy of our state and the nation," said Chambliss. "This funding will result in the creation of many new jobs, new schools and, overall, a significant economic return for Brunswick and the surrounding area." 
   "From shore protection to waterway navigation, this funding recognizes the importance of the Army Corps of Engineer projects to our nation and especially to Georgia," Isakson said. "I am especially pleased that this bill includes $19.1 million for the deepening of the Brunswick Harbor channel, a project that is critical to the Brunswick port and to the state's economic future." 
   The funds for the Brunswick Harbor will be used to continue deepening the channel from 30 feet to 36 feet, allowing the Port of Brunswick to accommodate larger cargo carriers and attract new business. The deepening of the harbor, along with the completion two years ago of the Sidney Lanier Bridge over the harbor, is projected to bring $400 million annually in new sales, 1,000 new jobs and $15.8 million in additional tax revenue to Georgia.
