SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PASSAGE OF RESOLUTION HONORING MILITARY FAMILIES
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of a resolution recognizing and thanking military families for the tremendous sacrifices and contributions they have made to the United States. Isakson is an original co-sponsor of the resolution. 
   "I have seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifices that our military families have made during the War on Terror," Isakson said. "It is time we recognize and show our gratitude for the important role that these families play in the defense of our nation."
   The resolution honors the families of members of the Armed Forces and recognizes that they too share in the burden of protecting our nation. It also urges the people of the United States to join with the Senate in thanking military families for their tremendous sacrifice on behalf of our country and recognizes with great appreciation the contributions made by military families in providing the essential personal support that our nation's warriors need.
   There are currently more than 3,000,000immediate family members of individuals serving in the Armed Forces. These family members bear the most immediate and profound burden of the absence of their loved ones during the performance of their duties and have been the bedrock of support and strength for our nation's Armed Forces for over 230 years.
