SEN. ISAKSON: MINORITY LEADER SEN. REID MISCHARACTERIZES FILIBUSTER REMARK
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today refuted comments made by Senate Minority leader Sen.  
 Harry Reid (D-NV) in which Reid implied that Isakson has endorsed the use of filibusters to block judicial nominations.
   "My good friend Harry Reid appears to have construed a quote from a Kurdish leader to reflect my opinion on the Senate Democrats' abuse of the filibuster to block judicial nominations. 
   "Let there be no reservation or doubt that I believe the Senate should vote on each and every judicial appointment made by the President of the United States and that no rule or procedure should ever stop the Senate from exercising its constitutional responsibility.
   "I am proud to support Senate Majority Leader Frist in exploring all options to ensure that all nominees receive an up-or-down vote by the full Senate."
