SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today issued the following statement in response to President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court: 
    "I am delighted President Bush has nominated a woman to replace Sandra Day O'Connor. I look forward to meeting Ms. Miers and to listening to her testimony during the confirmation hearings. 
   "I look forward to considering the President's nominee deliberatively, fairly and expeditiously. I will not apply any kind of litmus test for Ms. Miers, and I expect the Senate to treat her with respect and dignity during the confirmation process. 
   "Every judge nominated by this president - or any president - deserves an up or down vote, one way or another. It is the responsibility of the Senate. It is the direction of the Constitution."
