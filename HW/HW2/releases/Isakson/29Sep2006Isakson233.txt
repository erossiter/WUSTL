SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE DESIGNATION OF ARABIA MOUNTAIN AS NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., on Friday announced that legislation to designate Arabia Mountain in DeKalb County as a National Heritage Area was approved by the Senate unanimously. The measure was included in a package of heritage bills (S. 203) and was introduced by Chambliss and Isakson last year. The bill will now move to the president's desk for final approval.  
   "The Georgia delegation has worked hard for the past few years to get this designation. I'm pleased that the recent Senate action takes us one step closer to making this a reality for the citizens of Georgia," said Chambliss. "Arabia Mountain is a true Georgia treasure and with the increasing development around Arabia Mountain, it's only right we protect and preserve this special place from urban sprawl for future generations to enjoy." 
   "Designating Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area is a wise investment in the future of our great state," said Isakson. "We are proud to try to help preserve this wonderful natural resource from urban sprawl."
   The designation of a National Heritage Area grants the Arabia Mountain Heritage Area Alliance the authority to use funds for making grants, making cooperative agreements and contracts for goods and services, and staffing the park. It requires the Alliance to prepare a management plan for the Heritage Area and prohibits any Federal agency, or local, State or Federal government from regulatory authority. The designation would include a large portion of eastern DeKalb, western Rockdale and northern Henry counties. In DeKalb, the area includes Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve, Miners Creek Preserve, and Arabia Lake and Stephenson Creek. 
   The designation has had broad support from key governmental and community leaders.
