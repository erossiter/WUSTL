SEN. ISAKSON: 'EVERY JUDGE NOMINATED DESERVES AN UP OR DOWN VOTE'
 Holding up a copy of the U.S. Constitution, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today urged the Senate to carry out its Constitutional responsibility to give all judicial nominees an up or down vote. 
   "The question is simple and our responsibility is clear. Every judge nominated by this president - or any president - deserves an up or down vote, one way or another. It is the responsibility of the Senate. It is the direction of the Constitution," Isakson said in a speech on the Senate floor this morning.
   Democrats in the U.S. Senate have used the filibuster to block 10 of the President's judicial nominees, refusing to let the full Senate vote to confirm them. Isakson, who was elected to the Senate last fall, said the Democrats' obstructionist tactics on judges was a top issue in Georgia during his Senate campaign last year.
   "As a candidate for the Senate, I was asked by members of the media, by constituents, by Rotary Clubs and Kiwanis Clubs, 'Mr. Isakson, if you are elected, what do you think the Senate ought to do?' My answer was I think every judge ought to get an up-or-down vote because the way I understand it, that's the responsibility of the United States Senate," Isakson said.
   Isakson held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution during his speech and urged his colleagues to heed its words about the responsibility of senators when it comes to voting on the President's judicial nominees.
   "This document is substance. It is the thing that has made the difference in the United States of America and any other country that has ever been formed since the creation of this earth. While it may not be perfect, it's the best man ever did. And it is specific in what our responsibilities are. And in no way does it say maybe, sometimes, or whatever," Isakson said.
   "I go back to a quote my Dad used to always tell me as a young man. He loved Mark Twain and when we had one of those difficult decisions to make, he said, 'Son, remember what Mark Twain said. When confronted with a difficult decision, do what's right. You'll surprise a few. You'll amaze the rest.' A decision that basically is really pretty simple has become for this Senate very complex. But in the end, I think we should peel back the arguments and look back to the foundation under which all of us operate, and that is our Constitution."
