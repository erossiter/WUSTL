SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES COURAGE, CONTRIBUTIONS OF TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the courageous actions of the Tuskegee Airmen, America 's first black military fliers during World War II. Nearly 400 aviators received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress, during a ceremony honoring their service and sacrifice to the country today at the U.S. Capitol. 
   "Through their actions during World War II, the Tuskegee Airmen demonstrated an unwavering devotion to duty," Isakson said. "These men are true heroes, and I'm extremely pleased they have finally received this tremendous honor."
   Isakson was a co-sponsor of the bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on behalf of Congress, collectively, to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of their unique military record, which inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.
   The Tuskegee Airmen were recruited into an Army Air Corps program that trained blacks to fly and maintain combat aircraft. From 1942 through 1946, 994 pilots were trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Tuskegee Ala., receiving commissions and pilot wings. Nearly 500 of those pilots flew more than 1,500 missions over North Africa and Europe.
   Since 1776, there have been more than 300 recipients of a Congressional Gold Medal, including George Washington, Joe Louis, Robert Frost and Mother Teresa. Originally, the award was presented only to military leaders, but Congress broadened its scope to include authors, entertainers, scientists, athletes, humanitarians, public servants and foreign officials.
