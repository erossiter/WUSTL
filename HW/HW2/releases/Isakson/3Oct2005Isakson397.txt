SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR ATLANTA ANTI-DRUG COALITION
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Genesis Prevention Coalition, Inc. in Atlanta will receive a $500,000 grant to conduct drug prevention work in Atlanta. 
   The funds will be distributed over a five year period through the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   Genesis Prevention Coalition, Inc. is a faith- and solution-based network committed to strengthening the overall health of families and communities through advocacy, education and service.
   "This grant is good news for Atlanta," said Isakson. "The more we focus on keeping people from trying drugs in the first place, the easier it will be to keep these harmful substances off the streets."
   "This important program will fund a crucial community initiative in Atlanta," said Chambliss. "I am honored to assist Georgians in their efforts to make our communities better places to live."
