SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR VALDOSTA CITY SCHOOLS
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Valdosta City Schools will receive a $152,845 grant from the U.S. Department of Education for the GEAR-UP Program, designed to increase the number of low income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in post-secondary education.  
   Some of the services this program will provide to students, parents and teachers include: after-school tutorials in reading and mathematics, reading clinics during the school day, standardized testing preparation, college and financial aid counseling, career preparation, summer program enrichment, parental involvement workshops and family reading night, and professional development. The services are designed to increase the number of students who are promoted from grade to grade, who graduate from high school and who enter into programs of post secondary study. 
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for Valdosta City Schools," said Isakson. "This funding will help all students to succeed in rigorous academic courses and that means more of them will graduate and go on to college."
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend the Valdosta City Schools for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need."
