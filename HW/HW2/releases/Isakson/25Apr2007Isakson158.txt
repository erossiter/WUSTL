SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE U.S. ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised Senate passage of legislation to invest in innovation and education to improve the competitiveness of the United States in the global economy. 
   The America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act passed by a vote of 88 to 8. Isakson is a co-sponsor of the legislation. 
   "I am extremely pleased that an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the Senate voted in support of this legislation to ensure that our students are receiving more of the educational tools they need to compete in the 21st Century," Isakson said. 
   The legislation focuses on three primary areas of importance, including increasing research investment, strengthening educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics from elementary through graduate school, and developing an innovation infrastructure.
   The bill is a legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report and the Council on Competitiveness' "Innovate America" report.
