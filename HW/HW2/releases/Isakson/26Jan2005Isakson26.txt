SEN. ISAKSON JOINS SENATE LEADERSHIP TEAM AS DEPUTY WHIP
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) has been selected to join the Republican leadership team as a Deputy Whip for the 109th Congress. 
   As a Deputy Whip, Isakson will work with Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Senate Majority Whip, to build support among fellow senators for the leadership's legislative priorities, which will include Social Security reform, tort reform, tax relief and continuing to support the President in the war on terror.
   "Johnny will be an excellent addition to the Whip Team, and I look forward to working with him during the 109th Congress," said Majority Whip McConnell. "He will play an important role in working with his colleagues from both sides of the aisle to pass an agenda that will benefit all Americans."
   Isakson was sworn in to the Senate Jan. 4 after having served three terms in the U.S. House. While in the House, Isakson also was selected by the Republican leadership to serve as a Deputy Whip in that chamber.
   "I am honored to be selected for this role," Isakson said. "I look forward to working with Senator McConnell and this leadership team to pass legislation that will be good for Georgia and good for this nation."
