SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE PHYSICAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR FAYETTE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today announced that the Fayette County Board of Education will receive a Carol M. White Physical Education Program (PEP) grant of $305,149 for the expansion and enhancement of physical education programs for students in kindergarten through the 12th grade.  
   "This grant is a great triumph for Fayette County's youth and physical education programs," said Isakson. "I am pleased to aid our schools in becoming better places of learning in all areas."
   "As a father, grandfather and former coach, I know first-hand how important physical fitness is for young people," said Chambliss. "Physical activity at an early age not only ensures kids stay healthy, but it also instills a healthy active lifestyle for a lifetime. This grant is good news for the students of Fayette County." 
   Through this U.S. Department of Education program, the Fayette County Board of Education is expected to help students make progress towards meeting state standards for physical education, and incorporate projects that reflect integrated approaches to lifelong physical fitness and healthy eating habits. They will also use program funds to provide teacher training, develop physical education and nutrition education curricula, conduct fitness assessments, and purchase equipment.
