SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES SENATE PANELS FOR ADDRESSING HEALTH INSURANCE WOES OF SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today praised two Senate committees for holding hearings on the growing struggle of America's small businesses to provide affordable health insurance to employees. 
   More than 45 million Americans lack health insurance, and 62 percent of those uninsured are either employed by a small business or dependent on someone who is. 
   Today, the Senate Small Business Committee held a hearing on legislation that Isakson is co-sponsoring to allow small businesses to pool together nationally to create Association Health Plans. On Thursday, the Senate Committee on Help, Education Labor and Pensions also will hold a hearing to discuss the health insurance struggles of small businesses. Isakson serves on both committees. 
   "The ability to provide affordable health insurance is one of the most critical issues facing small businesses in Georgia and across this country today," Isakson said. "The Senate must act soon on a solution that will help level the playing field for small businesses so that they can provide health insurance to their workers who desperately need it."  
   The bill Isakson is co-sponsoring - the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2005 - would allow small businesses to pool together, nationally, to create Association Health Plans and either purchase their health insurance from a provider, or self insure in the same way that large employers and unions currently do. The bill would give small businesses the same market-based advantages and competitive leverage that large employers and unions enjoy when providing employees health insurance.
   The legislation is supported by a large coalition of small business interests representing over 12 million employers and 80 million employees.
