SEN. ISAKSON ANNOUNCES $27.6 MILLION IN HIGHWAY, TRANSIT FUNDS FOR NORTH GEORGIA
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that he has secured $27.6 million in funding for North Georgia as part of the national highway funding bill. Isakson has secured over $211 million for the entire state of Georgia. 
   A conference committee report on the Highway Bill passed the Senate today and now goes to President Bush for his signature. It also passed the House today. 
   "Infrastructure is our state's single greatest need," Isakson said. "This legislation is critical to the state of Georgia, because it will provide our state with the tools necessary to improve and expand its surface transportation infrastructure to meet the demands of a growing population ."
   Isakson was selected by Senate leadership in May to participate in the committee that crafted a compromise on the bill. Isakson also serves on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over highways. As a member of the House of Representatives, Isakson served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which also had jurisdiction over highways.
   The bill includes $10 million for the state of Georgia for transportation improvements associated with capacity increases at statewide military installations as well as $9.1 million for buses and bus facilities. The Southeastern Economic Alliance for Next Generation High Speed Rail will receive $2 million, and the Georgia Ports Authority will receive $5 million for the Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program.
