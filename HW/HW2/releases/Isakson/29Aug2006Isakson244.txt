SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES COLUMBUS TEAM ON LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today applauded the members of the Northern Little League team from Columbus, Ga., who beat Kawaguchi City of Japan yesterday for the Little League World Series title.  
   "I am beaming with pride today. It is with great pleasure that I send my heartfelt congratulations to Manager Randy Morris and all the members of the Northern team in Columbus," Isakson said. "These boys played exceptionally well throughout the entire tournament, and I join with everyone across Georgia in saying how extremely proud we are of the outstanding job they did on the field." 
   A team from Georgia hasn't won the world title since East Marietta Little League beat the Dominican Republic in 1983.
