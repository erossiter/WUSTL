SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $1.5 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR GEORGIA PERIMETER COLLEGE
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Georgia Perimeter College will receive a $1,513,281 grant over two years that will focus on the nursing shortage and the need to expand the pool of healthcare workers in the metropolitan Atlanta area by offering more career options.  
   The U.S. Department of Labor will distribute the funds through the President's Community Based Job Training Initiative (CBJTI).
   The project will increase the capacity of the GPC nursing program and health offering by: training an additional 110 Licensed-Practical-Nurse-to-Registered-Nurse Bridge students through flexible evening/weekend courses; extending the associate degree nursing program to more convenient locations to serve an additional 45 students annually; providing a faculty mentoring program for hospital-based nurse clinicians to serve as adjunct faculty; reducing the burden on the current clinical practice options; integrating Workforce Investment Act funds for career counseling for 100 eligible students; and K-12 health career outreach activities.
   "This grant is a great triumph for Georgia Perimeter College, its faculty, students and prospective students," said Isakson. "This program will create new jobs and allow more students to receive their degrees in the important field of nursing." 
   "Our state and our nation are in desperate need of more nurses," said Chambliss. "I know this innovative on-line training program will help fill that need."
