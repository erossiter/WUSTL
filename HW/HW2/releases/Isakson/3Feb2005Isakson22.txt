SEN. ISAKSON COMMENTS ON BENEFITS FOR SURVIVORS
  Sen. Isakson (R-GA) 
  Hearing on Benefits for Survivors 
  Veterans' Affairs Committee  
   Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA): Well thank you, Mr. Chairman, I will make a comment. I apologize to you and the ranking member and especially to the ladies testifying today for being late, but I had to be on the floor.
   I thank you as the other senators have for your service, for your sacrifice for our country, and I thank you for being here today. I could in no way put myself in your place, but having lost two very close friends, one in combat in Vietnam and another in a non-combat related but military training-related issue, I want to echo the comments of Ms. Smith and the others in terms of the seamless treatment of our veterans. And I think also I want to say, Mr. Chairman, that I really appreciate the initiative that you're taking, because when - in just the testimony I've heard and having read part of Tiffany's statement as I was listening out of the other ear to the questions, seamless is a word also we need to provide the information and access to information on behalf on these widows and family members.
   Knowledge is a powerful thing, and for a young mother in search of the benefits that are rightly theirs, communication can make the world of difference, both in the family on that day as well as in their feelings about the way in which they're treated. 
   So I look forward to working with you on that very end. And I thank you again for your service and your commitment and your willingness to be here today, and I yield back.
