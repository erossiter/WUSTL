SEN. ISAKSON URGES SUPPORT OF PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today spoke on the Senate floor in support of efforts to extend the Patriot Act. The Senate agreed today to bring legislation extending the Patriot Act to the floor for debate.  
   "Today, terrorists use the civil liberties that we cherish to attempt to do harm and in fact destroy us. Because of this, we must watch, listen and pursue our enemies with the technologies of the 21 st century. The Patriot Act does not threaten our civil liberties. It is our insurance policy to preserve them. 
   "When the 9/11 Commission reviewed all that went wrong prior to 9/11, it recognized that what went right after 9/11 was the passage of the Patriot Act. It acknowledged that without our ability to connect the dots we could not protect the country. 
   "We should leave this chamber today sending a message to those that would do us harm that we stand here to preserve and protect, that we will not let any encumbrance stop our pursuit of those that would destroy or injure us, our children or our grandchildren."
