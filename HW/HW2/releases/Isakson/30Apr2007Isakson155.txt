SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES WORK OF CHARTER SCHOOLS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the work of Georgia's charter schools as National Charter School Week 2007 begins on Monday, April 30, and runs through May 4.  
   Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that are open to all students. Educators, community leaders, business people and parents who start charter schools select the curriculum, philosophies and emphases of the schools, such as a back-to-basics foundation, technology focus or school-to-work approach. The start-up nature of many charter schools means they typically operate with less funding and facility support than other public schools.
   "I am proud once again to lend my support to the Georgia Charter Schools Association and National Charter Schools Week," said Isakson. "Charter schools tend to have high achievement rates because parents and the local community are so heavily involved to the very nature of the school."
   Georgia was one of the first states to pass a charter school law in 1993. Georgia now has over 20,000 students enrolled in 59 charter schools across the state. Isakson was Chairman of the Georgia Board of Education from 1996 to 1999, and helped draft the federal No Child Left Behind law as a member of the U.S. House. In the Senate, Isakson serves on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 
   "I am going to do everything I can on a national level to support charter schools, which play a significant role in quality choice in public education," said Isakson. 
   The independence of charter schools allows them to employ innovative educational practices that help boost academic achievement. Across the nation, more than a million children attend one of 4,000 public charter schools in 40 states and the District of Columbia.
