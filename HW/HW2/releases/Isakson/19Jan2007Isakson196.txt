SEN. ISAKSON NAMED SENIOR REPUBLICAN ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) was chosen this week to serve as the senior Republican on the Senate Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over issues such as transportation, federal disaster relief programs, historic preservation and green buildings.  
  Isakson was chosen as the senior Republican, or "ranking member," of the subcommittee by members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, known as the EPW Committee. The subcommittee also has jurisdiction over federal agencies and legislation including the Federal Highway Administration, the Water Resources Development Act, the National Dam Safety Program, the Mississippi River Commission and the Economic Development Administration.
   "I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as ranking member of this important panel," Isakson said. "I look forward to working with all of the subcommittee members, both Republican and Democrat. Infrastructure is my state's single greatest need, whether it's highways or ports. I'm glad Georgia will have a seat at the table when these critical issues come up."
   The ranking member of the EPW Committee, Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla.), also named Isakson as a member of the Committee's Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee as well as the Private Sector and Consumer Solutions to Global Warming and Wildlife Protection Subcommittee.
   The Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Clean Air Act, the Indoor Air, the Tennessee Valley Authority and nuclear plant safety and security. 
   The Private Sector and Consumer Solutions to Global Warming and Wildlife Protection Subcommittee has jurisdiction over global warming, including environmental technology, fisheries and wildlife, the Endangered Species Act and national wildlife refuges.
   "I am honored to serve on these two subcommittees that will be handling issues critical to this nation and my state," Isakson said. " Many clean air and clean water issues have a direct impact on Georgia and I am glad to have a seat at the table for these debates."
   Isakson serves on five Senate committees that have jurisdiction over foreign affairs, education, healthcare, transportation, environment, ports, veterans' affairs, jobs and small businesses. His committee assignments are: 
   * Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions 
   * Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
