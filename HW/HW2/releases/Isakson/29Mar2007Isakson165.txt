SEN. ISAKSON REJECTS TIMELINES FOR WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM IRAQ
  Expressing dismay over the Senate's approval of specific timelines for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today voted against final passage of the emergency supplemental spending bill. In addition, the President has threatened to veto the bill if it includes timelines for withdrawal, and Isakson said he would support the President by voting to sustain such a veto.  
   "We must remember today we are not in a war like past wars. The terrorists don't want to beat us. They want us to lose our resolve so they can rule the world through intimidation," Isakson said. "It is vital that we pass a bill that includes the necessary for funds for our men and women in uniform to do their job, but Congress should not dictate strategy regarding the conflict in Iraq." 
   Isakson again stressed how critical it is for America to remain committed to Iraq and to the War on Terror. Isakson said withdrawing troops before Iraq is fully secure or revealing timelines for the withdrawal of troops sends a message of hope to the terrorists and insurgents that America has lost its will. 
   "For us to talk about timetables or to compromise our commitment is just plain wrong," Isakson said. " We must not undermine the President in a time of war. We cannot disengage or retreat at a time when strength is needed the most." 
   President Bush has threatened to veto the emergency supplemental spending bill if includes a timeline for removing U.S. troops from Iraq. The bill, which was passed by the Senate today by a vote of 51 to 47, sets a goal of withdrawing most U.S. troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008.
   If the President vetoes the bill, it would come back to the Senate for a vote on whether the veto should be sustained. 
   "I will vote to sustain a veto if the President issues one because we cannot as a nation lose our resolve while our men and women are in harm's way," Isakson said.
