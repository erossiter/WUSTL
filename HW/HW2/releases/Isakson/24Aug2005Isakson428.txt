SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECOMMENDATION BY BRAC COMMISSION TO CLOSE GEORGIA BASES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today released the following statement regarding decisions made by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission to reverse gains to Kings Bay Submarine Base and to close Naval Air Station Atlanta, Ft.  
 McPherson, Ft. Gillem and the Athens Naval Supply School: 
   "I'm extremely disappointed with the BRAC Commission's decision to disregard the proposal for major job gains at Kings Bay Submarine Base. I adamantly disagree with decision to reverse the Pentagon's recommendation and do not understand the logic behind keeping Naval Submarine Base New London open." 
   "Georgia's congressional delegation and its state and community leaders did an outstanding job to make the case against the closure of Naval Air Station Atlanta, Ft. McPherson, Ft. Gillem and the Athens Naval Supply School. I am proud of our efforts and deeply disappointed by the Commission's recommendation to close these four bases"
