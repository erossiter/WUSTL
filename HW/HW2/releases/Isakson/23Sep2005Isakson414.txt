SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR GEORGIA COLLEGE AND STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Georgia College and State University will receive $199,990 from the U.S. Department of Education for the Leadership Program, designed to train individuals to provide specialized services and instruction to students with disabilities. 
   The project will engage scholars at Georgia College and State University in a field-based three-year program in special education and two content areas, provide extensive mentoring and supervision to support participant success, guide scholars in implementation of evidence-based practices in the field, and require scholars to meet rigorous goals across programs competencies through field-based assignments. 
   Participants will be hired by school systems through non-regular certification to meet local needs and to demonstrate project commitment. Therefore, they will be learning on the job throughout their entire program experience. Upon program completion, scholars will "payback" with two years of service for each year of supported training for a total of six years continued employment.
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for Georgia College and State University," said Isakson. "This funding will help students with disabilities receive a better education from professionals trained to handle special needs students."
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend Georgia College and State University for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need."
