  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's confirmation of Judge John G. Roberts Jr. to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  
 The Senate confirmed Roberts by a vote of 78 to 22. 
   "I was honored to cast my vote today on behalf of the people of Georgia to confirm John G. Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States in the history of our country," Isakson said.
