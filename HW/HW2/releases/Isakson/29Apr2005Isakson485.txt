SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE EDUCATION FUNDING FOR DECATUR MENTOR PROGRAM
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced that God's Extraordinary Miracles Are Seen (GEMS), Inc. in Decatur, Georgia will receive $190,830 from the U.S. Department of Education as part of their Mentoring Grants Program.  
   The Mentoring Program's discretionary grant competition gives awards to local educational agencies, non-profit community-based organizations, or partnerships between the two, to promote school-based mentoring programs for children with the greatest need. These projects seek to assist children in receiving support and guidance form a mentor; improve their academic achievement; improve interpersonal relationships with their peers, teachers, other adults, and family members; reduce their rate of dropping of out school; and reduce levels of juvenile delinquency and involvement in gangs.
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend the GEMS program for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive support and guidance from a mentor."
   "Advancing education, especially through mentoring programs, is one of my passions, and I am pleased to announce this grant for GEMS, Inc.," said Isakson. "In the distribution of this grant, the Department of Education has performed a great service for Georgia."
