  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) , who chairs the Senate Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee, issued the following statement on the mine explosion in southeastern Kentucky that killed five miners early this morning: 
   "I was heartbroken to learn this morning of yet another catastrophe in an underground coal mine, this time in Holmes Mill, Kentucky. Dianne and I express our deepest condolences to the loved ones of those who perished.
   "It was just this week that I had the privilege of meeting again with some of the family members who lost love ones in the Sago Mine Disaster in West Virginia earlier this year. Now, another five families must experience a grief that none of us can imagine.
   "I commend the immediate response by the brave mine rescue team members who raced to the scene to attempt to save their fellow miners.
   "I will keep the families of those who died and the entire Holmes Mill community in my thoughts and prayers."
