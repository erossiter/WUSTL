SEN. ISAKSON URGES SENATE TO SUPPORT 'COMMON-SENSE' PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL SECURITY
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today spoke on the Senate floor in support of an amendment to a homeland security bill that would strengthen national security by closing loopholes in existing law.  
   "There is no question that September 11, 2001, changed our nation, and it is important now more than ever that we do everything possible to protect our country from those who seek to do us harm," Isakson said. "It is appropriate and essential for the safety and security of the United States of America and its people that we ensure these common-sense proposals become law."
   Specifically, the amendment would include provisions to criminalize the recruitment of terrorists. It would also prolong the time that the Homeland Security Department can detain dangerous aliens whose home countries will not accept them back into their country and authorize the immediate deportation of suspected terrorists whose visas are revoked. 
   The Senate is currently debating a bill that would implement several recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission that investigated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
