SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $2.5 MILLION FOR FLOOD PROTECTION IN COBB
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Cobb County will receive $2,540,000 to help eliminate future flood losses such as those that occurred in Cobb County and Powder Springs during heavy rains and flooding caused by Hurricane Dennis last summer. 
   The project, using a FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program award, will allow the state of Georgia to acquire 22 substantially damaged single-family homes in both Cobb County and Powder Springs. Those homes, located in a special flood hazard area, will be demolished and the land established as open space in perpetuity.
   "I am pleased Cobb County has received these essential funds that will greatly aid the area and many of its citizens," said Isakson. "I was happy to work with Governor Perdue, Senator Chambliss, FEMA, the Office of Homeland Security-Georgia Emergency Management Agency, Cobb County and the City of Powder Springs to provide relief for those homeowners whose properties were damaged or destroyed."
   "Johnny and I have worked closely with FEMA and many other agencies to make sure our Georgia communities have the resources they need to recover from these tragic natural disasters," said Chambliss. 
   Under the grant, FEMA provides 75 percent of the total project cost--$1,905,000--with the City of Powder Springs and Cobb County responsible for the remaining 25 percent, or $635,000.
