SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE BAGWELL APPOINTMENT TO GEORGIA FSA COMMITTEE
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Ranking Republican Member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that William Bagwell, Jr. of Gainesville, Ga., has been appointed by U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to serve on the Georgia Farm Service Agency State Committee. The Senators sent a letter to Sec. Johanns in February recommending Bagwell for the position.  
   "William Bagwell will be an outstanding representative on the Georgia Farm Service Agency State Committee," said Sen. Chambliss. "His diverse farming background and expertise in various agricultural programs will be a tremendous resource for producers in the state. I can think of no one better suited for this post than William and I look forward to working with him in his new capacity as we advance Georgia agriculture."
   "William Bagwell's knowledge and experience will serve Georgia's agriculture community well in this new post," Sen. Isakson said.
   The Georgia Farm Service Agency State Committee, headquartered in Athens, oversees the activities of the agency. Committee members are appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Committee hears appeals from local farmers and serves as a resource for area producers on USDA and FSA policy.
