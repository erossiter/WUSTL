SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PASSAGE OF BILL TO CUT FEDERAL SPENDING
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised Senate passage of legislation that will save the federal government $39.7 billion over five years.  
   "Balancing the federal budget is an obligation that those of us in Washington owe to future generations of Americans, and this legislation is a first step in the right direction" said Isakson. "Congress must become better stewards of the taxpayers' money." 
   The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 will reduce mandatory spending, which accounts for 56 percent of all federal spending. Left unchecked, that number would grow to more than 62 percent of all federal spending in 10 years. The Senate made several technical changes to the bill so it now must go back to the House of Representatives for final approval.
   "Although I'm pleased with the Senate's efforts today to reduce mandatory spending, I still believe we need fundamental reform of the budgeting process," Isakson said. "I will continue to work for spending restraint and fiscal responsibility."
   Isakson said he is committed to trying to pass legislation to curb federal spending and to demand more accountability from programs that receive federal dollars. To that end, Isakson has co-sponsored several pieces of legislation: 
   * The Government Reorganization and Program Performance Improvement Act would create a commission that will require Congress and the Executive Branch to regularly and formally examine whether Federal programs and agencies are achieving desired results for the American people. 
   * The Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies Act would establish a bipartisan commission to review federal agencies and programs in an effort to eliminate federal spending on programs that are duplicative, wasteful, inefficient or outdated. 
   * The Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act would require the president to submit a two-year budget - rather than the current one-year budget - at the beginning of the first session of a Congress. Members of Congress would then adopt a two-year budget resolution, a reconciliation bill if necessary and two-year appropriations bills during that first session. The second session of a Congress would then be devoted to the consideration of authorization bills and oversight of federal programs. 
   * A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States would allow the President to use the line-item veto to either eliminate or reduce appropriations in any bill passed by the Congress.
