SEN. ISAKSON REJECTS TYING PRESIDENT'S HANDS IN IRAQ, CASTS TWO KEY VOTES FOR STAYING THE COURSE
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today criticized the Senate for attempting to dictate strategy to President Bush regarding the conflict in Iraq. Isakson this week voted against two amendments that sought to force the President to spell out a strategy for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq.  
   "It is crucial that we remember we are not in a war like past wars. The terrorists don't want to beat us. They want us to lose our resolve so they can rule the world through intimidation," Isakson said. "We must not undermine the President in a time of war. We cannot disengage or retreat at a time when strength is needed the most."
   Rejecting any attempt to tie the President's hands in Iraq, Isakson cast two key votes this week in favor of staying the course in Iraq:
   * The first amendment Isakson voted against stated that 2006 should be a year of "significant transition" to Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi forces taking responsibility for their country's security. It mandated quarterly reports to Congress by the administration on progress toward that goal as well as an estimated timetable for the eventual redeployment of U.S. forces. The amendment, sponsored by Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich.), failed on a 40 to 58 vote. 
   * The second amendment Isakson voted against was nearly identical to the original amendment, but it did not include the requirement for the administration to establish a timetable for withdrawal. The amendment, which was sponsored by Senators Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and John Warner (R-Va.), passed on a 79 to 19 vote. 
   "We as a nation cannot lose our resolve. We must remain in Iraq until our job is done," Isakson said. "For us to stay is for liberty and freedom to take root, to grow and to prosper, and for an area in the world that for all time has been in turmoil to have a chance for future time to be in peace."
