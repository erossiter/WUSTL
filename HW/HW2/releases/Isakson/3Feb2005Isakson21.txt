SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES BUSH, URGES CONGRESS TO TACKLE SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today used his first speech on the Senate floor to praise President Bush's willingness to tackle Social Security Reform and urged his colleagues to take action on this pressing issue.  
   "We should not reject this debate out of hand. We should embrace it," Isakson said. We shouldn't reject personal investment. We should encourage it."
   Isakson criticized those reluctant to admit Social Security is in crisis. He also urged his colleagues to act now and s trengthen Social Security for their children and grandchildren. 
   "I heard someone in opposition to reform last night criticize the president for saying it's their money," Isakson said. "They said it's not their money; it's my mother's money. Well that's what's wrong with the system." 
   "We have robbed Peter to pay Paul ,"Isakson continued. "And we're running out of Peters. And we're getting a greater number of Pauls." 
   Isakson also applauded the President's efforts to spread freedom around the globe . However, he said the most powerful message during last night's State of the Union address was not words but a picture.
   "For when Janet Norwood embraced Safia, the president stopped speaking. The Chamber erupted. Tears flowed. But not a word was said," Isakson said referring to the soldier's mother and Iraqi woman in the audience. "If the saying, 'a picture is worth a thousand words' was ever appropriate, it was appropriate on that occasion."
