PRESIDENT DECLARES MAJOR DISASTER FOR ADDITIONAL GEORGIA COUNTIES
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today applauded President Bush's approval of a Federal Disaster Declaration to include all nine Georgia counties devastated by last week's severe storms and tornadoes. Baker, Clay, Crawford, McDuffie, Mitchell, Muscogee, Stewart, Sumter and Taylor counties are all eligible to receive federal funds to help repair the damage in these communities. Both Chambliss and Isakson joined the President during his visit to Georgia over the weekend.  
   "This is welcome news for those who greatly need assistance in recovering from the storms, and I am so pleased that following the assessments on the ground the President has now included all nine counties affected," said Chambliss. "Folks are going to need assistance in getting back on their feet following this devastation." 
   "I thank the President for adding all of the Georgia counties affected by these devastating tornadoes to this disaster declaration. This will ensure that the victims of this tragic storm will be eligible for much-needed federal assistance in their recovery efforts," Isakson said.
