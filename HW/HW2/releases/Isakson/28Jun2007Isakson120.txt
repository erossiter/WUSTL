SEN. ISAKSON URGES SWIFT ACTION ON BORDER SECURITY, RENEWS CALL FOR EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL TO SECURE U.S. BORDER
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today said the President and Congress must commit to securing the border as the first step of immigration reform, and he renewed his call to secure the border by using a supplemental spending bill to fully fund the manpower and technology necessary to do so.  
   Isakson today voted against a procedural motion to cut off debate on the immigration bill. The procedural vote failed 46 to 53. Senate rules required 60 votes to proceed with the bill.
   "It is clear we have a crisis in confidence among the American people over our commitment to secure the border," Isakson said. "Because past promises have yet to be fulfilled, the confidence level in the Congress and in the Administration to secure the border and to pay for enforcement measures is too low for immigration reform to proceed."
   Isakson believes border security must be "de-coupled" from the rest of the immigration bill, and that it must be the first, separate step of reform, before anything else takes place. He believes this is the only way to assure the American people that the President and the Congress are serious about securing the border. 
   Two weeks ago, Isakson and Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) sent a letter to President Bush urging him to request an emergency supplemental spending measure for border security. In the wake of today's vote, Isakson renewed his call for an emergency supplemental spending bill. 
   "We pass emergency supplementals for various things in this body. We've done it in response to Katrina. We've done it in response to Iraq. I would submit that the American people would tell you there's no greater emergency right now than securing our border," Isakson said. "An authorization is a promise, and an appropriation is a commitment. It is time that Congress makes a commitment and makes border security a reality."
