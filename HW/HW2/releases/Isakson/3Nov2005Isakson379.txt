SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE AGRICULTURE FUNDS FOR OPERATION OAK PROGRAM
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Sen.  
 Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced final Congressional approval of the fiscal year 2006 funding bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture including more than $400,000 in funding for the Operation Oak Program.
   The Operation Oak Program is a federal partnership to supply oak and other mast producing hardwood species seedlings to meet the needs of timber production and wildlife management and to reverse the decline of hardwood regeneration.
   "I am so pleased that the Senate was able to help fund the Operation Oak Program," said Chambliss. "The program will allow us to continue to supply oak and other mast produced hardwood seedlings to meet the needs of timber production and wildlife management and to reverse the decline of hardwood regeneration."
   "These funds are an investment in the future of our state and will help to preserve our forests for future generations," Isakson said. "Agriculture is Georgia's number one industry and a vital part of our economy. I am pleased the Senate saw fit to support this worthy program."
