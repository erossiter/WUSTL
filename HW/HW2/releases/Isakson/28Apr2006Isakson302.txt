SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES WORK OF CHARTER SCHOOLS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the work of Georgia's charter schools as National Charter School Week 2006 begins on Monday, May 1, and runs through May 6.  
   Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that are open to all students. Educators, community leaders, business people and parents who start charter schools select the curriculum, philosophies and emphases of the schools, such as a back-to-basics foundation, technology focus or school-to-work approach. The start-up nature of many charter schools means they typically operate with less funding and facility support than other public schools.
   "I have been a long-time advocate of charter schools," said Isakson. "Parental involvement is key to student achievement and charter schools rely very heavily on parental involvement. I am proud to lend my support to the Georgia Charter Schools Association and National Charter Schools Week."
   Georgia was one of the first states to pass a charter school law in 1993. Georgia now has over 20,000 students enrolled in 56 charter schools within 15 different school systems across the state. Isakson was Chairman of the Georgia Board of Education from 1996 to 1999, and helped draft the federal No Child Left Behind law as a member of the U.S. House. In the Senate, Isakson serves on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 
   "I am going to do everything I can on a national level to support charter schools, which play a significant role in quality choice in public education," said Isakson. 
   The independence of charter schools allows them to employ innovative educational practices that help boost academic achievement. Across the nation, more than a million children attend one of 3,600 public charter schools in 40 states and the District of Columbia.
