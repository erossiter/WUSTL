SEN. ISAKSON MEETS WITH JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today met with United States Supreme Court Nominee Judge Samuel Alito and issued the following statement in response to the meeting:  
   "Judge Alito is in person what he has appeared to me to be in print and on television. He is a very forthright individual and meticulously knowledgeable about the law. 
   "Coming out of the private sector before I came to Congress, I was very impressed with his record as well as his understanding of the free-enterprise system and private property rights. 
   "I am very supportive of Judge Alito. Our meeting was a confirmation of all the things I have heard and read about him. I have seen nothing that would lead me to anything other than a positive vote. I obviously look forward to the confirmation hearings, and I will listen to them closely. 
   "Everything I have read, seen, and learned firsthand today about Judge Alito are very favorable. I think he's a very competent individual, and I told him he is a credit to the President."
   Judge Alito currently serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit: Confirmation hearings for Judge Alito are scheduled to begin January 9, 2006. A vote on the nomination is tentatively scheduled for January 20, 2006.
