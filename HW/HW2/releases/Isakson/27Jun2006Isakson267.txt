SEN. ISAKSON VOICES DISAPPOINTMENT OVER SENATE'S FAILURE TO PASS AMENDMENT GIVING CONGRESS RIGHT TO PROTECT AMERICAN FLAG
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today expressed disappointment when the Senate refused to adopt a constitutional amendment that would empower Congress to ban desecration of the American flag. Isakson is a co-sponsor of the amendment, which failed by a vote of 66 to 34.  
   "Unlike some, I do not believe the flag is an inanimate object. I believe it's a living symbol for which we have fought for over two centuries," Isakson said on the Senate floor. "This amendment does nothing to prohibit the speech of anyone but everything to protect the flag from being desecrated. I think those brave men and women who died for this country would agree with that. I agree with that and I think the people of Georgia agree with that."
   In 1989, the Courts ruled that Congress did not have the right to pass a law banning flag desecration. S.J.Res.12 is a Constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to pass a law banning flag desecration. A Constitutional amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate and House, and then ratified by three-fourths of the states.
