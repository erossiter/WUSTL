SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON: DEFENSE FUNDING BILL BENEFITS GEORGIA
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss- R-Ga.., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised Senate passage of the conference report for fiscal year 2006 Defense Appropriations Bill saying that the bill strengthens our national security, addresses important quality of life issues for our troops and includes funds for weapons systems made in Georgia. The bill was amended to remove a provision that would allow oil exploration in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge. Because of this change, the bill now goes back to the House of Representatives for final approval.  
   "Georgia plays a major role in the national security of the United States," said Chambliss, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. "Not only do our military installations contribute to our strong national defense, but Georgia workers also play a key role building the best weapon systems that help our men and women in the armed forces fight and win wars. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am pleased to help secure these important funds for our troops and for important weapons systems built in Georgia that our military needs."
   "Georgia's military bases and defense systems manufacturers are critical to our national security and have played a key role in the war in Iraq, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington," Isakson said.
   Overall bill highlights include: $97.0 billion for Military Personnel, $123.6 billion for Operation and Maintenance, $76.5 billion for Procurement, and $72.1 billion for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation. The bill fully funds the 3.1% military pay raise, effective January 1, 2006, and end strength levels requested for active duty and Guard and Reserve Personnel in the President's budget. The bill provides an increase of $71 million for Family Advocacy, childcare programs, and assistance to military families and $35 million for Impact Aid. The bill also provides a total of $150.3 million to cover costs of the enhanced life insurance and death gratuity benefits originally approved in the FY 2005 war supplemental.
