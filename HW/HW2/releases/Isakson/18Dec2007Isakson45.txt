SEN. ISAKSON COMMENTS ON PASSING OF FORMER GEORGIA HOUSE SPEAKER MURPHY
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today released the following statement concerning the passing of former Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives Tom Murphy:  
   "Tom Murphy's passing is a loss to all our state and all of our citizens. Tom Murphy was a giant in Georgia politics, and his legacy is everywhere. Without Tom Murphy there would be no World Congress Center or Georgia Dome or MARTA. Without Tom Murphy our parks, our schools and rural roads would not be what they are. Simply put, Georgia would not be what it is were it not for Speaker Murphy. 
   "As tough as he was on the outside, he had a soft spot in his heart for children, the poor and the sick. He was a product of the Depression, and it left a lasting impression on him. In many a speech, Speaker Murphy would reflect on the days of his youth and would vow never to let a Georgia child face the conditions he did. 
   "Tom Murphy is gone, but he has left a living legacy that will endure in our institutions, our economy and our children."
