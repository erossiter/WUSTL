SEN. ISAKSON, GEORGIA DELEGATION TO HOST MILITARY ACADEMY DAY ON MAY 10
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today announced a statewide Military Academy Day event in coordination with the Georgia delegation on Saturday, May 10, 2008. The event will be held at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Atlanta from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. The event will help familiarize students with the application and nomination process for applying to the nation's five service academies. 
   Representatives from all five academies as well as cadets and midshipmen will also be in attendance to explain more about their requirements and expectations and will be available to answer questions. The event is open to students grades eight through 12. Along with Isakson, U.S. Representatives Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., and Tom Price, R-Ga., will also participate in the event.
   Due to Dobbins' security restrictions, all attendees must make reservations and must present photo identification, vehicle registration and proof of auto insurance at the Cobb Parkway checkpoint for admittance.
   "I am honored to once again be able to offer this excellent opportunity to Georgia's youth," said Isakson. "Many of my former academy nominees have used this Academy Day to decide which service is the right choice for them."
   All persons who are interested in attending must make a reservation by contacting Nancy Brooks, Isakson's Academy Director, at (770) 661-0999 or register online at http://www.isakson.senate.gov. All persons who wish to attend must provide their phone number, address and social security number by the registration deadline on Friday, May 2, 2008, at 5 p.m.
