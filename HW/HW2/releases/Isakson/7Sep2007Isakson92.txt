SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE $749,000 IN DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR GEORGIA COUNTIES
  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) , Ranking Republican Member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be sending $749,000 in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds to 16 counties in Georgia. Fifteen counties will receive $729,000 in funds to help farmers and ranchers cope with the severity of this year's drought. Henry County will receive $20,000 due to damage caused by high winds.  
   "This is good news for the agriculture community in North Georgia ," said Chambliss. "Our farmers and ranchers battle severe weather conditions year after year and this emergency assistance will help ensure they can recover from drought and other natural disasters."
   "As the leading industry in Georgia's vibrant economy, agriculture is critical to our state. Our producers in Georgia are facing tough times due to recent conditions, and this emergency assistance will aid those who need help," said Isakson.
   Georgia counties receiving this drought assistance funding totaling $729,000 include: Banks, Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Cobb, Douglas, Fulton, Gordon, Haralson, Jackson, Madison, Murray, Paulding, Pickens and Whitfield.
   The ECP program gives producers additional resources to remove debris from farmland, restore fences and conservation structures, provide water for livestock in drought situations and grade and shape farmland damaged by a natural disaster. Eligible producers will receive cost-share assistance of up to 75 percent of the cost of the approved practice, as determined by Farm Service Agency (FSA) county committees.
   Chambliss and Isakson encourage producers to check with their local FSA offices regarding ECP sign-up periods. More information on ECP and other disaster assistance programs is available at local FSA offices and online at: http://www.fsa.usda.gov.
