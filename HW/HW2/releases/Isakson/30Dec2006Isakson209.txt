SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON EXECUTION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today issued the following statement on the execution last night of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein: 
   "Justice has been served on a brutal dictator. The execution of Saddam Hussein came after a free and fair trial, which was more than the Iraqi people ever received under Hussein's oppressive regime. After decades of torturous tyranny, the free Iraqi people today have taken another significant step toward a future of self-governance, security and hope."
