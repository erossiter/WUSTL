SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, DECLARES REAUTHORIZATION ONE OF HIS TOP LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the No Child Left Behind Act, the landmark legislation that is providing schools with the necessary resources to give all children a quality education, in commemoration of its fifth anniversary and said one of his top legislative priorities for the new Congress will be reauthorization of the legislation. 
   "In the House, I was proud to have served on the drafting team for the No Child Left Behind Act," Isakson said. "With the President's strong commitment, we created a comprehensive reform to strengthen this nation's public schools, and the result is our school systems are improving and our students are receiving more of the educational tools they need to compete in the 21 st century."
   When Isakson served in the U.S. House, he was one of a handful of lawmakers invited by President Bush in 2000 to help write the No Child Left Behind legislation. Isakson is now a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which has jurisdiction over education issues including the No Child Left Behind reauthorization.
   "No Child Left Behind has demonstrated improvements in the children it set out to help the most, the inner city poor and rural poor children of America, " Isakson said. "I believe our continued commitment to improving reading and math skills by those students most at risk will in time reduce drop out rates and improve educational achievement around the country."
   In 1996, Isakson was tapped by then-Gov. Zell Miller to lead the Georgia Board of Education.
