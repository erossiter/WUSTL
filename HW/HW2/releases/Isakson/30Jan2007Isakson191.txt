SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS PRAISE CONFIRMATION OF LISA GODBEY WOOD TO SERVE AS FEDERAL JUDGE FOR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's unanimous confirmation of St. Simons Island attorney Lisa Godbey Wood to serve as the next United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Georgia. 
   President Bush tapped Wood to fill the judicial vacancy created by the Honorable Dudley H. Bowen, Jr., who elected to take senior status effective June 26, 2006. Both Isakson and Chambliss recommended Wood for the post.
   Wood currently serves as United States Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia. She was sworn in as interim U.S. Attorney in July 2004 and then unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in November 2004.
   "Lisa Godbey Wood brings to the bench of the United States of America the integrity, the sense and the judgment that all of us seek in a fine judge in this country," Isakson said on the Senate floor. "I am extremely pleased the Senate has confirmed this outstanding jurist."
   "This confirmation is long overdue and will bring much-needed relief to the judicial system in the Southern District," said Chambliss. "I am confident that she will make an exceptional federal judge and will serve the people of Georgia well."
   Ms. Wood is a summa cum laude graduate of the University of Georgia as well as the University of Georgia School of Law. Following gradation from law school, Ms. Wood served as a law clerk to the Honorable Anthony A. Alaimo of the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia before joining the Brunswick law firm of Gilbert, Harrell, Sumerford & Martin where she was quickly elevated to litigating partner. She also served as a Magistrate Judge of the Glynn County Magistrate Court from 1998 to 2000 before accepting the appointment to U.S. Attorney.
