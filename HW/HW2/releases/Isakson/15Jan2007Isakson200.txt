SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. HOLIDAY
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today issued the following statement on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday observance: 
   "While we have set aside one day to honor the service and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we should remember every day the equality and justice that he fought for on behalf of all mankind. This year, we also remember the passing of his great partner who was a tireless worker in the civil rights movement, Coretta Scott King. I hope this day will serve as a reminder of our country's continuing commitment to pursuing justice and equality around the world." 
   Isakson today planned to attend the annual commemorative service honoring King at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
