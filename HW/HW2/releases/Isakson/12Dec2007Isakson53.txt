SEN. ISAKSON CRITICIZES EFFORT TO LOWER FARM PAYMENT LIMITS
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today warned that many farmers in Georgia and across the South would go bankrupt under an amendment to the farm bill that would lower federal crop payments.  
   "Why are we trying to hurt farmers who only wish to provide a decent living for their families?" Isakson said. "The costs of farm operations in Georgia are tremendous, and it would be absolutely destructive to enact this arbitrary cap."
   In a speech on the Senate floor, Isakson joined with Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and other Southeastern senators in harshly criticizing the amendment, which would lower the annual limit on federal crop payments to individual farmers from $360,000 to $250,000. Isakson urged his colleagues to vote against it. 
   "This amendment will destroy agriculture in the South and, in particular, in Georgia," Isakson said. "I strenuously object to this amendment on behalf of the farmers of Georgia."
   Isakson said the payment limits would bankrupt many farms in Georgia and across the South, because Southern farmers tend to have larger, more costly farming operations than farmers in other parts of the country. Larger farm operations such as those in the South can reach one or more of the payment limits much faster than smaller farms.
   "Why should we take the greatest, most abundant food supply in the world and try to mess it up? Why should we hurt farmers who are trying to make a decent living for their families in the face of tremendous challenges?" Isakson said. "This amendment punishes the farmers and their families who depend solely on a farm for their livelihood. They do not deserve this kind of treatment."
