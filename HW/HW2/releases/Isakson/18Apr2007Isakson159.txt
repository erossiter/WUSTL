SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON APPLAUD AUTHORIZATION OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR RESPONSE TO RAGING SOUTHEAST GEORGIA FIRES
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised authorization of federal funding to respond to the fires in Southeast Georgia that have affected some 20,000 acres of federal, state, and private land. Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue made the request Tuesday, and funding has been made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The authorization includes a 75 percent federal cost share to be applied to all fire management assistance grants. 
   "Our firefighters, forestry officials, and rangers did a terrific job responding quickly to the fires threatening this treasured area of our state and notifying our citizens of this disaster," said Senator Chambliss. "I know the people of Georgia also appreciate Governor Perdue's swift action in submitting a request for the assistance, which will be critical in helping folks recover from this situation."
   "I am very pleased that the citizens of southeast Georgia will be able to take advantage of this federal assistance as they recover from these widespread fires," said Senator Isakson. "I applaud the heroic efforts of the emergency personnel and the firefighters who battled this unwieldy and fast-spreading fire and protected our citizens, and I join with Senator Chambliss in crediting Governor Perdue's quick action in seeking federal aid for the region."
