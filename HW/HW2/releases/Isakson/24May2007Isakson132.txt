SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE NEW VA CLINICS FOR STOCKBRIDGE, CAMDEN COUNTY
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs plans to open two new community-based outpatient clinics in Georgia. The clinics will be located in the city of Stockbridge and Camden County, and will enhance access to VA health care for veterans in the state.  
   "This is outstanding news that Georgia will receive two new VA clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of VA care they deserve," Isakson said. "As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, one of my top priorities is to make sure America takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country. " 
   "Our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services," said Chambliss, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "The announcement of these two clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor." 
   The VA said it expects both facilities to become operational later this year or in 2008. Local VA officials will keep communities and their veterans informed of milestones in the creation of the new community-based outpatient clinics. 
   These two new facilities will be in addition to the nine VA community-based outpatient clinics that already operate in Georgia. A 10 th c ommunity-based outpatient clinic is expected to open in Rome later this year.
