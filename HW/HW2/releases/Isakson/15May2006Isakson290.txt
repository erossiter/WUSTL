SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S IMMIGRATION ADDRESS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) tonight issued the following statement after President Bush's address to the nation on border security:
   "I'm grateful that the President is focusing on border security, but it is clear that any placement of National Guard troops on the border will be merely temporary. We must have a more permanent solution for securing our borders, and that is why I will seek a vote this week on my amendment to require that strong border security measures be funded and fully operational before we begin any guest worker program."
