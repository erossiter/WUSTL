SEN. ON PRAISES FUNDS FOR P-3 AIRCRAFT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that he has successfully secured $70 million for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to extend the life of the P-3 aircraft well into the 21 st century. The funding is included in the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which was approved by the Senate today.  
   A portion of the work for this program, including the manufacturing of new wings to replace the existing wings on the airplane, will be done at Lockheed Martin in Marietta, Ga.
   "The P-3 is an important component to our national law enforcement and homeland security efforts and have played a critical role in FEMA disaster support," Isakson said. "This versatile aircraft continues to meet the needs of our country to address a variety of missions."
   The P-3 aircraft is specifically modified for use in drug interdiction. The P-3 Airborne Early Warning and the P-3 Long-Range Tracker aircrafts have a highly successful record of detecting and tracking drug smugglers throughout the US, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean basin and Central and South America.
   The P-3 also provides FEMA with post-disaster assessment and monitoring. The aircraft was very active in hurricane relief efforts for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The aircraft provided coordination of search and rescue missions, real-time communications links and real-time video to the Homeland Security Operations Center, the Customs and Border Protection Operations Center and U.S. Northern Command. 
   The fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Report reconciles the Senate version of the bill with the House version. It now goes to President Bush for his signature.
