SEN. ISAKSON NAMES SOUTHEAST GEORGIA REGIONAL DIRECTOR
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) is pleased to announce that Jared Downs will serve as his Regional Director in Southeast Georgia.  
   As Regional Director, Downs will be responsible for overseeing day-to-day activities in the Southeast Georgia region and acting as a representative for Isakson when he is unable to personally attend events in Southeast Georgia. 
   "Jared will help ensure that the views and local efforts of Southeast Georgians are reflected in the operation of our office," said Isakson. "Jared has represented two previous Georgia senators in Southeast Georgia, and I am very pleased he will continue in this role for our Senate office." 
   Downs has served in the same capacity for U.S. Senators Paul Coverdell and Zell Miller since 2000. He also was Miller's representative on the Host Committee of the G8 Summit, which was held at Sea Island last year. Downs is a member of the Savannah Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Committee and an ex-officio member of the Governor's Military Affairs Coordinating Council and Kings Bay Military Community Council. Downs has an Associate's degree from Young Harris College and a B.S. from Georgia College & State University.
