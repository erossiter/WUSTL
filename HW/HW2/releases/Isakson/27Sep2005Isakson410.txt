  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the City of Chickamauga will receive a $50,000 grant for the development of a tourism marketing strategy to promote the region's culture and heritage. 
   The grant, distributed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, will position the City of Chickamauga as the gateway to the Chickamauga National Military Park. In addition to the marketing strategy, the "Heritage Trail" will include a website, construction and installation of 36 marker signs along an interpretive trail and is projected to generate 100 new jobs for the area. The project will be a partnership between local and state government, local chambers of commerce, local economic development authorities and the National Park Service.
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for the City of Chickamauga," said Isakson. "This grant will greatly enhance opportunities for tourism in Walker County."
   "These funds will continue to create new jobs in the City of Chickamauga," said Chambliss. "It is important that we support the Appalachian Regional Commission as the area continues to thrive." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
