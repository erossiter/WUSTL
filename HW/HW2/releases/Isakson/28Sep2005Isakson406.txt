SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR HALL COUNTY CHAMBER YOUTH PROGRAM
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce will receive a $3,000 grant to conduct Youth Leadership Hall for at least 50 high school juniors and seniors. 
   The grant, distributed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, is designed to strengthen leadership skills through experience-based education, mentorship opportunities, and community service. The year-long program will build leadership skills and strengthen civic entrepreneurship of students through daylong seminars and community work assignments. This program will encourage students to remain in or return to the Gainesville or Hall County area after high school or after the completion of their post-secondary education.
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for the Hall County Chamber of Commerce and the youth of Hall County," said Isakson. "It is important that students have leaders and mentors to learn from in their communities and to underscore the importance of community service."
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend the Hall County Chamber of Commerce for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
