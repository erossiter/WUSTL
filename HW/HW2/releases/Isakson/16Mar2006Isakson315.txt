SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES SENATE'S DECISION TO OPEN ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE TO OIL, GAS DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's passage of an amendment that would allow oil and gas development in a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).  
   "With gas prices continuing to remain high, the exploration of ANWR is critical to America's national security and economic well being ,"Isakson said. "We must seek to end our reliance on foreign energy sources by responsibly exploring potential energy sources here at home. ANWR holds the most potential for domestic oil and gas production. "
   ANWR potentially contains up to 10.4 billion barrels of crude oil and will eventually be capable of producing 1 million barrels of oil per day. Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, production of 1 million barrels a day was offline in the Gulf of Mexico due to damages from the hurricanes.
   Opening a portion of ANWR will also create between 700,000 and 1 million American jobs. It would raise an estimated $2.4 billion in leasing fees for the federal government, and development in ANWR and related activities is estimated to add $350 billion to the U.S. economy in direct spending.
