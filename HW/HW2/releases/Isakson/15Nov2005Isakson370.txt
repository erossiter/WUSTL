SEN. ISAKSON URGES SENIORS TO EXPLORE CHOICES IN MEDICARE'S NEW PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that beginning today, November 15, all senior citizens and those eligible to receive disability benefits have the opportunity to sign up for Medicare's new Prescription Drug Plan, or a Medicare Advantage Plan, which likely will help lower healthcare costs by helping to prevent serious illness or disease.  
   "Previously, Medicare would pay for major surgery, but would not help pay for the medicine that would have prevented the surgery in the first place. Medicare is joining the 21 st century of medicine and now allows doctors and patients to practice more affordable preventative measures." Isakson said. 
   "I encourage Georgia's Medicare beneficiaries to learn about the new prescription drug coverage and to choose a plan that fits their needs. Giving seniors a choice encourages healthy competition and provides the best services for each person."
   In addition to providing a prescription drug benefit, the new law also provides for a one-time initial wellness exam within six months of enrolling in Medicare. Screenings include early detection of breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
   Last month, Medicare recipients were mailed a handbook called "Medicare and You" that includes detailed information about choosing the proper prescription plan. New coverage will begin on January 1, 2006 for Medicare beneficiaries who sign up for the plan by December 31, 2005. The deadline to enroll to receive coverage for 2006 is May 15, 2006.
   Additional information can be found on the Internet at www.medicare.gov or by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).
