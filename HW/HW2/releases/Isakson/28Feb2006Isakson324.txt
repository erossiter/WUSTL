SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE $5 MILLION GRANT FOR NEW PAULDING COUNTY AIRPORT
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Paulding County will receive a $5 million grant through the Department of Transportation for land grading and drainage installation for a new airport. 
   The Paulding County Airport is the first general aviation airport to be built in Georgia in over 15 years.
   "This grant is extremely important to building Paulding's airport," Isakson said. "This new facility will benefit the entire community and will greatly assist this growing county."
   "I am pleased to see Paulding County receive these important funds to build an airport to better serve the area," said Chambliss. "This new airport will not only help boost economic development and job creation for the entire region, but doing so will meet the critical air travel needs for both passengers and commerce."
   The Paulding County Airport Authority anticipates breaking ground in the first quarter of 2006. The new facility will be part of the Paulding County Airport and Business Technology Park.
