SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON ANNOUNCE $44 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR HARTSFIELD-JACKSON ATLANTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isaskon, R-Ga., today announced that Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport will receive a $44,468,300 grant from the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration.  
 Hartsfield-Jackson will receive $24.1 million in noise-reduction grants, $28.8 million to continue construction of a new runway that will reduce delays and increase capacity at the airport, and $14 million to extend a current runway so as to alleviate existing congestion. 
   The $24.1 million noise-reduction grant to Hartsfield-Jackson will enable the airport to purchase more than 400 homes and soundproof approximately 100 others, providing noise relief for nearly 1,300 people. The airport also will receive the $28.8 million third installment of a total $179 million federal investment for the construction of Runway 10/28, Hartsfield-Jackson's fifth runway. The new 9,000-foot runway is scheduled to be completed next year. 
   "Hartsfield-Jackson is the busiest airport in the south and one of the busiest in our nation," said Senator Chambliss. "This funding will go a long way towards improving passenger safety and securing the long-term viability of Hartsfield-Jackson." 
   "This is great news for Georgia. Hartsfield-Jackson airport is critical to our state's infrastructure and to our economy, and these grants will go a long way toward expanding and improving this airport so that it can serve more passengers and boost the state's economy." Isakson said.
