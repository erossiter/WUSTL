SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR ODUM VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), today announced that the Odum Volunteer Fire Department will receive a $131,466 grant as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) "Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program" (AFGP).  
   "This funding will go a long way to help ensure that Georgia's first responders have the resources necessary to protect families and communities across the state," said Isakson. "This grant fills an important need for volunteer firefighters in Odum."
   "Local firefighters and emergency workers provide our first defense to natural disasters, accidents and terrorist attacks," Chambliss said. "It is because these brave men and women are often the first on the scene of any incident that we must continue to ensure they have the tools and training they need to do their jobs safely and efficiently. I look forward to continuing to work with local fire departments and emergency responders across the state to ensure they have the resources they need." 
   Each year, this grant program awards one-year grants directly to firefighters. President Bush authorized $650 million for the 2005 program. The Odum Volunteer Fire Department funds are awarded through the Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program and include pumpers, brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, quints, aerials, foam units, and fireboats.
   The AFGP was created to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs. To qualify for funding, applicants must demonstrate financial need and articulate the benefits they will get if awarded the grant.
