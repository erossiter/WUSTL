SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CLARKE COUNTY SCHOOLS ARTS EDUCATORS
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today announced that the Clarke County School District will receive a $105,240 grant from the Department of Education for a program to train arts educators.  
   Over the course of three years, the Professional Development for Arts Educators grant will provide 31 fine-arts teachers and 90 classroom and resource teachers (special education, English for Speakers of Other Languages, gifted, Early Intervention Program, and reading) with sustained, intensive, teacher-designed professional learning opportunities based on need and on research regarding the potential impact the fine arts have on student academic achievement. 
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for the Clarke County School District," said Isakson. "This funding will strengthen standards-based arts education and help ensure that all students can meet the challenging State academic standards in the arts."
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend the Clarke County Schools for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need."
