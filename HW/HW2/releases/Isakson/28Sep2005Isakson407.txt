SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CITY OF CLAYTON
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the City of Clayton will receive a $300,000 grant to expand its wastewater treatment plant. 
   The grant, distributed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, will also support the creation of 250 new jobs and $16.4 million in private investment. ARC funds will be used to expand the plant's capacity from 800,000 to 1,000,000 gallons per day. The expansion will provide sufficient capacity for immediate growth demands of economic development projects currently under way and allow for future growth demands. It will also allow several businesses to move to Clayton because the city will now be able to meet their water treatment needs.
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for Clayton," said Isakson. "This grant will encourage expanded growth and opportunities for the area."
   "These funds will continue to create new jobs in the City of Clayton," said Chambliss. "It is important that we support the Appalachian Regional Commission as the area continues to thrive."
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
