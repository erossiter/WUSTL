SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today released the following statement regarding the federal response to Hurricane Katrina: 
   "While I believe everyone is working hard to meet the unusual demands of this tragedy, I am concerned with some of the response, particularly delays. However, I'm not going to join in the blame game at this time, though there is plenty to go around. Right now, we have to react to and focus on this humanitarian crisis. Thursday night, the Senate approved $10.5 billion for FEMA for the next 20 days. I will continue to work with local and federal officials to help those in need."
