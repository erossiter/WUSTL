SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR VALDOSTA STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that Valdosta State University will receive $198,210 from the U.S. Department of Education for the Leadership Program, designed to train educators to serve children with low-incidence disabilities such as severe mental retardation or orthopedic impairments.  
   Students will be recruited from a rural, culturally diverse region in South Georgia. Participants will either be graduate students or currently employed general educators with no credentials or training in special education. 
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for Valdosta State University," said Isakson. "This funding will help students with disabilities receive a better education from professionals trained to handle special needs students." 
   "The biggest investment that we can make as a nation is in our youth," said Chambliss. "I commend Valdosta State University for recognizing this fact and for working hard to see that these Georgia children receive the valuable support they need."
