SEN. ISAKSON VOTES TO CAP FEDERAL SPENDING
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today voted for an amendment to put the brakes on federal spending by capping discretionary spending at fiscal year 2007 levels.  
   The amendment would have required a two-thirds vote by the Senate before there could be an increase in discretionary federal spending above fiscal year 2007 levels. Defense spending and trust-fund spending would have been exempted. The amendment failed by a 35 to 62 vote.
   "Balancing the federal budget is an obligation that those of us in Washington owe to future generations of Americans, and this amendment would have been a huge step in the right direction" said Isakson. "Congress must become better stewards of the taxpayers' money."
