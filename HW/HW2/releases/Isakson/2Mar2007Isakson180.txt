SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON SUPPORT GOVERNOR'S REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION FOLLOWING SEVERE STORM DAMAGE
  U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., this evening expressed their strong support for Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue's request for an expedited major disaster declaration from President Bush for the counties affected by this week's devastating storms. A federal disaster declaration will make the state eligible for federal funding to assist with response and recovery efforts. The senators have been in communication with local and state emergency officials following the storms. On Saturday, Chambliss and Isakson will join President Bush during his visit to Georgia. 
   "We support Governor Perdue's request and stand ready to assist our fellow Georgians in need," said Chambliss. "It is extremely important that the President approve this request and I am pleased he will travel to Georgia to see the devastation first-hand. I applaud each and every one of our citizens and emergency personnel who responded quickly to help those in need. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Georgia and our neighbors in Alabama who have lost loved ones as a result of this natural devastation."
   "My prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives in this tragedy, and I fully support the Governor's request for federal disaster assistance for communities in Georgia affected by these devastating tornados," Isakson said. "I hope the President will approve this request quickly so all of our Georgia communities can begin the recovery process."
   On Friday, Governor Perdue issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in nine Georgia counties including Baker, Clay, McDuffie, Stewart, Sumter, Taylor, Muscogee, Mitchell and Crawford.
