SEN. ISAKSON VOTES AGAINST RESOLUTION CONDEMNING PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO SEND ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO IRAQ
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's refusal to end debate on a resolution opposing the President's strategy of sending additional troops to Iraq. The procedural vote failed 56 to 34. Senate rules required 60 votes to proceed. 
   Isakson voted against ending debate because the Senate Democratic leadership has refused to allow a debate or a vote on an alternative resolution that pledges not to restrict funding for U.S. troops in combat.
   Isakson said his "no" vote "was not a desire to cut off debate. It was in fact a desire to elevate the debate. I think every side that's represented in this United States Senate floor ought to be a side that's spoken."
   President Bush recently proposed sending more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq as part of a strategy to help the Iraqi government assume more control and more accountability for securing the country. Isakson supports the President's strategy as the best hope of giving the Iraqi government an opportunity to secure the country and achieve political reconciliation.
   "Our enemies and the enemies of the Iraqi people watch our actions and listen to our words. Our Commander in Chief has committed our Armed Forces to a plan, and the Iraqi government has committed to be a full partner," Isakson said. "At such a critical time, when our country is committed to a major battle in the overall Global War on Terror, the words of Congress should not send a mixed message to our troops, the Iraqi people or our enemies."
