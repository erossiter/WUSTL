SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) tonight issued the following statement in response to President Bush's nomination of John G. Roberts Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "President Bush has given us an outstanding nominee. John Roberts is a distinguished and experienced jurist. 
   "I look forward to considering the President's nominee deliberatively, fairly and expeditiously. I will not apply any kind of litmus test for Judge Roberts, and I expect this body to treat him with respect and dignity during the confirmation process. 
   "Every judge nominated by this president - or any president - deserves an up or down vote, one way or another. It is the responsibility of the Senate. It is the direction of the Constitution. 
   "I am hopeful my Senate colleagues will share my goal of confirming Judge Roberts before the new Supreme Court term begins in October."
