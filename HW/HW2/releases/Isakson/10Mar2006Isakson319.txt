SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES SUPREME COURT DECISION ALLOWING MILITARY TO RECRUIT AT COLLEGES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised this week's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court confirming the military has a right to recruit on college campuses and at law schools nationwide.
   "The Supreme Court has made the absolute right decision," Isakson said. "It's only fair to allow our nation's military the opportunity others are readily given. Our military deserves it. Our students deserve it."
   During the creation of the No Child Left Behind Act, Isakson successfully fought to include language to provide the military with information to contact students.
