SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES VALDOSTA ON RECEIVING NATIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AWARD
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the City of Valdosta for receiving the Audrey Nelson Community Development Award, which recognizes outstanding achievements and exemplary uses of the Community Development Block Grant funds. 
   The Audrey Nelson Community Development Award, which is presented by the National Community Development Association, recognized the City of Valdosta for its outstanding administration of the 2006 Southern Hospitality Workcamp. 
   Through its 2006 Southern Hospitality Workcamp, the city gathered over 350 youths from across the country to repair 46 homes for low-income and disabled individuals and families. This annual program has also earned the City of Valdosta the State of Georgia's Magnolia Award for excellence in affordable housing. The city has won this award in three of the past six years. 
   "The outstanding work by these students is a great example of Valdosta's determination to eliminate substandard housing," Isakson said. "I would like to thank the City of Valdosta for its efforts as well as encourage the city to keep working on this outstanding goal in the future." 
   Isakson recognized the City of Valdosta's achievements earlier this week on the Senate floor and presented a copy of his remarks to members of the city's delegation during an awards ceremony in Washington. 
   "The City of Valdosta is one of 11 cities from across the Nation to receive this award," Isakson said. "I am very proud of its accomplishments and I would like to commend all of the people involved in this effort."
