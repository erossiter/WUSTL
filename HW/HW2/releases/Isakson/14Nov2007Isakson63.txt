SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PASSAGE OF HEAD START ACT
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of legislation to reauthorize a successful early childhood development program known as Head Start that gives low-income preschoolers the tools they need to enter school ready to succeed.  
   "We have an obligation to ourselves and to our future to see to it that every American child arrives at kindergarten or first grade ready to learn. The enhancement of programs like Head Start is precisely what will make that happen," Isakson said. "Our children need every opportunity for a good, strong education and Head Start gets many children started on the right path to that goal." 
   Head Start combines education activities with comprehensive social services, such as health and nutrition, and emphasizes parental involvement. Since its inception in 1965, Head Start has served more than 24 million children. It currently serves over 909,000 children and their families through a network of about 1,600 public and private agencies. 
   The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 sets clear standards and measures for Head Start programs, improves coordination with other early childhood education programs and strengthens program accountability. 
   Isakson was selected by Senate leadership to participate in the conference committee that crafted a compromise on the bill. The House and Senate had previously passed their own versions of the legislation. Isakson also serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over education issues. Isakson also served as chairman of the Georgia Board of Education in 1996. 
   The House of Representatives adopted the conference report earlier today. The bill now goes to President Bush for his signature.
