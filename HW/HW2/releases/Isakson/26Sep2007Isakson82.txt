SENATE APPROVES SEN. ISAKSON RESOLUTION TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER
  The U.S. Senate unanimously approved a resolution on Tuesday introduced by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., supporting efforts to increase awareness, treatment and research of childhood cancer.  
   "It is extremely important that we increase awareness and treatment of the devastating effects of childhood cancer," Isakson said. "I am grateful for the support I received from my Senate colleagues in unanimously approving this resolution, because it is vital we support initiatives that seek solutions to this deadly disease."
   Childhood cancer claims the lives of over 2,000 children annually. One in every 330 youths develops cancer before the age of 20, and 12,400 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Cancer in children is much different from the cancer experienced by adults, and children's bodies are more fragile and require different types of treatment and research. 
   Isakson's resolution promotes awareness about the occurrence, the signs and the symptoms of cancer in children as well as options for long-term treatment. It also urges Congress to support investment, policies, education programs and grassroots efforts to promote awareness about childhood cancer. 
   The resolution and its emphasis on grassroots outreach are supported by a number of childhood cancer awareness organizations, including the Rally Foundation in Roswell, Ga.
