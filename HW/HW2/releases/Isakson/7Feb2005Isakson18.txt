SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON COMMENT ON FLETC FUNDS INCLUDED IN PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today commented on funds for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center included in President Bush's fiscal year 2006 federal budget.  
   Specifically, the President's budget includes $183,362,000 for FLETC in 2006. This is an increase compared to $177,440,000 that was included in the President's fiscal year 2005 budget. The funds are included as part of the Department of Homeland Security funding request. 
   "The backbone of our nation's domestic defense against terrorist attacks will continue to be the men and women in local law enforcement and emergency services," said Chambliss. "FLETC pays a critical role to ensure our federal law enforcement are well trained. By increasing funds for FLETC in his budget, President Bush is recognizing the important role FLETC continues to play in our efforts to fight and win the war on terror."
   "FLETC has done an outstanding job to ensure our officers are trained and ready to meet potential terrorist threats," Isakson said. "I am very glad President Bush recognizes the critical role FLETC plays in the war on terrorism."
   While the President's budget does not actually appropriate funds, it does kick off the year long federal appropriations process where Congress fills in the details.
