SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PASSAGE OF PERKINS CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION ACT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's unanimous passage of legislation to reauthorize a successful federal program that helps train America's workforce more effectively for U.S. jobs that demand skilled workers. 
   "Thanks to this reauthorization, the American workforce will be more competitive, better educated and more qualified for the high-wage and high-skilled jobs of our future economy," Isakson said. 
   The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act will create more accountability between federal educators and local training programs, strengthen partnerships between high schools, colleges and businesses and promote an enhanced emphasis on academic instruction for federally supported career and technical education programs consistent with other federal education programs.
   The legislation, passed unanimously by the Senate Wednesday, reauthorizes and revises the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1998.
   Isakson was selected by Senate leadership to participate in the conference committee that crafted a compromise on the bill. The House and Senate had previously passed their own versions of the legislation. Isakson also serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over education issues.
   The House of Representatives plans to vote on the conference report Friday. If approved, the bill would then go to President Bush for his signature.
