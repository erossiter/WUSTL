SEN. ISAKSON ECHOES PRESIDENT'S CALL TO MAKE TAX CUTS PERMANENT
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today urged Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, echoing statements made over the weekend by President Bush during his weekly radio address. 
   "I feel very strongly that we should continue our nation's unprecedented economic prosperity by making the tax cuts permanent.We absolutely cannot afford to abandon the very strategy that has created jobs, allowed businesses to expand and left more money in the pockets of our families," Isakson said.
   "President Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 lowered tax rates for individuals, businesses, dividends and capital gains, eliminated the marriage penalty and scaled back the alternative minimum tax and the death tax.
   "Critics said he was giving a handout to the rich, soaking the poor and leading the nation deeper into recession and deeper into deficit spending. They offered up the same shortsighted, anti-growth solutions - more taxes and class warfare. But the facts are on President Bush's side."
   Isakson was a co-sponsor of the legislation enacting the tax cuts, which Congress passed in 2001 and 2003. He has continued to be a strong supporter of making the tax cuts permanent.
