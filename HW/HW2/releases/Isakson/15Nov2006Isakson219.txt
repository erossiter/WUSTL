SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. AIRWAYS BID FOR DELTA AIR LINES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today issued the following statement in response to a proposed bid by U.S. Airways to merge with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines:  
   "As the largest employer in Georgia, Delta Air Lines is vital to Georgia's economy and to the thousands of Georgians it employs. Delta has put in place an aggressive plan to emerge in 2007 as a strong, stand-alone carrier and I am very confident it will succeed. As U.S. senator, I have worked very hard to help Delta and its employees through hard times and I will work even harder to keep Delta as an outstanding corporate partner headquartered in Atlanta for many, many years to come."
