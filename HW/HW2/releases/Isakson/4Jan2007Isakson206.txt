SEN. ISAKSON NAMES TRICIA CHASTAIN AS NEW STATE DIRECTOR
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today announced that he has named Tricia Chastain as his new state director. 
   "Tricia has worked for me for nearly seven years and has become an integral part of my team," Isakson said. "She is a talented, loyal and dedicated professional and I am delighted that she will now take on this new responsibility. I know she will continue to help me do the best job possible for the people of Georgia."
   As state director, Chastain will manage the day-to-day operation of Isakson's Georgia office as well as represent Isakson at events across the state. Isakson has a staff of about 20 in Georgia, including several constituent caseworkers in Atlanta and several field representatives stationed around the state.
   Chastain has served as deputy state director in Isakson's Atlanta office since he took office in the U.S. Senate in 2005. She began working for Isakson in 2000 as a legislative correspondent in his Washington office when he was a member of the House of Representatives. She worked for Isakson as a legislative assistant from 2001 to 2002 and as a senior legislative assistant from 2002 to 2003. Later in 2003, she returned to Georgia to serve as Isakson's district director and press secretary until his successful election to the Senate.
   Chastain is a native of Roswell, Ga., and earned her A.B.J. in public relations from the University of Georgia. She is currently pursuing her M.B.A. from Georgia State University. Chastain is married to Terry Chastain, who is vice president of government affairs at the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
   Chastain replaces Chris Cummiskey, who is leaving to become the chief of staff for Georgia Speaker of the House Glenn Richardson.
