GEORGIA 'S MILITARY COMMUNITIES BENEFIT FROM SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE 2008 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the provisions included in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. Included in the authorization, is funding for our servicemembers and their families, critical military construction projects at Georgia bases and Georgia-made weapons systems. The Senate Armed Services Committee crafted the bill this week. It now goes to the full Senate for consideration. 
   "In this time of increased demand on our troops, we need to stand behind our soldiers and offer them our full support for the sacrifices they make," Chambliss said. "The provisions in this bill address the critical needs of our troops and include key resources for Georgia's military communities. It's imperative that we ensure that the men and women wearing the uniform of the United States are fully-equipped and well-prepared."  
   "Georgia is a big winner in this Defense Authorization bill, thanks in large part to the work of Senator Chambliss on the Committee," Isakson said. "This legislation sets the priorities for our nation's military needs and I am proud of the strong commitment it shows to Georgia." 
   The bill authorizes $648.8 billion in funding, including $130 billion in war-related Global War on Terrorism funding. It provides a 3.5 percent raise for all military personnel across the board, includes $4 billion for mine resistant vehicles to protect our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan from Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), and many provisions to improve compensation and quality of life for the men and women in uniform.
