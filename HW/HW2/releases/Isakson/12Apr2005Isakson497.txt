SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS DEMAND EXPLANATION OF PROPOSAL TO CUT SCREENING JOBS AT HARTSFIELD-JACKSON AIRPORT IN ATLANTA
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) today called on the Transportation Security Administration to explain why it is considering cutting as many as 300 screeners from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta.  
   Isakson said: "These cuts would basically shut down the busiest airport in the U.S., and that would have a horrible domino effect on the rest of our airports around the country. Senator Chambliss and I are demanding some answers and I am hopeful we will convince TSA to rethink these cuts." 
   Chambliss said: ""Hartsfield-Jackson is one of the busiest airports in the South, and is a vital airport for the South and the nation. The hard working TSA agents at Hartsfield-Jackson screen enormous numbers of passengers every day, and the number of passengers using Hartsfield-Jackson will only increase. Reducing the number of TSA agents at Hartsfield-Jackson will have a devastating effect on air travel, and Senator Isakson and I will make a strong case to TSA about this important issue."
