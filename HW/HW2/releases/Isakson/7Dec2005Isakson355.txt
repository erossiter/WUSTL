SEN. ISAKSON DENOUNCES HOWARD DEAN'S COMMENTS ON IRAQ
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today released the following statement criticizing remarks by Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean that the U.S. will not win the war in Iraq: 
   "By stating that 'the idea we're going to win the war in Iraq is an idea which is just plain wrong,' Howard Dean's reckless and irresponsible comments weaken America and surrender to those who would destroy us. We are in the ultimate war between good and evil and victory is our only option. Today, brave Iraqi soldiers fight side by side with American soldiers and soldiers from around the world against the very enemy that brought down the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. Those soldiers know and the world knows we must be united in support of victory against the agents of terror."
