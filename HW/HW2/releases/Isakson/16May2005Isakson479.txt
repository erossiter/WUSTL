SEN. ISAKSON JOINS SENATE 4-H CAUCUS TO FOCUS SUPPORT ON YOUTH LEADERSHIP
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today announced that he has joined a Senate organization that promotes the 4-H program, a youth organization promoting leadership among rural, urban and suburban youth from every state in the nation. 
   "The 4-H program gives our youth the skills they need to succeed through fun and engaging programs," Isakson said. "I am pleased to join a Senate organization that recognizes the value of 4-H in developing leaders in our communities."
   Originally formed as a boys and girls club to improve agricultural knowledge, 4-H is now the largest non-academic youth organization in the country. It teaches leadership, citizenship and life skills to more than 7 million school-age participants.
   In collaboration with the Cooperative Extension Service, state land grant universities, state and county governments and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 4-H reflects the needs and interests of communities across the nation.
   The Senate 4-H Caucus will serve as an advocate for 4-H and will directly support the 4-H Youth in Governance Initiative. This initiative helps provide greater understanding of the democratic process. Senate support for this effort is an important opportunity to encourage and mentor tomorrow's leaders.
