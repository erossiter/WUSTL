SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES DELTA AIR LINES FOR PURSUING U.S. ROUTE TO AFRICA
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised Delta Air Lines for seeking to become the only U.S. airline to operate scheduled service between the United States and Africa. 
   "Delta Air Lines has been an integral part of helping Atlanta become a global destination," Isakson said. "I am very pleased that Delta will become the only U.S. carrier to serve the continent."
   In a filing with the U.S. Department of Transportation today, Delta is requesting government approvals to begin the first ever Delta-operated service between Atlanta and the South African city of Johannesburg, with an intermediate stop in Dakar, Senegal, effective in December 2006. If Delta's request is approved, they will become the only U.S. airline to operate scheduled service between the United States and Africa.
