SEN. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CITY OF COMER
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today announced that the City of Comer will receive a $200,000 grant to improve the storm drainage system in its downtown business district.  
   The grant, distributed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, will also support the creation of 14 new jobs and the renovation of 14 downtown buildings. The drainage system that serves the city's historic district is inadequate and often floods during storms. The ARC funds will be used to improve storm drainage facilities, street layout, pedestrian access and parking areas. 
   "I am pleased to announce this grant for Comer," said Isakson. "This grant will greatly improve the downtown area as well as economic development opportunities for the city." 
   "This important funding will go a long way to strengthen the rapidly growing downtown," said Chambliss. "I am proud to support the City of Comer as the area continues to thrive." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
