SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES FINAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL FOR FISCAL 2007
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the final passage of the FY 2007 Defense Authorization bill Conference Report as an important victory for America's military. The $462.8 billion bill authorizes significant funds for key Georgia defense-related projects, military installations and military men and women.  
   "Georgia is a big winner in this Defense Authorization bill, thanks in large part to Senator Chambliss' work on the Committee," Isakson said . "This legislation sets the priorities for our nation's military needs and I am proud of the strong commitment it shows to Georgia." 
   The conference report authorizes $84.2 billion in procurement funding, $73.6 billion in funding for research, development, test and evaluation, $155.3 billion for operation and maintenance and other programs and $110.1 billion for military personnel. 
   The conferees also authorized $70 billion in emergency supplemental funding for fiscal year 2007 for activities in support of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism. The emergency supplemental funding includes $23.8 billion to help reset Army and Marine Corps equipment. 
   The bill supports service members and families by improving health care and increasing military pay and benefits and expands eligibility for TRICARE to all members of the Selected Reserve and their families without regard to active duty service. The bill prohibits increases in TRICARE fees until a study of TRICARE costs is completed. The bill also provides a 2.2 percent pay raise for all military personnel plus targeted pay raises for senior enlisted personnel and warrant officers.
