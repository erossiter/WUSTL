SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES SENATE PANEL FOR ADDRESSING HEALTH INSURANCE WOES OF SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate Committee on Help, Education Labor and Pensions for approving legislation that would help small businesses provide affordable health insurance to employees. 
   "The ability to provide affordable health insurance is one of the most critical issues facing small businesses in Georgia and across this country today," said Isakson, who voted for the legislation as a member of the HELP Committee. "The Committee's action is a good step forward and I urge the full Senate to act soon. We must help level the playing field for small businesses so that they can provide health insurance to their workers who desperately need it." 
   More than 45 million Americans lack health insurance, and 62 percent of those uninsured are either employed by a small business or dependent on someone who is.
   The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act passed by the HELP Committee will allow business and trade associations to bring their members together and offer group health coverage on a national or regional basis.
