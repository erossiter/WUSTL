SENS. CHAMBLISS, ISAKSON CO-SPONSOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG LEGISLATION FOR VETERANS
  Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., co-sponsored legislation that would allow more veterans to have access to the well-managed prescription drug program run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   The VA operates one of the most comprehensive prescription drug programs in the nation. Currently, the VA provides enrolled patients with prescription medications for $7 for each 30-day supply. However, only VA patients who obtain a full range of medical care from the VA are eligible to get such prescriptions.
   The Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act, sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter, R-Pa., would allow all Medicare-eligible veterans - even those who are not enrolled for care with the VA - to gain access to the VA's well-managed drug program. The veterans who participate in this program would be required to pay a co-payment for their prescriptions. The VA fills and distributes more than 100 million prescriptions each year for its 5 million veteran-patients. As a result of its purchasing power and smart use of its formulary program, the VA has been able to negotiate very favorable prices for prescription drugs. 
   "I am pleased to support this legislation which will allow the VA to cost-effectively provide prescription drugs to some veterans who would be otherwise ineligible to receive care," said Chambliss. "America's veterans have made great sacrifices for our freedom and it is only right that we do all we can for them."
   "Our nation's veterans have sacrificed tremendously so that this nation can live in freedom," said Isakson, a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. "This legislation helps to ensure that the treatment and services we give our veterans are equal to the sacrifice they have made for our country. All Medicare-eligible veterans should have access to the well-managed VA prescription drug program."
