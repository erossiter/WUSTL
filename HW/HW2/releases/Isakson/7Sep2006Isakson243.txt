SENS. ISAKSON, CHAMBLISS: DEFENSE FUNDING BILL BENEFITS GEORGIA
  Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) today praised the Senate's passage of the fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill, saying that the bill strengthens national security, addresses important quality-of-life issues for troops and includes funds for weapons systems made in Georgia.  
   "Georgia's military bases and defense systems manufacturers are critical to our national security and have played a key role in the War on Terror, and I am very pleased to see such a strong commitment to them from Washington," Isakson said. "One of our most important duties in Congress is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect our homeland and continue the fight for freedom around the world."
    "Georgia troops play a key role in the global war on terrorism and, as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am committed to ensuring that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions," said Chambliss. "Additionally, there are countless civilian employees in Georgia working to construct the world's most cutting edge weapons systems currently in use by the joint forces. We will continue doing all we can to make sure these aircraft maintain their viability and production lines in Georgia."
