SEN. ISAKSON : U.S. MUST REMAIN COMMITTED TO WAR ON TERROR
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today spoke on the Senate floor in support of U.S. efforts in the War on Terror and stressed how critical it is for America to keep its resolve in this global fight.  
   "September 11, 2001, was the most tragic event in the history of mankind. What the United States did and what this president declared by changing our policy from one of reaction to one of preemption was precisely the right thing to do," Isakson said. "There is no doubt in the last five years mistakes have been made, but there is no doubt the greatest mistake would have been not to respond." 
   Isakson said America has a rich history of remaining committed in times of war and that it is more important than ever to remain committed in the War on Terror because we are up against a new kind of enemy.
   "One of the great ideals of the American people has been we don't quit. We didn't quit in our revolution. We didn't quit in our civil war. We didn't quit in World War I or in World War II. And we can't quit now," Isakson said. "It is time for us to resolve ourselves to support this country, our men and women in harm's way, our intelligence agencies with the resolve to see it through to its conclusion, understanding that it's going to be a long and difficult battle."
