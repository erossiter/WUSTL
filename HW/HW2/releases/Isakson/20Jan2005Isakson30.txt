SEN. ISAKSON HAILS BUSH INAUGURATION AS CELEBRATION OF FREEDOM AROUND GLOBE
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) today praised President Bush as he was sworn in to a second term, calling the inauguration a celebration of the President's efforts to spread freedom around the globe. 
   Isakson, who attended the 55 th inauguration outside the Capitol along with his wife, Dianne, hailed Bush's success at bringing freedom to Afghanistan and Iraq.
   "Today is a celebration of our democracy," Isakson said. "What this President has done for freedom around the world - 50 million people are free today who were not free four years ago - is a dramatic accomplishment."
   Isakson, who was sworn in to the U.S. Senate on Jan. 4 after serving three terms in the U.S. House, pledged to work with Bush on domestic and national security issues.
   "I look forward to working with him on Social Security reform, on tort reform, on continuing the war on terror and continuing to spread freedom wherever we can across this great globe of ours," Isakson said. "It's just an exciting time, but most importantly, it's a celebration of what God has given us, which is the greatest system of government and the great free society on this planet."
