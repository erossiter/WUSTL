SEN. ISAKSON ANNOUNCES U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY APPOINTEES FOR 2007
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today proudly announced that 39 Georgia students whom he had nominated to the United States military academies have now received appointments to the prestigious schools. 
   "Only the best and brightest students from across the country are selected for the honor of attending one of our outstanding military academies," Isakson said. "I am delighted to have been able to nominate these promising young leaders who will make Georgia and America proud."
   The annual nomination of young people to our nation's military academies is the responsibility of each Member of Congress. Those nominees who are accepted into the academies are awarded full four-year scholarships, which are valued at $300,000 each and include tuition, books, board, medical and dental care. Since his election to Congress in 1999, some 165 Isakson nominees have been accepted into U.S. military academies.
   Isakson plans to host a reception for the students and their families on May 6, 2007, in Atlanta.
