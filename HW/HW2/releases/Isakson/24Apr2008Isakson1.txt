SEN. ISAKSON PRAISES PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO ENHANCE BENEFITS FOR VETERANS
  U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of legislation to increase a variety of veterans' benefits. Isakson is a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   "The most important responsibility we have as a Congress is to see to it that the treatment and services we give our veterans are the very best our country can offer," Isakson said. "Our nation's veterans and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our children and grandchildren can live in freedom. I am pleased the Senate has passed this legislation to ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they deserve." 
   The Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 is a comprehensive bill providing benefits to veterans, their families and their survivors. Provisions of the bill include expanding eligibility for traumatic injury insurance, increasing benefits for veterans pursuing apprenticeships or on-job training programs and expanding eligibility for specially adapted housing assistance. The bill also provides an automatic annual increase in burial benefits (based on inflation) for the families of veterans.
