SEN. ISAKSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11TH TERROR ATTACKS
  Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today released the following statement on the fifth anniversary of the September 11 th terror attacks: 
   "There is no question that September 11, 2001, changed our nation. It was the first time in our history that an army without uniforms, capitals or diplomats attacked innocent men, women and children and killed wantonly. On 9/11, the terrorists attacked the heart and soul of America. They attacked our families, our children and our parents. We must always remember the innocent victims who lost their lives on that terrible day. 
   "We must also take the time to thank our first responders who put their lives on the line to save so many others on September 11 th. Our police, firefighters and emergency medical professionals risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe, and they are America's first line of defense. They are true American heroes. 
   "There is no doubt that 9/11 was a wake-up call. I'm so proud of our president, our country and especially our men and women in the armed forces. It is important now more than ever that we continue our efforts against terrorism to protect our homeland and fight for freedom around the world."
