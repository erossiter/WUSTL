SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON CONFIRMATION OF CABINET SECRETARIES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the confirmation of President George W. Bush's nominees for Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns and Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings.  
 Johanns' nomination was confirmed this afternoon by the Senate. Spellings' nomination was expected to be confirmed later today.
   "I congratulate the new Secretary of Education and Secretary of Agriculture on their confirmation. 
   "I met with Secretary Johanns yesterday and reminded him of the importance of keeping the border closed to Canadian cattle while Mad Cow disease is a problem. While we can expect that Secretary Johanns will be a voice for the Administration's policies, including opposing mandatory COOL, I am hopeful that he will carry out implementation of the law as written in the 2002 Farm bill by Congress. 
   "I look forward to working with Secretary Spellings to address the challenges we face with respect to education. The GAO study I requested indicates that rural states face unique challenges in implementing No Child Left Behind. States facing unique challenges should receive unique flexibility. I will continue working to make the Department of Education and the Administration aware of that."
