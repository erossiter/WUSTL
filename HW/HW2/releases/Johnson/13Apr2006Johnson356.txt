CUSTER COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Custer County as his April 2006 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted on a special section of his website. 
   "Custer County has much to offer those that live there and those that visit," Johnson said. "From helping secure funds to build the Heartland Expressway to promoting economic development, and preserving the natural beauty of the Black Hills, I am always proud to work on projects of importance to the people of Custer County."
   Custer County was founded in 1875 and was named after General Custer, who traveled there in search of gold. The county is one of South Dakota's most visited, with both a portion of the Black Hills and the Crazy Horse Memorial within its boundaries.
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson.
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are great places to live. Custer County has a rich history and immense natural beauty that make it a wonderful place to visit or live."
