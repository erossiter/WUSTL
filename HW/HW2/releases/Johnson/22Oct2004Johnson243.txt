TRADE BILL INCLUDES SEN. DASCHLE-BACKED PROVISION TO GIVE RANCHERS MORE TAX RELIEF
  Sen. Tim Johnson and Sen. Tom Daschle announced that the FSC/ETI bill was signed into law today by the President, enacting the Daschle provision to provide additional tax relief to ranchers who are forced to sell cattle due to drought conditions.  
   A Murdo-area South Dakota rancher with whom Daschle met last spring first presented the idea to expand the current law to allow ranchers more flexibility in dealing with the effect of the drought. Daschle and Johnson worked to include it in the Senate-passed FSC bill. Senator Craig Thomas (R-WY) joined in offering the amendment, and it was included in the bill that passed the Senate in May.
   Current law allows those forced to sell cattle during a weather-related disaster two years in which to either re-purchase a like amount of cattle or pay taxes on the income received from the sale. Under the Daschle amendment, that time period would be extended to four years, and would permit producers to reinvest an amount equivalent to the sale of cattle into their farm operation through the purchase of cattle, machinery, or equipment.
   "This provision will provide more help for South Dakota ranchers coping with the devastating effects of drought. It is due to Senator Daschle, working behind the scenes, that West River ranchers will benefit from this provision in the corporate tax bill," said Johnson. 
   "This measure is another way for us to help out ranchers affected by the devastating multi-year drought in South Dakota," Senator Daschle said. "Now, ranchers will have more time reinvest, and will have the flexibility to choose what kind of purchase best suits their needs. Ranchers have told me that they need more breathing room when coping with drought, and this bill provides it."
