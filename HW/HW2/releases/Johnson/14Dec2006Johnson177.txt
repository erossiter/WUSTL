ADMIRAL EISOLD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONDITION OF SEN. JOHNSON
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson has released the following: 
   Admiral John Eisold, Attending Physician of the United States Capitol said, "Subsequent to his admission to George Washington University Hospital yesterday, Sen. Tim Johnson was found to have had an intracerebral bleed caused by a congenital arteriovenous malformation. He underwent successful surgery to evacuate the blood and stabilize the malformation. The Senator is recovering without complication in the critical care unit at George Washington University Hospital. It is premature to determine whether further surgery will be required or to assess any long term prognosis."
   Barbara Johnson, wife of Senator Johnson, said, "The Johnson family is encouraged and optimistic. They are grateful for the prayers and good wishes of friends, supporters and South Dakotans.
   "They are especially grateful for the work of the doctors and all medical personnel and GWU hospital."
