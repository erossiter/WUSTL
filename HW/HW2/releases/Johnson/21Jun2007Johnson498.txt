FULL APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PASSES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced the Senate Appropriations Committee passed the Interior Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2008, which contains $27.202 billion for forest, wildlife, and public lands programs that benefit South Dakota annually. This spending level is an increase of $1.5 billion over the President's request. Johnson, a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that passed this bill on Tuesday, secured $4.4 million in projects for South Dakota. The bill will now move to the full Senate for consideration. 
  "The Interior Appropriations Bill includes critical funding to enhance the stewardship and use of public lands within our state and provisions that will directly affect how delivery of health care to social services across the state through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services," said Johnson. "I appreciate that Committee Chairman Byrd is moving the bill so quickly through the committee, so that we can continue the appropriations process and swiftly get funding to the programs that will help South Dakota."
