SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Oglala Sioux Tribe will receive a $1 million earmark for law enforcement, judicial, and victim service activities. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson secured this funding in the Department of Justice Appropriations bill for this year.  
   "This funding will provide significant resources for the Oglala Sioux Tribe to enhance the safety and well-being of people on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation," Johnson said. "It is essential that tribes have the tools they need to combat and prevent crime, as well as to provide services for victims."
   This earmark for the Oglala Sioux Tribe will be used to fund the detention/detox facility, the tribal court system, the department of public safety and the Oglala Nation Tiospaye Resource and Advocacy Center (ONTRAC). "Reservation communities have unique law enforcement needs, but face chronic under-funding," Johnson said. "The violent crime rate in Indian country is 50% higher than the national average. Yet, Indian country has far fewer police officers per capita then the national average."
