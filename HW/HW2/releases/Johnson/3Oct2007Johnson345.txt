SEN. JOHNSON THANKS SPEARFISH STUDENT FOR SERVICE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today met with Paul Gainey of Spearfish, South Dakota to thank him for his service in the Congressional Page Program. In June, Johnson wrote to Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and recommended Gainey for a position in the program's fall 2007 session, which began in September.  
  "The Congressional Page Program is a strenuous, yet accomplished program with the highest expectations for our nation's high school students," Johnson said. "Paul Gainey has exceeded those expectations, and I am proud and thankful for his service this session." 
  The United States Congressional Page Program consists of thirty page positions in the Senate that allow high school juniors to work with the chamber's members in a variety of ways, including delivering correspondence and preparing the Senate chamber for session. 
  Students from around the country are nominated and appointed by Senators to take part in one of four sessions throughout the year. The positions are highly competitive and students continue taking classes in Washington, DC throughout the program. 
  High school juniors from South Dakota are encouraged to apply for a position in the Congressional Page Program. To apply, interested students should a cover letter, high school transcript, resume, three letters of recommendation and a letter stating why you want to be a page to:
