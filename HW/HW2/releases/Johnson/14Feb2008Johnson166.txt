SEN. JOHNSON HAILS BASIN ELECTRIC'S DECISION TO BUILD IN SELBY, SOUTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) said South Dakota was a leading force in the power industry as Basin Electric Power Cooperative today announced that Selby has been selected as the preferred site for their newest power plant.  
  Last week, in Washington, D.C, Senator Johnson met with Ron Harper, CEO of Basin Electric Power Cooperative, regarding the selection of a preferred site for a new electric generating unit. Today, the Basin Electric Power Cooperative Board of Directors made the announcement official. 
  "Today's decision by Basin Electric Power Cooperative to select Selby, South Dakota as the preferred site for the construction of its NextGen project is terrificnews for Walworth County and the state of South Dakota. Demand for electricity is continuing to grow and in order to meet that growth, it is necessary to look to all sources of energy," Johnson said, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
  "Expanding South Dakota's electricity generation capacity means building more high-voltage electricity transmission lines to move electricity throughout the region, which will eliminate a key hurdle in constructing hundreds of megawatts of wind energy generation. The project has many steps yet to go, including a state permit process, but this is certainly good news for South Dakota," Johnson continued. 
  Earlier this month, VeraSun and US BioEnergy agreed to locate the newly-combined company headquarters in South Dakota. This made South Dakota home to two of the largest ethanol companies in the United States. Basic Electric's announcement today is a homerun for South Dakota's continued economic development. Johnson was proud to be working with these companies to highlight South Dakota's leadership in the energy industry.
