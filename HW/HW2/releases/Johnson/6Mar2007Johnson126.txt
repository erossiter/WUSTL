SEN. JOHNSON STAFFER TO HOLD CONSTITUENT OUTREACH DAY IN JERAULD COUNTY ON MARCH 15
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D SD) office announced today that Erik Nelson of his Sioux Falls office will hold a Constituent Outreach Day in Jerauld County on Thursday, March 15.  
   Nelson will hold traveling office hours from 9:30am-10:30am CT at Springs Inn Cafe in Wessington Springs, SD. 
   In the past, Johnson has described outreach days as a way to "help me remain in touch with the concerns of South Dakotans. Many South Dakotans are unable to travel to my offices in Rapid City, Aberdeen or Sioux Falls. South Dakotans are my number one priority, and I want to make sure that everyone regardless of where they live has an opportunity to meet personally with my staff." 
   Johnson has always encouraged South Dakotans to call, write or visit his Service Offices in Rapid City, Aberdeen, Sioux Falls or Washington D.C. to share their concerns. South Dakotans may also call Johnson's office toll free by dialing 1 800 537 0025 or e mail at http://johnson.senate.gov/emailform.html.
