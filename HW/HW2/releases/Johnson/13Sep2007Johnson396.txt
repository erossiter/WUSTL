SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF FARM BILL SURVEY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced the results of the Farm Bill survey that was distributed earlier this year to farmers, ranchers and stakeholders across the state and made available on the Senator's website in preparation for the upcoming rewrite of the 2002 Farm Bill. Johnson will now share the results with Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA).  
   "I was pleased by the feedback from hundreds of people across the state, making it clear that South Dakotans want to see changes made to the 2002 Farm Bill," said Johnson. "As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to fight for the needs of South Dakota's agricultural community as the legislation is reviewed." 
  A Sampling of Survey Replies:
  * South Dakotans would like packer ban and Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) legislation included in the upcoming farm bill. More than 75 percent of respondents would like to see legislation in the Farm Bill to more quickly enact COOL provisions. 
  * South Dakotans would like payment limitations between $100,000 and $250,000. Senator Johnson supports capping payment limitations at $250,000.
  * Direct payments should be targeted to land operators. South Dakotans overwhelmingly agree that direct payments should go to the primary operators of land rather than landowners not involved in day to day farming operations. 
  * The upcoming Farm Bill should include agricultural disaster provisions. More than 90 percent of South Dakotans said such legislation is very or somewhat important. 
  * FSA closures would pose significant problems to South Dakota farmers and ranchers. Proposed changes would lead to long driving distances and prevent access to information. 
  * Ethanol and other renewable fuels should be included in the next Farm Bill. South Dakotans would like incentives for cellulosic ethanol production and renewable fuel education taught in public schools. 
  Earlier this year, Johnson outlined his priorities for this year's farm bill in a letter to Sen. Harkin. Initiatives include a strong, effective Competition Title that addresses market concentration; implementation of COOL for beef, lamb, pork, fruits, vegetables, and peanuts; fighting arbitrary closure of South Dakota Farm Service Agency (FSA) county offices; bolstering the USDA's Rural Development programs and finding energy alternatives through biofuels.
  Senator Johnson continues to accept farm bill surveys from across South Dakota. The document, as well as his letter to Sen. Harkin, can be downloaded from the Senator's website at http://johnson.senate.gov.
