SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $176,000 FOR SOUTH DAKOTA TRIBES
  Sen. Tim Johnson today announced grants from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) for four tribes across South Dakota totaling $176,000 to continue supporting long-term economic development planning in the region. Securing economic development funding is a key part of Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan. 
  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Yankton Sioux Tribe, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe will each receive $44,000. 
  "An investment in the future of Indian Country is one that will pay dividends for all of South Dakota," Johnson said. "This economic development funding will help tribes across the state strengthen their economy and make progress on many other issues, including generating additional resources for education, reducing crime rates, and making it easier for people to provide for their families."
  Johnson has continually supported the EDA and economic development in South Dakota as a member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees. 
  The Economic Development Administration, which is a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was established in the 1960s to generate jobs, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas of the United States. EDA assistance is available to rural and urban areas of the nation experiencing high unemployment, low income, or other severe economic distress.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
