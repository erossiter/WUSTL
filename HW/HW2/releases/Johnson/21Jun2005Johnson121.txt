SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING IN AGRICULTURE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels in the Agriculture spending bill for 2006. The legislation passed the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee today, of which Johnson is a member. The bill is now ready for consideration by the full Appropriations Committee. Johnson was in South Dakota for a base closure field hearing during this subcommittee action, but had worked with colleagues prior to leaving to secure this funding and keep any delay of country-of-origin labeling out of the bill.  
   As part of this bill, the funding level for 2006 South Dakota projects is over $7.75 million, which is $5.9 million or 76.3 percent more than President Bush's Budget request of only $1.84 million for South Dakota. 
   "This bill contains increased funding for agricultural programs important to South Dakota," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Farmers and ranchers will benefit from these programs, which provide rural and community development funding and valuable agricultural research at SDSU in addition to numerous other functions. Agriculture is the largest industry in our state and as such requires a certain level of investments to promote further economic growth." 
   Also in good news, the Senate did not follow the House of Representatives in its attempt to stall implementation of Johnson's Country-of-Origin-Labeling (COOL) provision by an additional year, because Johnson has continued to work tirelessly with his Senate colleagues on making sure that meat can simply be labeled with its country of origin. While the Senate bill does include $3.1 million for the Agricultural Marketing Service to implement COOL, the amount is not enough to implement this national program. 
   "COOL is the law of the land and the Administration needs to begin the process of moving it from paper to reality. The American people deserve to know where their meat comes from," Johnson said.
