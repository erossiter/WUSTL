SEN. JOHNSON ADDRESSES NATIVE AMERICAN MEDIA SYMPOSIUM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, addressed journalists, activists and educators at the Native American Media Symposium today in an event to explore a wide range of tribal issues and bring together Native American journalists.  
   "I'm glad to see such a broad support for this symposium," said Johnson. "It's important that we maintain an open dialogue with the Native American media and community so that the flow of information continues, allowing government and media to better serve Indian Country." 
   Johnson discussed in his speech today his advocacy for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, of which he is a cosponsor, and his work to fight the unacceptable disparity between Native American life expectancy against other segments of the population. 
   First enacted in 1976, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act established the first comprehensive framework for the delivery of health care services for Indian people and authorized funding for health programs, projects, and facilities. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act was last reauthorized in 1992.
   Johnson recently worked with Senate colleagues to include language in the Homeland Security Appropriation bill to allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to distribute unused mobile housing units to tribal governments and trial housing entities throughout the U.S. The mobile homes are now being stored in Hope, Arkansas.
