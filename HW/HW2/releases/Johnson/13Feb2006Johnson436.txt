SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCE $1.25 MILLION FOR ABERDEEN AREA TRIBAL CHAIRMAN'S HEALTH BOARD IN RAPID CITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health Board, whose office is in Rapid City, will receive $1.25 million in funding for healthy start programs. The Healthy Start program serves reservations in the regional area, which includes all of South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, and North Dakota.  
   "Programs like Healthy Start are an investment in healthy children and strong families," said Johnson. "The Healthy Start program brings important resources and medical services to families on reservations to help to eliminate disparities in health care for pregnant mothers and newborns. Receiving quality health care at birth can make a difference for a lifetime."
   The purpose of the Healthy Start program is to educate new mothers on prenatal care and early infant care. Northern Plains Healthy Start is committed to the mission of promoting healthy families and improving birth outcomes for Native American women. The Targeted Case Management (TCM) services are a culturally relevant program, which empowers individuals to make better health care choices.
   Northern Plains Healthy Start and the Targeted Case Management program use a holistic approach, respecting the importance of family, extended family, physical, emotional, psycho-social and spiritual health and the continued support for Indian family values.
   The Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairmen's Health Board is a nonprofit organization that was established to provide formal representation of Native Americans on health issues to communicate and participate with the Indian Health Service (IHS) and other health organizations. 
   This grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
