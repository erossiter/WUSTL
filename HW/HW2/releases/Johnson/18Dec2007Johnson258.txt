SEN. JOHNSON: FUNDING WILL EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES IN NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Northeast South Dakota Community Action Program will receive a grant of $234,643 through the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development.  
  "This funding for Northeast South Dakota Community Action Program will provide funding for economic development opportunities and help our local communities," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help people of South Dakota."
  The Northeast South Dakota Community Action Program is a non-profit agency serving 17 counties in South Dakota, including Brown, Campbell, Hand, Hughes, Roberts, and Walworth. The funds will provide technical assistance to three recipients, and allow them to expand services by building their capacity in housing, community facilities, and community and economic development programs.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
