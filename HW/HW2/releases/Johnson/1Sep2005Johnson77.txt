SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR HURRICANE RELIEF
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement as Congress reconvenes to approve emergency assistance for relief efforts from Hurricane Katrina:  
   "The White House has asked Congress to reconvene today and pass a $10 billion emergency supplemental package for FEMA. 
   "We must move this funding immediately. This measure is likely to be the first stage of relief that will be provided by Congress. As efforts continue and the damage is fully assessed, Congress will do all it can to get the people on the Gulf Region back up on their feet as soon as possible. 
   "The evolving situation in New Orleans and the Gulf Region in general is overwhelming. This is a national disaster, and we must all stand together to save lives and eventually rebuild this area. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected and all of the relief workers on the ground. May God bless them all." 
   Congressional procedure states that the House of Representatives must pass the funding measure first. It will then move to the Senate for passage. The measure is expected to pass unanimously by voice vote. The House is expected to reconvene this afternoon and the Senate will follow shortly as the bill is prepared for action.
