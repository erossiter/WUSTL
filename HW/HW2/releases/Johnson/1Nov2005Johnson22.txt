SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE'S CLOSED SESSION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in reaction to the Senate's decision to go into a closed session in order to discuss intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq: 
   "More than 2000 American soldiers have died in Iraq, including 10 from South Dakota. Debate in the Senate is not unprecedented, nor are closed Senate sessions uncommon. This move allows us to discuss classified information and the case for war free from politics and free from theatrics. The importance could not be greater than life or death. Our national security is at stake. The American people deserve answers."
   Below are some examples of recent closed Senate sessions:
   Since 1929, the Senate has held 53 secret sessions, generally for reasons of national security.
   * For example, in 1997 the Senate held a secret session to consider the Chemical Weapons Convention (treaty).
   * In 1992, the Senate met in secret session to consider "most favored nation" trade status for China.
   * In 1988, a session was held to consider the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and in 1983 a session was held on Nicaragua.
   * In 1942, a secret session was held on navy plans to build battleships and aircraft carriers, and in 1943 a secret session was held on reports from the war fronts.
