SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SCHOLARSHIP, DISABILITY FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that University of South Dakota in Vermillion has received two grants totaling $528,672 through the Department of Health and Human Services. 
  The university will receive a $38,672 federal grant to fund scholarships for disadvantaged students and a $490,000 federal grant to the USD Center for Disabilities to fulfill its work as South Dakota's University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Educations, Research and Services.
  "Any person eager to learn should be able to access quality post-secondary education, no matter their economic background," Johnson said. "Making college more affordable will help to ensure that all students at University of South Dakotahave the chance to succeed academically and get their college diploma. In addition, I am so pleased that the Center for Disabilities received these funds to continue their valuable work in education, community services, research and outreach efforts."
  A member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Johnson has supported increasing the federal support for higher education. Earlier this year, the committee approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education bill that funded this scholarship program at a level of $46 million, more than $30 million above the president's budget request. The bill must now be considered by the full Senate.
