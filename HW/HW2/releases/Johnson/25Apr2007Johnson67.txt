SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES $3.39 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR BON HOMME-YANKTON WATER DISTRICT
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Bon Homme-Yankton Water District in Yankton will receive a low-interest federal loan of $3,390,000 for expansion and renovations. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   The funding will be used to construct an elevated storage tank and install additional water transmission lines. This will result in additional pumping, storage, and transmission capacity, which will increase the area's service capacity. 
   "Proper water infrastructure is crucial for our communities," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding for the Bon Homme-Yankton Water District is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
