SEN. JOHNSON: SENATE EXPECTED TO PASS CHILDREN HEALTH INSURANCE BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced his strong support for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007, which is expected to pass the Senate overwhelmingly this evening. This bipartisan, compromise bill has nationwide support and is expected to provide health care to more than 10 million low-income children. 
  South Dakota currently has a monthly average of 11,000 children enrolled in the CHIP program. There are still 18,000 uninsured children in South Dakota with 12,000 of those children coming from low income families eligible for the CHIP program. Funds do not currently exist to cover these children, but this new legislation provides the funds needed to cover up to an additional 8,000 South Dakota kids.  
  "This is a successful program, and when something works, you don't throw it out the window. We're not talking about strangers half way across the country. These are South Dakota's children that need basic health coverage to ensure they have the chance to live long, healthy, and productive lives," Johnson said. 
  The bill will be sent to President George W. Bush for his signature, but he has already threatened to veto it. Numerous child advocacy organizations and faith-based groups have called on the President to drop his veto threat. 
  The compromise bill, which has strong support from both chambers of Congress, allocates an additional $35 billion over five years and will move the nation closer to providing health insurance to the nine million uninsured children in this country.
  "During the past nine months, I've received a personal lesson in the great value of health insurance. Misleading information has been batted around about this program, but ten years after it began, studies show CHIP has accomplished its goal," Johnson said. "This is an example of a government program that is child-focused and effective at reducing the number of uninsured children in our country and investing in our future." Currently, South Dakota provides coverage under CHIP to children in families with incomes up to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. 
  "One of my priorities for CHIP reauthorization was ensuring that children already eligible actually receive coverage. I support this bipartisan, compromise bill that will help states like South Dakota identify and enroll these children," said Johnson. 
  Johnson has posted a link to an online petition to urge President Bush to sign this bipartisan compromise bill and help reduce the number of uninsured children in this Country. For a link to the petition, visit Johnson's website at: http://johnson.senate.gov.

   South Dakota Facts
   * Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act
  Funding
   * The bill authorizes an additional $34.7 billion in block grants for Fiscal Years 2008-2012, bringing the program to a total $60 billion over five years. 
   * In Fiscal Year 2008, South Dakota is estimated to receive $15.3 million as part of the Reauthorization bill going to the President, a 46% increase over the $10.5 million the state would receive under an extension of current law. 
   * When this FY08 allotment is added to the state's available unspent funds, South Dakota will be able to invest $18.1 million in the health of our state's children. 
   * South Dakota's allotment in subsequent fiscal years is dependent upon several factors, including growth in national health expenditures, growth in the state's child population, and the state's ability to utilize its annual allotment by enrolling more uninsured children in CHIP. 
   Covering Children
   * This bill ensures that all South Dakota children currently covered under CHIP (approximately 11,000 children per month) continue to receive these critical services. 
   * Though estimates vary, this bill will provide South Dakota sufficient funds to cover up to an additional 8,000 uninsured children under CHIP.
