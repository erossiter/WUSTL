SENATE VOTES OF MARRIAGE PROTECTION ACT
  The U.S. Senate failed to pass the Marriage Protection Act today. Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today voted against the measure saying this was an issue that should be handled by the states and not Congress. 
   "Again, South Dakota already has enacted an anti-gay marriage law and is taking up a possible state constitutional amendment to that effect. But that is where the debate ought to be taking place, in South Dakota and in the other states; not here in DC," Johnson said.
   "Senator Frist knew this amendment wasn't going to pass. Instead, he chose to use the Senate floor for a political charade rather than focus on issues that affect Americans every day. Let's talk about gas prices or health care for the uninsured or the war in Iraq. But with the very limited time remaining in this congressional session, we should not be looking to amend the Constitution, which should rarely be amended. When it is amended, it ought to expand opportunity and freedom and it ought to be consistent with being pro-family in a real and serious way," Johnson concluded.
   Johnson supported the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Johnson's own church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) Lutheran Church, has come out in opposition to the MPA.
