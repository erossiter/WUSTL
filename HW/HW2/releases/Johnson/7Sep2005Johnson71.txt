SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES 'ANGELS IN ADOPTION' FAMILY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced he has chosen Jim and Sue Russo of Sioux Falls to be his "Angels in Adoption" from South Dakota.  
 Johnson is a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption and chose this family from among six nominees in South Dakota. 
   "There are so many adoptive and foster parents who feel that caring for children is its own reward. I am pleased that I can recognize Jim and Sue Russo's dedication to providing a safe, loving, and stable home," said Johnson. 
   Jim and Sue Russo have two grown daughters and began taking in foster children in 1993. After two years acting as foster parents to Brandon and as a mentor family for his mother, it became clear that Brandon would need to be adopted. Jim and Sue decided to continue caring for Brandon not as mentors but as his parents and adopted him in 1998. 
   The "Angels in Adoption" program was established in 1999 by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute to raise awareness about the importance of adoption. Since the program's beginning, 22 South Dakota families have been recognized for their commitment to children. 
   "I have been promoting adoption throughout my service in the Senate. The 'Angels in Adoption' program is a great way to acknowledge people for doing something so selfless, by adopting children and raising them in loving homes" continued Johnson. 
   The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute will honor the "Angels in Adoption" at a reception and dinner on September 13, 2005 in Washington, DC.
