SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES NEW WEBSITE LAUNCH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that his new website has been launched on the Internet.  
   The new website was designed so that South Dakotans may have the most up-to-date information from Johnson's office at their finger tips. Visitors will be able to find everything from ordering a U.S. flag to filing casework to reading the most current legislation.
   "My new website serves as a resource center for visitors and aims to be user friendly," said Johnson. "It is my hope that South Dakotans will keep returning for the latest information."
   Johnson's site provides information on his work in Washington on behalf of the people of South Dakota, helps South Dakotans plan a trip to Washington, D.C., and provides information on all three U.S. branches of the government. 
   Students of all ages may find Johnson's website helpful when doing a school project, or applying to be a Congressional page, or for a college internship position in one of his four offices. Additionally, if students are interested in applying for an academy nomination, finding information on schools, or reading about financial help for higher education institutions, information may be found in the "Student & Intern Opportunities" section of his website.
   The new site also has many unique features such as "County of the Month" where one county in South Dakota will be highlighted for a month at a time. 
   Another friendly attribute is the kids' page. This page allows children to learn about the federal government, public service and at the same time discovering their home state. 
   Senator Johnson invites South Dakotans to visit his new site at: http://johnson.senate.gov
