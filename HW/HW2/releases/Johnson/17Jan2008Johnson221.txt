SEN. JOHNSON TOURS ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) met with Ellsworth Air Force Base officials today for the first time since securing $16.6 million in federal funding for the Ellsworth Air Force Base Civil Engineer Administrative Facility as part of the spending bill that passed the Senate last month.  
  "Ellsworth is key to our nation's security and is an important part of South Dakota," Johnson said. "As Chairman of the subcommittee that allocates funds for our nation's military infrastructure, I am pleased to see Ellsworth's facilities improving and I am committed to keeping that progress on track," Johnson said. 
  Johnson is Chairman of the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, and secured $16.6 million for the Ellsworth Air Force Base Civil Engineer Administrative Facility in the Omnibus spending bill passed in the Senate last month.
  Commander Scott Vander Hamm and Vice Commander Col. Peter Coster toured the base today with Johnson. Among the issues Johnson discussed were the numbers of personnel that have been deployed overseas and a housing privatization initiative. 
  "As I prepare to return to Washington for votes next week, I will continue to work for funding to fund our nation's vital military installations, including Ellsworth," Johnson continued.
  In the past several weeks, Johnson has participated in numerous meetings and briefings, traveling to Sioux Falls, Vermillion, Yankton, Brookings, Watertown, Mitchell, Huron, Lower Brule, Chamberlain, Aberdeen, Sturgis, Spearfish and Rapid City.
