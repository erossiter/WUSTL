SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FREE TAX HELP FOR SOUTH DAKOTANS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced help for South Dakotans during tax season. Two programs from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will provide tax preparation services in numerous towns and cities across South Dakota for all senior citizens, military personnel and their families, and individuals or families with personal incomes of $38,000 or less.  
   "Tax forms can seem like they're written in a language that no one understands," said Johnson. "These programs will help South Dakotans navigate the process."
   Volunteers at tax preparation sites will utilize software to prepare non-business tax returns for 2005 tax forms due on April 15, 2006. 
   The tax preparation will be done in conjunction with two programs, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program. The TCE Program allows senior citizens, defined as those aged 60 and above, to seek free tax preparation assistance. The VITA Program allows for military personnel and their families and any individual or family with an income of $38,000 or less to seek free assistance with preparing their taxes.
   A list of local sites with the dates and hours of operation for both the VITA and TCE Programs are available on Senator Johnson's web site at http://johnson.senate.gov. Some of the sites are by appointment only, and phone numbers are listed for those sites. There may be more sites available throughout South Dakota as April 15 approaches. 
   Items taxpayers need to bring to the VITA/TCE Sites to have their tax returns prepared are:
   * Photo identification 
   * Social Security Cards for the Taxpayer, their spouse and dependents, if applicable Birth Dates for primary, secondary and dependents on the tax return
