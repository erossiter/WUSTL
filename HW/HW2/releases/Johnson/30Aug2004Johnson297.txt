SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $350,000 IN FUNDING FOR SIOUX FALLS REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Sioux Falls Regional Airport has been awarded $350,000 from the Department of Transportation (DOT) under the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP).  
   "This funding will help the Sioux Falls Regional Airport compete for low fare airlines and will increase economic development," said Johnson. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work for our smaller airport communities."
   In a letter to Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Norman Mineta, Johnson wrote urging the DOT to commit funding for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport to begin recruiting American West Airlines to provide service to Phoenix. America West is interested in starting the region's first low-fare air service by using a 50-seat regional jet aircraft. 
   The program was established to help smaller communities address air service deficiencies, particularly issues related to high airfares and insufficient service.
