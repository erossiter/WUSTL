SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $81,836 TO WISE START PROGRAM AT SDSM&T
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T) will receive $81,836 to increase the opportunity for Native American women to pursue excellence in math and science through its WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) Start program.  
   "This program encourages young Native American women to pursue higher education in math and science, targeting students who have been underrepresented in these important fields," Johnson said. "SDSM&T is a highly-regarded science and engineering university, and I applaud their efforts to increase achievement rates." 
   WISE Start is designed to attract and retain low-income, Native American women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. The program will work with two groups of students - the first made up of students entering their first year of college and the second group comprised of students who are entering their final year of high school. The students will participate in a 4-week summer JumpStart program before entering school and will be part of a mentoring program upon matriculation. 
   "By offering students from low-income backgrounds academic and social support as they transition into the college environment and throughout their education, we will go a long way to increasing the retention and success rates among students. Education is central to reducing cycles of poverty, giving students the tools to create their own opportunities," Johnson continued. 
   The majority of this funding will be used for direct support for the students involved, covering the cost of participation in the JumpStart program and costs of room, board, tuition, and fees for the first college year. The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Education's Implementation Program and is anticipated to last for two years.
