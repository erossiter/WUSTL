SENATE CONFIRMS NEW DEFENSE SECRETARY
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Senate approved the nomination of Robert Gates for Defense Secretary. The nominee was questioned by the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday morning, and was promptly approved for a full Senate vote. 
 Johnson released the following statement regarding Gates's confirmation: 
 During Dr. Gates' testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was encouraged by his candid assessment of the situation in Iraq. Dr. Gates acknowledged that we are not winning in Iraq and the status quo is unacceptable. He signaled his willingness to actively solicit the advice of military leaders on the ground and to work with members of both parties to develop a coherent strategy for Iraq. Dr. Gates' testimony was straightforward and refreshing. It is a step in the right direction toward resolving the crisis in Iraq. 
 At the same time the full Senate began debate on Dr. Gates' nomination, the Iraq Study Group released their recommendations for overhauling our policy in Iraq. The commission's report was stark and sobering and described the current situation in Iraq as grave and deteriorating. 
 I wholeheartedly agree with the Iraq Study Group's assessment that our commitment to Iraq should not be open-ended. U.S. support for the Iraqi government is strong, but Iraqi leaders must immediately make the necessary political decisions to create a sustainable political settlement.
 As a member of the Iraq Study Group prior to his nomination, it is my hope Dr. Gates will heed the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group and encourage the Bush Administration to change course in Iraq.
