SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $50,000 IN FUNDING FOR HOUSING PRESERVATION
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Neighborhood Housing Services of the Black Hills, Inc. will receive a federal grant of $50,000 to help low-income homeowners to make repairs and improvements to their homes. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program. 
  "Strong communities begin at the home," Johnson said. "This funding for the Neighborhood Housing Services of the Black Hills will provide South Dakotans with the opportunities to maintain and repair their homes. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help people of South Dakota."
  Neighborhood Housing Services of the Black Hills, Inc will use the funding to provide low cost repairs for eligible homeowners. They will also provide assistance with other housing services such as loan and grant information and construction consulting.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks."
