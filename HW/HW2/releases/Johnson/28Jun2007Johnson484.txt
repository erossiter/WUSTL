FULL COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. JOHNSON REQUEST FOR $85.585 MILLION FOR SOUTH DAKOTA PROJECTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Energy and Water spending bill was passed by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, and includes $85.585 million for water projects and renewable fuel sources in South Dakota. The bill includes $28 million for Lewis and Clark Regional Water System and nearly $31 million for Mni Wiconi Rural Water System, and now will move to the full Senate for consideration. 
  "By substantially increasing the funding level above and beyond the Administration's budget request for the Lewis and Clark project we have paved the way for significant progress in 2008. These water projects are crucial to the continued economic growth of our state and slowly funding projects only increases the costs in the long run. I am thankful to Chairman Dorgan for working with me on this request, pushing the federal government to keep its promise to pay for part of a water project crucial to South Dakota and states in our region," said Johnson.
  "Senator Johnson and I discussed our priorities for the Upper Midwest as we put this bill together," Senator Dorgan said this week. "I'm confident that the legislation we approved today will help us move forward in a significant way on energy and water projects in our states and across America."
