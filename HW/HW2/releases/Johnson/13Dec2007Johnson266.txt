SEN. JOHNSON TO SPEND DAY REFLECTING, WORKING FOR SOUTH DAKOTA
  On the one year anniversary of the brain hemorrhage that caused a ruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM), U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today issued the following statement: 
  "Surrounded by family, friends and the doctors that helped save my life, I will spend today reflecting on the humbling journey I have experienced over the last year. I have always found strength and comfort in the notion that when God closes a door, He opens a window. Through the prayers and encouragement of my family and the people of South Dakota, that notion has never been more clear. As the Senate continues today with votes on many critical issues facing our nation, I will be working for the state I love. That is the best way I could have hoped to mark this anniversary."
