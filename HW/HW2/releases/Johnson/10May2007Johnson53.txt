SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES LOWER BRULE SIOUX TRIBE TO RECEIVE $851,563
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lower Brule Sioux Tribal Housing Authority will receive an Indian Housing Block Grant Award of $851,563 for the preservation and refurbishing of tribal members' homes. This grant will be administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996.  
   "This funding will help the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe expand safe and affordable housing for its members," said Johnson. "Unfortunately, unsafe and inadequate housing is an all too familiar reality on many of the reservations in the state. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
