SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that small non-farm businesses in four South Dakota counties are eligible to apply for low-interest loans to offset losses in revenue from farmers and ranchers that were impacted by ongoing drought, high winds, late spring frosts, extreme heat, prairie fires in Lawrence County, and hail. 
   The South Dakota counties include Butte, Meade, Lawrence, and Pennington. Several counties in Wyoming are also eligible.
   "In a state like ours, the fates of many businesses and of farmers and ranchers are closely intertwined," Johnson said. "When extreme weather hurts our farmers and ranchers, it also affects the small businesses who serve them. I encourage small businesses to learn about the assistance that may be available to help them."
   Small businesses may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $1.5 million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which would have been met had the disaster not occurred. The U.S. Small Business Association (SBA) makes EIDLs available when the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture designates an agricultural disaster.
   For additional information about this small-business assistance, contact the Small Business Administration (SBA) toll-free at (800) 659-2955, or visit www.sba.gov/disaster. Hearing impaired individuals may call (800) 877-8339.
   The deadline to apply for these loans is September 18, 2006.
   Loan eligibility is based on the financial impact of the disaster. Loans have a 4% interest rate and a maximum term of 30 years.
