SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES PUKWANA TO RECEIVE FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL WATER SOURCE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Town of Pukwana in Brule County will receive a $99,800 federal grant and a $292,000 low-interest federal loan to improve the current wastewater system and secure an additional water source to help meet increased demands. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
   "Proper water infrastructure is crucial for our communities to continue to grow and this funding will greatly benefit the people in Brule County and surrounding areas," said Johnson. "One of the pillars of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
