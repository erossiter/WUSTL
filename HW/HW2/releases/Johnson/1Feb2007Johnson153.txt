DOT ISSUES IMPORTANT DECISION ABOUT DAKOTA, MINNESOTA, EASTERN UPGRADE PROJECT
  Gov. Mike Rounds, the office of Sen. Tim Johnson, Sen. John Thune, and Rep. Stephanie Herseth announced on Thursday, Feb. 1, that DOT has issued a favorable Record of Decision regarding environmental issues associated with the Dakota, Minnesota, and Eastern Railroad's upgrade project.  
   The U.S. Department of Transportation decision follows the public comment period that began on August 16, 2006, with respect to its plan to adopt the final environmental impact statement (EIS) issued by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board concerning the DM&E Railroad's Powder River Basin project. 
   "We are pleased to receive word that the Department of Transportation has approved the Environmental Review with only minor changes. What's even more significant is that we should have full information as to the Financial Review in 90 days or less. This is a very encouraging development with regard to the DM&E proposed upgrade project through South Dakota," said Rounds. 
   Senator Johnson has said that, "the DM&E proposed project will instill market competition that will lower shipping rates and ease many of the captive shipper problems that impact businesses in our state and region." 
   "This decision is good news and it takes us one step closer to strengthening South Dakota's economic future. I will continue to work with Governor Rounds, Senator Johnson and his office, Representative Herseth and the Administration as we draw closer to a final decision," said Thune. 
   "I am pleased that the Federal Railroad Administration has issued a favorable record of decision on DM&E's Powder River Basin expansion project," said Representative Stephanie Herseth. "This is another step in the process that we expect to lead to greatly improved rail infrastructure in South Dakota."
