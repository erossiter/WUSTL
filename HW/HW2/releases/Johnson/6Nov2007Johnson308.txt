SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN ONE MILLION IN FUNDING TO BADLANDS HEAD START PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Badlands Head Start program in Vale will receive a federal grant of $1,015,863 through the Department of Health and Human Services. The funding will be used to help coordinate early childhood educational opportunities for area kids. 
  "Head Start is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "This funding for the Badlands Head Start program will ensure that every child has the same opportunities to excel. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering elementary school. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
