SEN. JOHNSON WORKS TO TARGET FARM PAYMENTS TO FAMILY PRODUCERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced his support for bipartisan legislation to limit farm payments to agricultural producers, targeting them to smaller, family producers. 
   "Farm programs should work for the independent producers who continue the tradition of family farming," said Johnson. "We shouldn't be helping agribusiness squeeze out independent producers. Limiting farm payments is an easy way to stop giant ag corporations from gaming the system."
   The legislation, introduced with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) would lower the total farm payments a producer can receive to $250,000. This is a similar initiative to one proposed during the 2002 Farm Bill.
   The Federal Farm Subsidies bill, S.385, does not attempt to reopen the Farm Bill. The bill was written to tighten payment limits that will target payments and prevent fraud and abuse. 
   Although there is currently a payment limit of $360,000, the system contains many loopholes, meaning there is effectively no limit. Between 1995 and 2003, the top 10 percent of recipients collected 71 percent of all government farm payments. 
   In his budget proposal for 2006, President George W. Bush proposed reducing the payment limit cap for individuals to $250,000. 
   "It's amazing to me that it requires the largest budget deficit in history for this Administration to support common-sense payment limitations," Johnson said. "I'm hopeful that the President will stand behind his proposal and that we get the Congressional support we need to make this work." 
   Johnson serves on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee.
