SEN. JOHNSON NAMED CHAIRMAN OF MILCON-VA APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has been named the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Although Sen. Johnson underwent surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage on December 13th, he retains his seniority in the Senate and will lose none of his rights during his absence. Johnson's office remains open for business while he recuperates.  
   "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Tim has helped direct millions of dollars to Ellsworth Air Force Base and South Dakota National Guard facilities. This new Chairmanship speaks to his commitment to helping our nation's veterans and building a strong national defense," said Julianne Fisher, Communications Director for Senator Tim Johnson. "Senator Johnson will retain his seniority and the staff remains active working on behalf of South Dakota while he continues his recovery process."
   "Tim has always made fiscal discipline a cornerstone of his work in Congress. This new chairmanship had been discussed as a possibility prior to his surgery in December. He was excited at the possibility of working with Chairman Byrd on restoring order to the process and funding South Dakota's priorities," Fisher continued.
   Senator Johnson's staff remains busy in his absence. His staff members continue to visit with constituents in his Washington, DC office and across South Dakota. Staff will continue to address casework issues from South Dakotans, and his legislative staff remains active. Senator Johnson would need to be in the Capitol building to vote on Senate business. As such, while he recuperates, he will be considered necessarily absent.
