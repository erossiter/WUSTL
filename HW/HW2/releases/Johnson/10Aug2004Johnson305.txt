SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO SIOUX FALLS HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $182,988 in funding to the Sioux Falls Independent School District for Head Start programs.  
 The grant comes as part of the teacher and technical training portion of Head Start. 
   "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel. Head Start paves the way for a strong educational foundation. Head Start is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "The program allows kids, who normally would not be able to afford pre-school, the opportunity to get an excellent preparatory experience before entering school."
   Head Start is a proven, effective early development program that improves the physical, mental, and educational well-being of children to prepare them to enter kindergarten. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents.
   The grant is awarded by the Department of Health & Human Services.
