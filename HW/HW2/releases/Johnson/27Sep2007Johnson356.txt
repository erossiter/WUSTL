SEN. JOHNSON'S WIFE RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL FAMILIES LEADERSHIP AWARD
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Congressional Families Action for Cancer Awareness awarded his wife, Barbara Johnson, the Congressional Families Leadership Award for her work to educate people about cancer.  
  "I am so proud of her, not only because she fought so hard and survived this disease, but also because of her work to educate others about the advantages early detection makes in the battle," Senator Johnson said. "Barbara is truly a public servant for all of her work to promote cancer awareness, and I appreciate her outspoken efforts to help people realize the dangers but also seek out help to fight this disease." 
  Mrs. Johnson is a two time breast cancer survivor who has worked for years to promote education and early detection of cancer. Her work has, among other things, raised funds to sponsor a "Mammogram Van" and PSA screenings for prostate cancer for uninsured and underinsured people at the South Dakota State Fair each year. Senator Johnson is also a prostate cancer survivor.
  "The State Fair cancer screening project is especially rewarding because several people have returned the each year to tell us that their cancer was found early and they were able to get treatment," Barbara Johnson said. "I am honored to receive this award today from the Congressional Families Action for Cancer Awareness."
  The Congressional Families Action for Cancer Awareness Program, an arm of the Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation, is described as "a bipartisan network of spouses of Members of the House, the Senate, Cabinet and Supreme Court who share an interest in advancing cancer prevention, early detection and education."
   Over 140 congressional spouses participate in advocacy activities, educational seminars, and awareness campaigns spouses as members of the Congressional Families Advisory Board.
