SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION, HUD CONFERENCE REPORT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced his support of the conference report of the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) spending bill. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee charged with writing the bill, Johnson fought to include vital funding for South Dakota that will improve roads and increase community development.  
  "Strong communities are a result of strong investments like this one, which will improve the roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure in South Dakota and across the country," said Johnson. "It is my hope that the President will work with Congress and sign this bipartisan bill, which will ensure hometowns across the state get the vital funding they need."
  The bill includes more than $237 million for South Dakota, including an additional $2.88 million to address bridge infrastructure. In September, the Senate responded to the bridge collapse in Minneapolis by increasing the limitation on federal funding for bridge reconstruction, leading to additional funding for South Dakota bridges. The legislation also includes $1.7 million in community development projects specifically for South Dakota. 
  "This legislation provides funding for critical Transportation and HUD programs that affect thousands of South Dakotans," continued Johnson. "As a member of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, I am proud to have fought to secure this funding for our state."
