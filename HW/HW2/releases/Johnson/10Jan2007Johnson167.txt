SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE: DAVID MILLER REAPPOINTED TO TICKET TO WORK, WORK INCENTIVES ADVISORY PANEL
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that David Miller of Sioux Falls has been reappointed to the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Advisory Panel. Johnson sent a letter supporting Miller's nomination to Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in August and expressed his confidence in Miller's qualifications to serve on the Panel in that letter. 
   "Appointed by Senator Daschle in 2002 and having already served a four-year term, Mr. Miller would help guide his peers in making sound, achievable, and unifying recommendations to protect those Social Security beneficiaries and recipients who are genuinely limited in their capacity to work," Johnson wrote. "He also has extensive experience working on telecommunication and vocational rehabilitation issues on behalf of individuals with disabilities, and brings a much-needed rural perspective to the Panel."
   Blind since age 11, David Miller understands the barriers that those with disabilities who work face everyday. Currently, Miller is the Chief Compliance Officer for Communication Service for the Deaf. Previously, he worked as the Executive Director of the Prairie Freedom Center for Independent Living as well as the director of Vocational Rehabilitation Services in South Dakota. 
   The Advisory Panel was created by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 to advise the Commissioner of Social Security, Congress, and the President on implementation issues regarding the Ticket to Work Program and other work incentive programs for individuals with disabilities. 
   The panel has twelve volunteer members, four of whom are appointed by the President, four by the Senate, and four by the House.
