SEN. JOHNSON TOURS YMCA, DISCUSSES APPROPRIATIONS SUCCESS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today toured the Rapid City YMCA and discussed the importance of a new project to encourage young people to make healthy lifestyle choices. 
   Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was able to secure $248,000 in federal funding to help develop wellness facilities to serve children aged 11-16. The facility will help develop long-term programs to encourage healthy lifestyle choices for young people and serve as an early intervention to help children avoid the pitfalls of substance abuse, delinquency and other high-risk behavior.
   "Just as we can engage young people at school and at church, we can reach them at the wellness facility here at the Y," said Johnson. "This is a great example of positive steps we can take to reach youth who may be at risk."
   The YMCA has taken important steps to improve the health and wellness of the young people in the region. The YMCA reaches over 4,000 young people in South Dakota through after-school programs, mentoring programs, athletic leagues, civic education programs, and leadership clubs. 
   The Rapid City YMCA has served the community for over 50 years.
