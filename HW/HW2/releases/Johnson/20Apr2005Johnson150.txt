SEN. JOHNSON CO-SPONSORS MUCH NEEDED REFORMS TO NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND EDUCATION PROGRAM
  Today Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) in supporting S. 724, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act. The bill provides much needed flexibility that educators across South Dakota have reported to Johnson was missing from the initial program passed in 2002. 
   "We all want to improve achievement for all students from across the country. As I travel South Dakota, I hear from parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members on the need to make No Child Left Behind (NCLB) work. We are going to continue holding schools to high standards, but we need to make sure we give schools the funding and tools necessary to ensure student achievement. I believe the No Child Left Behind Reform Act is a first step," Johnson said. 
   This legislation has also been cosponsored by Senators Rickard Durbin of Illinois and Ken Salazar of Colorado. The No Child Left Behind Reform Act has been endorsed by the Parent Teacher Association and the National Education Association.
   Late last week, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings announced a new approach to implementing NCLB called "Raising Achievement: A New Path." Secretary Spellings announced her intent to allow more flexibility for states that are showing student improvement and will allow more special education students to take alternate NCLB exams. 
   The President's 2006 budget proposal called for the elimination of 48 programs within the Department of Education. If enacted, this budget request would result in an overall decrease in education funding for the first time in a decade. And yet again, the President's budget would underfund NCLB programs by an estimated $12 billion, bringing the cumulative funding shortfall to $39 billion. 
   "While the Administration's move to make this program more flexible are welcome, I believe we need to make some basic changes to the underlying law to ensure a real difference and increase student achievement," Johnson said. "We have to commit the necessary funding to the program so that cash strapped states and school districts have the necessary resources to meet the target. The Administration's proposed funding levels are simply unacceptable."
   The No Child Left Behind Reform Act, S724, has three main components:
   * It provides states with the flexibility to use multiple measures to calculate student achievement. Under current law, schools are held accountable for student achievement based on how their students perform on annual tests; however, many times a student's standardized test scores alone may not be an accurate measure of student achievement. Additional information, such as an individual student's rate of improvement or graduation rates may be better measures of determining adequate yearly progress towards proficiency. Technically the current law allows additional measurements other than test scores to be considered. However, the law does not allow additional measures to result in taking schools off a "needs improvement" list. These secondary measures can only be used to penalize schools, not help them, in the accountability process. S.724 will allow schools to use added academic measures in a way that gives schools credit for performing well. The bill also provides funds to states and school districts to increase their capacity to track student improvement from year to year.
   * It allows schools to target school choice and supplemental services to the students that actually demonstrate the need for them. Under current law, school choice must be offered to all students in a school, and supplemental services must be provided to all low-income students in a school, regardless of whether these children are the students that have actually failed to meet testing goals. Targeting resources to the students that actually demonstrate the need for them is a more efficient way to maximize limited resources. 
   * It ensures that NCLB's highly qualified teacher provisions are both rigorous and reasonable. As interpreted, provisions in current law requiring teachers to be "highly qualified" to teach are particularly burdensome for some teachers. For example, a 7th grade teacher in a K-8 school could be required to hold degrees, or take exams in, all of the subjects that they teach: English, math, science and social studies. This provision would:
   -Allow middle school teachers to pass a comprehensive state middle school exam to fulfill NCLB teacher requirements rather than take separate exams in each of the subjects that they may teach.
   -Allow for the creation of a comprehensive state social studies certificate at the middle or high school level that will allow teachers to teach history, geography, economics, and civics without having to separately major in each of these subjects.
   -Allow for the creation of a comprehensive state science certificate at the middle or high school level that will allow teachers to teach earth science, biology, chemistry, and physics without having to separately major in each of these subjects.
