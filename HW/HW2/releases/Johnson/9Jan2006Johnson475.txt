SEN. JOHNSON JOINS IN RIBBON CUTTING FOR YMCA WELLNESS CENTER
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today took part in a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new Rapid City YMCA Wellness Center for which he secured $248,000 in federal funds as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "The Rapid City YMCA Wellness Center symbolizes what can happen with funding partnerships between federal, local and private sources," said Johnson. "This is a great example of the positive steps we can take to reach youth who may be at risk." 
   Johnson secured the $248,000 in federal funding to help develop wellness facilities in order to serve children aged 11-16. The facility will help develop long-term programs to encourage healthy lifestyle choices for young people and serve as an early intervention to help children avoid the pitfalls of substance abuse, delinquency, and other high-risk behavior. 
   The YMCA has taken important steps to improve the health and wellness of the young people in the region. The YMCA reaches over 4,000 young people in South Dakota through after-school programs, mentoring programs, athletic leagues, civic education programs, and leadership clubs. 
   The Rapid City YMCA has served the community for over 50 years. 
   Earmarks, like this one, are grants secured by members of Congress, enabling them to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member of Congress' ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, Senator Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
