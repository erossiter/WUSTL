SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $54,000 TO BROOKINGS FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Brookings will receive $54,000 in federal funding to support efforts to preserve and celebrate the history and culture of the community. 
   "South Dakota has a long and important past, and we must preserve that history for future generations," said Johnson. "Preserving our past will help us to grow in the future by increasing tourism, helping our local economy, and honoring the history and beauty of Brookings."
   The project involves public education, an assessment of current tourism resources, and the development of a comprehensive plan to promote historic and cultural resources in Brookings.
   Senator Johnson has been a long-time supporter of historic preservation. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee and Appropriations Committee, he has helped to defend funding for historic preservation. In addition, Senator Johnson and his wife, Barbara Johnson, help to support the preservation of South Dakota heritage as members of the South Dakota Historical Society.
   Preserve America is a National Park Service program that encourages and supports community efforts to preserve and enjoy America's cultural and natural heritage. The goals of the initiative include a greater shared knowledge about the nation's past, strengthened regional identities and local pride, and support for the economic vitality of our communities. In South Dakota, Brookings, Vermillion, and Lead have won recognition as Preserve America communities.
