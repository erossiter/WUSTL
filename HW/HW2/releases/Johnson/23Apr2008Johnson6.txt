SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS EQUAL PAY LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today stood up for employees across the country and supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which would consider each paycheck that is based on a discriminatory practice a new violation of employment law. The bipartisan bill is in reaction to the Supreme Court decision in the Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company case from nearly a year ago. 
   "Discriminatory pay practices hurt workers and their families every time a worker takes home their paycheck. This bill makes that clear," Johnson said. "This legislation clarifies the law and gives workers a reasonable amount of time to file a pay equity claim."
   Lilly Ledbetter, an employee of Goodyear Tire for 19 years, was awarded more than $3.5 million by a jury that agreed she was discriminated against in her job based on her gender and was paid substantially less than her male equivalents over the course of her career.
   By a narrow 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court reversed that decision and highlighted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which requires that suits must be filed within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice. The majority remarks argued that the 180 days begin when the employer commits a discriminatory practice, not when an employee is compensated based on that practice.
   The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would adjust the Civil Rights Act to expressly state that employment discrimination occurs each time an employee is compensated. It also provides for two years of back pay compensation for discrimination that occurred before a claim was filed.
