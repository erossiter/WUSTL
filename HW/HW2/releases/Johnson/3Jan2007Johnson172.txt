SEN. JOHNSON'S OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATOR'S HEALTH CONDITION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) underwent an angiogram this morning at George Washington University Hospital. 
   "Today's angiogram revealed no evidence of residual arteriovenous malformation," said Dr. Vivek Deshmukh, MD, neurosurgeon. "Senator Johnson continues to be responsive to both his family and physicians- following commands, squeezing his wife's hand, and understanding speech."
   Senator Tim Johnson underwent surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage caused by an arteriovenous malformation at George Washington University Hospital on December 13th. As a consequence of the initial hemorrhage, Senator Johnson developed fluid in his lungs. Doctors placed him on a ventilator to assist his breathing. "His breathing has steadily improved and now he only requires ventilator assistance at night," says Dr. Deshmukh.
   "My family and I are so pleased with today's angiogram results, and I want thank everyone for their constant prayers and support. Tim has had some challenging days since surgery, but step by step, he's been making great progress. We know there is a long road in front of us, but Tim's determination will make all the difference and he'll be back at work as soon as he can be. We ask that everyone keep us in their prayers," said Barb Johnson, wife of U.S. Senator Tim Johnson.
   Senator Johnson's overall medical condition has improved steadily over the past three weeks. The next phase of his recovery is expected to take several months and focus upon rehabilitation and physical therapy.
