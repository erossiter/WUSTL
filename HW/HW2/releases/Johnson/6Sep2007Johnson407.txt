SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ROSEBUD SIOUX TRIBE TO RECEIVE $150,461
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Rosebud Sioux Tribe will receive a federal grant of $150,461 to assist with the operation of their tribal court. The funding will come through the United States Department of Justice's Tribal Courts Assistance Program. 
  "This funding will help the Rosebud Sioux tribe improve their justice system and keep their tribal court running efficiently," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The funding will be used to purchase equipment, provide training, hire staff, and improve the efficiency of the tribal justice system. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
