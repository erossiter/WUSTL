SEN. JOHNSON: SLANTED REPORT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS SHORT-SIGHTED
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in response to the Citizens Against Government Waste's slanted report that attacks government spending. The report totals all federal funding directed towards states, including all agriculture programs, to inflate totals in their report. Johnson said:  
  Citizens Against Government Waste thinks the Perkins County and Lewis and Clark water projects are pork. This organization has said, 'that farm subsidies don't help small farmers.' Earmarks have helped fund projects like the lab in Lead, economic development projects in Watertown, the medical school at USD and transportation projects in every corner of the state. 
  Of course, I'm against government waste, and where there is waste in government we should eliminate it. But to lump projects like these in with wasteful ones is simply wrong and dishonest. I have fought for these projects in the past and will fight for them in the future because they are good projects for the people of South Dakota.
