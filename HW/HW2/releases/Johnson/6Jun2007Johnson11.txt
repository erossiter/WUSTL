SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON PASSING OF SEN. THOMAS
  In response to a press inquiry, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) issued the following statement today on the passing of Sen. Craig Thomas late Monday evening: 
   "Senator Thomas will be missed by the people of Wyoming and he will be missed in the Senate. His kind is more and more rare these days. He was able to work across party lines for the good of the country and his state. While we may not have always agreed, we remained friends. My sympathy goes out to his wife Susan and his children during this time. They remain in our prayers."
