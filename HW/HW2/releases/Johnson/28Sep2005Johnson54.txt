SEN. JOHNSON BILL FOR RAPID CITY WATER PASSES COMMITTEE
  Legislation to ensure adequate water supplies for Rapid City that Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) introduced earlier this year today passed in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Johnson serves on that Committee and is the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, which held hearings on the bill in July.  
   \"Rapid City and area irrigators have worked hard to come to an agreement that will help all water users in the Rapid City area better balance the needs of the region,\" Johnson said. \"The Energy and Natural Resources Committee\'s approval of this bill is an important step in finalizing their hard work.\" 
   The Pactola Reservoir Reallocation Authorization Act of 2005, S. 819, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to reallocate costs of the Pactola Dam and Reservoir to reflect changing demands for municipal, industrial, and fish and wildlife purposes. Rapid City, the Rapid Valley Water Conservancy District, and the Bureau of Reclamation have renegotiated their water service contract to meet new needs, but Congressional approval is needed before the contract can be executed. With Rapid Valley\'s irrigation needs decreasing and Rapid City\'s municipal water needs increasing, shifting the resources is important. 
   \"I am pleased that the Committee approved the legislation, and I will continue to work with my colleagues toward approval by the full Senate,\" Johnson continued. 
   The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Pactola Dam and Reservoir, part of the Rapid Valley unit under the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, in the Flood Control Act of 1944. 
   Johnson introduced the Pactola Reservoir Reallocation Authorization Act on April 15 of this year. It is now ready for consideration by the full Senate.
