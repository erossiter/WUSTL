SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $99,867 FOR VERMILLION'S TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that Technology Innovations, Inc., of Vermillion will receive a $99,867 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Grant for their "HAZMAT Training for First Responders in Rural Areas: An Online Intelligent Tutor" project. The funding comes from the Department of Health and Human Services NIEHS Hazardous Waste Worker and Health Safety Training program. 
  "This is an innovative way to spread important information to workers who deal with hazardous substances," Johnson said. "I'm pleased that these funds will help a Vermillion company, Technology Innovations, move forward with their project, which will improve the availability of HAZMAT training for rural first responders."
   The SBIR program encourages small businesses across the US to explore, research and develop innovations with potential for commercialization. The SBIR program was established under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 and reauthorized again until September 30, 2008 by the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 to encourage small businesses to creatively find solutions for public benefit. To date, over $12 billion has been awarded by the SBIR program to various small businesses.
   Currently, eleven Federal agencies participate in the SBIR program: the Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Agriculture (USDA), Commerce (DOC), Defense (DOD), Education (DoED), Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), and Transportation (DOT); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
