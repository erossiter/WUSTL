FARM BILL STALLED BECAUSE OF MORE THAN 260 AMENDMENTS
  Five votes shy of the needed total, a procedural vote that would have ended debate on the Farm Bill failed in the Senate today, thus letting the legislation languish. U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) comments on the effort to keep the Farm Bill on track and his hope that compromise will still be found this year:  
  It's remarkable that this Farm Bill made it out of the Senate Agriculture Committee with unanimous, bipartisan support and it has been given two weeks on the Senate floor, but 42 Senators voted to obstruct this bill with a filibuster. Today, we could have moved to the heart of the Farm Bill by limiting the more than 260 amendments to this bill down to the most relevant ones and delivered a new Farm Bill for our producers. Instead, the minority voted to punt the Farm Bill down the field.
  Forty-two Senators thought it was more important to debate amendments on the Exxon Valdez, immigration reform and medical malpractice. Farmers and ranchers will have to wait because a minority of Senators would not let us bring debate down to the most central agriculture issues on the Farm Bill.
  This Farm Bill had such a strong start and potential for the Great Plains. After my conversation with Senator Reid yesterday, I am still hopeful that we will complete both the Farm Bill and Energy Bill this year. 
  Compromise is necessary to accomplish results. I hope the White House and the minority will work with us to deliver a strong package for rural America.
