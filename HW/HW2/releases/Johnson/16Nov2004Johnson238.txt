SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON APPOINTMENT OF JONATHAN ADELSTEIN TO FCC
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in reaction to Jonathan Adelstein being appointed to the FCC today by President Bush: 
   "Thanks to Senator Daschle appointing Jonathan to the FCC, we were able to convince the White House of the need for an FCC commissioner who understands the unique telecommunications needs of rural communities. This is a victory for South Dakotans. I will work to see that Jonathan's confirmation moves forward swiftly-hopefully before Congress adjourns for the year. I've known Jonathan for years, and he has done an outstanding job at the FCC since being sworn in almost two years ago. I applaud Senator Daschle's leadership in selecting Jonathan for the FCC to ensure South Dakota's telecommunications needs are heard at the FCC."
   Adelstein's nomination is reportedly scheduled to be considered in the Senate Commerce Committee Thursday morning.
