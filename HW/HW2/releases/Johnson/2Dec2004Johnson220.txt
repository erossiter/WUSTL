SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S PICK OF JOHANNS FOR AGRICULTURE SECRETARY
  Sen Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon receiving news that President George W. Bush has selected Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns as his choice to replace outgoing Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman: 
   With Governor Johanns selection, we can only hope the great plains will have a strong voice at the USDA. While a lawyer by trade, Johanns was raised on a dairy farm and has used his position as Governor to focus on trade, value-added agriculture, especially ethanol, and drought assistance. 
   Johanns will have his hands full at the top post of the USDA. Our family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota are facing years of drought and are in need of an Agriculture Secretary that is ready to fight on their behalf.
   Of course, the implementation of mandatory country-of-origin labeling remains a top concern. It is my hope that Governor Johanns will have a greater opportunity to focus on this issue in his new post and is ready to implement the law of the land.
   I look forward to working with him on behalf of our farmers and ranchers, and I wish him all the best in this crucial post.
