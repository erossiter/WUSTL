SEN. JOHNSON: LOAN MEANS OPPORTUNITY, JOB GROWTH FOR MINNEHAHA COUNTY
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Minnehaha County Water Corporation will receive a $3.25 million low-interest federal loan that will be used to finance the connection to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. The loan is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program, and provides the final prepayment amount for the systems non-federal cost share.  
   "Proper infrastructure is crucial for our communities and I am pleased that Minnehaha County will receive this important funding," said Johnson. "As the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Systems continues to progress, it is critical that we are able to get our growing communities on-line. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   The President's Fiscal Year 2008 budget provides only $15 million for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, a decrease of $6 million compared to the level provided by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007. As a member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee with responsibility for funding this project, Senator Johnson will work with his colleagues on the subcommittee to restore the necessary funding. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov. 
   Lincoln County Rural Water Systems will receive a $2.9 million low-interest federal loan for a similar purpose.
