SENATE CONFIRMS NEW FED CHAIRMAN
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Banking Committee and Ranking Member on the Financial Institutions Subcommittee, welcomes incoming Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. Today, Bernanke takes over the helm following the retirement today of Alan Greenspan who served as the Fed Chief for more than 18 years. 
   "I wish Chairman Greenspan well as he transitions back into the private sector, and I look forward to working with Chairman Bernanke," said Johnson.
   "With the costs of energy, health care, and housing continuing to drive inflation higher, it is my hope that Chairman Bernanke will hold firm to his commitment to maintain transparency in the Fed's decision making and set policies independent of any political agendas."
   "Dr. Bernanke's credentials, both academic and professional, are exemplary. The world eagerly waits to see what his leadership brings as a new era at the Fed begins."
   Dr. Bernanke was nominated on October 24, 2005 to replace retiring Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Senate confirmed Bernanke's nomination today.
