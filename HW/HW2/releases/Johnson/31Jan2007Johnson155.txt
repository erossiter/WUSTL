DISABLED VETERANS LIFE MEMORIAL FOUNDATION TO HONOR SEN. JOHNSON
  This evening, the Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation will honor Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) at a ceremony for his continued dedication to disabled veterans, and his efforts to support building a memorial to honor disabled veterans in Washington, DC. A member of Johnson's staff will be on hand to accept the award. Among the other honorees at the Wednesday evening gathering are Sen. Max Cleland (D-GA) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). The Master of Ceremonies for the event is former Veterans Affairs Secretary Tony Principi.  
   In May of 2006, Johnson's The American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act passed the Senate, but the House of Representatives failed to act on it during the last Congress. Johnson has committed to reintroducing the coin bill in the 110th Congress. 
   The bill would have created a commemorative coin to honor America's disabled veterans, and the proceeds from the sale of the commemorative coin would have helped fund the construction of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, DC. 
   When the bill passed the Senate last year, Johnson remarked that "in America, we have over 3 million living disabled veterans who served their country honorably. This memorial will help us to recognize their sacrifices in a monument overlooking the U.S. Capitol." 
   Congress has authorized the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial to be placed on a site adjacent to the National Mall. The Foundation describes the memorial's purpose as a way to "embody America's lasting gratitude for the men and women whose lives are forever changed in service to our country."
