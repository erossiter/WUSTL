SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES APPLICATION PERIOD FOR FIREFIGHTER GRANTS PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Department of Homeland Security is currently accepting applications for its Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) Program. Eligible applicants are limited to fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical service (EMS) organizations. 
  "The resources this program provides benefit South Dakota's small communities tremendously, and help us respond to the devastating impact of fires," Johnson said. "I will continue to push for funding for this program, and I encourage all eligible organizations to apply for these funds."
  Details about this grant opportunity and instructions for submitting an application are available at www.firegrantsupport.com. Applications must be received by Friday, April 4, 2008 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. 
  President Bush has proposed deep cuts to this program. In fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated $745 million. But for fiscal year 2008, the President proposed a funding level of only $300 million. Senator Johnson understands the importance of properly equipping those who voluntarily risk their lives to protect the public. That is why he has repeatedly used his seat on Senate Appropriations Committee to oppose cuts to this vital program.
