SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $900,000 TO LOWER BRULE SIOUX TRIBE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe will receive $900,000 through the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG). 
   "I'm pleased that the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe will be able to use this funding to further improve their standard of living," said Johnson. "The ICDBG program is an important source of federal assistance to tribes to help them meet their development needs. As a member of both the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight for funding for this vital program."
   ICDBG funding goes toward improvement projects for tribal communities across America. This grant will be used to renovate the roof of the elderly housing complex and mitigate black mold in houses.
   The ICDBG program provides grants to tribal communities to develop viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low and moderate-income persons. This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
