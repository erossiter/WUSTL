SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES BILL TO PROVIDE FOR RAPID CITY WATER NEEDS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today introduced legislation to ensure adequate water supplies for Rapid City.  
 The legislation would provide the necessary Congressional approval of the long-term contract between the Bureau of Reclamation and Rapid City to utilize water resources from the Pactola Reservoir in order to meet a range of municipal, industrial, and residential water supply purposes.
   "I am glad to help move this process forward with today's legislation," said Johnson, a member of the Energy Committee. "It is critical that we provide all South Dakotans with a reliable source of clean water. As the community has changed, so have the water needs of Rapid City. This is a simple, yet necessary, legislative fix. I will work to move this legislation forward."
   With Rapid Valley's irrigation needs decreasing and Rapid City's municipal water needs increasing, shifting the resources is important. Today's legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a contract with Rapid City and Rapid Valley Conservancy District to provide a water supply for municipal, industrial, recreation, and wildlife needs.
   The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Pactola Dam and Reservoir, part of the Rapid Valley unit under the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, in the Flood Control Act of 1944.
   The bill will be referred to the Senate Energy Committee's Subcommittee on Water and Power, on which Johnson serves as the Ranking Member.
