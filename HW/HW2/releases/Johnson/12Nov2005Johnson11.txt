SEN. JOHNSON TOUTS E85 AT AFI EVENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today touted the use of E85 at an educational event.  
 E85 is a motor fuel blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. The higher blended fuel is used in flexible fuel vehicles. The event was sponsored by the Alternative Fuels Institute (AFI). 
   "Encouraging investment in alternative forms of clean-burning energy, like E85, is good for the environment, good for national security and energy independence, and good for job creation and rural America," Johnson said. "E85 is a great step in moving America toward energy independence."
   Today's event, which was attended by Senator Johnson, and his South Dakota colleagues in Congress, Senator John Thune (R-SD) and Representative Stephanie Herseth (D-SD), served to further promote ethanol and E85, which have been popular alternatives for South Dakotans, particularly as gas prices have remained high.
   The Energy Bill, for which Johnson served on the conference committee, includes an incentive for the installation of E85 pumps through a tax credit. This provision provides a 30 percent tax credit up to $30,000 for gasoline stations that choose to retrofit existing pumps or install new tanks and E85 pumps for the higher-ethanol content fuel. 
   Ethanol production remains a high priority for Johnson. Johnson secured a provision in the Energy Bill that increases the use of renewable fuels over the next seven years to 7.5 billion gallons per year.
