SEN. JOHNSON PUSHES FOR SUFFICIENT MILITARY PAY INCREASE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) is calling for Congress to provide adequate pay to our nation's troops. Johnson joined colleagues in sending a letter to the Senate Budget Committee pushing to make sure troops are given a raise on par with what they deserve. President Bush's request in his 2007 budget is a meager 2.2% increase, the smallest increase since 1994. 
   "As we face recruiting shortages in the Army, the National Guard and the Army Reserve, the least we can do is give our military a pay raise that keeps up with inflation," said Johnson. "Many of our troops are stretched thin around the world, often far away from their loved ones. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I will seek to secure appropriate raises for those who serve to protect our great nation."
   In recent years, Congress has relied on a formula to increase military pay by 0.5% above the Employment Cost Index (ECI). This year, the administration's request is only equal to the ECI. Together, America can do better for our troops.
