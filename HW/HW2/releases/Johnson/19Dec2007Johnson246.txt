SEN. JOHNSON: TRIBAL PROJECTS FARE WELL IN OMNIBUS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) voted for the Omnibus spending bill yesterday, which passed the Senate late last night. The bill will fund the federal government through Fiscal Year 2008 and provides resources for vital projects for South Dakota's tribal communities. 
  "Our tribes need this funding, and I am proud to use my seniority as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure resources to improve justice systems, upgrade 911 systems and expand health care," said Johnson. "I will continue to make sure that funding for Indian Country is a priority, not an afterthought, in our budgetary process."
