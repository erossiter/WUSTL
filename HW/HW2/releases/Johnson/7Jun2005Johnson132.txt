SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $300,000 RURAL COMMUNITY INITIATIVE GRANT TO FIRST NATIONS OWEESTA CORPORATION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that a South Dakota-based corporation will receive $300,000 to enhance economic development in a number of Native communities. 
   The First Nations OWEESTA Corporation (Oweesta) of Rapid City will use the funds to aid non-profit financing and training organizations in developing their ability to undertake projects related to small business, housing, community facilities and economic development.
   "The First Nations Oweesta Corporation has done an extensive amount of work to increase economic opportunities for Native Americans," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This grant will help expand their efforts throughout Indian Country." 
   This program, which is an expansion of the Kellogg Foundation's Entrepreneurial Development System Grant recently received by Oweesta and its partners, will allow Oweesta to provide assistance to the Four Bands Community Fund on the Cheyenne River Reservation, the Lakota Fund on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Wind River Development Fund on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and the Aneth RBDO, which aids the Navajo in Utah. This funding comes from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Community Development Initiative Grant.
   "I remain deeply committed to helping build opportunities for economic growth on our reservations," said Johnson. "I look forward to continuing to work with Native Americans to address concerns facing Indian tribes."
   Johnson has worked with tribal leaders in the past to help develop such programs as the Native American Housing Enhancement Act of 2003 and the Tribal Economic Enhancement Act of 2003, both of which sought to aid Native Americans in developing a strong economic outlook.
