SEN. JOHNSON TO BE HONORED FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF FAMILY FARMERS AND RANCHERS
  At a reception later this evening, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) will receive the Golden Triangle Award from the National Farmers Union (NFU) for his work and commitment to issues affecting rural America. The award is the highest award for government service given by the NFU. NFU's board directors will present honorees with their awards at a special Capitol Hill event. 
   "I am honored to receive this award from the National Farmers Union, for my work on behalf of farmers, ranchers and other members of South Dakota's rural communities," said Johnson. "Working hard for South Dakota families includes a strong commitment to addressing the needs of our state's agricultural community. As the Senate begins considering the farm bill, I will continue to be a strong voice for South Dakota in Washington." 
   "If the South Dakota Farmers Union had any say in the name for the Golden Triangle award, we'd change the Golden Triangle award to the Tim Johnson award because he has been such a phenomenal supporter of South Dakota agriculture," said Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union. 
   Johnson has received the NFU's Golden Triangle award eleven other times: 1988, 1991, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. 
   The Golden Triangle Award is based on NFU's symbol-a triangle with "legislation" and "cooperation" forming the sides and "education" the base. The Golden Triangle Award is awarded annually and was first established in 1988.
