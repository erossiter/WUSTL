SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $30,000 GRANT FOR PLAYGROUND IN FREEMAN
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Department of Game, Fish and Parks will receive a $30,000 grant from the National Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to improve the children's playground at the Freeman City Park. 
  "Places like Freeman City Park are important to our communities, and give children and families a safe, clean place for recreation," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment."
  The LWCF gives grants to states to help them purchase land, water and wetlands to be preserved for both present and future generations. The grants match state expenditures and benfit the local communities directly. Congress provided over $24 million for conservation grants to states through the LWCF in fiscal year 2008. Johnson serves as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the National Park Service.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
