DOCTORS SAY SEN. JOHNSON CONTINUES TO PROGRESS
  Sen. Tim Johnson continues his recovery in an in-patient rehabilitation facility, where he will spend the Easter holiday with his family. His doctors are pleased with his progress and have released additional information.  
   The Senator continues to make gains with regard to strengthening in his right leg. The attending physician states, "These very early signs of physical improvement offer the hope of even greater gains over time. It is not uncommon for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients to see improvement for up to 2 years." 
   "Patience, faith and family keep me moving forward. Between therapy, my Senate work and following the news in South Dakota, I have been keeping busy. Barb can attest that I am anxious to get back to traveling the state and visiting with South Dakotans," said Senator Johnson.
