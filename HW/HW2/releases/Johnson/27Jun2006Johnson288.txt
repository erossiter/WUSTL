SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ENERGY, WATER SPENDING LEVELS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels for South Dakota's water projects contained in the Energy and Water spending bill. The bill passed the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee today, on which Johnson serves. 
   "I was pleased to be able to help secure $23.5 million for Lewis and Clark," said Johnson. "It's important that we fight for South Dakota projects and keep the dollar amounts as high as possible in the Senate so that we can come out of conference committee with necessary funding for these vital water priorities." 
   "We will be working to hang onto these numbers amid increased competition for every federal dime," Johnson continued. "Budgets are about priorities, and moving forward it is my hope that we can provide more for critical infrastructure, including drinking water, renewable fuels, and flood control projects."

  - Of $22.72 million for Biomass Feedstock Infrastucture to develop harvesting, transportation and storage systems that reduce the cost of converting crops into energy sources:

   "We are working against the administration's misplaced priorities," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "The Administration's tax cuts for people like Paris Hilton and Donald Trump will cost thirty-two billion this year alone, yet drinking water and other infrastructure projects are supposed to take a backseat."
   The Energy and Water Appropriations Bill will next be considered by the full Senate Appropriations Committee this week. The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill in recent weeks.
