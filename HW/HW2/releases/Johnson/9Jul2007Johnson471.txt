SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TRIBES TO COMBAT CANCER
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that two tribal groups will receive funding for the early detection and treatment of cancer.  
  The Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health Board will receive $200,000 federal grant for their Northern Plains Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council will receive $357,563 federal grant for Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.
  "As a cancer survivor, I know the difference that early detection and treatment make in fighting cancer," Johnson said. "With this funding, the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health Board will work hard to offer a comprehensive approach to cancer prevention. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council will also be able to expand early detection for both breast and cervical cancers, which will increase the chances for women to be diagnosed in time to fight a cancer diagnosis."
  Both grants are funded through the Department of Health and Human Services National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion agency, through the Chronic Disease Control Cooperative Agreement program.
