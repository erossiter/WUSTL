SEN. JOHNSON: STIMULUS SHOULD BE TIMELY, TARGETED AND TEMPORARY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in response to the President's comments today on the economy: 
  I was pleased to see that the President is taking steps to address the weakening economy and that he is working with Congress to develop a bipartisan plan. We still need to see details and make sure that any steps taken are fiscally responsible and primarily benefit those who would be most burdened by a possible recession. An economic stimulus package needs to be timely, targeted and temporary to have a strong effect. It is clear we need to give a boost to the economy and get help to America's working families.
