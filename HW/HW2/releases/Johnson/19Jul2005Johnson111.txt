SEN. JOHNSON RESPONDS TO BRAC COMMITTEE HEARING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today monitored a hearing held by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission on Capitol Hill.  
 The purpose of today's hearing was to vote on considering the inclusion of other bases to BRAC's closure and realignment list. The BRAC Commission voted not to consider closing Grand Forks Air Force Base. 
   "The future of Ellsworth does not depend on the Grand Forks Air Force Base," said Johnson. "I continue to make the case that it is not in our national security interests to station all the B-1 bombers at a single base. The Commission decision on Grand Forks does not change that fact. I was pleased to see that the Commission again recognized and discussed the value of Ellsworth at today's hearing. I will continue to actively monitor the BRAC proceedings with the rest of South Dakota's Congressional delegation."
