SEN. JOHNSON: $171,750 FOR HOUSING HELP IN EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Inter-Lakes Community Action, Inc. will receive $171,750 to assist low-income families seeking affordable, safe housing.  
   Johnson has called this program a way that "families who could not otherwise afford a house are able to contribute 'sweat equity,' by helping to build their own and other families' homes." 
   Inter-Lakes Community Action is a community-based nonprofit organization that serves primarily low-income families and senior citizens in twelve eastern South Dakota counties, according to its mission statement. Counties served by the organization include: Brookings, Lake, Miner, Kingsbury, Hamlin, Grant, Deuel, Codington, Moody, McCook, Minnehaha, and Clark. Specifically, these funds will be used to provide for rehabilitation of 30 homes. 
   The loan will be administered by the USDA's Rural Development Agency through its Self-Help Housing Grant program. USDA Rural Development provides programs with the goal of increasing economic opportunity and improving the quality of life of rural residents.
