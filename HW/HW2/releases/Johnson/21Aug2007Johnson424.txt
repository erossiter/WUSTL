  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Todd County School District will receive a federal grant of $714,257 from the U.S. Department of Education's Safe Schools/Healthy Students Grant Program (SS/HS) to promote healthy childhood development and prevent student violence and drug abuse.  
  "It is crucial that South Dakota's schools receive the resources they need to give students the highest quality education," said Johnson. "This funding helps ensure that students in the Todd County School Districtwill be able to thrive in a safe and healthy educational environment."
