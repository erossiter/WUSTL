SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR RED CLOUD INDIAN SCHOOL'S AMERICORPS PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D?SD) office announced today that the Teaching the Young People AmeriCorps program at the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge will receive a continuation grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service in the amount of $198,494. In addition, 19 members may receive up to $4,725 to pay for college or qualified student loans.  
   Members at the Red Cloud Indian School provide tutoring and mentoring to students in structured after-school and service learning programs. Activities include developing classroom curricula, tutoring at-risk students, assisting students with computer-based reading and math testing software, monitoring standardized test results, and supporting expansion of after-school activities including cultural activities. 
   "I strongly support efforts to promote community service and volunteerism," Johnson has said in the past. "The programs administered through the Corporation for National Service, including AmeriCorps, are critical to facilitate community service initiatives. These programs support hundreds of thousands of volunteers and generate millions of hours of service to communities and families throughout the nation." 
   AmeriCorps members support community volunteer activities, mentor youth, build affordable housing and help communities respond to disasters. They serve in hundreds of nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and community and faith-based organizations in rural and urban communities across the nation.
