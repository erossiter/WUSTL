SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING CONTROL OF U.S. PORTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today voted to keep debate open on an issue critical to our national defense. As the Senate debates the Lobbying Reform Bill, S. 2349, Senators sought to discuss the management of six U.S. ports by the state-owned United Arab Emirates company, DP World. Had the Senate voted to stop debate, there would have been no opportunity this legislative period for the Senate to debate the deal proposed by President George W. Bush before control of the ports was transferred. Debate was not limited, by a vote of 51-47. 
   "The Senate needs to debate the President's deal allowing American ports to be run by a state-owned company from a country that had ties to terrorists," said Johnson. "To cut off debate today would have suggested to the White House that the Senate is okay with selling control of our ports to the highest bidder."
   Just moments before the Senate vote occurred, the United Arab Emirates-based company Dubai Ports World issued a press release saying it would 'transfer fully the U.S. operation of P&O Operations North America to a United States entity.'
   "We should address lobbying reform just as soon as we can finish Senate action to prevent foreign control of our ports," Johnson added.
   "Even as DP World announces that they will transfer control of the ports to a U.S. entity, we know very little regarding the details of this transfer. The devil is in the details, and we need to know more," Johnson concluded.
