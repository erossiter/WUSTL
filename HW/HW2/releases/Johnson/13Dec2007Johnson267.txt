ENERGY BILL AGAIN BLOCKED BY MINORITY IN SENATE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) was disappointed today with another stall tactic that has blocked the Energy Bill, which includes a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) of 15 billion gallons of ethanol by 2015. The vote to move the bill forward received a majority vote of 59 to 40, but failed to clear the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster.  
  Johnson is working with Senate Majority Leader Reid (D-NV) to get a fourth version of the legislation to the floor as soon as today. Johnson has released the following statement:
  "Today, a majority in the Senate voted to bring to end debate on the Energy Bill and finally move the legislation forward. I am disappointed that that effort was again blocked by a minority who oppose lessening our dependence on foreign energy sources.
  Increasing the Renewable Fuel Standard and making America less dependent on oil is too important to South Dakota and the country to let Senators from the oil patch use the issue as a political football. There is widespread agreement on increasing the Renewable Fuel Standard and improving the fuel economy of cars and trucks. 
  I have spoken to Senator Reid about the importance of this bill to South Dakota and will continue to work with him and others in the Senate to revisit this issue and get a new Energy Bill to the floor as early as today. Together with Republicans and Democrats, I am determined to pass an Energy Bill that increases the Renewable Fuel Standard and lessens America's dependence on foreign oil."
