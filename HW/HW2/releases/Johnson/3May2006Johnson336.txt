SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $150,000 FOR URBAN INDIAN HEALTH PROGRAM IN SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that South Dakota Urban Indian Health, Inc. (SDUIH) will receive a $150,000 federal grant for continued health services to Native Americans at its clinics in Aberdeen, Pierre and Sioux Falls. The grant is being awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
   "I'm pleased that South Dakota Urban Indian Health is receiving this funding," Johnson said. "There are significant numbers of Native Americans living in urban areas in South Dakota, and they rely on the high-quality, culturally appropriate care that these clinics provide."
   SDUIH is part of the Urban Indian Health Program (UIHP), which provides health care services at 41 sites across the country. The President's 2007 budget request proposes to cut future funding for the program entirely. Johnson is strongly opposed to the elimination of the program and continues to work to restore funding.
   "I am extremely disappointed that the Bush Administration has threatened the future existence of UIHP. Through my seats on the Senate Budget and Appropriations committees, I will continue to fight to see that future federal funds are available for this important program," Johnson continued.
   In March, Johnson joined with 15 bipartisan colleagues in writing a letter to the leadership of the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the Interior to request that funding be restored in the 2007 budget for UIHP. According to the 2000 census, 64.1 percent of the native population lives outside tribal areas, many in urban locales.
   Johnson continues to believe that rising health care costs can sap economic strength in Indian Country and the state as a whole. Taking action against health care costs is a main focus of the Protecting Pocketbooks pillar of Johnson's new Hometown Prosperity Plan.
