SEN. JOHNSON: GAS PRICES REMAIN HIGHER THAN NECESSARY
  During a Senate Energy Committee hearing on gasoline prices today, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) said that despite a recent leveling-off of gas prices, more can be done to ease the burden on working families.
   "We need real solutions to the long-term problem of dependence on foreign oil," said Johnson. "Development of renewable sources of energy-ethanol and biodiesel-must be a part of that. I am concerned that American taxpayers are subsidizing Iraqi gas prices, while at home we pay top dollar. During near record-highs in South Dakota, we are helping Iraqis to enjoy a tank of gas for under two dollars."
   In South Dakota, motorists have seen the average price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline rise from $1.75 in March to $2.05 a gallon in late May. For a mid-sized vehicle, the record-high gas prices amount to several hundred dollars over the course of a year.
   Recent studies confirm that ethanol has reduced gasoline prices by 30 cents per gallon from what they otherwise would be. Meanwhile, of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), only Saudi Arabia still has any existing capacity to boost production. 
   Ethanol production has increased by approximately 300 million gallons in 2002 and another 300 million gallons in 2003, to an annual total of 3.3 billion gallons. As ethanol producers continue to improve efficiency, similar significant growth can be expected in the coming years.
