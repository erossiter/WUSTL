  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in response to reports of the passing of former President Ronald Reagan:
   "President Reagan provided leadership for our country during a time of great transition, shepherding America through the end of the Cold War. No one ever doubted his commitment to America.
