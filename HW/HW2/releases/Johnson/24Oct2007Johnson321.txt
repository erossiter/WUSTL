SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE SOUTHWICK
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson released the following statement on his affirmative vote to confirm Judge Leslie H. Southwick of Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals: 
   Judge Southwick possesses a high level of legal skill and is a man of solid personal and professional integrity. I voted today to confirm his nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   While it is not the role of the Senate to "rubber stamp" any President's judicial nominations, it is also true that any President's choice deserves due deference. Although there is always pressure to do so, I do not have a litmus test on any issue for judicial nominees. 
   I do not believe that simple political ideology ought to be a deciding factor so long as the nominee's views are not significantly outside the mainstream of American legal thinking. I have concerns about Judge Southwick's rulings on some civil rights and child custody cases in the past, but I cannot accept an argument that his views are so radical that the Senate is justified in denying his confirmation. 
   For eight years this seat on the bench of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has sat vacant. The American people deserve a justice system that not only works fairly, but also swiftly, in the manner intended by those who designed the branch of government to interpret our laws.
