FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT BILL PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support extending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). After the bipartisan bill passed the Senate, Johnson offered the following comment on the measure: 
  This is meaningful legislation gives our intelligence community the tools they need to keep up the fight against terrorism while protecting Americans' civil liberties. I hope that my colleagues in the House will quickly move this piece of legislation and that the President will sign the bill so we can maintain our ability to collect information on foreign terrorists.
