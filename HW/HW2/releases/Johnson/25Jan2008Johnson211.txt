HOME DEPOT DROPS ILC BID
  Upon hearing the news that Home Depot has withdrawn their application for an industrial loan company (ILC) charter, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson released the following statement:  
  With the impending expiration of the FDIC's moratorium on commercial ILC applications, I was very pleased earlier this week to see that Senator Dodd will be acting quickly to take up comprehensive legislation in the Banking Committee to address this.
  Home Depot's withdrawal of their application for an ILC charter is further evidence that we need to move forward with legislation to clarify the regulatory landscape. The FDIC needs the necessary tools so Congress doesn't find itself in this position again or in the position of legislating in response to a crisis in this area.
  Johnson has raised questions about applications such as Home Depot's for an ILC due to concerns it would mix banking and commerce, cause potential risks to the deposit insurance fund and possibly threatening the nation's payments system. In May, Senator Johnson, along with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Wayne Allard (R-CO), introduced the bipartisan Industrial Bank Holding Company Act (S. 1356), to restore the separation of banking and commerce by preventing additional commercial firms from acquiring or establishing industrial loan companies (ILC).
