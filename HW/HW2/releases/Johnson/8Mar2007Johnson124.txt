SEN. JOHNSON CO-SPONSORS TAX RELIEF FOR TEACHERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has co-sponsored the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2007, S.505. The bill would make permanent a teachers' tax deduction for out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies. The bill also amends the tax code to increase the deduction for out-of-pocket expenses of classroom supplies to $400 and expands the deduction to cover professional development expenses. Johnson has co-sponsored similar legislation for the past two Congresses.  
   In the past, Johnson has described these types of tax deductions as "targeted tax cuts that help working families - not just multi-millionaires." Since 2001, teachers have been allowed to deduct up to $250 per year for expenses they incur out of their own pockets to purchase classroom supplies. This tax deduction was recently extended in the tax extenders portion of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act through the end of 2007. Without permanent change, this deduction will again have to be extended to cover 2008.
