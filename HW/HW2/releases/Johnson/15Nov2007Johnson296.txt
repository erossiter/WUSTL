SEN. JOHNSON MARKS NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN HERITAGE MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today submitted a statement to the Congressional Record on the importance of National American Indian Heritage Month. Johnson also met with South Dakota tribal members who today performed at an event in Washington in recognition of the month. 
   "This November we celebrate American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month to honor the first people of this land and recognize the obligations this country has made to American Indian people," Johnson said in the statement. "As we look to the past, we must also look to the future...I am dedicated to working with Indian Country to protect sovereignty, freedom, and to stimulate a collective growth as a people." 
   Johnson met with Dallas Chief Eagle of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and Jasmine Pickner of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, who performed a traditional hoop dance at the Library of Congress' American Folklife Center earlier in the day. Their performance was part of an event titled "Homegrown: The Music of Americana" in honor of National American Indian Heritage Month.
   "Dallas Chief Eagle and Jasmine Pickner made South Dakota and all of Indian Country proud with their performance in Washington today," said Johnson. "Their traditional hoop dance celebrated the sort of rich cultural heritage that has helped make this country great."
   A member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Johnson has been a strong voice for American Indian issues in Washington. South Dakota has nine separate tribes across the state that are home to more than 62,000 American Indians. Tribes include the Cheyenne River, Crow Creek, Flandreau Santee, Lower Brule, Oglala, Rosebud, Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, Standing Rock, and Yankton Sioux Tribe.
