BANKRUPTCY REFORM BRINGS PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO THE SYSTEM
  On a conference call with state reporters today, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced his support for the bankruptcy reform bill currently being debated on the Senate floor. Johnson, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, will play a leading role in the floor debate over the next two weeks. Johnson has been working to craft legislation that finds a balance between personal responsibility and consumer protections. 
   "The goal is not to throw people to the creditors, but to create a needs-based system that protects those that need the help most - that simple. At the same time, we want to make sure that those who can repay their debts do so," Johnson said. "This is the eighth straight year that I have supported this reform bill, and I am hopeful that it may finally pass."
   The bill, S. 256 - the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, requires debtors to receive a minimum amount of credit counseling from a nonprofit credit counseling agency to determine if they might be able to work out their debt problems with some additional help. If a solution short of bankruptcy can be found, it is most likely to be in the debtor's best interests. 
   The goal is to address certain abuses present in the bankruptcy process. The bill is over 500 pages long, but key provisions include:
   * A means test to ensure that those who can afford to repay some portion of their unsecured debts are required to do so. Bankruptcy petitioners with relatively high incomes could be required to file under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7, and repay some of their debt out of future income. The means test takes into account the petitioner's income, debt burden, and allowable living expenses, which can vary significantly according to the debtor's place of residence and particular circumstances. Filers who cannot afford to repay at least $6,000 will be given unfettered access to Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings. 
   * A permanent extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy for family farmers. The bill also bumps the exemption level for family farmers from $1.5 million to nearly $3.24 million, which will be adjusted periodically for inflation. "I am pleased that we will finally be able to get away from a year-by-year extension of this measure, which is, I regret to say, important for all too many of our family farmers," Johnson said. 
   * Child support collection measures. The bill contains provisions that strengthen the ability of women and children to collect child support and marital dissolution obligations.
   * Consumer protection measures. The bill protects consumers by requiring new minimum payment and introductory rate disclosures for credit cards. It also contains a 'debtors bill of rights' requiring that bankruptcy attorneys and petition preparers disclose their services and fees for those services to consumers.
   "No American is denied access to the bankruptcy system under reform. However, higher-income debtors trying to protect their lifestyle at the expense of working families will be held accountable. Again - this is common-sense reform and it is long overdue," Johnson concluded.
