SEN. REID TAPS SEN. JOHNSON FOR VICE CHAIR OF ETHICS COMMITTEE
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) announced today that Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) will take his place as Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics for the 109th Congress. Sen. Reid, who was just elected to be Senate Minority Leader, will step down to focus on his new duties.
   "There's no one I'd rather have on the Ethics Committee than Tim Johnson," said Reid. "Tim is intelligent, hard-working, and dedicated. He is also an impeccable example of good character. I know he'll represent our party well on the committee."
   Johnson, in his second-term in the Senate, will retain his current committee assignments on Appropriations, Banking, Budget, Energy, and Indian Affairs. 
   "For the Senate to serve the American people, observing ethics and standards is critical," said Johnson. "I am honored that Senator Reid has asked me to take on this role."
   Unlike most Senate committees, the Select Committee on Ethics always has two Vice Chairmen - one Democrat and one Republican. Committee members are also evenly divided between the parties. The committee oversees internal ethics matters and sets conduct guidelines for Senators and staff.
