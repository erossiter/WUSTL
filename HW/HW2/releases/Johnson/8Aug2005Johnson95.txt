SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS SIGNING OF ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a negotiator on the Energy Bill conference committee and Member of the Senate Energy Committee, applauded the signing of the Energy Bill by President Bush today.  
 Johnson helped secure a 7.5 billion gallon Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by 2012 as part of the Energy Bill. 
   "The Energy Bill has numerous advantages for South Dakota including the 7.5 billion gallon RFS and tax incentives for energy production that will have long term benefits for South Dakota," said Johnson. "I'm pleased to see the President sign this into law today. This comprehensive bill will hopefully bring jobs, energy independence, a cleaner environment, and economic development." 
   The Renewable Fuel Standard that was adopted by Congress would implement a robust standard beginning in 2006 and require refiners to blend 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel. That standard would be gradually increased over the next several years until 2012 when refiners would be required to blend a total of 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels.
