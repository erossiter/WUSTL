SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $300,000 FOR BOOKS, HOURS, PROGRAMS AT MID-CENTRAL EDUCATIONAL COOPERATIVE LIBRARIES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Mid-Central Educational Cooperative in Platte will receive a $300,000 federal grant for library enhancements. This funding will allow for the acquisition of high-quality contemporary titles to library collections, the purchase of research and content-oriented software, and the extension of library hours. The grant comes through the U.S. Department of Education's Literacy and School Libraries program. 
  "South Dakota's libraries should be troves of knowledge and exciting places for our young people to go and learn," said Johnson. "This funding will allow the Mid-Central Education Cooperative to provide the children of Charles Mix County the latest books and technology to help their literary skills develop."
  The Department of Education's Literacy and School Libraries program provides students with increased access to up-to-date school library materials, a library media center, and well-trained, professional media specialists to improve literacy skills and student achievement. The Senate FY 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill includes $23 million for this program, which is approximately $2.5 million more than the President's budget request.
