SEN. JOHNSON MEETS WITH EDUCATION LEADERS IN MITCHELL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today met with a cross section of local education leaders in Mitchell to ensure the federal funding he has secured is helping area students continue to strive. Johnson recently worked with members of both parties to pass the Omnibus spending bill, which includes education funding that far exceeds the 2007 level.  
  "In an era of tightening budgets and heightened education standards, it is crucial that local educators have the resources they need to help our children succeed," Johnson said. "My meeting in Mitchell today made clear that the federal funding I have fought to secure is helping local schools in the area and throughout South Dakota provide for our students."
  The Omnibus spending bill passed last month in the Senate includes $59.4 billion in funding for the Department of Education, a $2 billion dollar increase over the Fiscal Year 2007 funding level.
  "I will continue to use my seat on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that educators in local communities throughout South Dakota have the resources they need to provide our students with a quality education," continued Johnson. 
  Johnson is a strong supporter of full funding for critical programs like IDEA and No Child Left Behind, and has worked to sustain funding for these programs so they do not remain an unfunded mandate and burden on the state.
  Johnson was joined at the event by Bob Duffett, President, Dakota Wesleyan University; Chris Paustian, Director, Mitchell Technical Institute; Joe Graves, Superintendent, Mitchell Public Schools; Brian Held, Superintendent, Mitchell Christian School; and Carol Wilant, Principal, John Paul II Elementary School.
