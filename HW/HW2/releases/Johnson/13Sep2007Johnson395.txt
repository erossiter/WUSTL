SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR EAGLE BUTTE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Eagle Butte Volunteer Fire Department will receive a federal grant of $165,000 to purchase a new fire truck. The grant is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
   "It is critical that emergency responders have the resources they need to serve the community. This funding will provide the Eagle Butte Volunteer Fire Department with tools to better serve the people of Dewey and Ziebach counties," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is 'investing in the public good,' and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help people in need of quality emergency health services."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
