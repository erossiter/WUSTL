SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES NURSING EDUCATION, E. COLI RESEARCH FUNDING FOR SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota State University (SDSU) will receive a pair of grants from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) totaling $114,047. One grant will fund E. coli research, the other will fund advanced nursing education. 
  "This funding for South Dakota State highlights South Dakota's position on the forefront of medical research and education," Johnson said. "Funding nursing education and infectious disease research will benefit not only South Dakotans, but all Americans. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  A $42,297 federal grant, will increase funding for SDSU's Advanced Education Nursing Traineeships, which furthers nursing education to the master's or doctoral level. The grant comes from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a division of HHS. According to their website, the HRSA "provides health resources for medically underserved populations." 
  The second federal grant of $71,750 will fund a study of ways to isolate and prevent complications arising from digestive tract E. coli bacterial infection, which is responsible for the death of one million people worldwide annually. The research funding comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a branch of the National Institutes of Health. According to the NIAID's website, the Institute "conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergenic diseases."
