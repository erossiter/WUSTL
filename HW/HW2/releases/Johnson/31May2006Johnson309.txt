SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES OVER $7.73 MILLION IN HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING TO SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson today announced that under the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) South Dakota has received over $7.73 million for this fiscal year to build homeland securities capabilities at the state and local levels. The money will go to multiple departments and agencies throughout South Dakota who have applied to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for funding. 
   "It's important that the Department of Homeland Security recognize the importance of security and safety in all of our states," said Johnson. "Law enforcement across South Dakota plays a vital role in keeping our families safe from harm and these grants recognize that fact."
   Over $7.5 million of the money provided in the grants come from two specific programs: 1) the State Homeland Security Program, which provides assistance to states and territories to prevent, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism; and 2) the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, which supports such prevention activities as information sharing, target hardening, threat recognition, interoperable communications, and interdiction efforts.
   The rest of the provided money, $173,780, comes from the Citizens Corps Program, which promotes citizen preparedness, and engages citizens in all-hazards prevention, protection, response, and recovery.
   "It's important for South Dakota and all Americans to try to prevent emergencies when possible and to prepare for a situation that requires rapid response when necessary," continued Johnson.
   In 2006, DHS' HSGP will award approximately $1.7 billion to states, territories, and urban areas, to prevent, protect against respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies.
