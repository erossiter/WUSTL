GET EDUCATED TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT, LIMIT DAMAGE SHOULD IT HAPPEN
  It can happen in a split second. You could be making an online purchase over an insecure server. Or you could throw out an old credit card bill, forgetting to shred it. It seems like no big deal, but to identity thieves, it's money in the bank. Within seconds your credit card or social security number has been passed along to others for fraudulent use. The worst part is you might not find out for many months, and repairing your credit may take even longer. 
   Identity theft has exploded over the past several years, victimizing over 10 million Americans last year alone. It has cost the financial industry nearly $50 billion in recent years and consumers more than $5 billion in out-of-pocket expenses. 
   The good news is that you can take steps to protect yourself and learn what to do should your identity or credit information be stolen. I became aware of the problem as a member of the Senate Banking Committee. Last weekend in Sioux Falls, I brought together a group of national and local experts for a forum to discuss the crime of identity theft and educate people on ways to protect themselves. 
   Attendees learned important safeguards to help prevent identity theft:
   * Avoid using easily accessible information for passwords or pins (mother's maiden name, birthdate, etc.), 
   * Protect personal information-don't give out your social security number without knowing where it's going and how it will be protected, and 
   * Learn how best to protect your computer-use appropriate firewall software and use only secure transactions when making purchases.
   We also discussed what to do if you suspect you are the victim of identity theft: 
   * Contact the fraud departments of any one of the three major credit bureaus to place a fraud alert on your credit file. 
   * Close the accounts that you know or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. 
   * File a police report. Get a copy of the report to submit to your creditors and others that may require proof of the crime. 
   * File your complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
   It is also critical that you monitor your credit report from time to time. Currently, you can obtain your credit report online for as little as $10. To make it even easier to monitor your credit, I introduced and helped pass legislation this year, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act), that ensures every consumer can receive one free credit report each year starting in 2005.
   This July, I joined President George W. Bush at the White House as he signed the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act (S. 153) into law. The bill increases criminal penalties for identity theft and provides additional resources to the Department of Justice to prosecute this devastating crime. I am a cosponsor of the legislation, which increases prison sentences for committing identity theft, and adds five years to the prison terms of anyone who commits identity theft in order to commit an act of terrorism.
   The federal government is meeting this challenge head-on, working diligently to catch identity thieves. To make sure you and your family do not become victims of identity theft, I recommend taking simple steps to protect yourself. Together, we can stem the spread of identity theft, and ensure that each person's personal information and credit remains their own.
