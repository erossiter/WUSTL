SEN. JOHNSON DENOUNCES SCHWAB'S DOHA COMMENTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) called USTR Schwab's comments on compromising ag subsidies to move forward with negotiations on the stalled World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha talks "simply unacceptable" today. While in Australia, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab announced during trade talks that "[the U.S. is] even prepared to do even more in terms of cutting domestic support than we have on the table."  
   "I hope that the Administration will choose to support producers rather than cutting them off at the knees during trade negotiations." Johnson said. "The Bush Administration is already pushing a 60 percent cut in ag payments as a trade position, and it is simply unacceptable to now propose even deeper cuts to jump start trade talks that have stalled," Johnson said. 
   Existing conflicts over Doha trade talks, which stalled in July, were based largely upon the European Union's objection to agriculture tariff provisions. The Doha effort was launched in 2001 by the WTO, this week's discussion was held in Cairns, Australia.
