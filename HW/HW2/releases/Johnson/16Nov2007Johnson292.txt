SEN. JOHNSON: DEADLINE APPROACHING FOR OVERSEAS HOLIDAY MAILINGS
  With Thanksgiving less than a week away, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today urged South Dakotans interested in sending packages to our troops overseas in time for the holidays to do so via First Class or Priority Mail by December 4, 2007.  
  "As members of our military prepare to spend another Christmas away from their families, let's remember them in our prayers and be ever-thankful for their service," said Johnson. "As the father of a solider, I know how important it is to feel connected to a loved one so far away. Christmas celebrations should not be delayed because of a missed deadline." 
  Smaller packages about the size of a shoebox that weigh less than 20 pounds are recommended. All packages should include the soldier's name, the organization to which they are assigned and their unit number.
  Department of Defense requirements mandate that mail be sent to specific servicemembers, though organizations are in place that would deliver non-specific "Any Servicemember" packages. "Operation USO" (www.usocares.org) provides a soldier with often requested items, including pre-paid worldwide phone cards, sunscreen, and toiletries, along with a personalized message from the donor. Sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, "Operation Uplink" (www.operationuplink.org) also provides soldiers with phone cards, and "Gifts from the Homefront" (http://www.aafes.com/docs/homefront.htm) has gift certificates available that soldiers can redeem at military exchanges. 
  "South Dakotans are so generous, particularly this time of year," continued Johnson. "I encourage those interested in sending packages to our troops overseas to do so by the deadline, so they can share the joys of the season with those who cannot be home for the holidays."
