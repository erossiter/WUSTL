SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR WATERTOWN
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson today announced that the First District Association of Local Governments in Watertown will receive a $52,000 federal grant from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to continue long-term economic development planning in the region. Securing economic development funding is a key part of Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan. 
  "This investment for the First District Association of Local Governments is an investment in the future that will pay dividends for all of South Dakota," Johnson said. "This economic development funding will help strengthen the local economy and make progress on many other issues, including generating additional resources for education, reducing crime rates, and making it easier for people to provide for their families."
  Johnson has continually supported the EDA and economic development in South Dakota as a member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees. 
  The Economic Development Administration, which is a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was established in the 1960s to generate jobs, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas of the United States. EDA assistance is available to rural and urban areas of the nation experiencing high unemployment, low income, or other severe economic distress.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
