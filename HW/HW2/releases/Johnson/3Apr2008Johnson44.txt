SEN. JOHNSON RAISES QUESTIONS OF FEDERAL REGULATORS, WALL STREET FIRMS ON CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today raised questions of representatives from the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission during a Senate Banking Committee hearing looking into the recent turmoil in the credit markets. Specifically, Johnson wanted to know more details on the Federal Reserve's recent move to allow JP Morgan Chase to purchase Bear Stearns. 
   "The hearing today regarding the current turmoil in the U.S credit market is timely as Congress and regulators attempt to restore confidence, liquidity, and transparency in the market," Johnson said. "We should consider the appropriateness of offering help to Wall Street firms while Americans face increasing health care costs, gas prices and mortgage payments."
   Johnson previously discussed the Bear Stearns purchase and subsequent actions taken by the Federal Reserve in a private meeting with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on March 19, a few days after the bailout was announced.
   In the hearing, Johnson sought clarification about the Bear Stearns situation prior to the buyout's approval and posed the question of what situation would prompt similar actions in the future. Recent reports set the losses in the credit market from subprime mortgages, as well as from loan commitments and obligations related to leveraged corporate buyouts, at over $200 billion.
   "I applaud Chairman Dodd's steps to exercise the committee's oversight and investigatory functions to examine the issues surrounding the purchase of Bear Stearns," Johnson added. "As Chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee, I continue to work to ensure the safety and soundness of our financial institutions."
