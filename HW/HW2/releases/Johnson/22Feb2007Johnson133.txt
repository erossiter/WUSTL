SEN. JOHNSON STAFF WILL TOUR CUSTER, MEET WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LEADERS
  A staff member representing Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will tour Custer and visit with economic development leaders on Friday, February 23, 2007. Johnson spoke to the Custer Chamber of Commerce on November 9, 2006, and was encouraged by the progress Custer is making, and their role in the emerging Black Hills "technology corridor."  
   In his speech to the chamber, Johnson discussed his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. In the speech, Johnson complimented the efforts made by the Chamber and businesses "to harness the tourism prospects of the area, while working to create friendly areas for the technology sector to grow. This diversification of industry offers a lot of potential growth for Custer and the surrounding area, which the Chamber and its partners have already begun to explore." 
   The four pillars, or strategies, of Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
