SEN. JOHNSON DISAPPOINTED IN PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE BUDGET PLANS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today said he is extremely disappointed in the President's plans to make significant cuts to health care programs South Dakotans rely on. The White House released the Administration's 2007 budget proposal last week, and Congress will now begin putting together their own fiscal blueprint with which to operate the government. 
   "This budget is wrong for South Dakota and our priorities, putting the needs of the wealthy in front of the needs of every day Americans and our future health as a nation. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to health care, and cutting critical programs is simply short-sighted," Johnson said. 
   MEDICARE: 
   This budget proposes $35.9 billion in Medicare cuts over five years. These cuts reduce payments to health care providers. New estimates find that in South Dakota, over a 5-year period: 
   * Hospital inpatient and outpatient payments would be reduced in the state by $31.124 million. The total U.S. number is $13.45 billion over five years.
   * Home health reimbursements would be frozen at 2005 levels, reducing payments in South Dakota by roughly $3.9 million. This cut would come on top of the recently passed budget cutting bill for 2006, which will reduce home health payments in South Dakota by about $2.26 million over five years.
   * Skilled Nursing Facility reimbursements would not be provided an inflationary update, costing South Dakota nursing homes about $1.86 million. 
   * Hospice payments in South Dakota would be reduced by roughly $596,000.
   MEDICAID:
   The President's 2007 budget also proposes an additional $17 billion in cuts to Medicaid--cuts that follow the enactment of $6.9 billion in Medicaid cuts that were part of the recently passed budget cutting bill for 2006. These cuts will be devastating to local community pharmacies and reduce access to some health care services for low-income people in need. 
   HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES: 
   The President's budget also cuts discretionary programs at the Department of Health and Human Services by $1.5 billion. These cuts chip away at important rural health programs that ensure that South Dakotans have access to care, and take several steps backward with regard to important health advancements, inadequately funding medical research.
   RESEARCH:
   * The President's 2007 budget proposal would cut funding for 18 of the 19 institutes for 2007, including research for cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Funding for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) would be reduced by $40 million. This cut means that the National Cancer Institute would award 80 fewer new, competing research grants in FY07 than it did in FY06. 
   * The President's budget also cuts the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) cancer prevention programs by $3 million. That includes a $1.4 million cut to the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. This program currently serves just 1 in 5 eligible women. A $1.4 million cut translates into 4,000 fewer women getting screened.
