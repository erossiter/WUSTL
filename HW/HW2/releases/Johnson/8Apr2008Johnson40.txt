SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON SUSPENSION OF TROOP WITHDRAWAL
  As General Petraeus briefs Congress this afternoon, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement: 
   General Petraeus said today that the troop withdrawal has been indefinitely suspended. Our troops have been asked to return to Iraq again and again, some have served four deployments to the region already. This is costing us dearly. In South Dakota many in the Guard have already served two tours while others are preparing to go back.
   This war has lasted longer than World War II and is costing us $10-12 billion each month as we face an increasingly tight budget situation here at home.
   We were supposed to be buying time for the Iraqi government to make political gains, but this indefinite suspension leads me to believe that our soldiers are the ones doing all the work in Iraq. It is time for an increased focus on diplomatic efforts, for the Iraqis to provide their own security, and for U.S. troops to transition out of harm's way.
