SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $125,000 IN FUNDING TO YANKTON SIOUX TRIBE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Yankton Sioux Tribe will receive $125,000. The funding will be used to fund a South Dakota Tribal Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.  
   "I am pleased that the Yankton Sioux Tribe will be getting this funding," Johnson said. "We need to make sure that people are getting the medical care they need. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   The $125,000 was awarded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The grant goes to the Yankton Sioux Tribe for the South Dakota Tribal Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. The Yankton Sioux Tribe will use this grant in conjunction with the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health Board Northern Plains Epi Center.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
