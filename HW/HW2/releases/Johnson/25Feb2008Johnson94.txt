BUTTE COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Butte County as his February 2008 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website at http://johnson.senate.gov. 
   "Butte County has a rich history and wonderful recreational sites, and that makes it a wonderful place to live and visit," Johnson said. "I am proud to have helped the county on many issues, from improving the Newell Museum to funding crucial Head Start programs."
   Butte County was founded in 1883 and is home to the city of Belle Fourche and the towns of Newell and Nisland. Butte County serves as the crossroad connecting Montana and Wyoming to South Dakota's border. The Tri-State Museum in Belle Fourche acknowledges the union of the three states and the heritage of the county. 
   Johnson is a strong advocate of homeland security and economic development grant programs that help our small communities continue to grow. He was proud to announce funding for programs in Butte County ranging from Badlands Head Start to federal funding for the improvement of the Belle Fourche Airport. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," Johnson said. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments -- they are truly great places."
