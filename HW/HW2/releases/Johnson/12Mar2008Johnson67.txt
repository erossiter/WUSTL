SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO GIVE NATIVE VETERANS A VOICE ON CAPITOL HILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) introduced legislation today to grant the National American Indian Veterans Association a federal charter, which would allow the organization to represent Native American veterans before the Congress and the Administration.  
  "Anyone who puts their life on the line for this country deserves to have their concerns heard before Congress and the Administration," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "Native Americans have the highest per-capita rate of military service of any ethnic group in the nation. It is time they have a voice on Capitol Hill."
  A federal charter does not grant any special privileges, but will provide the Native American Veterans Association the same status other veterans' organizations enjoy. Federally-chartered veterans' organizations often have members who testify before Congress and provide input to legislators. Organizations that currently have a charter include the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.
  Johnson supported this legislation in the 108th Congress and introduced it in the 109th Congress. In 2004, the bill passed the Senate but failed to pass the House of Representatives before Congress adjourned.
  Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representative last year by Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (D-SD).
