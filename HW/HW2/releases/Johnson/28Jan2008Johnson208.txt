SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON CONFIRMATION OF SCHAEFER AS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, released the following statement as the Senate confirmed former North Dakota Governor Ed Schaefer as Secretary of Agriculture today: 
   I want to congratulate Secretary Schaefer on his confirmation by the Senate today. The Secretary is from our nation's heartland, and he will surely have his hands full as America's farmers and ranchers look to him to be a strong voice at the USDA. As the Farm Bill reauthorization moves ahead in Congress, I will also use my seat on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to pursue meaningful funding for promised programs such as mandatory COOL, Rural Development, and a strong agriculture disaster program. I look forward to working with Secretary Schafer at this critical time to make sure our nation's producers are put before partisan politics.
