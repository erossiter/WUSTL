SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEMORIAL DAY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding Memorial Day: 
   "As we South Dakotans celebrate the Memorial Day weekend, our hearts go out to the family and friends of those personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of a grateful nation. Our servicemen and women put their lives on the line for our nation. It is important that we remember the true meaning of this day."
   "We owe them our thoughts, prayers, and gratitude, but it doesn't end there. We should honor our commitments to veterans' health care. Congress should pass the mandatory spending bill to end the annual tug-of-war over veterans' health care - a bill I was proud to introduce."
   In addition to The Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, S. 331, Johnson has introduced legislation to address gaps in military retiree health care, The Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act, S.407, and a bill to honor and raise awareness of veterans disabled for life, The American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act, S. 633.
   Johnson is spending the Memorial Day weekend with his son Brooks and his wife, Naida. Army Staff Sergeant Brooks Johnson served in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and is currently serving as an Army recruiter in Dixon, Illinois.
