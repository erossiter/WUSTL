COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS FUNDING PASSES SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced funding levels approved by the Senate Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee for the Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill. The bill, which includes $4.15 million in South Dakota projects Johnson requested, now moves to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for consideration on Thursday. 
  "This bill includes funding to enhance local law enforcement efforts in South Dakota and increase scientific research across the country," Johnson said. "This is an 'investment in the public good' like those I describe in my Hometown Prosperity Plan, and I appreciate Chairman Byrd and Subcommittee Chairman Mikulski's inclusion of so many of my priorities for South Dakota in this bill." 
   S.D. Projects Johnson Secured in the Senate Report:
   * $400,000 to the South Dakota Children's Home Society in Sioux Falls to assist the Children's Home Society's efforts to care for at-risk children and victims of abuse, by funding Family Support Services, Forensic Interviewing Centers, and Children's Inn Emergency Shelter Operations.
   * $100,000 for A Child Is Missing (ACIM), which is a sophisticated satellite mapping technology program and an advanced, telephony computer system that can place 1,000 emergency telephone calls at the request of law enforcement every 60 seconds to residents and businesses in an area where a missing child or adult was last seen. This funding will expand the service in South Dakota. 
   * $500,000 for law enforcement, court, and detention equipment and operations of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Criminal Justice System. 
   * $1 million for law enforcement, court, and detention equipment and operations of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Criminal Justice System.

   * $200,000 for technology upgrades to the 911 system on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.
   * $500,000 for law enforcement, court, and detention equipment and operations of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Criminal Justice System in South Dakota and North Dakota.

   Funding for specific programs that affect South Dakota include:
   * $250 million for the Economic Development Administration, which provides funding for a variety of economic development projects in South Dakota, as well as economic development planning activities across the state. The recommended funding level is approximately $47 million above the amount proposed by the President.
   * $550 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, which funds grants for law enforcement equipment, training and to hire more officers. The President had proposed to zero this program out in previous budgets.
   * $80 million to state and local law enforcement programs to combat methamphetamine production and distribution, to target drug "hot spots" and to remove and dispose of hazardous materials at clandestine methamphetamine labs. 
   * $117 million for the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. This program helps South Dakota Universities to win a greater share of competitive grant funds awarded by the National Science Foundation, the agency that is currently considering the Homestake Mine in Lead as a potential site to build a deep underground lab. The recommended funding level is $10 million above the amount proposed by the President for the agency.
