SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES COLOME STUDENT APPOINTED TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today extended congratulations to Kristi Miner of Colome on her recent offer of an appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Johnson nominated Miner to the service academy in December of 2007. 
  "This is a tremendous opportunity for outstanding students like Kristi. She has proven herself to be a responsible, disciplined individual with high academic abilities and strong leadership skills. These young people represent the best and the brightest of South Dakota. I wish them good luck and congratulate them as they begin their service to our country," said Johnson.
  "We live in the greatest county in the world, home of the American dream and the land of opportunity, and I would like the chance to give something back by becoming an officer in the United States Air Force," Miner said in her application to Johnson. 
  She is the daughter of Kevin and Judy Miner, and attends Colome High School. As the president of the Student Council, a member of the National Honor Society and with more than 150 hours of community service, Miner has demonstrated a commitment to her school and the community. 
  In order to be nominated for a service academy, young men and women must be of good character and must meet strict requirements in academics, physical aptitude, medical fitness, character, and leadership potential. Applicants must also meet the minimum medical requirements of the respective academies which are reviewed by the Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB). Candidates must also receive a nomination from a nominating source, one of which is through a member of their Congressional delegation.
  The service academies notify students who have qualified for appointments on a rolling basis. Johnson nominated 18 highly-qualified South Dakota students to the military service academies this year.
