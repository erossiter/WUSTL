FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced Senate passage of flood insurance reform legislation.  
 The bill, cosponsored by Johnson, extends the National Flood Insurance Program through September 30, 2008 and makes some changes to the existing program.
   "Natural disasters such as floods may strike at any time, damaging homes and crops," said Johnson. "South Dakota is seeing as much as 8 inches of rain when the ground was already wet. It is important that we extend the National Flood Insurance Program to help protect our communities in the event of catastrophe."
   In addition to extending the National Flood Insurance Program through September 2008, the bill:
   * Establishes a new $40 million pilot program to target "severe repetitive loss properties"-properties that have been flood numerous times and are the largest drain on the National Flood Insurance Program.
   * Changes the existing program to allow an additional $20 million to be used for the basic mitigation program. 
   * Clarifies that "Increased Cost of Compliance" funds can be used as a match for mitigation funds and that a community's definition of "substantially damaged" applies even if different from the federal definition.
   * Requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with administrative processing of claims related to Hurricane Isabel. 
   The Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, S. 2238, passed late yesterday. The bill was sponsored by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY).
   "While eastern South Dakota is getting too much rain, much of western South Dakota still faces severe drought. I will continue to push for the needed assistance," Johnson said.
