SEN. JOHNSON SPEAKS TO WOMEN'S VETERANS CONFERENCE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) addressed the Women's Veterans Conference at the Sioux Falls VFW today. In his remarks, Johnson expressed his respect and gratitude for the service and sacrifice of female veterans through the armed services. 
   "Too often we overlook the heroic sacrifices made by the women who have served in our military," Johnson said. "Like their male counterparts, Congress must work to ensure that our women soldiers and veterans have access to the benefits they have earned and deserve." 
   Approximately 100 women attended the conference, which included veterans from World War II through the current conflict in Iraq.
   Johnson has worked, through his seat on the Appropriations Committee, to fully fund programs for veterans run through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and has asked for mandatory funding so that the Department can offer the best service possible to veterans. 
   "I believe caring for our all our nation's veterans is a continuing cost of war that we need to take responsibility for, and we should never tell our veterans there aren't sufficient funds available to address their urgent needs," Johnson said.
   In August, Johnson received the Air Force Sergeants Association's top honor, the L. Mendel Rivers Award of Excellence. In February, Johnson was sworn in to his appointment to the United States Air Force Academy's Board of Visitors, which overseas the Academy's practices and is committed to maintaining oversight to ensure female cadets are respected on campus.
