MEADE COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that he has selected Meade County as his October 2007 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website.  
   "From the annual Sturgis motorcycle rally to the 28th Bomber wing, Meade County is an important part of South Dakota's history and future," Johnson said. "I am proud to have helped the people of Meade County on many issues, ranging from recreational improvements to continued economic growth."
   Meade County was founded in 1889 and is home to the city of Sturgis and the towns of Mud Butte and Elm Springs. The county hosts the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which draws nearly half a million visitors each year.
  Ellsworth Air Force Base, which is headquarters for the 28th Bomber Group, is also located in Meade County. Johnson, along with his colleagues, successfully fought to keep the base from closure in 2005. Since that time, Johnson has used his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to provide funding for the facility, including $14 million dollars for new family unit houses at the base.
   Johnson has also worked to ensure that communities across South Dakota, including those in Meade County, are safe. Most recently, Johnson announced $104,870 in federal funding from the Department of Justice to reduce gang violence in the area through education and training.
  "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places," Johnson said.
