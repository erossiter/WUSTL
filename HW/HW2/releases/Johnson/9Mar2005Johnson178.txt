SEN. JOHNSON ADVOCATES CONSULTATION ON TRUST REFORM DURING MEETING WITH INTERIOR SECRETARY NORTON
  At a meeting with Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton earlier today, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) encouraged her to find a speedy solution to the trust reform issue through continued communication with Indian Country.
   "I was encouraged to hear that Secretary Norton was reaching out to members of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to address trust reform. I assured her that all sides need to be brought to the table to meet the needs of tribes at the local level. Our tribes need flexibility and funding assurances," Johnson said, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. 
   Johnson has said that the Great Plains Region is uniquely affected by trust reform as vast amounts of trust land are located in the region. 
   Johnson has been a leading advocate for trust reform during the past several Congresses. Last year, Johnson initiated a request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct an expansive investigation into the Office of Special Trustee (OST). As the GAO continues the investigation, Johnson has worked with the group to make the report more manageable. The report is expected this year.
