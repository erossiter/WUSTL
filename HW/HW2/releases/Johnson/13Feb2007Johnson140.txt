SEN. JOHNSON: LOAN MEANS OPPORTUNITY, JOB GROWTH FOR NORTHEAST SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Northeast South Dakota Economic Corporation (NESDEC) in Roberts County will receive a low-interest federal loan for $750,000 to help create or retain an estimated 115 jobs. The funds will be used to make loans to new and expanding businesses in the local area. The loan is an Intermediary Relending Program loan provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   Johnson has said in the past that "it is important that communities get the assistance they require to make sure their business needs are met. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
