SEN. JOHNSON TO JOIN PRESIDENT BUSH, FAMILY OF WOODROW KEEBLE AT WHITE HOUSE CEREMONY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) will join President George W. Bush and members of the North and South Dakota congressional delegation at a White House ceremony this afternoon, where the President will posthumously award Master Sgt. Woodrow Wilson Keeble with the Medal of Honor. The award will be accepted by members of Keeble's family. Johnson has long worked to secure the Medal of Honor for Keeble, but not nearly as long as Keeble's family has had to wait for this honor.  
  I am honored to join with members of the North and South Dakota congressional delegation, President Bush and the family of Woodrow Keeble at the White House ceremony this afternoon. Woodrow Keeble has made our state and nation proud. Woody was a warrior who did not seek public recognition for his heroic efforts, but is greatly deserving of this award. I congratulate his family on receiving this rare, extraordinary honor. 
  Later today, Johnson will enter a statement in the Congressional Record honoring Woodrow Keeble's service to our nation. The statement can be viewed online on his Senate website at http://johnson.senate.gov/newsroom/keeble/3-3-08%20Keeble%20Record%20Statement.doc. 
  Johnson's website also features a new, special section honoring Keeble, which includes in-depth information about his actions and a 1954 affidavit from a soldier who served along side him. It also details Johnson's congressional actions in trying to secure him the Medal of Honor. It can be viewed online at http://johnson.senate.gov/newsroom/keeble/keeble.cfm.
