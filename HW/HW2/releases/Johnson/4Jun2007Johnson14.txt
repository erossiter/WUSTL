OFFICE OF SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES YANKTON STUDENT TO WASHINGTON
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Ryan Cwach of Yankton, South Dakota to Johnson's Washington, DC office. Cwach graduated from Yankton High School in 2004 and will receive undergraduate degrees in Political Science and Economics from the University of South Dakota in May of 2008. 
   "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson said. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital." 
   "I don't really grasp the inner workings of the Senate, so I hope to gain a knowledge of that through this internship," said Cwach, last year's president of USD's College Democrats.
   Cwach, the son of a Yankton-area farmer, also plans to explore the nation's capital during his summer in Washington.
   The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with Senator Johnson and his staff.
   College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's internship program this summer. College credits or a stipend are available. To apply for a state office internship, please call toll-free at 1-800-537-0025.
