SEN. JOHNSON: MORE THAN 260 AMENDMENTS WEIGH FARM BILL DOWN
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) comments on an effort to end debate on the Farm Bill and take steps to get a farm bill in place this year: 
  The Farm Bill shouldn't have to withstand the Herculean weight of more than 260 amendments, including ones on the Exxon Valdez, medical malpractice, immigration and taxes. This Farm Bill is very good, but not perfect. That is why I cosponsored several amendments on issues like farm payment program caps and a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The goal has always been to debate and vote on relevant amendments. 
  However, there are some that want to grind this bill to a halt, and I am not willing to let a good bill slip away from our producers because more than 260 amendments, many unrelated to ag policy, weigh it down. Enough is enough. Our ag producers deserve better than partisan bickering. I will support the cloture vote because our ag producers deserve to know what the new farm bill contain so they can plan accordingly. 
  An RFS can and should be part of the Energy Bill that has to still be passed this year. The Energy Bill is currently being held hostage by Republicans from the oil region, including Texas. It's time that bill goes to conference and gets passed. I spoke with Senator Reid today and he is committed to seeing an energy bill with an RFS passed this year. 
  We can accomplish all of our goals if people work together. Americans are tired of political theater. They want results and common sense. Surely we can find solutions that produce results.
