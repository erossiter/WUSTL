SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $346,500 FOR WAKPA SICA HISTORICAL SOCIETY
  Sen. Tim Johnson announced today that the Wakpa Sica Historical Society in Ft. Pierre will receive a $346,500 federal earmark. The funding will be used for Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place, which will house the Sioux Nation Supreme Court and serve as a cultural center with the goal of healing past differences between Natives and non-Natives.  
   "I am pleased to work with the Wakpa Sica Historical Society in their efforts to complete the Reconciliation Place," Johnson said. "I know the funding for this project will enable South Dakotans, both Native and non-Native, to reconcile differences that still remain between them and work to protect the artifacts and culture that were the foundation of Plains society." 
   The funds were appropriated in an earmark Johnson helped to secure in the 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   Earmarks are secured by members of Congress to support high-priority projects in their home states. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
