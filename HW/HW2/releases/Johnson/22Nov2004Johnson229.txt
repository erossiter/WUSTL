SOUTH DAKOTA DELEGATION ANNOUNCES ENERGY, WATER SPENDING LEVELS
  Sens. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Rep. Stephanie Herseth (D-SD)today announced funding levels for South Dakota's water projects contained in the Energy and Water spending bill. The bill passed the House and Senate as part of the Omnibus spending bill late Saturday. 
   "Providing safe, reliable drinking water to South Dakota communities remains one of my top priorities," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This is the highest level of total funding we've ever secured for our water projects. This funding will allow Lewis & Clark to move forward with construction. This funding will allow Mid Dakota to finish within the next year. Also, this bill contains critical funding to protect our communities from flooding."
   "South Dakota is home to some of the world's largest drinking water projects. I am proud to have worked to secure the federal funding necessary to move these efforts forward," Daschle said. "From the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System to Mid Dakota to improvements for tribal water programs, South Dakota is blessed with so many examples of the importance of access to safe, reliable drinking water. These projects will enhance the quality of life for these communities."
   Representative Herseth said, "This funding represents another important step for our state's crucial water projects. For Lewis and Clark, securing more than the $17 million in the president's budget is a significant victory, though we still have a long way to go. I'll continue to work in the 109th Congress to ensure that South Dakota has a safe and abundant supply of drinking water, and a key part of the infrastructure for economic growth throughout the state."
   The bill includes funding for the following South Dakota projects at the request of the delegation:
   * $18.75 million for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System 
   * $17.0 million for the Mid-Dakota RWS. This funding should allow the project to be finished in 2005.
   * $25.282 million for Mni Wiconi for construction. $6.254 million for operations and maintenance. 
   * $2.25 million for Perkins County RWS 
   * $4.038 million for the Pierre Flood Mitigation Plan. This funding will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to floodproof homes affected by Missouri River dams in the Pierre/Ft. Pierre area
   * $5.75 million for Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and Missouri River Mitigation. 
   * $2.5 million for operations and maintenance. The funding will allow for wildlife, recreation, and cultural enhancement and mitigation projects to compensate for flooded lands as a result of the Pick-Sloan Flood Control Act and construction of the Missouri River dams. 
   * $237,000 for the Watertown Flood Control Project
   * $500,000 for the James River Water Development District Environmental Impact Statement

   Each of the projects will be subject to an across-the-board cut of .83%, which the White House mandated.
