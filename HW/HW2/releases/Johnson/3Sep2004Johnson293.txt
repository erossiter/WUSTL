SOUTH DAKOTA DELEGATION INVITES YOUNG PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING SERVICE ACADEMY TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS BY OCTOBER 31
  Sen. Tom Daschle, Sen. Tim Johnson, and Rep. Stephanie Herseth are encouraging young people interested in being nominated to one of the four U.S. Service Academies to apply separately to each office by October 31. 
   South Dakota residents between the ages of 17 and 23 can apply to any of the four service academies if they meet the eligibility requirements in leadership, physical aptitude, scholarship, and character. The four services academies are the Military Academy at West Point, NY; the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland; the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado; and the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York.
   "Many talented young men and women from South Dakota apply for limited appointment spaces at our nation's distinguished service academies, and deciding whom to recommend is never an easy process," Daschle said. "We put the October 31 deadline in place to ensure that the academy advisory committee will have ample time to review all applications and make the most informed recommendations possible."
   "I am proud to see a strong level of interest from some of South Dakota's finest young men and women every year," said Johnson. "So many of our young people choose to pursue a role in our nation's defense, and I expect this year will be the same. I am always proud to nominate students to America's service academies."
   "This is a tremendous opportunity for South Dakota's young people who are interested in attending one of the country's four Service Academies. I enthusiastically encourage anyone who is interested to contact my office or one of the Senators' offices, and submit their application," Representative Herseth said. 
   Each office establishes an outside advisory group of South Dakotans with various military backgrounds to make final recommendations to the academies by January 31. The academies will make offers of appointment next spring.
   Interested applicants should contact the delegation's Sioux Falls offices: Senator Daschle, (605) 334-9596 or (800) 424-9094; Senator Johnson, (605) 332-8896 or (800) 537-0025; and Representative Herseth, (605) 367-8371 or (866) 371-8747.
