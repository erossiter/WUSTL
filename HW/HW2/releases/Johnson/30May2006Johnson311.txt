SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $208,781 GRANT FOR RED CLOUD INDIAN SCHOOL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that AmeriCorps has been awarded $208,781 for the Red Cloud Indian School. This money will be used for a tutoring and mentoring program at the Red Cloud Indian School. 
   "I am very pleased that AmeriCorps is getting this funding. This program will be a great help to the Red Cloud Indian School," Johnson said. "We need to make sure that children have all the resources they require to succeed and this program will help to do just that."
   The money for this grant is provided by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Red Cloud Indian School received an AmeriCorps South Dakota grant. This grant allows members of AmeriCorps to work in schools as mentors and tutors in return for funding for their education.
   AmeriCorp grants cover the costs of operating the program, including living expenses for AmeriCorps members to serve in positions of direct service, volunteer mobilization, and capacity building of small community organizations. AmeriCorps members who complete their term of service will receive an education award of $4,725 for one year of full-time service.
