SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES APPROVAL OF $248,000 FOR THE DAHL FINE ARTS CENTER IN RAPID CITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced the approval of $248,000 in federal funding for renovation of the Dahl Fine Arts Center in Rapid City. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson helped secure this funding in a FY 2005 appropriations bill. 
   "The Dahl Fine Arts Center is a tremendous asset for the Rapid City area," Johnson said. "This funding represents an investment in both the arts and the overall community. I will continue to do all I can at the federal level to partner with local leaders to find resources for projects that benefit South Dakota communities. It's important that we invest in the public good."
   The Dahl Arts Center, which opened in 1974, houses contemporary visual arts, community theater and arts education. The center is administered by the Rapid City Arts Council, under contract with the city of Rapid City. The facility contains a 170 seat theater, three admission-free visual arts galleries and classroom spaces. More than 60,000 people visit the Dahl or take part in community arts outreach events each year, according to the Center's website.
   Earmarks, like this one, are grants secured by members of Congress, enabling them to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member of Congress' ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, Senator Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
