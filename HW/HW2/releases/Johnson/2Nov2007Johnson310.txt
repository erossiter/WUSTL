SEN. JOHNSON SENDS MESSAGE OF SUPPORT, ENCOURAGEMENT TO DEEP UNDERGROUND SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING LABORATORY MEETING
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) sent a strong message of support and optimism to the National Academy of Sciences meeting held today in Washington, DC to discuss the National Science Foundation's (NSF) plans for construction of a Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL).  
  "This potential new federal facility would have the capacity to generate new knowledge with significance to the entire nation, as well as the international community, and I am proud that South Dakota can provide a suitable site for such important work," Johnson said in a message. "I am hopeful that my seats on the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee will enable me to play a key role in this task."
  Scientists with an interest in the facility, representatives from the NSF, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and elected officials were invited to take part in the meeting. Representatives from some of the South Dakota universities attended, along with the members of the Homestake lab team.
  In July, the the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced that Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota was the best site for a Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). With that announcement came the pledge of a $15 million federal award over three years so that the Homestake team can further refine the plans involved in developing this lab. The project must still compete with other NSF research projects for federal funding, and then receive approval from Congress and the President.
