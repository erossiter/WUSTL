SEN. JOHNSON THANKS CHAIRMAN CRAWFORD FOR TESTIFYING AT INDIAN GAMING HEARING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today thanked James "JC" Crawford, Chairman of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation, for testifying at a hearing regarding the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA).  
   Chairman Crawford discussed the impact gaming and the IGRA have had on the Lake Traverse Reservation, including lower unemployment, an opportunity for a higher level of education and increased housing options. 
   "Gaming promotes tribal economic development, self-sufficiency and strong tribal governments," said Johnson. "I would like to thank Chairman Crawford for sharing his thoughts with the Indian Affairs Committee. Hearing from people who experience Indian Gaming first hand provides the best possible insight for policymakers." 
   IGRA was enacted in 1988 to provide uniform regulation of Indian gaming. Since its enactment, Indian gaming has become and $18.5 billion activity. 
   On a separate matter, Senator Johnson also notified Chairman Crawford that the tribe will receive $40,000 in funding for economic development planning. 
   "As a member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and Committee on Appropriations, I consider funding for economic development in Indian Country to be one of my top priorities," said Johnson. "Investing in economic development initiatives in Indian Country creates a ripple effect throughout the entire state- it is good for Native Americans and good for South Dakota." 
   The funding is provided by the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration's Planning Assistance program. The program assists community organizations with long term planning efforts. This is the second year the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe has been awarded this grant.
