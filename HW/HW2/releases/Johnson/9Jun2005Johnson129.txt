SENATE COMMITTEE PASSES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which he serves, passed the Interior funding bill for 2006. The bill contains $26.257 billion in federal spending for forest, wildlife, and public lands programs. The bill is smaller than last year's by approximately $760 million, but $98 million more than the House version, which passed on May 19th.  
   "This bill includes funding for a number of projects important to South Dakota. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight to fund South Dakota's priorities," Johnson said. 
   - $235 million for Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT), an $8 million increase over FY'05. 
   - $72 million for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants; $6 million directed to the Tribal Wildlife Grant program. Total funding allotment is a $3 million increase over FY'05.
   - $1.748 billion for National Park Service Operations Account, a $60 million increase over 2005. 
   - $39.5 million for the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, a $1.5 million increase over 2005.
   - $6.5 million for Water Resources Research Institutes, of which $92,000 provides direct research funds to South Dakota State University.
   - $30 million for Land and Water Conservation Fund stateside grants, a significant decrease compared to the $91.2 million approved by Congress in FY '05. President Bush has requested that this program be zeroed out this year, suggesting only $1.587 million to complete pre-existing projects. 
   - The bill provides $1.745 billion for Forest Service wildland fire management, an increase of $300 million over the president's budget request.
