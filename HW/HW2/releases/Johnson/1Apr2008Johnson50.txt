SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $317,647 FOR SOUTH DAKOTA COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Northeast South Dakota Community Action Program will receive a federal grant of $317,647 through the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The funding will be used to improve economic conditions in the area by helping low income individuals build personal assets. 
   In February, Johnson wrote a letter to the director of the Administration for Children and Families in support of this funding.
   "This funding for Northeast South Dakota Community Action Program will provide resources to local South Dakotans who are facing significant economic challenges. I am pleased that such a worthy organization will receive this funding," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help people of South Dakota."
   The Northeast South Dakota Community Action Program is a non-profit agency serving 17 counties in South Dakota, including Brown, Campbell, Hand, Hughes, Roberts, and Walworth. The funds will provide technical assistance to recipients, and allow them to expand services through housing, community facilities, and community and economic development programs. The funding will assist low-income people in becoming economically self-sufficient by teaching them about economic and consumer issues.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
