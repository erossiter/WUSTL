SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $400,000 IN FUNDING TO HELP FIGHT AND PREVENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will receive a $400,000 federal grant from the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women (OVW) to help prevent domestic violence and sexual assault against women.  
  "It is my hope this funding for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will expand the resources available to victims of domestic violence," Johnson said. "We must do everything we can to prevent domestic violence and provide communities in South Dakota and across the nation with the resources necessary to help victims of crime." 
  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, located in north-central South Dakota, will use the funding to provide direct advocacy and supportive services to victims of violent crime, as well as assist victims with emergency rent, utilities, food, clothing, and daycare. They will also establish a crisis hotline for easy access to crisis intervention services and information.
