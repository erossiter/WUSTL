SEN. JOHNSON TOURS ABERDEEN WITH CITY LEADERS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson met with local leaders and took an economic development tour of Aberdeen today. The tour included updates on Molded Fiber Glass, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Northern Beef Packers construction site, Heartland Grain Fuels, HAPI Homes, Inc., and several new housing developments.  
  "It is wonderful to see the growth and development Aberdeen has experienced first hand and I am grateful that Mayor Levsen and local civic leaders could update me on city's progress during today's tour," Johnson said. 
  Johnson secured a $196,000 earmark for Aberdeen's Civic Arena Renovation in the Omnibus spending measure passed by Congress in December. Johnson was also able to insert legislative language into that bill to protect the Aberdeen Post Office for several months from the post office realignment process, and continues to monitor that federal issue.
  "The Civic Arena Renovation is a topic I was looking forward to being briefed on, because I was able to secure funding for the project in the coming year's federal spending bill," Johnson added. "Arenas like the Civic Arena contribute to life in a city, and the effort to modernize this facility will pay long-term dividends for Aberdeen."
  Mike Levsen, Mayor of Aberdeen, Jim Barringer, Vice President of Aberdeen Development Corporation, Julie Johnson, Executive Director of "Absolutely Aberdeen!," Jeff Mitchell, Executive Director of HAPI Homes, Inc., Gail Ogdahl, Executive Director of Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, Dave Osborn, the Aberdeen Airport Manager were among the leaders who took part in Johnson's tour. 
  After the tour, Johnson spent some time in Aberdeen before continuing on to Rapid City.
