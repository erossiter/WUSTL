SEN. JOHNSON VISITS BROOKINGS BOYS, GIRLS CLUB
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) toured the Brookings Boys and Girls Club today in his first visit since securing $400,000 in federal funding for the project and attending the joyous groundbreaking two years ago. Johnson, who was scheduled to visit the facility in January of 2007, is a strong advocate of afterschool programs. 
  "It is heartwarming to see the Boys and Girls Club in action and serving the children of Brookings," said Johnson. "The facility is a strong testament to what federal funding can do for our local communities. I am proud to have used my seat on the Appropriations Committee to bring home resources that will allow South Dakota's youth to continue to thrive." 
  A member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson fought to secure $400,000 to build the facility as part of the 2006 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill.
  Johnson is a member of the Senate Afterschool Caucus, which advocates for adequate funding to provide for high-quality afterschool programs. Johnson has also fought to adequately fund federal grant programs to grow local communities as well as projects like the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program.
  "Our state has one of the highest rates of two person working households in the country, and access to afterschool care is a necessity. High-quality afterschool programs like those at the Brookings Boys and Girls Club provide a safe and healthy place for kids to go until the parents get home from work," continued Johnson. 
  Johnson was joined on the tour by Vanessa Merhib, Executive Director of the Brookings Boys and Girls Club.
