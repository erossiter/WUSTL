SEN. JOHNSON TRANSFERRED TO IN-PATIENT REHABILITATION UNIT AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following: 
   Sen. Tim Johnson has been transferred to the in-patient rehabilitation unit at The George Washington University Hospital where he will be participating in aggressive therapy. "Yesterday, Senator Johnson underwent an MRI which showed that his speech centers were spared of injury. This is confirmed by the fact that he is following commands and has started to say words," said Vivek Deshmukh, MD, neurosurgeon. 
   Doctors say it is common for there to be a delay in speech returning as the blood is reabsorbed after the initial hemorrhage. 
   Johnson is currently being weaned off the tracheostomy tube that remains in his neck.
   "The fact that Tim is beginning to use words is remarkable as is his strength and determination. He even maintains his sense of humor when I share emails about his grandsons' adventures," said Barb Johnson, wife of Senator Tim Johnson.
