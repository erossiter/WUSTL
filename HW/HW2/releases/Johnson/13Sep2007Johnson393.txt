SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CANGLESKA SHELTER
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today the Cangleska Shelter in Shannon County will receive a federal grant of $55,000 to purchase security fencing. The grant is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
   "It is critical that the Cangleska shelter has the resources it needs to protect and assist the women and children who reside there," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help people in need of quality emergency health services."
  The Cangleska shelter serves the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and houses approximately 450 women and children every year.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
