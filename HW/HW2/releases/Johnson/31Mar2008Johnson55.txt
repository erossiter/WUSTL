SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA TO RECEIVE $257,021 TO STUDY HEART, VASCULAR DISEASES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the University of South Dakota (USD) will receive a $257,021 federal grant to study heart and cardiovascular disease to develop new forms of treatment and prevention. 
   "This type of funding demonstrates South Dakota's position on the forefront of medical research," Johnson said. "This research has the potential to result in a new treatment that could benefit not only many South Dakotans but many Americans as well. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
   The funding comes from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services.
