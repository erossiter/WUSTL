SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES LABOR HHS, EDUCATION SPENDING BILL PASSAGE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) voted to oppose the conference report for the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education spending bill for 2006 in a voice vote late yesterday evening. Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, believes funding levels in the conference report are inadequate. The conference report now passed the Senate awaits the signature of the President.  
   "While I am pleased that we were able to restore some of the cuts proposed by the President in his 2006 budget, including rural health programs, the conference report that emerged does not provide the federal support necessary to meet the health and education needs of our communities," said Johnson. "Overall, this conference report does not address many of our domestic priorities. I am opposed this appropriations bill because it is not in the best interest of South Dakotans."
   This bill cuts discretionary funding by $1.4 billion compared to what was provided in 2005. The result is a bill that comes up short in virtually every critical area of need. 
   Some of the funding cuts that would affect South Dakotans in this bill include:
   Health and Human Services: This bill cuts total health funding by $466 million. 
   * The Bureau of Health Professions program is cut by $185 million. This program is critical to helping recruit and retain a variety of health professionals, something that is a great challenge in rural states like South Dakota. 
   * Johnson's efforts to encourage conferees to eliminate cuts to rural health programs did result in improved funding levels. However, this conference report still cuts these programs by $137 million. Some of the programs impacted by these cuts include: the Rural Outreach Grant program and the Rural Emergency Medical Services program, both vital programs to South Dakota. 
   * This bill does not provide adequate funding for the increased needs of community health centers which maintain a critical health care safety net for the uninsured. Hot Springs, Porcupine and Aberdeen are communities in great need of health centers to meet the growing needs of uninsured citizens, but the funding levels do not allow for new facilities to be built, or for expansions to existing facilities. 
   * The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is provided the smallest increase the agency has seen in 35 years. The great strides made in health research in recent years will be slowed by this inadequate funding. 
   Education: This bill contains the first decrease in federal education funding in a decade, shortchanging many important education programs through $59 million in cuts.
   * Reduces funding for No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) programs by 3 percent, for a total of $13.1 billion below what was promised when President Bush signed NCLB into law. 
   * Title I will receive a meager 0.8 percent increase in funding. 
   * There is no increase in funding for the work-study, GEAR UP, and TRIO programs. 
   * Funding for special education will move backwards by only funding about 18% of the cost of special education--down from 18.6% last year. The federal government has never lived up to the promise of providing 40% of the cost of special education. 
   * Funding for Impact Aid payments under this important program will be maintained roughly at 2005 levels. Impact Aid helps school districts that educate federally connected children or have a federal land presence, including military installations, other government installations, national parks or forests and Indian reservations. 
   Labor: This bill cuts total labor funding by $430 million, or almost 4 percent. 
   * Employment services will be cut by 11%. Most of the cuts would impact Unemployment Insurance state offices. 
   * Cuts will also impact adult and youth job training programs. For 2006, adult job training programs would be cut by $31 million over last year's level, while youth programs would be slashed by $36 million.
