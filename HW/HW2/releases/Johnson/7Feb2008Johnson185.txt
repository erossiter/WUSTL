SENATE PASSES BIPARTISAN STIMULUS BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon passage of an improved, bipartisan economic stimulus package today in the Senate: 
  The Senate worked together to improve upon the House economic stimulus bill. We swiftly moved a plan that provides for middle-class families, disabled veterans and seniors with the goal of strengthening our national economy. I hope the House moves quickly to pass this improved version and get checks into the hands of the people who need it most. 
  Economic Stimulus Act of 2008
   Individual Tax Provisions: The agreement will provide stimulus checks to more Americans - including 20 million seniors living only on Social Security and 250,000 disabled veterans, as the Senate Finance Committee first proposed. Stimulus checks for the survivors of disabled veterans have been added as well. Safeguards proposed by the Finance Committee ensure that illegal immigrants do not obtain rebates or bonus payments remain in the final agreement as well. 
  Business Tax Provisions: The compromise legislation retains tax relief for American businesses, in the form of enhanced expensing and depreciation provisions for businesses buying equipment and placing it into service this year. This tax relief will encourage businesses to buy what they need to grow - and the requirement for investment this year will achieve the stimulus bill's goal of injecting money into the economy right away. 
  Other Provisions: America's current economic troubles have their roots in the nation's sagging housing sector. The compromise legislation retains House-passed provisions temporarily increasing conforming loan limits for the Federal Housing Authority.
