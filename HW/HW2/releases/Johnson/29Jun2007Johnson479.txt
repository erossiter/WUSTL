SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SCHOLARSHIP FUNDING FOR DAKOTA WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY IN MITCHELL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell will receive a $15,273 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services to fund scholarships for disadvantaged students. 
  "Any person eager to learn should be able to access quality post-secondary education, no matter their economic background," Johnson said. "Making college more affordable will help to ensure that all students at Dakota Wesleyan Universityhave the chance to succeed academically and get their college diploma."
  A member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Johnson has supported increasing the federal support for higher education. Earlier this year, the committee approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education bill that funded this scholarship program at a level of $46 million, more than $30 million above the president's budget request. The bill must now be considered by the full Senate.
