SEN. JOHNSON PUSHES FOR QUALITY HEALTH CARE IN RURAL AMERICA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced his support today of a bill that offers comprehensive improvements in Medicare payments to rural health care providers. The bill, introduced by Sen. Johnson and the bipartisan Senate Rural Health Caucus, is called the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity (R-HoPE) Act of 2006. The bipartisan legislation demonstrates an understanding of the obstacles rural health care providers face and addresses disparities in the Medicare payment system to place rural providers on a more level playing field with their urban counterparts. 
   "The bipartisan group of Senators created a bill that will strip away many of the inequities rural health care providers face in Medicare billing. The bill is recognition that in health care 'one size does not fit all,' and that good health care is not a privilege reserved for bigger cities," Johnson said. 
   The bill touches on many of the funding hurdles and geographic handicaps that rural health providers face from clinics to individual health care providers to ambulance services. It provides for less constricting limits on billing and allows providers to put patients' health before the bottom line.
   AMONG THE CHANGES THE BILL WOULD:
   - Provide Assistance to Low Volume Hospitals - helps rural hospitals that cannot make ends meet under the PPS system, but that do not want to be forced to convert to Critical Access Hospital status. 
   - Create a Capital Infrastructure Loan Program - makes loans available to help rural facilities improve crumbling buildings and infrastructure.
   - Implement Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Improvements - includes provisions to reinstate cost-based reimbursement to CAHs for lab services provided to patients who are not physically in the hospital. It would also eliminate the 35-mile cap on ambulance service reimbursement.
   - Extend the Medicare Incentive Payment Program - extends 10 percent bonus payments to physicians practicing in Health Professional Shortage Areas that would affect 40 South Dakota counties.
   - Equalize Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments - removes the cap on rural add-on payments, setting them closer to payment levels at urban facilities.
   - Increase Rural Health Clinic (RHC) Reimbursement - raises the RHC cap making it comparable to the payment rate Community Health Centers (CHC) receive.
   - Facilitate the Provision of telehealth Services Across State Lines - pushes for new regulations allowing for multi-state practitioner licenses, to bring telehealth health care into rural areas that otherwise lack access to such services.
