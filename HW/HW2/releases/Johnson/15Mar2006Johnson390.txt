SEN. JOHNSON PUSHES AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE PROPOSAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
  In an effort to address the sky-rocketing costs of health care, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) is working towards a solution that will help employers and their workers. Johnson has joined an effort with more than twenty of his colleagues to help small businesses offer affordable health care that provides both options and protections for their employees.
   "Access to affordable health insurance is one of the leading domestic issues facing our country. The cost of insurance continues to rise with health care inflation, increased administrative burdens and the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. Health care spending continues to outpace the growth of the economy, and as a result, is increasing the financial burden on working families. We need to find solutions that work for business and employees," Johnson said.  
   The Small Employers Health Benefits Program (SEHBP), S.2382, is based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which has provided benefit choices to members of Congress and federal employees for decades. Last year, more than eight million people were banded together in the FEHBP purchasing pool and given choices among 10 national health insurance plans and a variety of local insurance plans. 
   The program will be open to all employers with up to 100 employees. According to the most recently available data from the Small Business Administration, in South Dakota 19,750 businesses fall in this category, employing 136,560 people. The legislation also will provide for participation waivers to businesses with more than 100 employees under some circumstances.
   By pooling small businesses across America into one risk and purchasing pool like FEHBP, the new SEHBP program will allow employers to reap the benefits of group purchasing power and streamlined administrative costs, as well as access to more plan choices. Health plans will bid to offer benefit packages to SEHBP enrollees. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which has been managing FEHBP for decades with less than one percent administrative cost. The SEHBP Act also provides a refundable tax credit to employers for their payments on behalf of low-wage workers. 
   The SEHBP is an alternative to the President's Association Health Plan (AHP) initiative. While the AHP proposal being backed by the Administration would provide limited choices, the SEHBP legislation would create an option similar to the health care program offered to federal employees and members of Congress where federal workers can choose from 10 national health plans and a variety of local plans. 
   Further, the SEHBP places a high priority on consumer protections while the AHP model supported by the President would broadly preempt state consumer protections. SEHBP recognizes that states have been the primary regulators of health insurance and largely maintains requirements set by the states. The bill requires participating health plans to be licensed in every state in which they will operate. Local plans will have to operate within state consumer protection laws.

   THE SMALL EMPLOYERS HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM (SEHBP)SUMMARY AS PROVIDED BY BILL SPONSOR
   The Small Employers Health Benefits Program (SEHBP) is based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which has provided benefit choices to members of Congress and federal employees for decades. Last year, more than eight million people were banded together in the FEHBP purchasing pool and given choices among 10 national health insurance plans and a variety of local insurance plans. 
   Eligibility Requirements
   * The SEHBP program will be open to all employers with up to 100 employees, but there may be participation waivers granted to businesses with more than 100 employees.
   * To receive the tax credit, employers must agree to pay at least 60 percent of each employee's health insurance premium.
   * Employers who enroll in the first year will receive a 10 percent bonus refundable tax credit that year. 
   * All employees of participating SEHBP employers will be eligible to receive coverage through SEHBP. 
   PARTICIPATION AND COVERAGE
   * Employees may join SEHBP when first hired or during an annual open enrollment period.
   * Coverage choices are made by the employee. Each individual may choose a health plan according to his or her own needs. Like the federal employees plan, the options are likely to range from fee-for-service, in which most services provided by any doctor are covered with a co-payment, to HMOs, which offer lower prices with a more limited panel of doctors, to high-deductible plans, which require the first several thousand dollars of health care coverage be paid by the employee.
   * SEHBP enrollees who have at least six months of health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an SEHBP plan will face no pre-existing condition waiting period. To prevent people from waiting until they get sick to enroll, health plans will be allowed to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions for up to six months for people without coverage immediately prior to enrollment (reduced by one month for each month of immediately previous coverage). 
   * The SEHBP plan follows the model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners by allowing plans to vary premiums based on age, geography and family composition within strict limits or to prevent extreme variations in price. 
   TAX CREDIT
   * Under SEHBP, premiums will not be government-subsidized, but employers will receive an annual tax credit to defray part of the employer contribution. The SEHBP Act provides a refundable tax credit to employers for their payments on behalf of low-wage workers (those who make $25,000 or less per year). The tax credit will be equal to 25 percent of their costs for self-only policies, 30 percent for those employees who are married with no dependents and 35 percent for family policies. The wage limitation will be adjusted annually for inflation rate based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
   * Employers who cover more than 60 percent of their employee's premium will receive a bonus tax credit. The bonus will be equivalent to a 5 percent add-on per additional 10 percent of premium covered. So, an employer who covers 10 percent over the required employer portion will receive an additional 5 percent tax credit. If the employer covers an additional 20 percent of the premium, an additional 10 percent tax credit will be granted.
