SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES CROOKS NATIVE TO WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Dan Burke to the Washington, DC office. Burke is a graduate of South Dakota State University where he earned degrees in Political Science and History. Burke went to Tri-Valley High School, where he graduated in 2000.  
   "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson has said in the past. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital." "As a South Dakota native, I have a deep interest in agriculture issues as well as military affairs," said Burke. "I appreciate this wonderful opportunity and I look forward to better understanding the legislative process, and how it affects these issues." 
   The Washington D.C. spring internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a "first-hand" opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with the office administrative staff.
