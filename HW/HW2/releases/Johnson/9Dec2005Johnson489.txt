EDMUNDS COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) has selected Edmunds County as his December 2005 "County of the Month."  
 The county is highlighted on a special section of this website. 
   "Edmunds County has much to offer," Johnson said. "From helping secure funds to increase crime fighting technology in communities to promoting economic development, I am always proud to work on projects of importance to the people of Edmunds County." 
   Edmunds County, located in Northeastern South Dakota, was founded in 1873. Ipswich was selected as the county seat. The county was named after Newton Edmunds, the second Territorial Governor of South Dakota, who was appointed by President Lincoln in 1863.
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are great places to live. Edmunds County's rich history and friendly people create a desirable atmosphere for everyone to enjoy."
