SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon hearing of the death of Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist:  
   "My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Chief Justice Rehnquist. During his nearly twenty years as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist served this nation with distinction. As we move forward with hearings to replace the Chief Justice and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, I hope the process moves with balance. We can all agree that the Supreme Court needs and deserves a respected jurist or scholar who falls within the broad mainstream of American jurisprudential thinking."
