SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $11,500 FOR PIERRE POLICE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Pierre Police Department will receive an $11,500 grant from the Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP) for the purchase of a video surveillance system. The funding comes through the Department of Homeland Security.  
  "In rural states like South Dakota, police departments play a crucial role in keeping residents safe. This funding from the CEDAP will ensure police departments in our communities have the equipment they need to respond safely and effectively to an emergency," Johnson said. "My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The CEDAP helps to meet the equipment needs of smaller jurisdictions by providing training and resources including communications equipment, chemical detection, sensors and other technology. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
