2007 ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS GRANTS COMPETITION BEGINS
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training (G&T) has begun accepting applications for the Fiscal Year 2007 Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG). The applications are due by May 4, 2007 at 4:00 p.m. CT, 3:00 pm MT.  
   Since it was created in 2001, the program has provided millions of dollars to South Dakota fire departments, enabling them to purchase firefighting vehicles, equipment, and other necessities. Despite these previous awards, many communities in South Dakota have critical unmet needs, and this year's grant competition provides another opportunity to address these needs. 
   In the past, Johnson has said "We cannot ask our first responders to do their job, and then neglect to give them the resources to protect themselves as they risk their lives for us." As in previous years, Senator Johnson encourages all eligible departments to apply for funds. 
   Regrettably, President Bush has for several years in a row proposed deep cuts to the program. In 2003, the program received $745 million. But for the upcoming year, the President has proposed a funding level of only $300 million, or less than half of the 2003 level. Because Senator Johnson understands the importance of properly equipping those who voluntarily risk their lives to protect the public, he has used his seats on the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee to oppose these cuts. 
   Interested applicants can access the FY 2007 AFG application through the AFG website (www.firegrantsupport.com), the U.S. Fire Administration's (USFA) website (www.usfa.fema.gov), and the Grants.gov website (www.grants.gov).
