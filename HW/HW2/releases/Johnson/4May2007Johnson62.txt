SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $190,742 TO OGLALA LAKOTA COLLEGE TO EXPAND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Oglala Lakota College will receive a $190,742 continuation grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service to expand service-learning and community service programs.  
   "I strongly support efforts to promote community service and volunteerism," said Johnson. "The programs administered through the Corporation for National Service are critical to facilitate community service initiatives. These programs support hundreds of thousands of volunteers and generate millions of hours of service to communities and families throughout the nation." 
   The Oglala Lakota College's Service Learning Initiative allows students to help their communities by addressing the needs of the Native American community in Rapid City and across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The area is one of the most economically disadvantaged regions in the United States. As part of the program, students take part in various projects including mentoring and environmental protection.
