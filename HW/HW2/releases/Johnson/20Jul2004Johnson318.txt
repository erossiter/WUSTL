SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR OUTDOORS, RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS
  During a hearing of the Senate Energy Committee, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced his support for federal funding for wildlife conservation and recreational projects as part of the American Outdoors Act.
   "Our efforts to enhance and protect our outdoors rest on a three-legged stool: management, conservation, and dedicated federal funding," said Johnson, a member of the Energy Committee. "In South Dakota, we are tied closely to the land. Whether hunting or fishing or camping, it's in our blood to spend time outdoors. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to protect the outdoors for our children and grandchildren by improving parks and enhancing critical wildlife habitat."
   The American Outdoors Act of 2004, S. 2590, would establish a guaranteed federal funding stream through the proceeds from offshore oil and natural gas royalties for wildlife conservation, state land acquisition, and municipal recreational projects. 
   For conservation and wildlife restoration, South Dakota would receive $3.316 million annually, or $23.212 million total in the next seven fiscal years. For development of parks and recreational facilities, South Dakota would receive $5.5 million annually or, $38.5 million total in the next seven fiscal years. 
   The bill authorizes the following funding nationwide:
   * $450 million annually for the State Land and Water Conservation Fund program
   * $350 million annually for wildlife habitat restoration programs
   * $125 million for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act; and 
   * $500 million annually for Coastal Impact Assistance.
