SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF BUS GARAGES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the communities of Watertown, Wessington Springs, and Parker will receive $368,000 in total funding for the construction of bus garages.  
   "I am pleased that these communities will be able to enhance their public transportation systems with this funding," Johnson said. "Efficient transportation is central to the infrastructure of our towns." 
   This funding comes from a $2 million earmark that Senator Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped secure in 2004 for South Dakota buses and bus facilities statewide. 
   "I will continue to work to ensure that the transportation needs of South Dakota are reflected in the federal budget," Johnson said. "Efficient, reliable, and dependable transportation is directly linked to the prosperity of rural America and our quality of life." Senator Johnson was recently named to the conference committee that will negotiate a final Transportation Bill.
