SEN. JOHNSON JOINS IN RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL REGARDING PROPOSAL TO RE-OPEN U.S., CANADIAN BORDER TO CANADIAN CATTLE
 Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined with Senate colleagues in signing a Resolution of Disapproval of the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) proposal to re-open the U.S-Canada border to imports of Canadian live cattle beginning in March. 
   "USDA continues to push a rule that will not help our domestic producers," said Johnson. "USDA needs to be accountable to our producers and ranchers, and should be a friend to the agricultural community. This bipartisan measure sends a strong message to USDA and it has the teeth we need to stop this course of action. I will continue to ride close herd on this and work with my Senate colleagues to keep the Canadian border shut."
   A Resolution of Disapproval requires thirty member signatures to force the resolution out of the committee of jurisdiction and onto the Senate floor for an up-or-down vote. A simple majority can then approve the resolution. If the House approves the resolution, it would be sent to the President for signature. 
   Joining Johnson in signing the resolution were Senators Kent Conrad (D-ND), Craig Thomas (R-WY), Max Baucus (D-MT), Ken Salazar (D-CO), Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Harry Reid (D-NV), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), and Pete Domenici (R-NM).
   In January, Johnson introduced bipartisan legislation to keep the border closed to Canadian beef and cattle until mandatory country-of-origin labeling has been implemented.
