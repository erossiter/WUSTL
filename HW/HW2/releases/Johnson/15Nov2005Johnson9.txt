SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG SIGNUP PERIOD
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement on the new signup period for the Medicare prescription drug program, Medicare Part D. 
   Starting today, November 15, 2005, seniors will begin selecting either a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) or a prescription drug plan (PDP) to receive drug coverage under the program if they choose to do so. Each plan will be different and will not necessarily cover the same drugs. Some of the plans may even force beneficiaries to choose a new physician if their current doctor is not covered under their particular benefit plan.
   "While I support the principle of a prescription drug benefit for seniors, the devil remains in the details. I voted against the bill that established the program because I was concerned it was overly complicated and lacked any price controls on the big drug companies. Seniors need to look at the plans carefully and choose wisely based on the particulars of their lives. As the program continues to roll out, I will monitor it and its effects closely to see what improvements can and should be made," Johnson said.
   For more information on the program, seniors may contact the following resources:
