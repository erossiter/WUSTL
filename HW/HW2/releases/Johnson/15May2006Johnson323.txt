SEN. JOHNSON RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S PLAN ON BORDER
  President George W. Bush will address the nation this evening on immigration reform. Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement on the President's call for the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to the border: 
   "Responsible use of the National Guard to support the border patrol is a good start, but I hope this plan is limited in duration and size. The National Guard is already stretched thin. We must expand our border patrol and find real, long-term solutions to secure our borders."
