SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING IN AGRICULTURE SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels in the Agriculture spending bill for 2007. The legislation passed the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee today, of which Johnson is a member. The bill is now ready for consideration by the full Appropriations Committee. 
   As part of this bill, the funding level for 2007 South Dakota projects is almost $8 million, which is $5.2 million more than President Bush's Budget request of only $2,827,650 for South Dakota. The total out of committee is almost three times more than the President's request for the state. 
   "This bill contains increased funding for agricultural programs important to South Dakota," said Johnson, a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. "Agriculture is the largest industry in our state and as such requires a certain level of investments to promote further economic growth. The bill includes funding to aid farmers and ranchers, but also includes money for and community development funding, agricultural research funding for SDSU, in addition to numerous other functions that will help advance the principles of my Hometown Prosperity Plan for years to come."
   Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a set of strategies for advancing the South Dakota economy from the federal level. The funding in the coming year's agriculture appropriations bill is a key part of that plan, as it "promotes partnerships," "emphasizes entrepreneurship," and is an "investment in the public good."
