EFFORT WILL MOVE VITAL SPENDING BILLS SWIFTLY TO PRESIDENT FOR APPROVAL
  In an effort to keep the federal funding process moving forward, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced his support for an effort to combine two funding packages that have passed conference committee so Congress can move them to the President as soon as possible. This bipartisan, bicameral appropriations conference report includes the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs (Milcon-VA) and Related Agencies and the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education appropriations bills. The final conference report was announced today and is expected to pass the House and the Senate this week. 
  "Federal appropriations bills are moving forward, and we are grouping spending bills to move them to the President as swiftly as possible. We hope that he will sign these bills into law, and not further stall these important projects," Johnson said. "I stand by each of my projects in these bills because they are worthy investments of federal dollars in South Dakota" 
  The conference report provides $37.2 billion for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), $4.5 billion more than last year and $2.5 billion more than the President's request. This is also more than what was requested for veterans health care in the Independent Budget, which has never occurred in the 21 year history of the Independent Budget. It also includes funding for the Johnson requested construction projects for Ellsworth Air Force Base, the South Dakota National Guard, and the South Dakota Reserve. 
   "As Military Construction-VA Subcommittee Chairman, I fought to ensure that vital Military Construction projects remained intact in this spending bill. In addition, I worked to make sure VA health was fully funded," Johnson said. "The VA must meet the needs of our nation's veterans, and the funding in this conference report will better allow the agency to do that." 
  "Critical funding for South Dakota was included in the Labor-HHS and Education section of this bill, including millions for our state's only medical school and funding to advance rural health care," Johnson said. 
  The conference report also includes $2 million for construction at the University of South Dakota's Sanford School of Medicine.
