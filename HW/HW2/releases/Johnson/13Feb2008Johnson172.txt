SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $1.5 MILLION IN FUNDING TO LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $1,587,044 in supplemental funding to the Northeast South Dakota Head Start program in Aberdeen. The grant will be used to help coordinate early childhood educational opportunities for area kids. 
  "This program is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel and Head Start builds a strong educational foundation."
  Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering elementary school. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents. 
  The grant is awarded by the Department of Health & Human Services.
