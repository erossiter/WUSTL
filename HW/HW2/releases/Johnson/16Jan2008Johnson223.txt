SEN. JOHNSON DISCUSSES SPEARFISH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) took an economic development tour of Spearfish today and was briefed on the area's economic progress by Spearfish Mayor Jerry Krambeck, including the expansion of the Spearfish Industrial Park for which Johnson secured $196,000 in federal funding this December.  
  "I am pleased to be part of the team working to promote economic growth in Spearfish through projects like the industrial park expansion," Johnson said. "The increased demand for space in the industrial park means more potential for economic growth in the area, and I expect the funds I have secured will help Spearfish to turn that potential growth into a reality."
  Johnson is committed to partnering with local and state government officials as well as economic development groups to expand economic opportunity. In 2006, Johnson announced his formal four pillar economic development plan to help advance local and state businesses and growth, the Hometown Prosperity Plan."
  The four pillars, or strategies, of Johnson's The Hometown Prosperity Plan include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
  After the tour Johnson took questions from the media at City Hall. Then he returned to Rapid City for a roundtable meeting with ag leaders at his office. 
  Johnson has been traveling across South Dakota during the district work period for the past month, participating in events in Sioux Falls, Vermillion, Yankton, Brookings, Watertown, Mitchell, Huron, Lower Brule, Chamberlain and Aberdeen.
