SOUTH DAKOTA DELEGATION WORKS FOR LEWIS & CLARK FUNDING
  South Dakota's Congressional Delegation, Sens. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and John Thune (R-SD) and Rep.  
 Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) today requested that $35 million in funding for the Lewis & Clark Rural Water System be included in President George W. Bush's budget. The President will send his budget to Congress early next month.
   "In order to be successful, we must remain steadfast in our efforts," the Delegation said. "Your leadership is necessary to continue progress on this vital project. We therefore strongly urge you to include $35 million in your FY 2006 budget for the project. This commitment will provide the funds necessary to keep this project on the path toward completion."
   Major construction of the project's main water line is underway. The three member states and the local project sponsors have also contributed much to the construction effort, with roughly $25.9 million in local funds being made available through FY 2005. A similar amount will be dedicated by the states in FY 2006. These funds will be used for construction, engineering and environmental compliance, and associated legal and professional costs.
   Lewis and Clark will provide safe, reliable drinking water to approximately 200,000 people and 21 communities and water districts in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. The project will utilize an aquifer adjacent to the Missouri River near Vermillion, South Dakota, and will distribute water to member communities in an area of approximately 5900 square miles, larger than the state of Connecticut.
