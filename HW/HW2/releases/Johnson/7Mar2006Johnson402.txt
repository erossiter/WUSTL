SEN. JOHNSON: LAW IS WRONG APPROACH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement today in regard to the new South Dakota state abortion ban: 
   "The South Dakota abortion legislation would deny individual women, even under the most extreme circumstances, their current right to prayerfully determine for themselves whether to have an abortion. This denial would be without regard to whether the pregnancy has been only one day in duration; whether it has been the result of rape or incest; or whether its continuation would cause profound injury to the woman.
   "I believe this law is an extreme and radical approach to a very difficult and personal subject, and I do not support it.
   "This legislation goes beyond what is acceptable to President Bush, and I agree with the Rapid City Journal editorial which stated, 'Requiring women and teenage girls to give birth to their rapist's baby adds injury and cruelly worsens their shattered lives.'
   "Our nation's goal should be to make abortion a much more rare occurrence, but the best way to accomplish that goal is through education, voluntary contraceptive resources, improved adoption procedures, and help for low income new mothers and their children. I do not believe that the judgment of politicians should be substituted for the painfully difficult and very personal decisions of women and their families.
   "Just as I oppose criminalizing abortion for victims of rape or incest, I also have opposed procedures commonly referred to as 'partial birth abortion' and I have helped organize a bipartisan Senate caucus on adoption, while promoting programs which assist pregnant mothers. I believe my approach reflects the broad mainstream values of South Dakota, and that our country needs thoughtful moderation over extreme alternatives."
