SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the immigration bill, S.1639, which is currently being considered by the Senate and that brings real and practical solutions: 
  In the 109th Congress, I supported the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate by a large bipartisan majority with the strong support of the President. That legislation addressed the same core principals as the current proposal; enhanced border security, a guest worker program, and an earned path to citizenship program to address undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.
  I will continue to support legislation that first strengthens our borders, creates a temporary worker program, and requires undocumented immigrants to go to the back of the line; pay substantial fines, pass a background check, and learn English and American civics before being put on a path to citizenship. There are an estimated 13 million illegal immigrants inside the United States and reasonable reforms are necessary to bring them out of the shadows so they can be taxed and better contribute to our nation as a whole.
  Except for Native Americans, we are a nation of immigrants, and we all have relatives that risked the impossible coming here to live out the American dream. 
  As in the last Congress, true immigration reforms need real and practical solutions, rather than obstructionist procedures and poison pill amendments aimed at preventing an up-or-down vote on passage of the bill. I will continue to monitor this legislation as it moves through the Senate and hope we can again pass consensus driven solutions. 
  This bill should reflect our nation's values by securing our borders, cracking down on employers who hire illegally, and bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows, while continuing grow our economy.
