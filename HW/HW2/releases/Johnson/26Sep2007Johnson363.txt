SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN ONE MILLION IN FUNDING FOR STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the South Dakota Department of Health in Pierre will receive a $1,491,255 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services to continue the Hospital Preparedness Program across South Dakota.  
  "This funding for the South Dakota Department of Health will help ensure that our local hospitals and healthcare facilities have the resources they need to prepare for and respond to potential threats," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help all South Dakotans." 
  The Hospital Preparedness Program helps area hospitals and health care providers plan for and respond to the threat of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
