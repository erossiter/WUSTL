SEN JOHNSON: FEMA EXPANDS DISASTER ASSISTANCE TO COVER PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has amended its federal disaster declaration to provide public assistance for twenty two counties and three Indian reservations. Previously, the disaster declaration only provided individual assistance and hazard mitigation to a more limited set of counties.  
   "Yesterday, I said we needed to continue our full court press so that FEMA would expand the aid available to respond to the floods in Eastern South Dakota. I am pleased that FEMA responded favorably to repeated contacts from my office and other federal and state leaders regarding our disaster declaration," Johnson said. "I will continue to follow this situation and I have directed my staff to keep me up-to-date on how the response to the disaster declaration is going back home." 
   Earlier this week, the President granted a federal disaster declaration which will provide limited federal funding to Beadle, Brown, Clark, Davison, Hanson, Hutchinson, Miner, Sanborn, Spink, and Yankton Counties. Today's announcement expands the type of aid and regional areas and private groups that can apply for aid.

   Johnson directed his staff to remain in contact with FEMA in the wake of the flooding. On May 8th, Johnson wrote a letter urging Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to release emergency funds to flood victims from the USDA's Rural Development programs, including the 504 housing program which would provide a critical source of grants and loans to many homeowners facing water damage.
