SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES REAUTHORIZATION OF DISABLED VETERANS MEMORIAL PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that legislation to authorize an extension for the creation of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, DC has passed the Senate. Co-sponsored by Johnson and introduced by Senators Dorgan (D-ND) and Thune (R-SD), the bill extends authorization for the memorial, allowing fundraising for the project to continue until 2015. This legislation passed the House of Representatives earlier this year.  
  "By continuing the authorization for the construction of this memorial honoring our nation's disabled veterans, the United States Senate is reiterating our commitment to those who protect the freedoms we hold dear," said Johnson. "I support the construction this memorial because I believe it is important to pay tribute to the sacrifices disabled veterans have made for America." 
   Johnson has also supported efforts to fund construction the memorial. Earlier this month, Johnson introduced The American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act to honor veterans who became disabled while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. The legislation would create a commemorative coin to honor disabled veterans. The profits from the sale of this coin would go to help build the memorial. 
  American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial has been authorized by Congress to be placed on a site adjacent to the National Mall. Though the commemorative coin would help raise a portion of the funds needed for construction of the memorial, more money is needed.
  The American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act passed the Senate last Congress in May 2006. That bill did not pass the House in either the 108th or 109th Congress.
