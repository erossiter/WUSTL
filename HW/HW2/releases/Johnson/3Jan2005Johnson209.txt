SEN. JOHNSON REQUESTS WHITE HOUSE RECONSIDER CANADIAN CATTLE PLAN
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today requested the White House reconsider its plans to reopen the American market to Canadian live cattle imports in the wake of confirmation of the third case of Mad Cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) found in a Canadian animal. 
   "Canada has found another case of Mad Cow and the Bush Administration still insists on opening the floodgates," said Johnson. "We have a responsibility to protect our consumers and ranchers - right now that means keeping the Canadian border closed. American ranchers and farmers deserve a Department of Agriculture that will fight for them. I maintain confidence in the safety of our domestic food supply, but without COOL in place, I urge the Administration reconsider its proposal. This move puts the U.S. export market in jeopardy."
   Johnson expressed his concerns to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the White House in letters today and requested that they reconsider the March timeline.
   Early today, USDA officials reiterated agency support for reopening the American market to Canadian live cattle beginning in March.
   "Continuing on USDA's March timeline in light of this news is reckless and hasty," Johnson said. "I expect this to be an issue of concern during Secretary-Designate Johanns' confirmation, and have requested a meeting with him."
   The case of Mad Cow, confirmed by a series of tests late Sunday, is the third case in a Canadian animal. The U.S.-Canadian border was initially closed to imports of live cattle from Canada following a case of BSE in May 2003. Another Canadian cow, diagnosed with Mad Cow disease in December of 2003, was found in Washington State.
