SEN. JOHNSON: COMPROMISE MOVES FARM BILL FORWARD
  Late last evening, an agreement was reached in the Senate that would limit the number of amendments on the Farm Bill to 40, and bring the bill to the floor again next week. U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) applauded negotiation efforts and released the following statement: 
   "It was nearly death by amendment for the Farm Bill when debate was stalled last month with 286 amendments to the bill, including ones on the Exxon Valdez, medical malpractice and immigration. After weeks of compromise proposals being sent across the aisle, we have reached a 40 amendment deal. The Farm Bill is expected to be on the floor again next week. It is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate keep this debate focused on farm policy and not continue to make this bill a political football. Our nation's farmers and ranchers deserve a new Farm Bill and the time to plan accordingly. I'm glad to see this bill is moving forward and that the art of bipartisan compromise is still alive and well in the Senate."
