FARM BILL FEEDBACK ENCOURAGED
  With the Farm Bill Congress passed in 2002 scheduled to be rewritten this year, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) is encouraging South Dakotans to share their thoughts on the legislation. Johnson will forward their suggestions on to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA). Initially more than 3,000 farmers, ranchers and stakeholders from across the state will be receiving a survey from the senator's office via mail, while all constituents are encouraged to download a copy of the survey from his website.  
   "As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I am in a strong position to support the priorities of South Dakotans in this year's farm bill," Johnson said. "I am asking the people of the state for their assistance generating ideas about how we can bring our agricultural community to new levels of prosperity with the passage of this updated legislation." 
   Earlier this month, Johnson outlined his priorities for this year's farm bill. Initiatives include a strong, effective Competition Title that addresses market concentration; implementation of Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for beef, lamb, pork, fruits, vegetables, and peanuts; fighting arbitrary closure of South Dakota Farm Service Agency (FSA) county offices; continuing the USDA's Rural Development Program and finding energy alternatives through biofuels. 
   In his letter to South Dakotans, Johnson said, "I am very interested in hearing your thoughts about what the next farm bill should look like, and I look forward to sharing your suggestions with Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin of Iowa. Working with Tom and my Senate colleagues of both parties, I hope to help build a farm bill that gives South Dakota and rural America a fair shake."
