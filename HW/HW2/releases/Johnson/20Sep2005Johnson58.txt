SEN. JOHNSON WORKS TO PROTECT U.S. PRODUCERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today worked to protect the U.S. beef market.  
 Johnson supported an amendment to the 2006 agriculture appropriations bill that would prevent the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) from opening up the border to Japanese beef until the Japanese market is opened to U.S. beef. 
   "U.S. producers are responsible for the safest beef supply in the world," Johnson said. "Especially after opening up the border to Canadian cattle and beef, it is ridiculous that this Administration would pursue opening up the American border to Japanese beef when the Japanese market hasn't been secured for U.S. beef. This amendment sends a strong message to this Administration that the Senate won't support such flawed policy for our producers." 
   The amendment was introduced by Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE) and passed in the Senate this morning by an overwhelming margin of 72-26. Additionally, a measure introduced by Senator Allard (R-CO) passed unanimously by a voice vote this morning, expressing the Sense of the Senate that the U.S. border not be opened to Japanese beef until the Japan market is opened for U.S. beef. Johnson supported both measures. 
   The USDA developed and announced a proposed rule in August of this year that would open the U.S. border to Japanese beef. Senator Nelson's amendment prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from using any funds from the 2006 agriculture spending measure to develop a final rule allowing the importation of Japanese beef. Under this provision, the USDA could not open the border until the President certifies to Congress that Japan has granted open access to Japanese markets for beef and beef products produced in the U.S.
