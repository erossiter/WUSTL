SEN. JOHNSON: SUPPORTING STEM CELL RESEARCH IS PRO-LIFE, MORAL CHOICE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) commented today on President George W. Bush's veto of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007: 
  As a cosponsor of the legislation, I'm disappointed that President Bush vetoed the stem cell research bill, stifling the promise and the hope offered by embryonic stem cell research. The pro-life, moral choice is to support this research. This bill allows a closely monitored and controlled stem cell research effort and imposes tighter ethical rules than exist under current law. The stem cells to be used are frozen embryo cells sitting in fertility clinics that are currently classified as medical waste. These stems cells should not be waste, but hope. My deeply held religious faith tells me that respect for human life embraces this potentially life-saving research. 
  The 2008 Labor-HHS spending bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee will consider tomorrow now includes a provision to expand the number of embryonic stem cell lines available for federally funded research, and I support its inclusion. The President needs to stop putting up road blocks and help us expand research that may save and enrich countless lives.
