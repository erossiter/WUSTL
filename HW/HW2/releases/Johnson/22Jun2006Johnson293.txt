SEN. JOHNSON FIGHTS TO INCLUDE DISASTER ASSISTANCE IN AG FUNDING BILL AS IT CLEARS FULL COMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced he was able to help include the $3.9 billion ag disaster package in the Agriculture spending bill for 2007. The provision was initially introduced as stand alone legislation in May and was later knocked out of the recently passed emergency spending package due to President George W. Bush's opposition to ag disaster funding.  
   "The President didn't want the ag disaster package in the emergency spending bill, so we had to find another way to get the job done. More than just the hurricane-affected Gulf region was hurt by disaster last year. Our farmers and ranchers in South Dakota are hurting. While it still has several hurdles to clear, this is an important step," Johnson said. Johnson is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and has been an ardent supporter of this emergency funding since it was introduced by Senator Conrad in March 2006.
   The overall package that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today included almost $8 million for 2007 South Dakota projects, which is $5.2 million more than President Bush's budget request of only $2,827,650 for South Dakota. The total out of committee is almost three times more than the President's request for the state.
   "Agriculture is the largest industry in our state and requires investment to promote further economic growth. The bill includes funding to aid farmers and ranchers, but also includes money for community development, agricultural research funding for SDSU, in addition to numerous other provisions that will help advance my Hometown Prosperity Plan for years to come," Johnson continued.
