SEN. JOHNSON WRITES TO AGRICULTURE CHAIRMAN ON COOL LEGISLATION
  With the support of 31 bipartisan Senators from across the country, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today sent a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA) urging him to include legislation in the upcoming farm bill that would implement mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL). 
  "Because of USDA's inability over the past five years to create a workable and common-sense rule, now is the time for congressional intervention to ensure the long-awaited implementation of mandatory COOL," Johnson said. "The consensus reached by strong COOL proponents and COOL opponents represents a reasonable compromise and finally clears the way to timely and reasonable implementation." 
   When passed as part of the Farm Bill in 2002, COOL was to be implemented by September 30, 2004. Later, House Republicans pushed back the date by two years to September 30, 2006 for all commodities except fish and shellfish. An additional delay postponed implementation to September 30, 2008. Since that delay, the Senate has held off further attempts to make the entire program voluntary instead of mandatory.
  The USDA released an interim final rule for fish and shellfish implementation on September 30, 2004, and allowed affected industries to have a six month phase-in period to ensure compliance with the program. Mandatory COOL for fish and shellfish was implemented on April 4, 2005. 
  Full letter Johnson sent to Chairman Harkin below:
   Dear Chairman Harkin:
  As long-time supporters of mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL), we write to urge you to include companion language within your chairman's mark that reflects the COOL compromise reached during consideration of the House-passed farm bill.
  Because of USDA's inability over the past five years to create a workable and common-sense rule, now is the time for congressional intervention to ensure the long-awaited implementation of mandatory COOL. The consensus reached by strong COOL proponents and COOL opponents represents a reasonable compromise and finally clears the way to timely and reasonable implementation. The problems and concerns created by USDA among producers, packers and retailers are alleviated by this compromise language.
  Failure of the Senate to include identical language to solidify this agreement from the onset of our farm bill debate creates an unnecessary opportunity for some to generate obstacles at a time when great momentum forward has been achieved.
  Numerous consumer polls have consistently shown widespread support for COOL. In July 2007, Consumers Union conducted a poll that found 92 percent of respondents believed imported food products should be labeled with their country of origin. Zogby International conducted a consumer poll in August 2007 and found 95 percent believe consumers have a right to know the country of origin of the foods they purchase. These two latest polls are just further verifications of information we have known for years; consumers want to know where their food comes from and including the House farm bill language within your mark will allow a step in the right direction toward finally making that desire a reality.
  We appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to finally witnessing the benefits to American consumers and producers upon the long-awaited and successful implementation of mandatory COOL.
  Sincerely,
  Tim Johnson
