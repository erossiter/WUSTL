SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TEA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Tea Volunteer Fire Department in Lincoln County will receive a $21,700 low-interest federal loan to purchase new bunker gear. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
  "Rural emergency responders play an invaluable role in keeping communities like Lincoln County safe, and it is essential they have the equipment needed to respond safely and quickly to emergencies," Johnson said. "One of the key parts of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is strengthening rural development across the state, and this grant is a wonderful example of that kind of funding."
  In his Hometown Prosperity Plan, Senator Johnson lays out a four-pillar agenda for promoting economic development in South Dakota from the federal level. Under the pillar "Investing in the Public Good," Johnson pledges to defend USDA Rural Development infrastructure programs against proposed budget cuts.
