SENS. JOHNSON, DASCHLE ANNOUNCE FUNDING IN AGRICULTURE SPENDING BILL
  Sens. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Tom Daschle (D-SD) today announced funding levels in the Agriculture spending bill for the next fiscal year. The legislation passed the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture today. 
   "This bill contains funding for programs important to South Dakota," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee. "Farmers and ranchers will benefit from these important development programs, which address water and wastewater needs, provide rural and community development funding, and provide for valuable research at SDSU. Investment in research helps bring prestige to our universities and economic development opportunities for our state."
   "Agriculture is our state's top industry, and investments in agriculture are key to the state's economic development," Senator Daschle said. "As a graduate of SDSU, I know how much South Dakota benefits from the federal dollars that go toward that university's research projects. And other programs designed to help farmers and ranchers are critical to our economic well-being. As this bill moves to the full Senate, I will fight to protect this funding, and will remind my colleagues that farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and in other parts of the country not only need the funding in this bill, but they need drought-related disaster assistance."
