SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF AGRICULTURE SECRETARY JOHANNS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) comments on the resignation of Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns: 
  I was scheduled to meet with Secretary Johanns this afternoon, but his office called to cancel late yesterday. Now that I know why, I can only say I am disappointed that the Secretary is irresponsibly walking away with the farm bill heating up. America's farmers and ranchers didn't even get two weeks notice.
