SEN. JOHNSON WORKS TO EXTEND VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has joined a bipartisan group of 33 colleagues in supporting the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Johnson is a cosponsor of extending the landmark bill, which protects the ability of Americans to participate in democracy and prevents voter intimidation throughout the United States. 
   "Extending the Voting Rights Act is crucial to making certain everyone eligible to vote is allowed the opportunity to do so," said Johnson. "We must pass this legislation so that all voters are assured the freedom to participate in elections."
   The reauthorization would extend provisions that apply to South Dakota in the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years until 2032. One provision that would be extended requires a review of any change to voting laws by the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal court before the change is enacted. This provision applies to states and counties with a history of voter suppression and in South Dakota affects Todd and Shannon Counties.
   Another provision would allow for bilingual voting assistance. The bilingual voting assistance provision was added to the Voting Rights Act in 1975 and applies to 19 counties in South Dakota, including the use of languages such as Lakota, Nakota, Dakota and others.
   "Voting is a fundamental right that must be guaranteed," continued Johnson. "Let's move forward, not backward, by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act."
   The Voting Rights Act is currently set to expire at the end of 2007.
