SEN. JOHNSON AIDED LAW PROVIDES SOUTH DAKOTANS WITH FREE CREDIT REPORT BEGINNING MARCH 1
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that South Dakotans can look forward to a free copy of their credit report beginning March 1 as part of legislation he helped to enact in 2003.  
   "The ability to access one's credit report will help South Dakotans protect themselves from identity theft," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Banking Committee that created the legislation. "By reviewing credit reports annually, consumers can determine more quickly if there are any inaccuracies."
   The FACT Act, signed into law December 4, 2003, extends certain federal laws governing credit agencies and provides for a free credit report each year to those who request one.
   Johnson, the Ranking Member on the Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, authored the first bill in the 108th Congress to renew the national standards, which allow consumers simple access to affordable credit. Johnson's legislation was incorporated into a larger bill.
   South Dakotans are encouraged to obtain their free credit report by: -Calling 1-877-322-8228; -Ordering online at www.annualcreditreport.com ; -or, Completing the Annual Credit Report Request form, available at www.ftc.gov/credit and mailing to Annual Credit Report Request Service, PO Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281
   In July of last year, Johnson held a forum in Sioux Falls, bringing together regional and national experts from law enforcement, credit, and banking industries to help South Dakotans learn to protect themselves, and what to do should they find themselves the victim of identity theft.
