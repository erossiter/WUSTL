SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO REDUCE NATURAL GAS PRICES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) in introducing a comprehensive energy bill to lower natural gas prices and increase natural gas supplies, while utilizing existing and next-generation technologies to increase renewable energy resources.  
   The Senators, who serve on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, introduced the Keep Manufacturing and Farming Jobs in the United States Act to slow the demand for natural gas by improving the efficiency of residential and commercial uses, and increasing production, which will lower energy costs for consumers. 
   "The bill that Senator Alexander and I are introducing today is a first step, intended to provoke a discussion in the Energy Committee and in the Senate on reducing natural gas prices and improving energy efficiency," said Johnson. "Volatile and high natural gas prices are a drag on South Dakota's economy, hitting producers and consumers alike in the pocketbook. Any balanced and comprehensive energy bill needs to deploy a full array of prescriptions; including wind energy, ethanol, and environmentally-sound natural gas exploration." 
   The Alexander-Johnson legislation contains the following components:
   * Conservation and energy efficiency; the bill incorporates provisions included in energy legislation that passed the Senate in 2003-the bill sets residential and commercial appliance standards that, when fully implemented in 2020, will reduce peak electric demand by about 33,000 megawatts or the equivalent of 34 coal power plants of 100 megawatts each. The energy conservation and improved energy efficiency are the most immediate and direct steps for stabilizing natural gas prices.
   * Deploying technology; the bill authorizes $2.15 billion over the next five years for the Department of Energy to commercially deploy hydrogen fuel cells in vehicles. The bill also includes a launching pad to construct next-generation coal gasification electric generating plants.
   * Improved production; increasing domestic supplies to clean-burning natural gas must be one peg to a long-term energy policy. The bill would increase natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has determined the Gulf of Mexico to be the most promising region for natural gas production.
   "Incorporating provisions of this bill, a Renewable Fuel Standard, and incentives for wind energy will be my top priorities when the Senate Energy Committee considers a comprehensive energy bill in the coming weeks," Johnson said.
