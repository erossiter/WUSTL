SEN. JOHNSON REACTS TO JAPAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING AMERICAN BEEF IMPORTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement reacting to the recent announcement by Japan that they will loosen beef importation regulations: 
   Well, it's about time but I'll believe it when I see it on the grocery store shelves. They've been dragging their feet for a long time on this. 
   At one point, Japan was the largest buyer of U.S. beef among foreign countries. We need to get that market back. We need to get it back now. I think we've got to be very firm with the Japanese. We cannot continue to buy billions of dollars of their automobiles and electronics while they continue to stonewall us on the purchase of our beef.
   We've got the safest, highest quality beef in the world in the United States. We're proud of our product. 
   This is an encouraging sign that they may be opening the door again, but I think we're going to have to continue to push on them in a very firm fashion to make sure that they open up their borders to U.S. beef.
