  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Kearney Area Ag Producers Alliance will receive a federal grant of $72,318 to train individuals to develop and market their resources to generate revenue, and increase tourism. The grant will be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
  "It is crucial that South Dakotans receive the education and training they need to help their bottom line, and this funding for the Kearney Area Ag Producers Alliance does just that," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Kearney Area Ag Producers Alliance based in Kearney, Nebraska, trains individuals from multiple states including South Dakota, Nebraska, and Utah. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks."
