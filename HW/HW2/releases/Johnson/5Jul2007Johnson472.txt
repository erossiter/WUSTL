SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SISSETON-WAHPETON TRIBE TO RECEIVE $2.9 MILLION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribal Housing Authority will receive an Indian Housing Block Grant Award of $2.9 million for the preservation and refurbishing of tribal members' homes. This grant will be administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) of 1996.  
  "This funding will help the Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribe expand safe and affordable housing for its members," said Johnson. "Unfortunately, unsafe and inadequate housing is an all too familiar reality in Indian Country. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
