SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $587,899 FOR AVERA HEALTH INSTITUTE, REGIONAL TELEMEDICINE AND DISTANCE LEARNING
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Avera Health of Sioux Falls will receive two grants totaling $587,899 to advance telemedicine and distance learning. Both grants are funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development as a part of the Distance Learning and Telehealth Grant Program.  
  "Continuing to improve technology in our healthcare facilities keeps South Dakota on the cutting edge of medical care and provides the best care possible for the people of our state," Johnson said. "Living in a rural area should not mean sacrificing access to the best doctors available. Telemedicine is one way to make sure rural health care is not second class health care."
  A $488,354 grant will be used to create 21 "end user" sites and 6 "hubs" for treatment and diagnosis by physicians who may not be able to reach a patient in a rural area. The equipment to create the end user and hub sites will give more rural patients access to Telehealth Emergency Response services, electronic critical and intensive care, and teleradiology. It will also provide the telehealth sites access to upgraded videoconferencing equipment for medical consultation and distance learning.
  A $99,545 grant will be used to help ambulance crews instantly send their patient's vital information from the ambulance to the emergency facility while transporting patients so that the facility can develop an action plan in advance of the patients arrival. The funding will also have a Telehome Health project component as well, which is an effort to increase flexibility of rural health care.
  The grants made will enable Avera Health to treat patients in South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska by linking physicians and rural patients more easily over large distances.
