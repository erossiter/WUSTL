SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES $120,000 GRANT FOR YANKTON INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Bon Homme-Yankton Electric Association will receive a $120,000 grant to help build a new fire station west of Yankton, in Yankton County. The grant funding is provided through the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development.  
   As part of his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for promoting economic development in South Dakota, Senator Johnson has pledged to defend USDA Rural Development infrastructure programs against proposed budget cuts. Johnson refers to these programs as an example of his strategy of "Investing in the Public Good," which means directing federal funds to initiatives that pay themselves back in the form of job creation and higher quality of life for South Dakotans. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
