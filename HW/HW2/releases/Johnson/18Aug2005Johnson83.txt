SEN. JOHNSON REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today toured the offices of the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health Board (AATCHB) and reaffirmed his support for the bipartisan Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA).  
   "Many reservations in South Dakota and across the country face staggering problems with health care inequalities. Working with tribal leaders to develop policy recommendations in the areas such as health care is an important and necessary step to improving conditions in Indian Country." 
   Johnson is a cosponsor of Indian Affairs Committee Chairman John McCain's (R-AZ) IHCIA bill. 
   First enacted in 1976, the IHCIA established the first comprehensive framework for the delivery of health care services for Indian people and authorized funding for health programs, projects, and facilities. The IHCIA was last reauthorized in 1992. 
   "I will continue to work with tribes in South Dakota and with my Senate colleagues to ensure that the federal government better meets its responsibilities to Indian Country. It is my hope that we will be able to address and implement policies that will better honor our treaty and trust obligations to tribes and their members," Johnson continued. 
   Johnson is a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
