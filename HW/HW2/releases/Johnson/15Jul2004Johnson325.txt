SEN. JOHNSON OPPOSES AUSTRALIAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today opposed the Australian Free Trade Agreement, citing provisions that would harm family livestock and dairy producers, and weaken attempts to curb the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs.  
   "This trade agreement is skewed to benefit Australian farmers and ranchers and big drug companies here at home," said Johnson. "I am disappointed that beef was not excluded from these negotiations given the lack of significant opportunities for our producers. Further, this measure could undermine efforts toward common-sense reimportation of prescription drugs."
   The treaty includes provisions to reduce and remove tariffs on livestock imports, allowing meatpackers to bring even more Australian beef into the country. Another provision allows for the importing of 'milk protein concentrates,' dried, processed products that were reportedly used in place of 318 million pounds of U.S. dairy products between 1998 and 2002. 
   Johnson previously contacted the White House and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick on several occasions, requesting that they consider the harmful impact of a flood of foreign beef on domestic markets when evaluating the Australian Free Trade Agreement. Additionally, the agreement failed to address any of the inequities inherent in the Australian Wheat Board monopoly.
   Johnson had requested that beef be excluded from the negotiations, as sugar was. The Senate was expected to pass the trade agreement late Thursday.
   The treaty also includes language to prohibit prescription drugs from being exported by the U.S. or Australia to the other.
   Upon passage, the bill will be sent to President George W. Bush for his signature.
