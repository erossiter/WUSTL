SENATE PASSES LOBBYING REFORM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) supported passage of an aggressive reform package to restore the public trust in the federal government, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006. 
   "As Vice Chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, I have a great interest in Congress putting an end to what has become business as usual and restoring accountability, honesty and openness at all levels of government. Honest leadership is not a partisan goal. I'm glad this bill passed the Senate," Johnson said.
   Johnson had cosponsored the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. The bill that passed the Senate today reflects a compromise bill, and Johnson was glad to see that the Senate could come to a consensus that would help bring reform to Washington.
