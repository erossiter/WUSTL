SEN. JOHNSON READ TO REDLIN ELEMENTARY 2ND GRADERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) visited Terry Redlin Elementary today and was a guest reader to a 2nd Grade class. Johnson read House Mouse, Senate Mouse by Peter W. Barnes and Cheryl Shaw Barnes to the class. 
   "It was a privilege to be invited to Redlin to be a guest reader, and spend some time reading and talking to the 2nd Grade class," Johnson said. "It is more important now more than ever that children begin reading at a young age, not only because it promotes lifelong learning but also because of the new demands placed on students through the No Child Left Behind Act. Now the responsibility lies with Congress and the White House to make sure those programs are fully funded and implemented fairly."
   As a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson has pushed for review of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and the requirements it places on schools. Earlier this year, Johnson, along with nine of his Senate colleagues, called for the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to hold hearings to review NCLB as it is up for reauthorization in 2007. 
   In the President's Budget, NCLB would be under funded by $15.4 billion. Despite the President's budget request, Johnson has worked to sustain previous year's funding levels for Education Department initiatives including NCLB and IDEA. 
   Johnson is also a cosponsor of the No Child Left Behind Reform Act, which emphasizes increased flexibility in calculating student achievement, allows schools to direct school choice and supplemental services to the students that actually demonstrate need for them. It would also increase flexibility and adds some common sense language into the law describing "highly qualified teachers.
