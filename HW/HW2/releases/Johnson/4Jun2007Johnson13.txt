OFFICE OF SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES SIOUX FALLS STUDENT TO WASHINGTON
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Luiz Rens of Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Johnson's Washington, DC office. Rens, who has the neurological condition Cerebral Palsy, graduated from Parkview High School in Little Rock, Arkansas in 2002 and moved to Sioux Falls the same year. In 2008, he will graduate from St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota with degrees in Political Science and Public Policy Administration. 
   "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson said. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital."
   "I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how the Senate works," said Rens, who acted as vice-chair of the St. Cloud College Democrats last year. "I also hope I can be an advocate for those with disabilities who want to work for the Federal Government."
   The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with Senator Johnson and his staff.
   College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's internship program this summer. College credits or a stipend are available. To apply for a state office internship, please call toll-free at 1-800-537-0025.
