HAMLIN COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH; COUNTY FEATURED IN SECTION OF SEN. JOHNSON'S SENATE WEBSITE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Hamlin County as his July 2006 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website.  
   "Hamlin County has a rich history and that makes it a wonderful place to live and visit," Johnson said. "I am thankful for the county's great help on many issues, ranging from fighting domestic abuse to installing weather radio transmitters." 
   Home to the towns of Estelline, Hayti, Castlewood, Lake Norden, and Bryant, Hamlin County was founded in 1873. The county was named after Hannibal Hamlin, Abraham Lincoln's first Vice President.
   Johnson is a strong advocate of homeland security grants and economic development grant programs that help our small communities continue to grow. He was proud to announce funding for programs in Hamlin County that range from federal funding for the Hazel Volunteer Fire Department to federal funding for Lake Norden for the construction of a water supply system to federal funding from the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) for the Estelline School District.
   In addition, after the 1998 tornado in Spencer, South Dakota, Johnson worked to ensure the people across South Dakota, including in Hamlin County, have weather radios so all communities have early warning systems during emergencies.
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and I am happy to feature Hamlin this month," continued Johnson. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places."
