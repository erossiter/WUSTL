SEN. JOHNSON DELIVERS FARM BILL FEEDBACK TO AGRICULTURE CHAIRMAN
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today sent the results of his farm bill survey to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA). In a letter sent to Chairman Harkin today, Johnson relayed the thoughts expressed by South Dakotans on topics such as Country of Origin Labeling (COOL), direct payments to land operators, payment limitations and Farm Service Agency (FSA) Office Closures.
  "Hundreds of people across the state sent me their thoughts on the farm bill and I wanted to be sure their positions are considered as part of the coming reauthorization," said Johnson. "I will work with all my Senate colleagues and use my seat on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to fight for the needs of South Dakota's agricultural community as the legislation is drafted." 
  Earlier in the week, Johnson met with members of the National Farmers Union (NFU). Johnson and his staff continue to gather feedback and discuss the pending farm bill reauthorization. Johnson was also presented with his twelfth Golden Triangle Award from the NFU for his work and commitment to issues affecting rural America. The award is the highest award for government service given by the NFU.
  Full letter Johnson sent to Chairman Harkin below:
   Dear Chairman Harkin:
  Earlier this year, I sent an agriculture and farm bill survey to farmers, ranchers and other interested stakeholders in my home state of South Dakota. Hundreds of South Dakotans completed the survey, communicating their perspectives on our federal farm policy. As the Senate Agriculture Committee moves forward with the farm bill reauthorization process, I wanted to share the results of my survey with you. The survey respondents indicated the following:
  * A large portion of respondents are on a family farm that's been engaged in agriculture for around or over 100 years. The next largest group consisted of those who had been farming for 50+ years. These two groups combined to make up nearly the entire pool of responses. A very small group had been new farmers or farming for less than 30 years. 
   * Over 75 percent of survey participants felt that the 2002 Farm Bill works "very well" or "okay" for South Dakota. 
   * South Dakotans would like Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) legislation included in the upcoming farm bill. More than 78 percent of respondents would like to see legislation in the Farm Bill to more quickly enact COOL provisions. 
   * The majority of respondents wanted payments capped somewhere between $100,000 to $250,000 with no loop holes allowing larger payments. There was an idea presented of capping acreage instead of capping payments. 
  Respondents overwhelmingly agree that payments should go to the primary operators of the land rather than to owners, not actively participating in the farming process. They feel that the primary operators take all of the risk so they deserve the payment. 
   * More than 90 percent of South Dakotans said creating a program to deal with agricultural disaster in this next farm bill is very or somewhat important. 
   * FSA closures would pose significant problems to South Dakota farmers and ranchers. Seventy percent of respondents felt that the driving distance would pose as the greatest problem, nearly 60 percent believe lack of internet accessibility would be a problem and that FSA offices are the only location to gain important farm bill information, over 50 percent need their local FSA office to discuss how the new farm bill will affect them, and about 50 percent felt that office closure would impact rural development. 
   * Over 70 percent of survey participants felt that the White House's trade agreements have not worked or were only marginally working for South Dakota agriculture. Many were disappointed with the current trade agreements. They felt that the trade agreements helped either large corporations or foreign countries at the expense of the local small farmer. 
   * Respondents' suggestions for helping beginning and young farmers and ranchers to enter production agriculture varied from giving farmers easier access to loans and lower interest rates, to giving retiring farmers a tax break for selling to younger farmers or small farmers, to giving tax breaks for young or beginning farmers. 
   * In responding to what various programs would be useful in developing the renewable fuels industry, over 65 percent of survey participants would like incentives for cellulosic ethanol production, 60 percent believe extending ethanol tax credits would bolster the ethanol industry, and 58 percent feel that there should be ethanol and renewable fuels education made available for the public and in schools. 
   * Respondents wanted the federal government to focus programs for small farmers and to stop assisting large corporations. 
  I wish to thank you in advance for your consideration of these very important results, and appreciate our continued working relationship for this upcoming farm bill reauthorization process.
  Sincerely,
  Johnson
