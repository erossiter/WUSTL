SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $575,000 TO BOOST RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will award $575,000 to the Oglala Sioux Tribe to combat domestic violence on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  
   "The effects of domestic violence and other crimes against women can be devastating for victims and their families," said Johnson. "This funding will help strengthen the judicial system's ability to protect victims and punish offenders. Combining violence prevention programs with an increased law enforcement response can make a real difference in ensuring the safety of Indian women." 
   Funding for this grant comes from the Office on Violence Against Women of the DOJ. The Oglala Sioux Tribe will use this grant from the STOP Violence Against Indian Women Discretionary Grant Program to hire new community education personnel, police officers, and court officials. The grant will also support the Najin Win Oti shelter and efforts to collect statistical data on domestic violence. 
   This program implements certain provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which is set to expire on September 30, 2005. Senator Johnson recently cosponsored legislation that will reauthorize VAWA and increase funding for the Act. 
   "With the reauthorization of VAWA, we can continue the strides that have already been taken to help combat domestic violence in Indian country," said Johnson.
