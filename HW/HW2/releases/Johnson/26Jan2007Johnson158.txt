SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE: FREE TAX HELP AVAILABLE FOR SOUTH DAKOTANS
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office today announced help for South Dakotans during this tax season. Two programs from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will provide tax preparation services in numerous towns and cities across South Dakota for all senior citizens, military personnel and their families, and individuals or families with personal incomes of $39,000 or less.  
   There are sites in Aberdeen, Brookings, Bullhead, Cannonball, Eagle Butte, Estilline, Ft. Meade, Ft. Yates, Hill City, Hot Springs, Huron, Kenel, Kyle, Little Eagle, Madison, McLaughlin, Mission, Mitchell, Mobridge, Newell, Piedmont, Pierre, Philip, Porcupine, Rapid City, Sioux Falls, Sisseton, Spearfish, Turton, Vermillion, Wakpala, Wanblee, Watertown, Webster and Yankton. 
   Johnson has said that "tax forms can seem like they're written in a language that no one understands, these programs are there to help South Dakotans navigate the process." Volunteers at tax preparation sites will utilize software to prepare non-business tax returns for 2006 tax forms due on April 15, 2007. 
   The tax preparation will be done in conjunction with two programs, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program. The TCE Program allows senior citizens, defined as those aged 60 and above, to seek free tax preparation assistance. The VITA Program allows for military personnel and their families and any individual or family with an income of $39,000 or less to seek free assistance with preparing their taxes. This volunteer service is strictly for non-business Form 1040's, not Schedule C businesses or Schedule F businesses or partnerships or corporations. 
   A link to local sites with the dates and hours of operation for both the VITA and TCE Programs is available on Johnson's website at http://johnson.senate.gov/. Some of the sites are by appointment only, and phone numbers are listed for those sites. There may be more sites available throughout South Dakota as April 15 approaches. 
   Items taxpayers need to bring to the VITA/TCE Sites to have their tax returns prepared are: * Proof of identification 
   * Social Security Cards for you, your spouse and dependents and/or a Social Security Number verification letter issued by the Social Security Administration 
   * Birth dates for you, your spouse and dependents on the tax return 
   * Current year's tax package if you received one 
   * Wage and earning statement(s) Form W-2, W-2G, 1099-R, from all employers 
   * Interest and dividend statements from banks (Forms 1099) 
   * A copy of last year's Federal and State returns if available 
   * Bank Routing Numbers and Account Numbers for Direct Deposit 
   * Total paid for day care provider and the day care provider's tax identifying number (the provider's Social Security Number or the provider's business Employer Identification Number) 
   * To file taxes electronically on a married filing joint tax return, both spouses must be present to sign the required forms.
