SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS PASSAGE OF LABOR-HHS BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) was disappointed today with a procedural move that put funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs on hold, but was pleased to see that the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education funding bill cleared another hurdle with Senate passage by a vote of 56 to 37. It is now on its way to the President for his approval. The bill will provide more than $8 million for South Dakota, including $2 million for the medical school at the University of South Dakota. 
  "We had two funding bills ready to go, but the minority stalled the process," Johnson said.
  On Monday, the conference reports for both the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs (Milcon/VA) and Related Agencies and the Labor-HHS-Education funding bills were approved by House and Senate negotiators. Today, a procedural motion pulled the MilCon/VA funding from the bill, which included $37.2 billion for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), $4.5 billion more than last year and $2.5 billion more than the President's request. 
  An earlier version of the Labor-HHS-Education bill passed the Senate with 75 votes. An earlier version of the MilCon/Va bill passed with 92 votes in favor of it.
  "This is a time when we should be working together to get funding in place for next year. I stand by the funding I was able to secure for South Dakota as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. These are valuable projects that will enhance research opportunities at our universities, address drug use in our communities and provide better health care around the state," Johnson continued.
