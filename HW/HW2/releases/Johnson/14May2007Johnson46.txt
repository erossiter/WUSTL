SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $60,000 IN FUNDING FOR WAGNER AIRPORT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Wagner Municipal Airport will receive $60,000 in funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for airport enhancements.  
   "This funding will improve transportation conditions at the Wagner Municipal Airport," Johnson said. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I support ongoing efforts to improve travel conditions in and around South Dakota to help provide our communities with continued economic development opportunities. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." The grant will fund improvements to the apron to repair severe cracks and frost heaving in the pavement, and assist the airport in complying with FAA standards. The President's proposed Fiscal Year 2008 Budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program by 23 percent, or $627 million, to $2.73 billion, as compared to the Fiscal Year 2007 budget level of $3.35 billion. As a member of both the Senate Budget and Senate Appropriation Committees, Senator Johnson has worked to restore the proposed cuts to this important economic development and safety program.
