SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR LAKOTA FUND
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lakota Fund will receive a $250,000 federal grant to continue economic development in the area. The funding is through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and will be used to help families secure housing.  
   "This funding will allow the Lakota Fund to continue to expand housing and economic opportunities on Pine Ridge," said Johnson. "As a member of both the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight for funding that allows our tribal community to continue to grow. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The Lakota Fund is dedicated to improving economic opportunities on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation through business loans, technical assistance, and targeted community and business development strategies. According to its mission statement, the Lakota Fund actively promotes the socioeconomic sustainability of the Oglala Lakota Oyate (people) with culturally appropriate strategies. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Planhttp://johnson.senate.gov. is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded.
