MARSHALL COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) has selected Marshall County as his September 2005 "County of the Month."  
 The county is highlighted on a special section of this website. 
   "Marshall County, the 'Gateway to Glacial Lakes of Northeastern South Dakota,' has much to offer," Johnson said. "From helping secure funding for the Britton Railroad to funding for education and fire safety, I am always proud to work on projects of utmost importance to the people of Marshall County." 
   Marshall County, located in the northeast corner of the states, was founded in 1885. Britton was selected as the temporary county seat because city promoters agreed to furnish free rooms to county officials for two years. After a few elections, the Marshall County Courthouse was built, and Britton became the official county seat. 
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments they are great places to live. Marshall County's proud history and its thriving present-day communities give residents much to be proud of."
