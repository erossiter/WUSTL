SEN. JOHNSON VISITS HARVEY DUNN ELEMENTARY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM
  As the school year gets underway, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) visited Harvey Dunn Elementary in Sioux Falls today to tour the after school program run by Youth Enrichment Services (YES).  
   "South Dakota has one of the highest rates of two person working households. Quality after school care is a necessity in our state," said Johnson. "Parents are working hard to make ends meet and want to know that their children are in good hands until they make it home for dinner."
   Johnson is a member of the Senate Afterschool Caucus, which advocates for adequate funding to provide for high-quality afterschool programs. Johnson also signed onto a Senate resolution designating October 12th as "Lights On Afterschool" to celebrate afterschool programs.
   The President's Fical Year 2007 budget calls for the largest cut in education funding in the Department of Education's 26-year history. This would result in cutting $2.1 billion and eliminating 42 education programs. The President's request would leave 2 million children without afterschool programs nationwide. Under the Fiscal Year 2007 budget, South Dakota would receive about $4.8 million, compared to the $12.3 million promised under No Child Left Behind. That means about 10,071 South Dakota students would be denied promised afterschool services.
   "It is important that we have high-quality afterschool programs to provide a safe and healthy place for kids," said Johnson. "This, in turn, will help students do better in school, and help working parents by creating a safe place for their children to go until the parents get home from work."
   Johnson was joined on the tour by Teresa Boysen, Principal Harvey Dunn Elementary; Karen Fogas, CEO of YES; Linda Hallstrom of the Sioux Falls Public Schools, along with CARE 4 directors and YES Board Members.
