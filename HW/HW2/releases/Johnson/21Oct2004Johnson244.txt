SEN. JOHNSON RESPONDS TO RABOBANK TERMINATION OF PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE FARM CREDIT SERVICES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today responded to reports that the Netherlands-based Rabobank has terminated its proposal to acquire the Omaha-based Farm Credit Services (FCS). Roughly 10,000 South Dakotans are FCS customers/stockholders.
   "I had significant concerns about the impact of the proposed Rabobank acquisition of Farm Credit Services of America on the agricultural community in South Dakota and the other three states that FCSA serves. It is crucial to ensure that our producers can access affordable, dependable credit, and that the Farm Credit System can continue to function as Congress intended."
