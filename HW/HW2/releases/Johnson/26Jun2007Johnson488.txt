SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $639,315 FOR BLACK HILLS SPECIAL SERVICES COOPERATIVE TO TRAIN AND RECRUIT TEACHERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative in Rapid City will receive a grant of $639,315 from the U.S. Department of Education's Transition to Teaching program. Together with partners, the Cooperative will recruit and train teachers for underserved areas of the state. 
  "It is crucial that South Dakota's teachers receive the resources needed to give students the highest quality education," said Johnson. "This funding for the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative assures that professionals preparing for a career in the classroom have what they need to educate our kids."
  The Transition to Teaching program recruits, trains and places individuals from other fields into teaching position in K-12 classrooms. It also provides support and mentoring for new teachers for up to one year after they are hired. Ongoing professional development is one of the goals cited by the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) as a way to retain teachers in schools and in the profession.
