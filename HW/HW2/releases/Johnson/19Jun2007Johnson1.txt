SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES LABOR-HHS FUNDING BILL PASSES SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that more than $10.75 million he requested for numerous projects for South Dakota was included in the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education spending bill for Fiscal Year 2008. The legislation today passed the Senate Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the bill is expected to pass the full Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday, and then go to the full Senate for consideration. 
  "This legislation provides funding for health and education programs that affect thousands of South Dakotans, particularly rural South Dakotans and our state's only medical school. The number of projects funded for South Dakota this year is a big victory for our state," Johnson said. "I appreciate Chairman Byrd's and Subcommittee Chairman Harkin's help throughout the appropriations process and for including the priorities I outlined to them in this bill." 
  Earmarks and projects that directly benefit South Dakota include: 
  EAST RIVER SPECIFIC FUNDING
  * USD Sanford School of Medicine: $2 million - South Dakota's only medical school, founded in 1907, is located at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion.

   * National Children's Study ($2.5 million for SDSU): The National Children's Study (NCS) is fully funded at $110.9 million. The President's 2008 budget proposal eliminates all future funding for the NCS. Brookings, South Dakota was selected as a Vanguard Center for the NCS, in part, because South Dakota State University successfully demonstrated advanced clinical research and data collection capabilities. SDSU will directly receive more than $2.5 million in Fiscal Year 2008 to continue work on the NCS. By following 100,000 children from birth to age 21, the National Children's Study will be the largest long-term study of human health ever conducted in the United States.
   * Dakota Wesleyan University's McGovern Library (DWU): $350,000- These funds will allow the McGovern Library to catalog, archive, and prepare material for display. Once prepared, materials will be available to the public for viewing and research. The facility will serve as a repository, laboratory, and a center for the development of future leaders, and will house the papers of former Senator George McGovern. 
  * Glory House Methamphetamine Addiction Treatment Center: $100,000- Glory House, in Sioux Falls, assists an average of 300 people annually in overcoming their addictions, yet must turn away more than 125 people each year due to lack of space. These funds will allow Glory House to expand their services to treat an additional 150 inpatients annually and to provide outpatient services to an addition 100 people. Glory House plans to build a 5,400 square foot building with space for outpatient facilities and housing for female methamphetamine addicts. 
  * Delta Dental of South Dakota (DDSD): $200,000- DDSD, based in Pierre but operates the Care Mobile statewide, has provided $1.7 million in free dental care to 4,000 South Dakota children since 2004. Demand for the Care Mobile now far exceeds its available time to provide services and it is booked through 2009. These funds will assist DDSD in adding a second unit to expand these vital services to Community Health Centers and reservations, serving adults in addition to children. 
  * Rural Oral Health Care Program: $200,000- This regional, Native American community-based Oral Health Program seeks to reduce early childhood caries (ECC) on Indian reservations by training technicians on reservations across South Dakota. American Indians have one of the highest rates of ECC in the world. The chronic pain and discomfort associated with ECC reduces a child's overall health status and general nutrition. ECC is also associated with an increase in middle ear infections and hearing loss. This funding will allow implementation of a community-based oral disease prevention program to enhance the overall quality of oral health in the rural Native American population. 
  * South Dakota Symphony and Black Hills Symphony: $100,000- This project proposes to combine the talents of the South Dakota Symphony (Sioux Falls) and the Black Hills Symphony (Rapid City) to produce a series of joint concerts and outreach events to promote music education and appreciation throughout the state. Proposed activities include a series of joint concerts featuring the South Dakota and Black Hills Symphonies; instrumental clinics; master classes; showcase of Native American compositions; "Meet the Composer" features; and educational outreach activities targeted at a variety of audiences, including preschool; grade school; high school; postsecondary education; and adult education. 
  * University Center - GEAR Center: $200,000- A series of expansions are planned for the Graduate Education and Applied Research (GEAR) Center in Sioux Falls.

  * Health Care Medical Technology, Inc. (HCMT): $100,000- This funding will allow HCMT to continue development of a web-based health, guidance, wellness, and career education software program for K-12 students and their teachers and parents. New portions of the website will include a culturally appropriate version for Native American students with a Lakota dictionary. This program is based in Sioux Falls, but available statewide. 
  * Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network: $675,000- Avera Research Institute, in partnership with health care organizations in seven other states, seeks to form a Network to develop, execute, and evaluate innovative, evidence-based chronic care initiatives focused on high cost fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who typically suffer from two or more chronic illnesses.

  * South Dakota State University Obesity Research Group: $125,000- SDSU has assembled an Obesity Research Group (SDSU-ORG) which consists of physicians, social scientists, and extension specialists and will invite collaborators from Native American colleges and private research organizations. SDSU-ORG's mission is to conduct basic and applied interdisciplinary research to prevent and treat obesity among rural Americans, with a special emphasis on children. 
  * South Dakota State University Biomaterials Research: $350,000- SDSU will use these funds to produce novel biomaterials for medical uses, working to address the medical community's current dissatisfaction with the performance of available biomaterials. The University aims to match any material developed to an unmet need in the medical field, to develop a screening process to demonstrate safety and efficacy to potential industry partners, and to develop the manufacturing expertise to produce the materials in South Dakota. 
   * University of South Dakota Center for Disabilities: $200,000- The Center for Disabilities will establish a Rural Substance Abuse Technical Assistance Center (RSATAC) to develop and improve prevention, treatment and care systems in the region. The ultimate goal will be to decrease the risk factors that result in children born affected by prenatal substance abuse. RSATAC will expand the work of the Consortium on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome to focus on all substance abuse. 
  WEST RIVER SPECIFIC FUNDING
  * Youth and Family Services (YFS): $300,000- YFS will use these funds for its Health Connections program, a health-focused case management and advocacy program for disadvantaged girls ages 5 to 15 in Rapid City.

  * Community Health Center of the Black Hills (CHCBH): $400,000- Formerly Rapid City Community Health Center, demand for CHCBH's services far exceeds current capacity. CHCBH seeks funds to purchase and retrofit a facility for use by several non-profit community organizations, including Pennington County Health, Rapid City Food Bank, West River Educational Center, and Western Resources for Disabled Independence. In addition to expanding its current medical and oral health services, CHCBH seeks to increase mental health and pharmacy services.
  * West River Foundation: $100,000- The West River Foundation for the Midwest Alliance for Professional Learning and Leadership (MAPLE) focuses on professional development for teaching, learning, and leadership in South Dakota. MAPLE is a collaborative community for education stakeholders in South Dakota. MAPLE will serve as a clearinghouse, providing access to comprehensive information about upcoming events, courses, or workshops providing professional development opportunities for educators and other interested parties across the region. In addition, MAPLE will design and provide new professional development experiences for educational stakeholders. 
  TRIBAL SPECIFIC FUNDING
  * Rosebud Sioux Tribe Piya Mani Otipi: $150,000- Piya Mani Otipi (PMO) is an innovative residential and outpatient therapeutic service provider to Native American youth age 13-17 on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. PMO, based on traditional Lakota values, gives youth an alternative outlet for emotional growth and learning that allows them to participate both mentally and physically in their own healing process. This funding will be used to reduce suicide, delinquency, and substance abuse among Native American youth as evidenced by subjective and qualitative data gathered from the students, teachers, staff/faculty and parents. 
  * Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Meth Prevention Program: $400,000- The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has seen an increase in the production and use of methamphetamine in recent years. This situation has reached epidemic proportions and drastically affects community stability. Reduced tribal law enforcement, court and special service funding results in an inability to prevent the rapid spread of methamphetamine distribution and use. This funding will support intervention, prevention, and education services to combat this epidemic. 
  * Rosebud Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center: $800,000- The Rosebud Sioux Tribe, like many other parts of the state, has seen a significant increase in their methamphetamine-related arrests and hospitalizations. In an effort to help those already addicted overcome dependency, Johnson secured funding to build a special wing for methamphetamine treatment and rehabilitation. 
  * Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chemical Prevention Program: $400,000- The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chemical Prevention Program will design an inpatient residential treatment center on the reservation. Currently, the Chemical Prevention Program utilizes a referral system for inpatient treatment, which is not available for adults within the boundaries of the Standing Rock Reservation. The waiting list for inpatient treatment is up to 90 days in some cases. On the Standing Rock Reservation, approximately 20-60% of adults have drug/alcohol abuse issues and methamphetamine abuse is increasing. 
  * Rosebud Inter-facility Transport: $200,000-The Rosebud Sioux Tribe Ambulance Service serves Todd, Tripp, Jackson, Bennett and Mellette counties and averages more than 5,000 calls annually. The Service transports patients inside and outside the state as well as within the reservation. Due to the extensive area covered, Johnson secured funding to purchase vehicles and related equipment. 
  NATIONAL PROJECTS with a SOUTH DAKOTA FOCUS
  Rural Health Outreach Grant Program The Senate bill includes $38.9 million for Rural Health Outreach grants. The President's budget proposal did not include funding for this program. These grants are available to rural communities working to provide health care services through new and creative strategies, including telemedicine and trauma care services. 
  Rural Health Flexibility Program (formerly Medicare Rural Health Flexibility Program) The Senate bill provides $63.538 million in 2008 for rural hospital flexibility grants. The President's proposed to completely eliminate this program, which supports Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), rural health networks and rural emergency medical services throughout rural states. 
  Head Start will see a $200 million increase over last year's request of $6.79 billion and $300million over the President's FY2008 request. Head Start is a comprehensive program that provides early education, health and nutrition services to children before entering elementary school. Also, in the bill, the Committee noted "the serious need for additional and expanded Head Start facilities in rural areas among Native American populations." Furthermore, the Committee stated that the Department could aide these communities "by providing minor construction funding, as authorized, in Native American Communities."
