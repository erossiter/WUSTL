SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON RELEASE OF IRAQ STUDY GROUP REPORT, RECOMMENDATIONS
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today discussed the release of the Iraq Study Group's report. When asked, he reacted to the Group's recommendations as a jumping off point for continued efforts to resolve the United States' involvement in the Iraq conflict: 
 I think the Iraq Study Group's report is a very constructive contribution to our debate over Iraq. Their description of the circumstances in Iraq as 'grave' and 'deteriorating' are right on. 
 It is a grim picture of a conflict that has now lasted longer that World War II. The Commission's recommendation that the United States should encourage neighboring countries to be more involved and to engage in diplomacy with Syria and Iran is a positive step. 
 We have done a great deal for Iraq. Only the Iraqi people and the Iraqi political leadership can make the decisions necessary to adopt democracy. We have rid them of Saddam Hussein, created a situation where a constitution could be written and elections held, but the 'end game' to the situation in Iraq is less military than it is political. 
 It's my hope that we can begin, very quickly, to redeploy American troops into safer circumstances, with a greater emphasis on training and a handing off of military responsibilities to the Iraqis.
