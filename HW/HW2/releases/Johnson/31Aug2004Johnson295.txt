RAPID CITY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY RECEIVES $8.4 MILLION CONTRACT TO BUILD NEW ELLSWORTH FACILITY FOR B-1B CREW TRAINING
  Sen. Tom Daschle and Sen. Tim Johnson announced today that Heavy Constructors, Inc., of Rapid City, has been awarded an $8.4 million contract at Ellsworth Air Force Base.  
 Under the terms of the contract, Heavy Constructors, doing business as Gustafson Builders, will build a new flight-simulator facility for B-1B crew training.
   Daschle and Johnson secured funding for the project as part of the Military Construction Appropriations Act of 2004. 
   "The B-1B bomber fleet at Ellsworth Air Force Base is critical to our national security. Flight simulators provide our crews with skills and experience they can't get any other way," Senator Daschle said. "This project will be important not only for our national defense, but also for the local Rapid City economy. My congratulations to Gustafson Builders."
   "Ellsworth, Rapid City, and our nation's defense will benefit from this important contract," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "We are proud of the unique role Ellsworth plays in our national security."
   The new facility is related to consolidation of the B-1B fleet, which has led to Ellsworth receiving two flight simulators instead of the previous single simulator. With two simulators, crews will be able to train as they fight - in pairs. The estimated completion date for the construction is March 3, 2006. 
   "This is another step toward making Ellsworth one of the most modern, effective facilities in the Air Force," Daschle said. "In the last six years, we have worked in the Senate to fund 10 projects worth $124 million. That's more than double the amount proposed for Ellsworth by either the President or the House of Representatives."
