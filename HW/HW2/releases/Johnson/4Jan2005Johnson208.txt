SEN. JOHNSON CONGRATULATES NEWLY ELECTED HOUSE, SENATE MEMBERS AS THEY ARE SWORN INTO OFFICE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement on the day that newly elected members of the Senate and House of Representatives were sworn into office: 
   Today, as our state's senior Senator, I will escort John Thune into the chamber of the United States Senate as he was sworn into office as South Dakota's newest Senator.
   I welcome John to the Senate, and I congratulate him and Stephanie Herseth on their respective victories this past November. Their participation in the swearing-in ceremonies today should be a source of great pride and satisfaction to both of them, as well as to their families and many friends. 
   We are a small and relatively junior delegation, but I believe that we can together accomplish great things for the people of our state and nation if we, in good faith, bring a spirit of cooperation, respect and civility to all our joint endeavors. Today is a day to put the past several years of tumultuous politics behind us, and begin this new 109th Congress as Americans and South Dakotans rather than as political partisans.
