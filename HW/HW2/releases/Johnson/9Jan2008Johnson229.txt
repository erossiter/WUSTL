SEN. JOHNSON MEETS WITH STATE FAIR REPRESENTATIVES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today met with local officials and representatives of the South Dakota State Fair to discuss the yearly event and the federal funding he fought to secure for the South Dakota State Fair Foundation in the recent Omnibus spending bill. 
  "While I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the fair this year, I am glad I could be in Huron today to meet with representatives of the South Dakota State Fair following a successful event last year," Johnson said. "The fair is a great way to showcase everything our state has to offer, and I am proud to have secured $196,000 in the funding for the South Dakota State Fair Foundation."
  A member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, Johnson fought to secure $196,000 in funding for the South Dakota State Fair Foundation as part of the Omnibus spending bill that will be used to upgrade the Open Class Beef Complex and Hippodrome.
  Johnson was joined at the event by Bill Even, South Dakota Secretary of Agriculture; George Williams, Deputy Secretary of the South Dakota Department of Agriculture; Pam Crawford, Acting State Fair Manager; Warren Lotsberg, South Dakota State Fair Board Member; and David McGirr, Mayor of Huron.
