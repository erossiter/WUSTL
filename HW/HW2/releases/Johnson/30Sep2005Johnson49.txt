SEN. JOHNSON CO-SPONSORS MEDICARE DO NOT CALL ACT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today co-sponsored legislation with Sen.  
 Jon Corzine (D-NJ) that would create a Medicare Part D Do Not Call List. This legislation would prohibit health plans from telemarketing their new Medicare prescription drug plans to beneficiaries. 
   "We don't need more calls from telemarketers at dinnertime trying to sell us what they consider to be the best plan," said Johnson. "I want to be certain that South Dakotans have enough information before they are expected to make a decision on Medicare Part D, but I think that it'd be a mistake to allow health insurance companies to market their products through aggressive telemarketing campaigns. There are plenty of other, less invasive ways that these companies can get their information to Medicare beneficiaries." 
   The bill permits representatives of insurance companies offering the Medicare prescription drug benefit to speak with and return calls to beneficiaries who initiate contact. It also permits plans to call beneficiaries that are already enrolled in their plans. The prohibition only applies to solicitation calls. 
   Additionally, the bill provides funding to State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) to conduct outreach and education on the Medicare Part D benefit. The bill also creates criminal penalties for telemarketing fraud relating to the program. Finally, it directs the Secretary to educate beneficiaries about the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Medicare fraud hotline.
