SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TODD COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Todd County will receive a federal grant of $3,607 to assist farmers in developing renewable energy systems. The grant will be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development.  
  "We must do all we can to encourage alternative sources of energy in our state. This funding for Todd County will help farmers and agricultural producers make the changes necessary to decrease our use of fossil fuels," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment to help farmers."
  Funds will be used to convert an irrigation motor from diesel power to electric power, as well as to assist farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses in making energy-efficient improvements to their operations. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
