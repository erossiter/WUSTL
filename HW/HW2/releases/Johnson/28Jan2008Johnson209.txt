SEN. JOHNSON: SOUTH DAKOTANS LOOKING FOR COMMON-SENSE SOLUTIONS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement as the President prepares to deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress this evening: 
  As President Bush prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address, South Dakotans are looking for sensible solutions to the serious issues our nation is facing. As gas prices continue to rise, health care costs skyrocket and our economy begins to slow, Americans are looking to hear a plan from the President that will benefit our middle class and improve our nation's standing at home and abroad. 
  Rural America is facing unique challenges, but it can also be a source of strength and prosperity for our nation. I hope the President will recognize the potential the Heartland has to move our country forward and away from foreign energy sources through the use of renewable resources like ethanol and wind energy. 
  It will take a healthy amount of bipartisanship and cooperation to address our nation's biggest challenges. Neither party has all the answers, and I hope tonight's speech will encourage Republicans and Democrats alike to come together and find the common ground necessary to tackle these issues. I am prepared to work in good faith with President Bush and members of both parties to do so.
  I am grateful for President Bush's kind words in last year's State of the Union address, and I am looking forward to joining my colleagues in the chamber to hear from the President firsthand this evening. 
  Johnson will release reaction to the speech following President Bush's State of the Union address this evening.
