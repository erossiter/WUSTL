SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $180,000 FOR HORIZON HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Horizon Health Care will receive $180,000 to improve technology to integrate electronic health information, making patients' records more readily available to their doctors. 
   "Horizon Health Care is a vital resource for many South Dakotans and this funding will help them to better care for their patients," Johnson said. "This new technology will allow patient records and other health services to be more easily shared among Community Health Centers. It's important that people in rural areas have access to high-quality health care."
   The funding for Horizon Health Care comes from the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA). The grant program is called the Rural Health Network Development Program. The funding itself is a yearly installment of a grant that will total $540,000 over three years to greatly improve health care services in South Dakota.
   Johnson has been a long-time supporter of Horizon Health Care and was instrumental in getting funding for this grant.
   Horizon Health Care operates 24 health care centers throughout South Dakota and provides vital services for many South Dakotans.
