SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR SISSETON WAHPETON OYATE TO HELP VIOLENT CRIME VICTIMS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate will receive a grant of $150,000 from the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs to provide services to victims of violent crimes.  
  "Violent crimes impact not only victims, but families and communities as well," Johnson said. "This funding will provide the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate with the resources necessary to assist victims-in-need and improve the services American Indian victims receive." 
  Though urban crime rates have declined over the last few years, crime rates on reservations have increased. American Indians are more than twice as likely to be a victim of violent crime than non-Indians.
  This funding will be used to provide direct services to victims of violent crimes including counseling, emergency services, and court accompaniment.
