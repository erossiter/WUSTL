SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $50,000 IN FUNDING FOR MITCHELL POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Mitchell Police Department will receive a $50,000 grant to hire a police officer to monitor and protect the Mitchell Public School System.  
   "I am pleased the Mitchell Police Department received this funding." Johnson said. "With our children spending so much time at school, parents should feel confident in their safety. Having police in public schools helps take the stress of safety off the administrators and teachers, and allows them to focus on education." 
   The funds for the Mitchell Police Department will be provided by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). The grants allocated by COPS are intended to support efforts to improve security at schools. The Mitchell Police Department will use their funding to enhance school safety and acquire a police officer committed to keeping the public schools safe. 
   Grantees are required to contribute a local match of 50 percent toward the total cost for the approved grant project.
