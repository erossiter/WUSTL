SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR MID-CENTRAL EDUCATIONAL COOPERATIVE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Mid-Central Educational Cooperative will receive a $999,236 federal grant for advancements in history education. The grant comes through the U.S. Department of Education's Teaching American History Grants Program. 
  "Teachers play a vital roll in shaping students future and deserve the best resources available," said Johnson. "This type of funding will provide teachers with resources they need to educate South Dakota students. I will continue to use my seniority in the Senate to fight for funding to improve schools across the state."
  The Department of Education's Teaching American History Grants Program provides teachers with increased access to up-to-date materials and additional training that will strengthen student's knowledge of American history. The training program created with these grant funds will be available to teachers from 70 school districts in eastern and south central South Dakota.
  Johnson pushed the Department of Education to award this funding for the We Americans project. The funding will benefit school districts in eastern and southern South Dakota, including Armour, Burke, Colome, Corsica, Gregory, Kimball, Mitchell, Mt Vernon, Plankinton, Platte-Geddes, Stickney, Wessington Springs and White Lake. It will also benefit schools in Educational Service Agency Regions 1 and 3.
  The Senate FY 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill includes $117.9 million for this program, which is approximately $67.9 million more than the President's budget request. The President has again requested $50 million for this program in Fiscal Year 2009. Senator Johnson is a strong supporter of education funding and will continue to push for funding for South Dakota schools.
