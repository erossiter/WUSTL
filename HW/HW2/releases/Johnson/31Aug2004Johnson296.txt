SENS. DASCHLE, JOHNSON ANNOUNCE $364,535 GRANT TO DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Tom Daschle and Sen. Tim Johnson announced today that Dakota State University will receive a grant of $364,535 from the Strengthening Institutions Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Education.  
 The funding is the fiscal year 2004 installment of what is expected to be a five-year grant.
   DSU will use the funds to support student success and retention programs. Specifically, administrators will create a student support system that includes student tracking capabilities, increase accountability and oversight by enhancing the university's data collection methods, and redesign tutoring programs and basic education courses to better equip students for success. Implementation of these initiatives will involve hiring full-time retention and student support specialists, and an activity director and development specialist.
   "I'm glad to see DSU committed to improving not just the courses it offers, but the very core of their educational mission: students' investment in their own success," Senator Daschle said. "Tackling a college degree can be a challenge, and enhanced tutoring, tracking, and retention efforts at DSU will help to ensure that, once involved, students keep at it until they achieve their goals."
   "I am pleased to have helped secure funding for the Strengthening Institutions Program so that DSU can reorganize and redevelop some academic programs to better meet the needs of their students," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "We want all of our students to receive the best possible education and take advantage of the outstanding programs available to them."
