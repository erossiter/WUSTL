SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES MORE THAN ONE MILLION IN FUNDING TO DECREASE VIOLENT CRIME
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Office of the Attorney General of South Dakota will receive federal grants totaling $1,002,133 to decrease violent crime and provide medical treatment to victims. The funding comes through the Department of Justice. 
  "This funding will provide significant resources for South Dakotans who are victims of violent crimes and provide the resources necessary to increase safety," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  A grant of $737,133 from the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women will be used to train personnel, enhance victim safety and prosecute cases of violent crime. An additional grant of $265,000 from the Office for Victims of Crime will be used to assist victims of violent crime, including child abuse, domestic crime, and rape.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
