SEN. JOHNSON PUSHES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES MISSION AT ELLSWORTH
  In a letter today to Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) offered additional support for a financial services mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base. After months of contact by Johnson's staff with the Air Force, Johnson wrote today to ask for an update on the process and determine if there is any additional assistance the Air Force may need during this deliberation process. A final decision is expected this spring.
   "Without question, Ellsworth is a world-class military installation due in large part to the upgraded facilities at the base. Prior to the recent base closure round, Ellsworth received nearly $140 million in military construction projects, including funding for new buildings and military housing. I firmly believe this investment, coupled with the high quality of life the Rapid City area offers to our men and women in uniform, make Ellsworth Air Force Base an ideal candidate for the central processing and contact center," Johnson said in his letter to Wynne.
   In late September 2005, Air Force officials conducted a site survey of Ellsworth Air Force Base to see if it is capable of operating a central processing center (CPC) and a contact center to deliver financial management services to military personnel. The financial mission will consist of approximately 775 employees who will perform customer service duties.
   Last year the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recognized that Ellsworth Air Force Base is a premier military installation, and voted to remove it from the base closure list. Johnson, the entire South Dakota delegation and Governor Rounds were vocal advocates of EAFB.
