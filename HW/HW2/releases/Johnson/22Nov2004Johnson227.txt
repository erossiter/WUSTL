SOUTH DAKOTA DELEGATION ANNOUNCES VA-HUD SPENDING LEVELS
  Sens. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Rep. Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) today announced funding levels for South Dakota projects contained in the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies spending bill (VA-HUD). The bill passed the House and Senate as part of the Omnibus spending bill late Saturday. 
   "Whether providing funding for the Sturgis Industrial Park or community projects on our reservations, this bill allows development across our state," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Water and wastewater infrastructure is critical to our communities."
   "I was pleased to help secure funding for these projects. This funding will give communities the resources they need to improve services to residents and enhance infrastructure to spur economic development," Senator Daschle said. "Each project represents a step forward, whether it means a more efficient, modernized water system or a facility that will give young people the direction they need to become successful, productive members of their communities." 
   "This legislation funds a variety of economic development projects across South Dakota. From community centers like the YMCA, arts centers like the Dahl in Rapid City, or funding for low income housing, this bill will lead to increased quality of life for all South Dakotans," said Rep. Herseth.
   The bill includes the following South Dakota projects at the request of the delegation:
   * $500,000 for the Sturgis Industrial Park - This initiative will help the community of Sturgis to promote economic development and job creation in the region. In recent years, Sturgis has successfully worked to attract and foster industrial growth in the area. This funding will develop needed infrastructure necessary to accommodate continued economic opportunity.
   * $400,000 for the Sioux Falls Family YMCA - This funding will assist in the construction of a new YMCA facility in a growing community of western Sioux Falls.
   * $250,000 for the Rapid City YMCA - This project will complete construction of a teen wellness center. The work would provide outfit the room with electrical, HVAC and finish work along with acquiring age-appropriate cardiovascular and strength training equipment. The YMCA of Rapid City is in a prime position to impact the young people of our community by instilling wellness habits that will combat youth obesity, which leads to diabetes and other physical problems.
   * $371,250 for the Cheyenne River Youth Project - This initiative will help to develop a youth center in Eagle Butte to serve teens in the region. The Youth Project will provide a much-needed venue for teens to congregate and socialize in a supportive, healthy environment.
   * $1.4 million for the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Project - The Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place brings together the tribes of the Great Sioux Nation in a coordinated effort to promote cultural healing and mutual determination to enhance the lives of Native American people. Wakpa Sica will enhance the knowledge and understanding of the history of Native American's and their culture. In addition, the project will establish the Sioux Nation Tribal Supreme Court and facilities for mediation and conflict resolution.
   * $1.5 million for Huron water infrastructure - Huron is planning upgrades to their water and wastewater systems to accommodate the needs for the Dakota Turkey Growers processing plant and the Ridgefield Farms Premium Hereford Beef processing plants. Huron is expecting these facilities to create 1,300 new jobs and additional jobs in ancillary businesses and industries.
   * $600,000 for the Green Valley Water District - These funds will extend infrastructure to the Green Valley Sanitation District to allow area residents to hook up to Rapid City municipal water services. This initiative will ensure that homes and businesses in the area have access to safe, clean water supplies.
   * $400,000 for Tyndall water infrastructure - This funding will replace and upgrade water and sewer infrastructure in the city. The community's water main was constructed in the 1950's and is in dire need of replacement to prevent a potential system failure. The existing water main is simply outdated and undersized to meet the needs of the City's water distribution system. During construction the street will be removed for the installation of the water line and the City sees this as an opportunity to replace the sanitary sewer in this area. 
   This project will make important investments in the City's core infrastructure to enhance services to residents and promote opportunities for commercial growth in the region. 
   Each of the projects will be subject to an across-the-board cut of .83%, which the White House mandated.
   "I am pleased that this bill provides $1.2 billion more for veterans' health care than what was included in the President's budget," said Johnson. "Our nation's veterans were promised that their health care needs would be taken care of when they joined up. We need to do better at keeping that promise."
   "The funding for veterans programs in this bill keeps our programs above water, but it is clear that we must commit additional resources to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs can deliver the level of care our veterans earned with their service and wholeheartedly deserve," Daschle said. 
   Herseth added, "While this report provides increased funding beyond the President's request for veterans' healthcare, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am disappointed that it still it still falls $1.3 billion below the amount we requested in committee. At a time when we are asking our servicemen and women for greater sacrifices, we must make sure we fulfill our promises. I will continue working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure veterans receive the benefits they have earned."
