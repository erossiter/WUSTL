SEN. JOHNSON REACTS TO WHITE HOUSE'S NUMBERS FOR VETERANS AFFAIRS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (VA) Appropriations Subcommittee, was glad to see a minor increase in the VA budget, but acknowledges that it does not meet the demand placed on the VA.  
  "The Administration has proposed an increase in funding for the VA, but I'm concerned the need will outpace the increase. The war in Iraq is increasing the demand for VA health care. The President is asking veterans to pay more in fees, but using these fees for deficit reduction rather than enhance their care. We've asked enough of these men and women. Now it's time to pay them their due and follow through on the promises we've made to them," Johnson said. 
  For FY 2009, the Administration has proposed a $1.7 billion increase in discretionary spending over last year's enacted level. 
  * There is a $1.5 billion increase in Medical Services for the VA from FY08 enacted to this FY09 request. This is an increase, but below previous Veterans Administration estimates of what they need to care for our nation's veterans. 
  * There are significant cuts to medical research - this will directly impact PTSD and TBI research - at a time when the need is growing, funding is decreasing for medical research. 
  * The White House has injected another "fees proposal" - essentially imposing fees & taxes on vets, including a proposed increase on pharmaceutical co-pays from $8 to $15. Further, this increase does not enhance VA funding, but returns it to the general Treasury fund.
