SEN. JOHNSON COMMENDS GLORY HOUSE GROUNDBREAKING
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) commented on the groundbreaking for Glory House Methamphetamine Addiction Treatment Center in Sioux Falls today for a 5,400 square foot building with space for outpatient facilities and housing for female methamphetamine addicts.  
  Earlier this week, Johnson voted for the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education conference report that included $150,000 in funding he requested for Glory House. 
  "I am so pleased that Glory House is expanding and will be able to help more people overcome meth addiction," Johnson said. "As an appropriator, I was proud to support Glory House by requesting funding in this year's Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, which the Senate approved earlier this week."
  Glory House assists an average of 300 people annually in overcoming addiction, but turns away more than 125 people each year due to lack of space. The funds included in the Labor-HHS and Education conference report will help Glory House to expand their services to treat an additional 150 inpatients annually and to provide outpatient services to an additional 100 people.
