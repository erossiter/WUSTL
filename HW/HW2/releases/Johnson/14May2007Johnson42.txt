SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $128,250 IN FUNDING FOR HIGHMORE AIRPORT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Highmore Municipal Airport will receive $128,250 in funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for airport enhancements.  
   "This funding will improve transportation conditions at the Highmore Municipal Airport," Johnson said. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I support ongoing efforts to improve travel conditions in and around South Dakota to help provide our communities with continued economic development opportunities. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   The grant will fund the construction of a snow removal equipment building and the purchase of a new snow plow. The improvements will assist the airport in complying with FAA regulations. The President's proposed Fiscal Year 2008 Budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program by 23 percent, or $627 million, to $2.73 billion, as compared to the Fiscal Year 2007 budget level of $3.35 billion. As a member of both the Senate Budget and Senate Appropriation Committees, Senator Johnson has worked to restore the proposed cuts to this important economic development and safety program.
