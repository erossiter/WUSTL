SEN. JOHNSON RECEIVES AWARD FROM SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) accepted the first ever "Outstanding Contribution to Education Award" today, from the School Administrators of South Dakota at the Ramkota Inn. 
   "I am honored to receive this award," said Johnson. "Our children are our most valuable resource and the better job we do in educating, the brighter South Dakota's future will be."
   Johnson understands that federal education funding is facing yet another shortfall. This year the President's proposed budget for 2007 for the largest cut in education funding in the Department of Education's 26-year history. This would result in eliminating 42 education programs by cutting $2.1 billion or 3.8 percent of the budget. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Johnson continues to work to ensure South Dakota Schools have the funding they need to sustain the best education possible. 
   In the President's Budget, No Child Left Behind would be underfunded by $15.4 billion. IDEA special education funding would also be shortchanged. Although the federal government has never lived up to the promise to provide 40 percent of the cost of special education, Johnson works to sustain funding for this program so it does not remain an unfunded mandate and burden on the state.
   Johnson also cosponsored legislation to stop the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid from eliminating reimbursements for school districts that provide services and transportation to disabled students. 
   The School Administrators of SD members are superintendents, principals, business managers, and directors of curriculum and special education.
