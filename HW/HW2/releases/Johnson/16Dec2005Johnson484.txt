SEN. JOHNSON VOTES IN SUPPORT OF PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today voted to close debate on the conference report reauthorizing and improving the USA Patriot Act. While the bill is imperfect, Johnson was comfortable enough with the bill to end debate and move to a final vote on the bill.  
   Unfortunately, efforts to end debate failed when more than forty Senators, including several Republicans, voted against bringing debate to a close. Sixty votes are required to end debate on a bill.
   "This final version of this legislation marks a substantial improvement over the House version of the bill," said Johnson. "The threat of terrorism still exists. It is important to give our law enforcement officials the tools they need, while maintaining proper Congressional and Judicial oversight. This bill also includes my anti-meth legislation and retains a favorable funding formula for determining Homeland Security funds for rural states." 
   Johnson is a strong supporter of the anti-meth provision included in the bill, which is based on the Combat Meth Act of 2005 that Johnson cosponsored. This provision would limit access to large quantities of cold medicines that contain pseudophedrine, a major component of methamphetamines. Meth is a highly addictive, powerful, and toxic drug that is becoming an increasingly serious problem in rural areas.
   This legislation reauthorizes provisions of the Patriot Act set to expire at the end of the year and makes certain changes to the bill, which was passed following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Johnson voted in favor of that bill in 2001, but wanted to ensure that reauthorization of the Patriot Act struck the right balance between protecting privacy rights and protecting the nation now that there has been time to review the full impact.
