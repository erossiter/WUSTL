SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $210,850 FOR WATERTOWN FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Watertown Fire Department will receive a $210,850 federal grant from theStaffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Program, which is operated by the US Department of Homeland Security. The program aims to enhance the ability of fire departments to maintain 24-hour staffing to assure adequate protection for citizens from fire and fire-related hazards. 
  "In rural counties in South Dakota, fire departments like the Watertown Fire Department play a crucial role in keeping residents safe," Johnson said. "It is essential that we have trained personnel capable of responding safely and effectively to an emergency. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  President Bush has proposed to eliminate the SAFER program in Fiscal Year 2009. In Fiscal Year 2008, the program received $190 million. Senator Johnson understands the importance of adequate staffing and properly equipping those who voluntarily risk their lives to protect the public. That is why he has repeatedly used his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to oppose these cuts.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
