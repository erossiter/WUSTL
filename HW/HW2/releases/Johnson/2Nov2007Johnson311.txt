SEN. JOHNSON MARKS NATIONAL ADOPTION AWARENESS MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Amiotte family of Long Valley, South Dakota will be featured in his Washington, DC office as part of the Voices for Adoption Adoptive Family Project. The family has been chosen by Voices for Adoption to represent South Dakota as part of the national program, aimed at informing individuals about adoption. A framed photo of the family will be placed in Senator Johnson's office throughout November.  
  "I have been promoting adoption throughout my service in the Senate. As a grandparent of two adopted grandchildren, I know firsthand how adoption can enrich a family," said Johnson, a founding member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. "Across South Dakota, families like the Amiotte's open their homes and hearts through adoption. It is my hope that the Adoptive Family Project will help put a personal face on the adoptive process."
  David and Malinda Amiotte have adopted four children, sisters JoAnne and Karen in 2005; and siblings Davis and Medina in 2006. 
  Johnson has been a supporter of making the adoption tax credit permanent to lessen this initial burden for adoptive families. Adoption proceedings and legal fees for some domestic adoptions can cost more than $40,000. 
  In South Dakota, nearly 1,600 children are in the foster care system. The average age of a child in foster care is nine years old. At the same time, in South Dakota, 100 children on average 'age out' of the foster care system each year before they are adopted.
