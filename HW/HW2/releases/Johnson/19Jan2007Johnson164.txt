GET WELL CARD FROM PIERRE RECEIVED IN WASHINGTON
  A get well card that hung in Gov. Mike Rounds' capital office has made its way to Washington, DC and now hangs in Sen. Johnson's Washington, DC office. Gov. Rounds had hung the card in his office and asked South Dakotans to sign messages to Sen. Johnson. The banner is more than 20 feet long and hangs above the Senator's personal office door awaiting his return. 
   "I want to thank the Governor for his warm support and all of South Dakota for keeping us in their prayers. It means the world to us," said Barb Johnson, wife of Senator Johnson.
   "After reading about the card and seeing the pictures, the banner was wonderful for the staff to receive here in D.C. It was quite a project to get it hung up, but people were excited and thankful to have the task," said Julianne Fisher, Communications Director.
