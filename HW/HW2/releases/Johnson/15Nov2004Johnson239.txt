SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF AGRICULTURE SECRETARY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon hearing of the resignation of Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman: 
   First, I would like to thank Secretary Veneman for her service and wish her the best in her future endeavors.
   As we look to the future, I respectfully ask the President of the United States to work with us in Congress in a bipartisan fashion to offer up a strong advocate for the producers and ranchers that help us put food on dinner tables around this country. I am asking that President Bush nominate a new Secretary of Agriculture who will work with Congress to save the mandatory country-of-origin labeling provision that was signed into law just two years ago.
   It is the law of the land. It needs to be implemented and we need a Secretary that will implement the law. It's just that simple. 
   We now have heard that the same members on the House Agriculture Committee that delayed COOL are now trying to make the entire program voluntary. The Senate has spoken on this issue by supporting my COOL provision and more recently, it supported the passage of Senator Daschle's resolution on COOL. We need a USDA leader who will stand up for our farmers and ranchers. 
   My first priority must be South Dakota's farmers and ranchers. I first introduced COOL while I was still in the House of Representatives more than a decade ago, and I fought for its inclusion in the current farm bill.
   As such, I must use mandatory COOL as one of the determining factors before providing my consent for the Secretary of Agriculture.
