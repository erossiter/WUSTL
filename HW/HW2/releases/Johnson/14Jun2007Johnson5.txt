SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $50,000 IN FUNDING FOR SOUTH DAKOTA ADVOCACY SERVICES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota Advocacy Services (SDAS) in Pierre will receive a $50,000 discretionary federal grant for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) protection and advocacy through the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration. 
  "This grant will support South Dakota Advocacy Services' work to protect the rights of people recovering from devastating brain injuries," Johnson said. "Funding like this ensures that South Dakotans have access to vital services including assistance with employment and housing issues."
  In 1996, Congress recognized the significance of TBI and authorized the Federal TBI Program, which funds grants for groups like SDAS. Today, TBI affects over five million Americans.
  According to their website, South Dakota Advocacy Services fights to ensure that the legal rights of South Dakotans with disabilities are respected. Through responding to claims of disability-related abuse, neglect, and discrimination, the SDAS ensures that South Dakotans with special health care needs gain access to their full entitlement benefits like Social Security and Medicare, while also helping them find employment and housing.
