SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $130,000 IN FUNDING FOR PHILIP AIRPORT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Philip Airport will receive a $130,000 federal grant from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for airport enhancements. 
   "This funding will improve transportation conditions at the Philip Airport," Johnson said. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I support ongoing efforts to improve travel conditions in and around South Dakota to help provide our communities with continued economic development opportunities. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a great example of that kind of investment."
   The grant will fund the construction of a snow removal equipment building, and install navigational aids to enhance aircraft operations safety.
   This funding comes from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). The President's proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2009 requests $2.75 billion for AIP, which is a $760 million cut from the $3.51 billion provided in 2008. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Johnson has worked to restore proposed cuts to this important program that enhances safety at our airports and strengthens economic development in our communities.
