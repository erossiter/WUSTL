SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CORSICA INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the City of Corsica will receive nearly a million dollars in multiple forms of federal funding to improve water and waste disposal. The loans and grants are provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   A low-interest federal loan of $595,000 and a grant of $26,325 will be used to improve the current wastewater system by improving the collection system and wastewater treatment facility. 
   A low-interest federal loan of $168,000 and a grant of $286,300 will be used to replace and add new water lines and loop lines to improve water delivery. 
   As part of his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for promoting economic development in South Dakota, Senator Johnson has pledged to defend USDA Rural Development infrastructure programs against proposed budget cuts. Johnson refers to these programs as an example of his strategy of "Investing in the Public Good," which means directing federal funds to initiatives that pay themselves back in the form of job creation and higher quality of life for South Dakotans. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
