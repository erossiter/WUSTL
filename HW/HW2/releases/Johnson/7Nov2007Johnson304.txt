SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS DEFENSE FUNDING BILL COMPROMISE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced his support for the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense spending bill conference report, which includes $39.79 million for South Dakota related projects. The conference report must now be passed by the House of Representatives and then the Senate. 
  The conference report includes $8.83 million for projects associated with the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and $7.68 million for projects associated with South Dakota State University, as well as $9 million to upgrade and modernize the B-1B fleet.
  "It is my hope the President will sign this bipartisan funding measure that provides resources for our troops, and will advance research to provide new tools to help them do their job," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "The bill includes over $8 million in funds I requested for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology and millions to upgrade and modernize the B-1B fleet."

  South Dakota State University funding:
   * Accelerated Materials Development and Characterization for Army Cannon Systems: $1.84 million 
   The Army Benet Weapons Lab is currently developing concepts for the next generation of lightweight cannon system for the Future Combat System (FCS). South Dakota State University will partner with Benet Weapons Lab to develop a fatigue testing system to test the dynamic load of components and predict the life and the reliability of cannon system parts. 
   * Fatigue Odometer for Vehicle Components and Gun Barrels Project: $2.64 million 
   South Dakota Science and Technology Corporation, Augusta Systems, Inc. and South Dakota State University are working with the U.S. Army Benet Laboratories (ABL), to develop innovative on-board sensor systems, and associated electronics and software, to provide more accurate and timely information on the wear-and-tear to military vehicle and weapon systems. 
   * Alternative Power Technology (APT) for Missile Defense: $3.2 million 
   South Dakota State University, with leadership from the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command's DARPA Office, and support from Radiance Technologies, Inc., is developing, prototyping, demonstrating, and validating alternative power technology (APT). 
  Other Funding Johnson secured for South Dakota:
   * Advanced Electronics Rosebud Integration Center (AERIC): $4 million 
   The Rosebud Sioux Tribe and Radiance Technologies, Inc., with program coordination and oversight by the U.S. Army's Space and Missile Defense Technical Center's (SMDTC) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) office, continues to research, develop, test, and demonstrate advanced electronics integration and fabrication technology on the Rosebud Sioux Tribe reservation in South Dakota. The primary focus of this program is to advance state-of-the-art Army defense system electronics by reducing the size, weight, and cost of electronic circuit cards, components, wire harnesses, and electronic cabling. Special emphasis will be given to reduce hazardous substances materials and to employ lead-free components in micro-electronic products. 
   * Next Generation Lightweight Drive System for Army Weapons Systems: $2 million 
   Dakota Power Incorporated (DPI) has developed technologies for significant reduction in the size and weight of electric drive systems to power Army weapons systems. 
  Exploding Foil Initiators with Nanomaterial-Based Circuits : $2.4 million 
  Black Hills Nanosystems Corporation, with oversight from Picatinny Arsenal, will manufacture Exploding Foil Initiator (EFI) devices. EFI devices ensure personnel safety by reducing the risk of unintended detonation. EFI devices are prohibitively expensive, especially for low-cost munitions. 
   MEMS Microdetonator Packaging Technology for Advanced DOD Weapons: $2.4 million
   This add will develop batch hermetic packaging of microdetonator devices. Black Hills Nanosystems Corporation, will partner with the Department of the Navy to develop batch hermetic packaging of microdetonator devices. The microdetonators needed by the Navy and the Marine Corps require hermetic packaging for long shelf life and reliable operation in harsh environments. 
   High Sentinel Stratospheric Airship: $4.64 million
   This add will provide the inflatable hull design and fabric specifications for the airship. The HiSentinelprogram will complete the development and flight testing of a new low-cost, expendable high-altitude unmanned airship. This vehicle will provide a long-duration platform for a wide range of military and intelligence applications, including surveillance, communications and networking. HiSentinel can be launched from any airport or large open area, and from its cruise altitude of 60,000-70,000 feet, the platform has a 360 degree, 600 mile field of view. Current high altitude platforms are limited to short duration missions of 24 hours or less. HiSentinel will provide an unmanned airship capable of carrying different payloads for durations greater than 30 days. 
   * Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) Qualification for Aging Weapons Systems Structural Repair: $1.6 million 
   The average age of operational weapons systems continues to climb due to budget constraints and the cost of developing replacement systems. Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) is a technology that has significant potential for extending the structural life and reducing cost in both near and long term sustainment of aging weapons systems. This project will use a methodical approach to qualifying LENS technologies for use as standard repair processes on families of similar components.

   ? Integrated Mechanical Diagnostics Health and Usage Management System and Condition Based Maintenance: $4.64 million
   The CH-53E helicopter is the work horse of the Marine Corps and has the highest maintenance burden and associated costs within the DOD helicopter fleet. Since 2001, the Marines have been equipping the fleet with the Integrated Mechanical Diagnostics health and usage management System (IMDS). This system automates and simplifies many maintenance tasks and collects data necessary to support the transition to Condition Based Maintenance. 
   * Modernization and Upgrade Program for the B-1B: $9 million 
   The B-1 aircraft provides a unique long range strike capability with a large and varied payload. Currently, B-1s are able to deploy with several types of launchers that are unique to the type of weapon. However, a new modification is now available and needed to fully exploit this capability and would provide better flexibility for the timely pairing of the weapons to targets.
