SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES YANKTON SIOUX TRIBE TO RECEIVE HOUSING GRANTS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Yankton Sioux Tribe will receive $503,280 in federal funding for housing activities through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program. 
  "This funding will help South Dakota tribes develop more safe and affordable homes for their members. Unfortunately, unsafe and inadequate housing is an all too familiar reality on many of the reservations throughout Indian County," Johnson said. "The Indian Housing Block Grant program is an important federal resource for tribes to improve living conditions and provide housing opportunities for Indian tribes in South Dakota and throughout the U.S." 
  The grant funding may be used for housing development, housing services to eligible families and individuals, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems.
  Johnson has long been a supporter of the IHBG program, and as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee, he has consistently fought to provide this important program with sufficient funding.
  The Indian Housing Block Grant Program (IHBG) was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). Federally recognized Indian tribes or their designated housing authorities are eligible for the block grants.
