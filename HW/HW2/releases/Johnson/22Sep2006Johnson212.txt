SEN. JOHNSON CALLS FOR VOTE ON TAX EXTENDERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson today expressed his frustration that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) will not move to take up the bill to extend tax breaks that expire this year. The bill would ensure that taxpayers in states like South Dakota would continue to be able to take a federal income tax deduction for state and local sales tax.  
   Johnson expressed his concern that this issue will not receive an up or down vote until after the mid term elections:
   Congress needs to take up the Tax Extenders legislation on a straight up and down vote. Senator [Chuck] Grassley (R-IA), Republican Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, acknowledges that.
   The extenders would include: tax breaks for college tuition, tax deductions for teachers' supplies and tax deductions for research and development.
   In South Dakota, I am particularly concerned that we retain our state sales tax deduction. South Dakota is one of eight states that does not have a state income tax. Currently we are allowed to deduct our sales tax liabilities from our federal income tax. We shouldn't be penalized for the tax structure that we have in South Dakota.
   All of these tax cuts need to be extended because they are going to expire this year. To hold all of these tax cuts, which have a broad bipartisan support, hostage to the Republican leadership's insistence that it must include a completely separate tax break for America's most fabulously wealthy, I think is an outrage.
   If we wait until after the election to address this issue, heaven knows what will happen. We shouldn't play games with taxpayers' pocket books; we need prioritize this vote and get these extenders passed now.
