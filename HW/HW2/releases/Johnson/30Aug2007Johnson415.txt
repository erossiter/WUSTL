The grant will be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development.  
  "This funding for the Yankton Sioux Tribe will lead to additional growth opportunities in our state and ensures that small businesses get the assistance they need," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment to help entrepreneurs."

The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks."
