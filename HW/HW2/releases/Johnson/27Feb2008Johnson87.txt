SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON PROGRESS OF FARM BILL NEGOTIATIONS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following update on farm bill negotiations: 
  The Senate and House agriculture committees are working together to get a hard budget number for the farm bill by the week's end. The farm bill is an urgent issue and we need compromise to get this done. The Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee have dedicated a lot of time to ironing out these funding issues, and I'm hopeful we'll have a farm bill to send to the Administration for the President's signature in the next few weeks.
