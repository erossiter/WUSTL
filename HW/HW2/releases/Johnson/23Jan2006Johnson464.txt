SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES GRANT WORKSHOPS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be holding several grant workshops around South Dakota for local fire departments interested in applying for the popular Assistance to Firefighters Grant program. 
   The workshops will be run in four cities around the state from February 27 - March 2, 2006. There is no charge for participation and the meetings will be open to any interested applicants. For more information about the workshops or the grant program, visit: http://www.firegrantsupport.com/.
   "Firefighters play a critical role in keeping South Dakota communities safe," Johnson said. "This federal program has provided a significant source of funding to South Dakota fire departments over the years, helping to upgrade safety equipment, vehicles and facilities, as well as providing for firefighter training. I encourage local fire departments to attend a workshop in their area and learn more about this important resource."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments to enhance their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. The grants are awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The program provides millions of dollars each year to fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations for a variety of uses, including training and the purchase of equipment and vehicles. In 2004 alone, 85 fire departments in South Dakota received $4,371,338 in grant funding.
   Last year, President Bush proposed slashing 2006 funding to this program. In October 2005, Congress approved $655 million for the program's upcoming year. This is $155 million more than the President had requested.
   "Taking critical resources from emergency working firefighters is not the way to balance the budget," said Johnson. "That's why I strongly opposed the cuts proposed to this program. I understand the value of the service that our firefighters provide to South Dakota."
