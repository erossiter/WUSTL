SENS. DASCHLE, JOHNSON ANNOUNCE $246,040 FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS
  Sens. Tom Daschle and Tim Johnson (both D-SD) announced today that $246,040 in funding is on the way for Community Healthcare Association, Inc., of Sioux Falls, the umbrella organization for South Dakota's community health centers.  
 Daschle and Johnson secured the funding through the fiscal year 2004 appropriations process, and it is being released from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 
   The funding announced today will be used for the implementation of an integrated management information system, including funding for computer equipment, training and maintenance of the integrated network plan for community health care centers throughout South Dakota. These improvements will allow South Dakota's community health centers to work together to improve efficiency, provide telecommunications services, and provide training to staff.
   "Community health centers are a crucial resource for South Dakotans seeking health services and information," Senator Daschle said. "This funding to the Community Healthcare Association will help keep centers up to date and ready to serve residents."
   "Community health care centers are for working families," said Johnson. "Keeping these centers open allows families who face financial challenges a place to receive quality health care at an affordable price. I will continue to support funding for community health centers across our state."
   Over the last three years, South Dakota has received the fourth-largest increase in HRSA money for new and expanded health centers. The 80-percent increase in health center funding - an increase of more than $3 million - over this period has enabled South Dakota community health centers to care for 19 percent more uninsured individuals and nearly double the total amount of medical encounters.
