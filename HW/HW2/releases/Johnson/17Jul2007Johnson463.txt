SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES SUMMERSET STUDENT TO WASHINGTON
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Byron Crowe of Summerset, South Dakota, to Johnson's Washington, DC office. Crowe graduated from Stevens High School in Rapid City in June of 2006 and is currently a sophomore, Political Science major at Black Hills State University. 
  "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson said. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital."
  "I'm looking forward to a unique political experience in D.C.," said Crowe. "Working on Capitol Hill is going to allow me the chance to help South Dakota in our nation's capital."
  The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with Senator Johnson and his staff.
  College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's internship program this summer. College credits or a stipend are available.
