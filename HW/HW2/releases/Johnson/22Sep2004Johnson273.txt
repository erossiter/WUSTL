SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $45,000 IN FUNDING TO HAZEL FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Hazel Fire Department will receive $45,000 in funding under the firefighting vehicle section of the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. 
   "In rural states like South Dakota, fire departments play a crucial role in keeping residents safe from harm," Johnson said. "The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is designed as an opportunity for Congress to be able to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to enhance basic fire delivery service in each state."
   The funding for the Hazel Fire Department will go towards training, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness of firefighters, as well as improvements to the facility.
   This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
