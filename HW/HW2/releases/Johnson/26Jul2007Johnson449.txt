SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $145,619 IN FUNDING FOR SOUTH DAKOTA DISCOVERY CENTER
  U. S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the South Dakota Discovery Center and Aquarium in Pierre will receive a $145,619 grant through the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Museums for America program to expand interactive art, science and literature programs.  
  "Education is one of my top priorities, and interactive learning programs like those at the South Dakota Discovery Center and Aquarium helps individuals of all ages explore the world around them," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The grant program seeks to strengthen a museum's ability to serve the public more effectively by supporting high-priority activities that advance the institution's mission and strategic goals. The funds can be used for a wide variety of projects, including research, planning, new programs and other activities. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
