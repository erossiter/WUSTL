SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS 'MODEST STEP' ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG REIMPORTATION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Vitter-Nelson amendment, which would prohibit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection from stopping people from bringing a 90 day supply of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescription drug into the country, is expected to be included in the conference report on the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. This spending bill is expected to pass before Congress adjourns for the mid term elections.  
   Johnson released the following statement:
   It's a modest step in the right direction. I have long supported the re-importation of prescription drugs from Canada. Prescription drugs in Canada cost, often times, less than half of what they cost in the United States and it seems to me that Americans ought to be able to take advantage of that.
   The legislation now agreed to by negotiators for the House and Senate, as part of the final Homeland Security Bill, legalizes what, frankly, is already going on. It will allow seniors to personally transport up to a 90 day supply of legal drugs over the border. 
   I think we need to go beyond that to allow seniors access to Canadian prices at their own local pharmacy in South Dakota; they shouldn't have to take a bus to Canada. I am pleased that we are able to get a bipartisan agreement at least on this modest step in the right direction and hopefully we can build on it from there.
   Johnson sent a letter earlier this month to Subcommittee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Ranking Member Robert Byrd (D-WV) urging conferees to retain Vitter-Nelson amendment in the final conference report. Johnson is an original cosponsor of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Fair Trade Act of 2005, which would provide for the safe importation of prescription drugs from Canada that are both approved by the FDA and manufactured in an FDA-approved plant.
