SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $277,425 GRANT TO SISSETON WAHPETON SIOUX TRIBE TO ENHANCE TRIBAL COURT SYSTEM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe will receive a $277,425 grant under the Tribal Courts Assistance Program.  
   "Strengthening the court system is an important step in combating the crime rates and substance abuse problems that are an unfortunate reality on the reservation," said Johnson. "An effective court system is vital to reducing crime and ensuring the safety of the tribal membership. Further, a strong tribal court system fosters confidence that can encourage economic development." 
   The Sisseton Wahpeton Tribe (Oyate) proposes to utilize this grant to expand its persecution of violent and other crime on the Lake Traverse Indian reservation by hiring additional judicial and administrative staff and continuing training of new and current staff. The Oyate Court has expanded over the last five years to cover seven different branches, including Adult Criminal, Juvenile, Family, Treatment, Housing, Child Support Enforcement and Civil courts. 
   The Tribal Courts Assistance Program is administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
