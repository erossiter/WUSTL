SEN. JOHNSON'S OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATOR'S HEALTH CONDITION
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following:  
   Senator Tim Johnson has made significant progress in his speech therapy this week at the in-patient rehabilitation unit at the George Washington University Hospital. "Senator Johnson is using limited full sentences and is initiating conversation with his family and therapists," said Philip Marion, MD, Medical Director for the Department of Rehabilitative Medicine. 
   As part of his therapy and on-going evaluations, the Senator participated in a reading test yesterday. "Simply put, he is reading. The test showed that he is comprehending written material and successfully following written commands," said Dr. Marion. "When it comes to rehabilitation, each patient's recovery is unique but Senator Johnson continues to impress us with his progress during his daily therapy sessions." 
   "Tim is enjoying reading the many cards and letters from his friends across the state. One of his doctors described his progress to date as miraculous. There is no doubt in my mind that the many prayers that have been offered for his recovery are being answered," said Mrs. Barbara Johnson, wife of U.S. Senator Tim Johnson.
