SEN. JOHNSON CONTINUES DRIVE TOWARD FINANCIAL SERVICES MISSION AT ELLSWORTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (S-SD) expressed support again for a financial services mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base in a call to Ronald Sega, Under Secretary of the Air Force. Johnson has been in frequent contact with the Air Force on this topic, and his staff met with Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne last week. 
   "Just like with the successful effort to get Ellsworth off of the base closure list, we need to stay focused, organized and remain persistent on this issue. I assured Under Secretary Sega that South Dakota has a highly educated and skilled workforce. I will continue to do all I can to make sure the Air Force fully understands that Ellsworth would be an ideal location for this center," Johnson said.
   South Dakota already has a great deal of experience in the state workforce with customer service and credit card processing services (i.e. Citigroup, Premier Bankcard, Wells Fargo). Johnson assured Sega that this local experience and local community support make this a mission that can easily transition into the Ellsworth environment.
   The Air Force conducted a second site visit to Ellsworth last week. According the Air Force officials this site visit was necessary to gather additional data in support of the on-going site selection process.
   Johnson also sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Wynne asking that the Air Force give careful consideration to Ellsworth for the mission last month. This mission will consist of approximately 775 employees, both military and civilian personnel, who will perform customer service duties on behalf of our nation's military.
