SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR FOUR BANDS COMMUNITY FUND
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Four Bands Community Fund, Inc. in Eagle Butte will receive a federal grant of $74,000 to diversify products and services of tribal businesses on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. The grant will be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development.  
  "This funding for the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation will lead to additional growth opportunities in our state and ensures that small businesses get the assistance they need," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment to help entrepreneurs."
  Earlier this year, Johnson announced he had gotten a $250,000 federal earmark for the Four Bands Community Fund included in the 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) spending bill. The bill has been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee and awaits consideration by the full Senate. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
