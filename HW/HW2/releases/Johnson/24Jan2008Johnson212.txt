SEN. JOHNSON: SOUTH DAKOTANS ARE FEELING PINCH, LOOKING FOR HELP
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in response to the initial economic stimulus plan announced by the bipartisan leadership of the House of Representatives:  
  There are people in South Dakota that never experienced the boom of the stock market, but are feeling the pinch in their wallet with this economic slowdown. An economic stimulus plan will hopefully put some much needed help into the hands of people who will use the rebate to kick the economy back into gear. The plan should be targeted, timely and temporary to have the strongest impact and keep the federal government from going deeper into the red. 
  I am glad to see the White House and both parties in the House working together to get the process started. I am encouraged that this package will help the middle class, assist businesses to create jobs, and aid those homeowners hit by the subprime crisis. I am hopeful that Congress and the President can agree on and pass a stimulus package before President's Day, but much work still needs to be done.
