SEN. JOHNSON PRAISES REIMBURSEMENT FOR TROOPS' BODY ARMOR
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) praised Senate passage of an amendment providing reimbursement to families of servicemen for their purchases of body armor for loved ones serving our nation during a time of supply shortage. 
   "It is astonishing that servicemen and women were sent into harm's way without proper body armor," said Johnson. "If we are going to send our troops into harm's way, we must provide them with the necessary supplies. For these families that purchased equipment during shortages, this is the least we can do."
   The amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, offered by Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and cosponsored by Senator Johnson would direct the Secretary of Defense to reimburse members of the Armed Forces, their families, and non-profit organizations for health or safety equipment they may have purchased as a result of military supply shortages in connection with Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, or Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Equipment purchases could include body armor, global positioning systems, hydration systems, or armor for vehicles.
   The Senate supported the amendment by a vote of 91-0.
