SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES COMMON SENSE TAX CUT FOR COMMUNITY LEADERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) introduced legislation today to fix a provision in the tax code that leads to overly burdensome taxes for community leaders. 
   "Town and township board members throughout South Dakota generally only make around $25 for meetings that are held only two or three times a year, but they still have to calculate and pay Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on this relatively small sum," Johnson said. "While these board members do not object to including this income as part of their overall earned income for tax purposes, they feel that withholding for Social Security and Medicare is overly burdensome for the amount of the actual pay."
   "Most of these community leaders do not have the means to do this electronically and end up sifting through form after form to calculate the tax by hand," Johnson continued. "We don't want to discourage people from performing a civic duty and working for the betterment of their local community. This is just a common-sense fix."
   Over the past year, the South Dakota Association of Towns and Townships has contacted Johnson extensively regarding this matter. 
   "Essentially, all the layers and layers of tax provisions that have been added to our tax code over the years had resulted in a system that was overly burdensome for our community leaders," Johnson concluded. 
   Johnson's legislation will return us to a common-sense approach. This bill will exempt those board members who earn $1,000 per year or less for their board member work from having to withhold for payroll taxes. They will still have to pay regular income tax on this income. Furthermore, they will also have to pay both income and payroll taxes on all income earned for any employment outside their board member responsibilities. 
   This bill operates very similarly to an exemption for poll workers.
