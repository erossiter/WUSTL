SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $146,420 IN FUNDING FOR OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE PARKS, RECREATION AUTHORITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Oglala Sioux Tribe Parks and Recreation Authority will receive $146,420 in funds for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) from the U.S. Department of Justice.  
 It comes as part of the COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP).
   "I am pleased to hear that the Oglala Sioux Tribe Parks and Recreation Authority will receive these funds," Johnson said. "It allows law enforcement officials to teach classes on crime prevention, and serve as community liaisons. This program truly makes a difference in a local community and with students." 
   COPS Native American programs address quality-of-life issues as well as a comprehensive list of law enforcement expenses, including hiring and training new community policing officers, training existing forces, purchasing new equipment, technology vehicles and more.
   The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) created a series of programs to meet the needs of law enforcement in Native American communities. These programs include the Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP), Tribal Hiring Renewal Grant Program (THRGP), Tribal Mental Health and Community Safety Initiative (TMHCSI), and the Tribal Court Pilot Program (TCPP). 
   The COPS program has awarded more than $258 million since 1999 to help Native American communities hire more than 1,800 new community policing officers. 
   To find more information on TRGP, THRGP, TMHCSI, or TCPP or COPS please visit the Department of Justice website at www.cops.usdoj.gov.
