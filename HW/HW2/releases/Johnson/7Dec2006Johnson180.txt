SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION RECOGNITION OF CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA ENHANCEMENT DISTRICT
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Economic Development Administration (EDA) has designated the Central South Dakota Enhancement District (CSDED) as a recognized EDA Economic Development District. The CSDED is comprised of Haakon, Hughes, Hyde, Jones, Stanley and Sully counties. 
 "I have long supported this official recognition by the EDA," Johnson said. "It opens doors for communities in those counties to receive additional economic assistance that will help them thrive and grow. Like South Dakota's other economic development districts, the CSDED is an indispensable partner in promoting the kinds of economic development activities outlined in my Hometown Prosperity Plan."
 The CSDED is in a non-profit organization that provides economic planning assistance to its member communities, economic development groups and businesses, along with assisting in securing funds for infrastructure needs and business opportunities. The EDA's designation allows the CSDED and groups in the counties it serves to be eligible for more types of funding and can result in the creation of new, high-skill, high-wage job opportunities. 
 Johnson is a strong supporter of this kind of economic development as outlined in his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
