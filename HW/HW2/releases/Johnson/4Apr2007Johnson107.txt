SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES YANKTON SIOUX TO RECEIVE $500,927
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Yankton Sioux Tribal Housing Authority will receive an Indian Block Grant Award of $500,927 for housing assistance under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act.  
   "Funding is essential for keeping the homes of South Dakota's tribal members maintained," Johnson has said in the past. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov. 
   This grant will be administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. The funding will be used for the preservation and refurbishing of homes belonging to tribal members.
