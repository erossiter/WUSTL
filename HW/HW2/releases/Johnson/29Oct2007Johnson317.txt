SEN. JOHNSON SEEKS SPRING INTERN APPLICANTS
  As students plan for their spring semester, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) is now accepting applications for spring internship positions in his Washington, DC, Sioux Falls, Rapid City, and Aberdeen offices. 
  The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues and provides a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with the office administrative staff. Students may also apply to intern in Johnson's press shop. Press interns track media coverage, organize clips, write releases, and other various press shop activities, as needed. 
  "This is an excellent opportunity for college students to experience the United States Senate, Capitol Hill and Washington, DC," Johnson said. "An internship in my Washington, DC office will provide students with a chance to serve South Dakota and gain first-hand knowledge of the federal government."
  Johnson also said that interning in his state offices will provide students with in-depth knowledge of current issues affecting the state and the opportunity to work directly with South Dakotans. An intern in a state office will assist staff with special events, constituent casework, and administrative functions.
  Johnson is a member of the following committees: Appropriations; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Budget; Energy and Natural Resources; Ethics; and Indian Affairs. In addition to these committees, Johnson also is involved in issue areas that include economic development, health care, housing, and education.
  College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's spring internship program. College credits or a stipend are available.
