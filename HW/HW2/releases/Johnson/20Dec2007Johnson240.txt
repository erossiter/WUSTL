SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR LAKE COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding for Lake County from the Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP). The Madison Police Department will receive an $11,500 grant for the purchase of a video surveillance system and the Lake County Search and Rescue will receive a $3,717 grant for the purchase of a night vision security kit. The funding comes through the Department of Homeland Security.  
  "In rural states like South Dakota, police departments and first responders play a crucial role in keeping residents safe. This funding from the CEDAP will ensure that communities in Madison will have the equipment they need to respond safely and effectively to an emergency," Johnson said. "My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The CEDAP helps to meet the equipment needs of smaller jurisdictions by providing training and resources including communications equipment, chemical detection, sensors and other technology. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
