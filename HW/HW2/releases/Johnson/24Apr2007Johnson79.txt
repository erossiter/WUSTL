SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $14,082 IN FUNDING FOR DEUBROOK SCHOOL DISTRICT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) is pleased to announce today that the Deubrook School District in White will receive $12,107.93 for telecommunications services and $1,974.68 for internet access through three E-Rate program grants.  
   This program provides discounts to help schools and libraries pay for telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections so their students may use the best technology in the classroom. "Many schools and libraries in South Dakota rely on technology funding through the E-Rate program to expand distance education and incorporate technology into classrooms," said Johnson. "The E-Rate program is vital to assisting schools in paying for advances in technology and to free up local revenue for other important educational needs. I will continue to work with my colleagues to strengthen this important program."
