SENS. JOHNSON, DASCHLE: VA-HUD SPENDING BILL PASSES COMMITTEE
  Sens. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Tom Daschle (D-SD) today announced funding levels for South Dakota projects contained in the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies spending bill (VA-HUD). The bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee Tuesday. 
   "Whether providing funding for the Sturgis Industrial Park or community projects on our reservations, this bill allows development across our state," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Water and wastewater infrastructure is critical to our communities."
   "I was pleased to help secure funding for these projects. This funding will give communities the resources they need to improve services to residents and enhance infrastructure to spur economic development," Senator Daschle said. "Each project represents a step forward, whether it means a more efficient, modernized water system or a facility that will give young people the direction they need to become successful, productive members of their communities." 
   The bill includes the following South Dakota projects at the request of the Senators:
   * $500,000 for the Sturgis Industrial Park-This initiative will help the community of Sturgis to promote economic development and job creation in the region. In recent years, Sturgis has successfully worked to attract and foster industrial growth in the area. This funding will develop needed infrastructure necessary to accommodate continued economic opportunity.
   * $250,000 for the Rapid City YMCA-This project will complete construction of a teen wellness center. The work would provide outfit the room with electrical, HVAC and finish work along with acquiring age-appropriate cardiovascular and strength training equipment. The YMCA of Rapid City is in a prime position to impact the young people of our community by instilling wellness habits that will combat youth obesity, which leads to diabetes and other physical problems.
   * $250,000 for the Cheyenne River Youth Project-This initiative will help to develop a youth center in Eagle Butte to serve teens in the region. The Youth Project will provide a much-needed venue for teens to congregate and socialize in a supportive, healthy environment.
   * $1.4 million for the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Project-The Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place brings together the tribes of the Great Sioux Nation in a coordinated effort to promote cultural healing and mutual determination to enhance the lives of Native American people. Wakpa Sica will enhance the knowledge and understanding of the history of Native American's and their culture. In addition, the project will establish the Sioux Nation Tribal Supreme Court and facilities for mediation and conflict resolution.
   * $1.5 million for Huron water infrastructure-Huron is planning upgrades to their water and wastewater systems to accommodate the needs for the Dakota Turkey Growers processing plant and the Ridgefield Farms Premium Hereford Beef processing plants. Huron is expecting these facilities to create 1,300 new jobs and additional jobs in ancillary businesses and industries.
   * $600,000 for the Green Valley Water District- These funds will extend infrastructure to the Green Valley Sanitation District to allow area residents to hook up to Rapid City municipal water services. This initiative will ensure that homes and businesses in the area have access to safe, clean water supplies.
   * $400,000 for Tyndall water infrastructure-This funding will replace and upgrade water and sewer infrastructure in the city. The community's water main was constructed in the 1950's and is in dire need of replacement to prevent a potential system failure. The existing water main is simply outdated and undersized to meet the needs of the City's water distribution system. During construction the street will be removed for the installation of the water line and the City sees this as an opportunity to replace the sanitary sewer in this area. 
   This project will make important investments in the City's core infrastructure to enhance services to residents and promote opportunities for commercial growth in the region. 
   "I am pleased that this bill provides $1.2 billion more for veterans' health care than what was included in the President's budget," said Johnson. "Our nation's veterans were promised that their health care needs would be taken care of when they joined up. We need to do better at keeping that promise."
   "The funding for veterans programs in this bill keeps our programs above water, but it is clear that we must commit additional resources to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs can deliver the level of care our veterans earned with their service and wholeheartedly deserve," Daschle said.
