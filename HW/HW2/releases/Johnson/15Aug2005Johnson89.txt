SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $3.44 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR SISSETON WAHPETON SIOUX TRIBE HOUSING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe will receive $3,444,365 in funding for housing assistance.  
 The funding comes under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) of 1996, for an Indian Housing Block Grant. 
   "The Indian Housing Block Grant plays a vital role in allowing families on Indian reservations the chance to be self-sustaining homeowners. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues in supporting this program funding," said Johnson. 
   This funding can be used for a variety of eligible affordable housing activities such as operating assistance, development of affordable housing that may include new construction, acquisition, modernization, or rehabilitation of rental or owner-occupied housing; housing services, and housing management. 
   Funding for the housing assistance comes through the Indian Housing Block grant (IHBG) under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
