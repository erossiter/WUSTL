SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON OPENING OF NEW SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM OF AMERICAN INDIAN
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement on the opening of the new Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), in Washington, DC.  
 Johnson cosponsored the legislation that provided for the museum in 1989, while a member of the House of Representatives:
   "The new Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian marks the journey of Native peoples. While we gather and reflect on the history of Native peoples, we must remember to continue our fight to protect tribal sovereignty while fulfilling the treaty and trust responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes. This is an important time to look to the future, to strengthen the relationships the federal government and Indian tribes have been building. This museum will forever grace the National mall of our nation's Capitol from the serenity gardens created to surround the museum to the heart of the building's Potomac gathering place. This is an exciting moment in history."
   Johnson was able to get an early preview of the museum earlier this month and will participate in the opening ceremonies. NMAI officially opens to the public tomorrow, Tuesday, September 21, 2004.
