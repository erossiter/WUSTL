SEN. JOHNSON RESPONDS TO HHS EFFORTS TO REIMPORT FLU VACCINE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today responded to reports that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working to secure as many as 1.5 million doses of flu vaccine from Canada.  
 On average, 36,000 Americans die each year from the flu:
   "I am glad that HHS is looking to import flu vaccines to help address the shortage we now face," said Johnson. "We should also recognize that lower price, reimported drugs can help prevent deaths from other health ailments. I hope the Administration will work, along with Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) and me, to clear the hurdles and allow for reimportation of medications addressing heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes as well."
   The following health ailments could also be addressed by lower cost, reimported medications from Canada:
   Heart disease (+700,000 deaths in 2001)*
   Cancer (+550,000 deaths in 2001)
   Stroke (+163,000 deaths in 2001)
   Diabetes (+71,000 deaths in 2001)
   * According to Centers for Disease Control information.
