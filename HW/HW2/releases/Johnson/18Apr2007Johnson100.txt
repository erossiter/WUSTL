SEN. JOHNSON RECEIVES AWARD FOR WORK WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson was honored with Habitat for Humanity's International Congressional Champions award in a Washington, DC, ceremony. The group recognized Johnson's long term commitment to the organization's efforts in South Dakota, and his participation in the Congress Building America program in the past.  
   "I am honored to receive this award from Habitat for Humanity. I look forward to continuing to work for more affordable housing for South Dakotans," Johnson said. "I have long believed that homeownership is the cornerstone of the American dream." 
   South Dakota's Habitat for Humanity branch is based in Brookings with affiliates throughout the state, and works to select candidates for housing and to help build and renovate houses for people in need. This need-based charity acts as a lender to low-income earners who are selected for this housing, offering loans that are interest free. South Dakota's Habitat for Humanity and their partners have constructed 244 homes through December of 2006, with a goal of building 40 more in 2007. 
   Johnson has long supported helping groups who advance affordable housing opportunities, describing low income loans and grants to those groups a form of "Investing in the Public Good," a pillar of Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
