SEN. JOHNSON FIGHTS FOR LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined U.S Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in introducing the Community Pharmacy Fairness Act of 2007, which would allow independent pharmacies across South Dakota to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs. The legislation would ease anti-trust laws for independent pharmacists by providing them the same negotiating leverage enjoyed by larger competitors. 
   "As a rural state, South Dakota has a disproportionately high number of independent pharmacies," said Johnson. "This legislation will ensure that independent pharmacies have the same opportunity as large, chain drugstores to serve our rural community and provide South Dakotans with the best health care services possible."
   Sixty-five percent of pharmacies across the state are independently owned and operated. South Dakota has the third highest percentage of independent pharmacies in the nation, with 129 independently-owned pharmacies out of 196 pharmacies. Under the legislation, pharmacies could form groups to negotiate reimbursement contracts with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). PBMs are third party administrators of prescription drug programs primarily responsible for processing and paying prescription drug claims.
   Currently, independent pharmacies are allowed to form purchasing groups only to negotiate drug prices with wholesalers, and are subject to contracts with PBMs that often have low reimbursement levels and frequent changes in coverage. This bill will improve access, increase choices, and lower medical costs for South Dakotans across the state.
