SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES BROOKINGS STUDENT TO WASHINGTON
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Andy Janes of Brookings, South Dakota, to Johnson's Washington, DC office. Janes, a graduate Brookings High School, will receive his undergraduate degree in Global Studies and Political Science from South Dakota State University in 2008. 
  "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson said. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital."
  "Interning in Washington for Senator Johnson will show me a new side of the political process," said Janes. "I'm excited to put my education to work for South Dakota."
  The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with Senator Johnson and his staff.
  College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's internship program this summer. College credits or a stipend are available.
