SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $2.6 MILLION FOR MERIDIAN BRIDGE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced the release of $2.6 million in funding for the Meridian Bridge in Yankton.  
 The funding was included in the Transportation Appropriations bill, which passed during the last Congress, at Johnson's request.
   "The Meridian Bridge project is vital to the economic development and growth of the Yankton community," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "I will continue working as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to see that this project remains on schedule."
   The funding assists the ongoing project to replace the Meridian Bridge.
   The $2,645,333.333 released today is a portion of the $4 million included in the final Transportation Appropriations bill, signed into law last December. The remaining funding from that bill will be released in the coming months.
   This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Discretionary Grant program.
