  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today encouraged Congress to quickly pass the Omnibus spending bill, which includes $1.9 million in funding for the construction of the University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine in Vermillion. The Omnibus, which will fund the federal government through Fiscal Year 2008, combines 11 federal appropriations bills 
  Additional information outlining specific South Dakota-related projects included in the Omnibus can be found on Johnson's website at http://www.Johnson.Senate.gov. 
  "As this process moves forward, I will continue to work with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure that the state's most vital projects, including the School of Medicine, get the funding they need," concluded Johnson.
