SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON SENATE APPROVAL OF SWEEPING ETHICS REFORM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying rules approved by the Senate: 
  Bringing greater openness while restoring the public's faith in government was the goal of this bill, and I am pleased the Senate has approved sweeping ethics and lobbying reform legislation. One of the messages the American people delivered in last year's election was that it was time to change the way Washington operates. 
  This bill will help restore the people's faith in their government by banning all gifts and travel paid for by lobbyists, requiring more public disclosure of lobbyists' activities, bringing greater transparency to the earmark process, and implementing restrictions to slow the revolving door for Members of Congress who become lobbyists. 
  Passing this comprehensive reform bill is a significant accomplishment for this Congress.
