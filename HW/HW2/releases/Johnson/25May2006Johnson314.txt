SEN. JOHNSON TO JAPAN: LET OUR BEEF IN
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in writing to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi urging him to resume trade with the U.S. beef producers. Koizumi is scheduled to visit the United States in June. 
   "It has been proven time and time again that American beef is the safest in the world. It is my hope that Japan understands once and for all how safe our beef is," said Johnson. "I hope that Japan also understands that we have a trading relationship that goes both ways. If they refuse to stop buying American beef, maybe we need to put an embargo on their electronics and cars."
   In October 2005, Johnson joined with a group of twenty other bipartisan Senators in writing a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman requesting that he employ economic measures against Japan when efforts to resume regular beef trade with that nation stalled.
   Japan initially banned U.S. beef and beef products in December of 2003 following the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States but had reopened its borders on several occasions before closing them again due to isolated incidents that were later resolved.
