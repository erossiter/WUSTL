SEN. JOHNSON: E-PRESCRIBING WOULD MAKE SYSTEM SAFER, MORE EFFICIENT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today urged the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to move forward in its rulemaking process to provide patients more accurate pharmaceutical prescriptions through electronic prescribing (e-prescribing). The DEA stalled its effort to create a process for implementing e-prescribing of controlled substances, and Johnson pushed today to expedite the process.  
  State boards of pharmacy control prescription-writing requirements for all non-controlled substances. The DEA's inaction in the rulemaking process is delaying implementation of e-prescribing and slowing states from establishing uniform e-prescribing systems for all pharmaceuticals. 
  "I am disappointed in the DEA's lack of progress on this issue. By making the system for doctors to prescribe drugs safer and more efficient, we will not only save time and money in the process, we will more importantly save lives." Johnson said. "States are moving forward with e-prescribing standards for all other pharmaceutical companies but the lack of standards from DEA on controlled substances is hindering the states' progress."
  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing today on Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances. Johnson, though not on the Committee, entered a statement and questions for the record. 
  The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 mandates that drug plans participating in Part D support electronic prescribing by 2009. 
  The Institute of Medicine acknowledged the promise of e-prescribing in its July 2006 report entitled Preventing Medication Errors, and recommended that by 2010 all prescribers and pharmacies be using e-prescriptions.
  In South Dakota, two task forces are already working to develop standards and regulations for e-prescribing.
