SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES HOUSING FUNDING FOR SISSETON-WAHPETON COMMUNITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $3,362,086 in funding for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Housing Authority to be used for the modernization and operating assistance for low-income housing, new construction, and other housing needs.  
   "This funding is important for the Sisseton-Wahpeton community," said Johnson. "It can be used for a variety of different purposes, creating the adequate and safe housing needed by the people in this state. Housing is more than a structure, homes are the foundation for our communities."
   The funds are part of the Indian Housing Plan, made available under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996.
   Johnson is a member of the Indian Affairs and the Senate Appropriations Committees.
