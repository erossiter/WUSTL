SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $25,000 GRANT FOR PLAYGROUND IN VERMILLION
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Department of Game, Fish and Parks will receive a $25,000 grant from the National Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to purchase and install playground equipment at Lions Park in Vermillion. 
  "Places like Lions Park are important to our communities, and give children and families a safe, clean place for recreation," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment."
  The LWCF gives grants to states to help them purchase land, water and wetlands to be preserved for both present and future generations. The grants match state expenditures and impact the local communities directly. Through the National Park Service, Congress provided a total of $30 million for nationwide grants to improve local recreational facilities and park lands. Johnson serves as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the National Park Service.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
