SEN. JOHNSON: OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL GOOD FOR SOUTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today outlined the South Dakota priorities included in the Omnibus spending bill, which combines 11 federal appropriations bills. The Omnibus will fund the federal government through the Fiscal Year 2008.
  "It has been difficult getting the appropriations bills passed this year, but the funding levels for many South Dakota projects look favorable," said Johnson, a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee. "We still must get this bill through the House and Senate and signed by the President. Barring any unforeseen obstruction, I am proud to have helped secure critical funding for important South Dakota projects like Lewis & Clark and Mni Wiconi, as well as historic levels of funding for our nation's veterans."  
  As Chairman of the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs (VA) Subcommittee, Johnson fought to secure a record $43.1 billion in discretionary funding for the VA, $3.7 billion over the President's budget increase. The money provides increased funding for key emerging needs of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, including treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental health services. 
  Below is the funding secured for several vital South Dakota projects:
