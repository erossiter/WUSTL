SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS NEW HOUSE VERSION OF FARM BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement on new steps taken by the House Agriculture Committee on reauthorization of the farm bill: 
  While I am glad to see that discussions are moving forward on the farm bill front, I am concerned that this proposal shifts us farther away from what South Dakota's agriculture communities need. We are, however, at the beginning of these negotiations. Ultimately, farmers and ranchers rely on a farm bill to make important management decisions, and I am hopeful that Congress will deliver a final bill soon.
