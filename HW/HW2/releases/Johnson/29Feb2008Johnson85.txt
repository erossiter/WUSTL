SEN. JOHNSON HIGHLIGHTS KEEBLE'S HEROIC ACTIONS AS MEDAL OF HONOR CEREMONY APPROACHES
  In anticipation of Monday's White House ceremony posthumously awarding Master Sgt. Woodrow Wilson Keeble the Medal of Honor, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today debuted a special section of his Senate website highlighting his heroic actions. It can be accessed online through a link on the front page of his website at http://johnson.senate.gov. 
  "Master Sgt. Woodrow Wilson Keeble has served our nation honorably in two wars and will soon receive the highest honor our nation can bestow on a member of the military. Yet, far too few people know about his heroic actions," Johnson said. "I hope that this special section of my website will help inform people in South Dakota and across the country of his remarkable actions."
  Johnson's website features in-depth information about Keeble's actions, and includes a 1954 affidavit from a soldier who served along side him. It also details Johnson's congressional actions in trying to secure him the Medal of Honor. 
  Keeble's men twice recommended him for the Medal of Honor, but the paperwork was lost, and he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second-highest commendation. For the past several years, Johnson, together with a few of his colleagues, has been working to get Keeble's Distinguished Service Cross upgraded to the Medal of Honor. 
   "I am looking forward to being at the White House on Monday to finally see Master Sgt. Keeble receive the Medal of Honor. The award is long overdue, and is a true testament to a remarkable military career that has made South Dakota and our nation proud," continued Johnson. 
  On Monday, Johnson will attend the White House ceremony honoring Keeble, where President Bush will present the Medal of Honor to Keeble's surviving family members. He is the first member of any of the Sioux tribes to earn that award.
