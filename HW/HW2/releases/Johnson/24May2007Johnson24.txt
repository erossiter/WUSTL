OFFICE OF SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES RAPID CITY STUDENT TO WASHINGTON
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Zachary Abrahamson of Rapid City, South Dakota, to Johnson's Washington, DC press office. Abrahamson graduated from Stevens High School in June of 2006 and will receive his undergraduate degree from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in May of 2010.  
   "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson said. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital." 
   "Working in Senator Johnson's press office promises to be an exciting and educational experience," said Abrahamson. "The internship gives me the opportunity to learn important skills outside the classroom and gain insights that will no doubt assist me as a student and journalist in the future." 
   The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with Senator Johnson and his staff. 
   College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's internship program this summer. College credits or a stipend are available.
