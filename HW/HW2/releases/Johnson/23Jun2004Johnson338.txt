BILL TO RESTORE ANGOSTURA WATERSHED PASSES COMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Senate Indian Affairs Committee approved a bill that will help the Oglala Sioux repair damage caused to the area surrounding the Angostura dam. S. 1996, the Oglala Sioux Tribe Angostura Unit Reclamation Act, was introduced by Senators Tom Daschle and Tim Johnson.  
   The Angostura legislation addresses environmental impacts in the Cheyenne River watershed on the Pine Ridge Reservation and the legal and equitable claims of the Oglala Sioux Tribe regarding the Angostura Unit. Based upon the Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Bureau of Reclamation, this legislation would set up a trust fund for purposes of making the tribe whole.  
   "The Angostura dam affected the local ecosystem and resulted in infrastructure changes to the communities, including loss of tribal industry and water quality problems. This bill helps rehabilitate the watershed. I am glad the Committee took swift action," Johnson said, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. 
   Oglala Sioux Tribal President, John Yellow Bird Steele, testified before the Committee regarding the legislation last week on June 16th. 
   "I want to thank Chairman Campbell (R-CO) and Vice-Chairman Inouye (D-HI) for holding this important hearing today, and the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council members for their hard work on this issue," Johnson said at today's markup.
