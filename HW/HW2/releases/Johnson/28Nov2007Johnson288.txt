REP. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $61,770 GRANT FOR CUSTER AMBULANCE SERVICE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Custer Ambulance Service will receive a $61,770 grant from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants program. The funding will be used to purchase a new defibrillator and training equipment.  
  "Emergency responders play an invaluable role in the communities they serve," Johnson said. "It is essential that ambulance personnel have the equipment and training needed to respond safely and effectively to an emergency. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  President Bush has proposed deep cuts to the program. In fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated $745 million. But for fiscal year 2008, the President proposed a funding level of only $300 million. Senator Johnson understands the importance of properly equipping those who voluntarily risk their lives to protect the public. That is why he has repeatedly used his seats on the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee to oppose these cuts.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
