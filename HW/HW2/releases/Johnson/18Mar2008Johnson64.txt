SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR DALLAS VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Dallas Volunteer Fire Department in Gregory County will receive a $4,100 federal grant and a $140,000 low-interest federal loan to build a fire hall. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
  "In rural South Dakota counties, fire departments like the Dallas Volunteer Fire Department play a crucial role in keeping residents safe," Johnson said. "It is essential that personnel have a quality up-to-date facility that will allow them to respond safely and effectively to an emergency. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  As in past years, the President has proposed large cuts to key economic development programs including Community Development Block Grants, the Economic Development Administration, and USDA Rural Development. Senator Johnson has used his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to reduce these cuts, and he will do so again in the Fiscal Year 2009.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
