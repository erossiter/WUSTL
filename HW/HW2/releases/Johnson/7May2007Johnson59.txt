SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO FLOODING IN EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in response to the flooding in eastern South Dakota:  
   I have been in touch with my staff on the devastating floods in our state. First and foremost, I want to express my concern for the safety and well-being of affected families. I have asked my staff to get in touch with the Governor's office and with FEMA to make sure that services are getting to where they need to be. I want to make sure FEMA understands the seriousness of the situation. FEMA has reported to us that they intend to send a five-person "technical support team" to help coordinate the state's disaster response 
   I have also asked staff to coordinate with Stephanie's and John's offices to make sure we are prepared to support the Governor's request for a disaster declaration as soon as the Governor makes a request to President Bush for federal disaster aid. 
   I wish I be could there right now to meet with people on the ground, but I assure you I have staff acting as my eyes and ears, and I will do all that I can to help the families touched by these storms.
