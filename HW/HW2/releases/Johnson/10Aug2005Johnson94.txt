SEN. JOHNSON COMMENDS PRESIDENT FOR SIGNING TRANSPORTATION BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) commended President Bush today for signing the Transportation Bill that has $225 million in funding for South Dakota. Sen.  
 Johnson was a negotiator on the conference committee helping to bring home money and jobs to South Dakota. Overall, South Dakota will receive roughly $1.3 billion over the next 5 years in highway formula funding. 
   "This Transportation Bill does exciting things for South Dakota, including funding for the Phillips-to-the-Falls project in Sioux Falls and the Heartland Expressway in Western South Dakota," said Johnson. "I'm pleased to see the President sign this legislation that the entire delegation has worked so diligently to pass. This comprehensive bill will hopefully bring jobs, economic development, and a greater transportation infrastructure to South Dakota." 
   The bill, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (SAFE-TEA) is a six-year authorization bill covering America's transportation, transit, and road safety network. The bill replaces the previous transportation reauthorization bill that expired in 2003.
