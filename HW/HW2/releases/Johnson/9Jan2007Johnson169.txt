SEN. JOHNSON UPGRADED FROM CRITICAL CONDITION TO FAIR CONDITION
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following: 
   "Senator Tim Johnson has been upgraded from critical condition to fair condition. He is breathing independently and no longer requires the assistance of a ventilator," said Vivek Deshmukh, MD, neurosurgeon at the George Washington University Hospital. 
   A tracheotomy tube remains in his neck to guard his airway. It is anticipated that Senator Johnson will be moved from the intensive care unit to in-patient rehabilitation later this week.
   "This is wonderful news. Tim has come a long way and we have a long way yet to go, but we celebrate each victory. For me, it is like watching a miracle unfold each day," said Mrs. Barbara Johnson, wife of U.S. Senator Tim Johnson.
