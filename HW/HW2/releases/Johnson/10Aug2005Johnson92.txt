SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $99,735 GRANT TO COMBAT VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN ON CHEYENNE RIVER
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will receive a $99,735 grant to combat domestic violence against children.  
   "We must stop the cycle of domestic violence by protecting children, the most vulnerable among us," said Johnson. "Some of the best ways to do that are by educating the community and providing support for its victims." 
   The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will use the funding from the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program to provide direct advocacy for victims of domestic violence and increase awareness of domestic violence issues in the community. 
   This program implements certain provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which is set to expire on September 30, 2005. Senator Johnson recently cosponsored legislation that will reauthorize VAWA and increase funding for the act. 
   "With the reauthorization of VAWA, we can continue the strides that have already been taken to help combat domestic violence in Indian country," said Johnson.
