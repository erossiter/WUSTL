SEN. JOHNSON CONGRATULATES REP. HERSETH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement on the swearing in of Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) this morning.  
 Herseth was elected to office on Tuesday, June 1 during a special election after the lone House seat was vacated by Congressman Bill Janklow (R-SD) earlier this year:
   Stephanie Herseth will be an extraordinary member of the House of Representatives. Having served there 10 years myself, I appreciate the challenges that go with being a lone representative in a small rural state. Stephanie is up to the challenge. Her ability to work in a bipartisan way will make her a rising star in the House of Representatives. 
   I have known Stephanie and her family for many years and I know her work ethic, strength of character and South Dakota values will help her as she represents our state as our lone voice in the House of Representatives. On her first day, she is already hard at work. The people of South Dakota will be well served by her presence in the House.
