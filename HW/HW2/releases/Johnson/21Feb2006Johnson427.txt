SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES VERMILLION NATIVE TO STAFF
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) is pleased to announce that Clinton Christensen of Vermillion, Johnson's hometown, has recently joined his staff as a Staff Assistant. 
   "Clint is a great example of the South Dakotan values of hard work and service. He started off as an intern and has moved up to staff assistant," said Johnson. "We are very thankful that Clint is here. He is a valuable staff member and his South Dakota roots bring a piece of home to my office."
   Clinton was born in Yakton and raised on a farm near Vermillion. He graduated from Vermillion High School in 2002 and then went to college at Florida State, where he studied Political Science and Psychology. 
   "I am very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to work for Senator Johnson," Clint said. "This will not only be an invaluable learning experience for me, but it will also allow me work for the benefit of my home state, while strengthening my ties to the South Dakota community."
   Brett Hoffman of Madison also arrived at the same time as Clinton and was hired on at the same time as a staff assistant.
