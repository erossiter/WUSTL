SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS RECOGNITION OF LAKOTA WINTER COUNTS ON SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today applauded the Smithsonian Institution's National Anthropological Archives division for creating an on-line-only exhibition featuring nearly 1,000 Lakota "winter counts."  
   A winter count, much like a calendar, marks each year with an artistic representation of memorable events on a large piece of hide, cloth or paper. Some of these works may span over a century. Extended families often had their own winter count keepers, who consulted with tribal elders to select one symbol for the year and add it to the series, typically in the winter. 
   The winter count exhibition recently received a Webby award, an Oscar for the Internet. It features a show of images of winter counts dating back to the 1700s and focuses primarily on those kept by the Lakota of the northern plains. 
   "Winter counts are an important part of Lakota history and culture," said Johnson. "I am pleased to see that the Smithsonian Institution has done such a fine job of making this exhibition available on the Internet, so this traditional art form can receive the recognition it deserves."
