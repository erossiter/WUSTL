SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT NOMINATION
  This evening, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon hearing President George W. Bush's nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr. to replace Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court:  
   "Again, I would like to commend Justice O'Connor on her service to our nation. She is an inspiration for generations of women, and will be hard to replace. 
   "This evening, President Bush has announced he will nominate John G. Roberts, Jr. to the Supreme Court. It is the Senate's Constitutional duty to carefully consider nominees for this lifetime appointment. That includes a review of the nominee and hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hearings are central to the nomination process. It is important not to prejudge a nominee before all the facts are in." 
   "I look forward to learning more about John G. Roberts, Jr."
