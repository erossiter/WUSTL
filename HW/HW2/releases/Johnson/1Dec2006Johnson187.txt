MEADE COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Meade County as his December 2006 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website.  
 "Meade County has a rich history and that makes it a wonderful place to live and visit," Johnson said. "I am pleased to have worked with the Meade County community on many issues over the years, from saving Ellsworth Air Force Base to funding for a wind energy project that will help the town of Faith raise money to build a new school." 
 Meade County was founded in 1889 and is home to the city of Sturgis and the towns of Mud Butte and Faith. Ellsworth Air Force Base, which is headquarters for the 28th Bomber Group, is also located in Meade County. Meade County hosts the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which draws nearly half a million visitors each year.
 Johnson is a strong advocate of homeland security grants and economic development grant programs that help our communities continue to grow. He was proud to announce funding for programs in Meade County that range from federal funding for the development of small businesses to improving facilities at Ellsworth Air Force Base to funding for Sturgis' Parent Resource Network. 
 "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and I am happy to feature Meade County this month," continued Johnson. 
 "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places."
