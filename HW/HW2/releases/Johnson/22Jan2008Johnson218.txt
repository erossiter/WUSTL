SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES HURON NATIVE TO WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Danielle Thomsen, daughter of Kent and Rita Thomsen, to his Washington, DC office. Thomsen is a 2003 graduate of Huron High School and attended Minnesota State University where she earned degrees in Political Science and Spanish. 
  "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," said Johnson. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital. I am glad Danielle has been able to join us this spring."
  "I wanted to take this opportunity to gain an understanding of the practical aspects of politics," Thomsen said. "I'm excited not only to be in the national hub of politics, but also to work for a well-respected and hard-working politician."
  The Washington D.C. spring internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a "first-hand" opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with the office administrative staff.
  College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's summer internship program. College credits or a stipend are available.
