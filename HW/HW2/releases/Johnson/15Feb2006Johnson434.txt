SEN. JOHNSON APPOINTED TO AIR FORCE ACADEMY BOARD OF VISITORS
  After being appointed to the prestigious United States Air Force Academy's Board of Visitors, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will be sworn in Thursday morning and attend his first meeting. Johnson was appointed to the post by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK), President pro tempore of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   "I am humbled and honored to accept this appointment to the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Air Force Academy," said Johnson. "The Air Force Academy is one of our nation's finest service academies and institutions of higher learning."
   The Board is comprised of 15 members. The President of the United States appoints six members (at least two of which must be Academy graduates). The Vice President of the United States or the President pro tempore of the Senate designates three members (with two being members of the Senate Appropriations Committee).
   Under its statutory charter, board members meet to review, the morale, discipline, and social climate, the curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters relating to the Academy. The Board is also required to visit the Academy, located near Colorado Springs, CO, annually.
   The Board meets four times annually and within 60 days after its annual and semi-annual meetings, the Board submits a written report of its actions, views, and recommendations of the Academy.
   Presidential appointees are designated for a period of three years. Each of the additional nine board members, including Johnson, serves a minimum term of one year. Any member whose term of office has expired continues to serve until his successor is appointed.
