SEN. JOHNSON CO-SPONSORS RURAL HEALTH CARE BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today he is an original co-sponsor of a bill that offers comprehensive improvements in Medicare payments to rural health care providers. The bill, supported by Johnson and the bipartisan Senate Rural Health Caucus, is called the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act. Similar to the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity (R-HoPE) Act of 2006 Johnson supported last Congress, the bipartisan legislation seeks to break down some of the big obstacles rural health care providers face.  
  The bill was re-named this year as a posthumous honor to Senator Craig Thomas (R-WY) who co-chaired the Rural Health Caucus and championed rural health care needs.
  "This bill is recognition that in health care 'one size does not fit all' and that Medicare should not be a hurdle preventing medical treatment. Medicare should be a way to make sure the underserved get the treatment they need," Johnson said. "This bipartisan effort is a fitting tribute to my colleague, Senator Thomas, as it corrects many of the inequities preventing health care from making its way to people in underserved, rural areas."
  Specifically, this legislation attempts to address the disparities in the Medicare payment system to place rural providers on a more level playing field with their urban counterparts. The bill touches on many of the funding hurdles and geographic handicaps that rural health providers face, from crumbling facilities and Medicare re-payment red tape to ambulance services. It provides for less constricting limits on billing and allows providers to prioritize patients' health before the bottom line.
  Among the changes the bill would implement:
   * Provide Assistance to Low Volume Hospitals - helps rural hospitals that cannot make ends meet under the PPS system, but that do not want to be forced to convert to Critical Access Hospital status. 
   * Create a Capital Infrastructure Loan Program - makes loans available to help rural facilities improve crumbling buildings and infrastructure.
   * Implement Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Improvements - includes provisions to reinstate cost-based reimbursement to CAHs for lab services provided to patients who are not physically in the hospital. It would also eliminate the 35-mile cap on ambulance service reimbursement.
   * Extend the Medicare Incentive Payment Program - extends 10 percent bonus payments to physicians practicing in Health Professional Shortage Areas that would affect 40 South Dakota counties.
   * Equalize Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments - removes the cap on rural add-on payments, setting them closer to payment levels at urban facilities.
   * Increase Rural Health Clinic (RHC) Reimbursement - raises the RHC cap making it comparable to the payment rate Community Health Centers (CHC) receive.
   * Facilitate the Provision of Telehealth Services Across State Lines - pushes for new regulations allowing for multi-state practitioner licenses, to bring telehealth health care into rural areas that otherwise lack access to such services.
