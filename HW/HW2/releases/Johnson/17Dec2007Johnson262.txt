SEN. JOHNSON: RAPID CITY PROJECTS FARE WELL IN OMNIBUS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today vowed to work with collogues to secure funding for vital Rapid City projects included in the Omnibus spending bill, which combines 11 federal appropriations bills. The Omnibus, which will fund the federal government through Fiscal Year 2008, includes funding for Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the Community Health Center of the Black Hills. 
  "As an appropriator, I am pleased that I can help fund worthy Rapid City projects," said Johnson. "From the School of Mines to Ellsworth Air Force Base, this funding is good for the Black Hills and our state. It is my hope that the House and Senate will work quickly to pass this important bill. Getting the Omnibus passed and signed into law will be good news for South Dakota."
