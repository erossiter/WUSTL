SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES TRANSPORTATION FUNDING RULE CHANGE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that South Dakota tribes are now eligible for a new funding source. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has interpreted a rule regarding the Safe Routes to School Program (SRTS) that will clarify that Indian tribes are eligible to receive the program funds.  
   According to the October 13th letter, Johnson and several Democratic members wrote to FHWA's Administrator expressing the intentions of the legislators who passed the SAFETEA-LU Transportation bill to include tribes, because the FHWA had not included the tribes in the groups eligible to receive program funds. 
   Today, the FHWA responded to the letter and agreed that federally recognized tribes should be eligible for the program.
   "I am pleased to see the Federal Highway Administration reconsidered their policy, and interpreted the law to recognize Indian tribes as eligible recipients for Safe Routes to Schools program funding," Johnson said. "While this kind of rule change is highly technical, its effects are clear - protecting our children, making travel to schools safer and potentially saving lives."
   Representative Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) joined Johnson on the letter to the FHWA.
   The purpose of the Safe Routes to School program is to enable and encourage children to walk or bike to school safely and to improve pedestrian safety in the vicinity of schools. The program grants funds to states, then the state divides the money among eligible groups. As the rule was previously interpreted, the program would not have included Indian tribes.
