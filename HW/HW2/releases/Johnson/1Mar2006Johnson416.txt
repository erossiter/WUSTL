SEN. JOHNSON: DON'T OUTSOURCE NATIONAL SECURITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) this week cosponsored the bipartisan Foreign Investment Security Improvement Act of 2006, which would mandate a report to Congress before turning over operations of six U.S. ports to a company owned by the United Arab Emirates. 
   "Despite assurances from the Administration, I remain concerned about the proposed deal to turn over operations of six U.S. ports to a company owned by the United Arab Emirates and controlled by the emir of Dubai. We simply should not be outsourcing our national security to the highest bidder," said Johnson.
   The bill would require a report to Congress with details of a 45-day national security review of the proposed deal. Based on that report, Congress could then decide to pass a resolution of disapproval to stop the turnover of the ports to DP World, the company in question.
   DP World was scheduled to close the deal on six of our nation's ports tomorrow, Thursday, March 2, 2006, but has agreed to a 45-day national security review of the proposed deal. 
   Johnson will continue to oppose the handover of these six ports to this foreign-owned company while working to ensure that a detailed national security review is completed.
