SEN. JOHNSON TO CHAIR WATER & POWER SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office today announced his assignment to be the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, a subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The Water and Power Subcommittee authorizes legislative priorities on policy and projects, such as the Lewis & Clark Water System and other water projects.  
   Johnson has said in the past that "due to mounting budget deficits, federal dollars are harder to come by - this kind of panel assignment is that much more valuable. Providing safe, reliable drinking water is tremendously important to the economic growth and development of South Dakota." 
   The Water and Power Subcommittee authorized the construction of important water projects, including Lewis & Clark and Mni Wiconi Rural Water Systems. Additionally, the Subcommittee exercises oversight on federal irrigation projects throughout the western United States. 
   Johnson has shared his concern with South Dakotans on water issues, saying that "rural communities, including those in our state, have unique water needs." 
   In addition to this Subcommittee Chairmanship, this Congress Johnson has been named Chairman of the Ethics Committee, as well as Chairman of the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee.
