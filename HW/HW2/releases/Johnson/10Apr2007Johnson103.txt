SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES $4.5 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR PLATTE COMMUNITY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Platte Community Memorial Hospital in Platte has received a low-interest federal loan of $4.5 million for expansion and renovations. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   The funding will be used to expand the existing patient care wing, a labor/delivery room and obstetrics patient room and allow for a new surgical suite. 
   As part of his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for promoting economic development in South Dakota, Senator Johnson has pledged to defend USDA Rural Development infrastructure programs against proposed budget cuts. Johnson refers to these programs as an example of his strategy of "Investing in the Public Good," which means directing federal funds to initiatives that pay themselves back in the form of job creation and higher quality of life for South Dakotans. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
