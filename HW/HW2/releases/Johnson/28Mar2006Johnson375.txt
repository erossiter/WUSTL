SEN. JOHNSON FIGHTS FOR SOUTH DAKOTA WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today continued his fight for South Dakota water projects at a hearing of the Energy and Water Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. John Keys, Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, testified before the subcommittee on projects important to South Dakota, including the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System (RWS) among others. Johnson is a member of the subcommittee. 
   "I am actively using my seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to fight for an increase in funding to ensure that Lewis and Clark project remains on schedule," said Johnson. "Although I am glad the Administration provided additional funds for the Lewis and Clark RWS, slight budget increases are falling short of the project capability. We cannot afford to be a penny-wise and a pound foolish when it comes to owning up to these important economic development projects." 
   The President's $21 million budget request for Lewis and Clark falls short of the project capability but is more than in past years.
   South Dakota includes two of the largest ongoing rural water projects in the United States. The Mni Wiconi Rural Water System (RWS) will serve approximately 55,000 people, including historically neglected parts of the state that suffer from a lack of public investment in clean and reliable drinking water. The Lewis and Clark RWS will serve approximately 200,000 people in 20 communities throughout South Dakota, as well as parts of Iowa and Minnesota. 
   In December of 2005, the South Dakota congressional delegation held a joint conference call with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Josh Bolten, to discuss the 2007 budget and South Dakota's rural water network, specifically, Mni Wiconi RWS and Lewis and Clark RWS.
   "It is imperative the Bureau of Reclamation maintain their commitment to South Dakota and ensure adequate federal resources to complete ongoing rural water projects," continued Johnson.
   Next week Senator Johnson will meet with dozens of state leaders working to develop reliable and dependable supplies of drinking water as part of the annual Rural Water Rally for the National Rural Water Association public policy awareness campaign. 
   The mission of the Bureau of Reclamation is to reclaim water for western states to further beneficial purposes, including drinking water supply and irrigation for agriculture lands.
