SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES LABOR-HHS FUNDING BILL PASSES COMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced that more than $10.75 million he secured for South Dakota in the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education spending bill for Fiscal Year 2008 was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Also included in the bill is a bi-partisan stem cell research provision. Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the bill will now move to the full Senate for consideration.  
  "This legislation provides funding for health and education programs that affect thousands of South Dakotans, and the number of projects funded for South Dakota this year is a big victory for our state," Johnson said. "I appreciate Chairman Byrd's efficiency in moving this bill forward and I support Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter's move to include a stem cell research provision in this bill to offer real hope to people facing devastating diseases. The pro-life, moral choice is to support this research and the hope it offers to save and enrich countless lives."
