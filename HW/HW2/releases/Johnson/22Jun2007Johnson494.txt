SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $1.3 MILLION FOR SOUTH DAKOTA TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS CENTER
  Sen. Tim Johnson today announced a grant from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) for $1.2 million to the South Dakota Technology Business Center in Sioux Falls. Sen. Johnson's office communicated with the EDA several times to express his support for the grant, and to encourage its approval. Securing economic development funding is a key part of Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan. 
  The funds will be used for the construction of a new addition to the center and for infrastructure improvements. The project will create an estimated 136 jobs and generate $27 million in private investments. The South Dakota Technology Business Center was originally constructed with the help of an $800,000 federal earmark supported by Senator Johnson, as a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee
  "Economic development funding like this will help the South Dakota Technology Business Center to strengthen our economy, and that makes it possible to achieve progress on many other issues, including generating additional resources for education, reducing crime rates, and making it easier for people to provide for their families," Johnson said.
  According to their website, the Center aims "to diversify and expand the regional economy by providing 'best practices' incubator services and networking opportunities to qualified new and early-stage technology-based companies."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
