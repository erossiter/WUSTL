SEN.JOHNSON MEETS WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) met with Judge Samuel Alito, President George W. Bush's nominee to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court.  
 Alito was appointed to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990 by Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush. Johnson said:
   "Judge Alito and I had a very thoughtful, substantive discussion this morning on a broad range of constitutional issues. While I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, nor a member of the "Gang of 14," I was his second stop of the day, and I'm honored that he was able to come by my office so early in the process.
   "As with past nominees, I will not decide on the nominee until the conclusion of the Judiciary Committee hearings. We are at the very beginning of this process. As I indicated to Judge Alito, his broad experience is a great strength, and it also provides a substantial amount of material for the Committee to review. 
   "Although there will be great pressure to do so, I will not give a litmus test on any issue.
   "I hope the hearings will be expeditious and thorough. I also told Judge Alito that I hoped that advocacy groups on the extreme left and right would settle down and let the process take its course in a respectful manner."
