  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) continues his course of rehabilitative therapy at the in-patient unit at the George Washington University Hospital.  
   "Senator Johnson is actively making decisions about his healthcare and expressing his opinions about his daily activities," says Philip Marion, MD, Medical Director for the Department of Rehabilitative Medicine. "He continues to initiate more conversations and questions. His therapy now includes computer exercises and problem-solving activities." 
   "Our family continues to be impressed with Tim's progress and the wonderful care and support that he is receiving from the hospital and the people of South Dakota. Even though there is a long road ahead to complete recovery, we feel that we have gotten 'our Tim' back," said Barbara Johnson, wife of Senator Johnson. 
   Senator Johnson has been reading the newspaper and following news, especially news from South Dakota. At this point, he has requested more contact with office and is looking for updates from staff.
