SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON REMOVAL OF PRAIRIE DOG FROM ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the removal of the black-tailed prairie dog from the list of candidates for federal endangered species protection: 
   "I am pleased that we can move forward with the common-sense management of the black-tailed prairie dog," said Johnson. "Through coordinated efforts we can strike the right balance, effectively controlling prairie dogs while ensuring that the species is not decimated from all public lands."
   On June 23rd of this year, in a hearing of the Energy Committee's Public Lands Subcommittee, Johnson requested the black-tailed prairie dog be removed from consideration for the Endangered Species list. Johnson contended that the biological survey data collected does not support the inclusion of the species on the candidate list.
   Then, on Tuesday, August 10th, Senator Johnson, Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD), and Representative Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) contacted Secretary of Interior Gail Norton, requesting that she make good on the Department of Interior's pledge to decide by August whether to remove the black-tailed prairie dog from the candidate list for protection under the Endangered Species Act.
   Information provided by the multi-state Prairie Dog Conservation Team, South Dakota's Black-Tailed Prairie Dog Management Plan, and other states' plans strongly demonstrates that black-tailed prairie dog populations are biologically viable and that state management plans are focused on sustaining the long-term viability of the species.
