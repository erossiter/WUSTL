SEN. JOHNSON SEEKS FEEDBACK ON OIL REFINERY PROPOSAL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has been briefed by his staff on the proposal by Hyperion Resources, Inc. to build an oil refinery in Union County, and believes that while economic development is a key concern of his for South Dakota, there are many questions that need to be answered first. 
  "I have been briefed on the Hyperion project by my staff, and while I am always interested in new economic development opportunities, there are many questions that need to be answered, including what the people of Union County think about this proposal and how it would affect their quality-of-life," said U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD). "As Americans require more energy, we know we need to look at all domestic sources of energy with ethanol, biodiesel and wind production leading the way."
  Julianne Fisher, Communications Director for Senator Johnson, said other concerns that have been raised include:
  * It is important that the people who live and work in Union County understand how a project of this magnitude will affect their communities, their air and water quality, other industry and overall quality-of-life. 
  * We also know that large-scale industrial projects must be constructed to minimize the effect on local agriculture producers and small businesses that rely on access to reliable water supplies. Oil and gas refineries require millions of gallons of water daily, a resource increasingly important to other economic development opportunities and quality-of-life in South Dakota. 
  * A proposal of this size and complexity requires substantial capital financing to retain construction and design firms with the experience and resources to build large energy projects. 
  * It appears there will be considerable additional federal incentives needed to construct an oil refinery, including changes to federal law. All of this must pass muster with tax-payers and serve the overall public interest.
