SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON 1,000TH AMERICAN KILLED IN IRAQ
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in response to media reports that the 1,000th American was killed in Iraq today.  
 The figure includes servicemen and women as well as contractors working to rebuild Iraq:
   "This is certainly a tragic milestone, and serves as further evidence of the Administration's failure to garner adequate international support. We should have a true international coalition helping in Iraq, not just in resolutions, not just in rhetoric. As a father of a soldier, my thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of those we have lost and I continue to think of those still on guard."
