UNION COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that he has selected Union County as his January 2008 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his Senate website. 
   "Union County has a great history and continues to offer so much to South Dakota," Johnson said. "I am pleased to have worked with the community on many issues over the years, from securing funding for the construction of a new library to continued funding for water projects like Lewis and Clark and the Missouri River."
   Formed in 1862, Union County was the site of the Lewis and Clark exhibition in 1804 and is one of the oldest communities in South Dakota. The area is rich in fertile land and is ripe for growing corn and soybeans. The county is also home to Elk Point, which is a proposed site for an oil refinery.
   In 2007, Johnson fought to secure $198,000 for the construction of a new library in North Sioux City. A strong supporter of South Dakota water projects, Johnson has secured nearly $110 million for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Project. Johnson, a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, has also secured $9.4 million since 2005 for the Big Sioux River Flood Control Project to prevent flooding.
   A strong advocate of putting weather radios in every home, Johnson secured funding for those transmitters, as well as additional towers to carry the alert broadcasts throughout the state. More than 95 percent of South Dakotans are now covered by the early warning system.
   "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places," Johnson said.
