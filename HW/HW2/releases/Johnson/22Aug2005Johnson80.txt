SEN. JOHNSON RECOGNIZED BY MISSOURI RIVER ENERGY SERVICES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) was recognized today by Missouri River Energy Services as its featured lawmaker for his work on the Energy Bill.  
 Johnson was a negotiator on the Energy Bill conference committee and is a member of the Senate Energy Committee. 
   Missouri River Energy Services said that Johnson led the effort to strip language from the bill "that would have placed an unnecessary burden on public power systems and rural electric cooperatives." 
   "I believe that local energy cooperatives and public power systems can best decide how to manage their energy grid and meet the needs of customers," said Johnson. "I will continue to fight for the type of flexible, cost effective oversight that preserves the local decision-making process." 
   The Johnson amendment struck out a provision inserted by House of Representatives conference committee members that would have mandated an open-ended customer service assessment by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) of rural electric cooperatives. Johnson proposed the amendment because that these required assessments would have caused an increased burden for not-for-profit utilities. FERC already has the authority to conduct this type of study if it chooses to, and there is no reason to make them mandatory. 
   "I am pleased that local energy cooperatives will continue to have the flexibility they need to meet the needs of their customers," said Johnson. "This bill will benefit consumers by reducing the cost of electricity by encouraging investment in electric generation and transmission lines, including new wind generation facilities."
