SEN. JOHNSON HOLDS AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS ROUNDTABLE IN SIOUX FALLS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today held a roundtable discussion at the AARP's South Dakota State Office and reiterated his strong commitment to providing affordable health care and retirement security. Johnson signed the AARP's "Divided We Fail" pledge earlier this year, and has since introduced legislation to protect seniors from skyrocketing health care costs.  
  "My roundtable discussion today in Sioux Falls highlighted the importance of financial security and having reliable health care, which I have learned firsthand the past year," said Johnson. "I will continue to fight for quality health care for all South Dakotans, and am committed to providing our nation's seniors with the retirement security they deserve."
  Johnson signed the AARP's "Divided We Fail" pledge earlier this year. In signing the document, Johnson promised to continue to work across party lines to tackle our nation's biggest health care issues, including improving access to care and strengthening Social Security.
  In December, Johnson introduced the Social Security COLA Protection Act, to protect seniors and individuals with disabilities on fixed incomes from skyrocketing health care costs. The bill ensures that no more than 25 percent of a beneficiary's annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) could be consumed by increases in Medicare Part B and D premiums. 
  Participants at the event included Sam Wilson, AARP member, Pat Gross, AARP State President, Bob O'Connell, Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce, Joan McMillen, Social Workers Association, Scott Graff, Community Healthcare Association of the Dakotas, and Karen Kovar, from Home Federal Bank.
