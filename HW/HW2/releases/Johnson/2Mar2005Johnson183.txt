SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON INJUNCTION BLOCKING BORDER REOPENING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today issued the following statement reacting to reports that a Federal District Court Judge in Montana put in place a temporary restraining order, preventing the border from being re-opened on March 7, 2005:  
   "Until Canada has a firm handle on its BSE problem and the U.S. has implemented mandatory country-of-origin labeling, this injunction should be made permanent. We should not open the floodgates to Canadian cattle at a time like this, threatening consumer confidence here at home and damaging export markets abroad. I am pleased the District Court Judge has come down on the side of common sense. My colleagues and I in the Senate will attempt to do the same with a Resolution of Disapproval regarding USDA's rule as soon as tomorrow."
