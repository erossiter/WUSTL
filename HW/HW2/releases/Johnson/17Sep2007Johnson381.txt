  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Yankton Sioux Tribe will receive a $389,996 federal grant from the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women (OVW) to help prevent domestic violence and sexual assault against women.  
  "This funding will provide significant resources for American Indians who are victims of violent crimes and help the Yankton Sioux Tribe increase safety," Johnson said. "We must do everything we can to provide communities in South Dakota and across the nation with the resources necessary to prevent violent crime and help victims."
  The Yankton Sioux Tribe, together with its partner, the South Dakota Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault, will use the funding to provide services to victims of violent crime and advocate prevention through public education and community awareness.
