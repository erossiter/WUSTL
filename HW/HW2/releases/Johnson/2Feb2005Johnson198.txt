SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S STATE-OF-THE-UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in reaction to President George W. Bush's State-of-the-Union Address, in which the President outlined his case for privatization of Social Security: 
   "I am prepared to work with the President in a good faith, bipartisan manner on all the issues brought up in the State of the Union speech. That having been said, I was disappointed that President Bush chose not to divulge more details about his Social Security plan. 
   "I do not support the cuts in Social Security benefits or the borrowing of $2 trillion that his proposal would apparently require. I also believe that Social Security should continue to have a defined and definite payment level that every citizen can rely on to the dime when they plan their retirement, and their payment should not be dependent on the state of the stock market at any given time. On the other hand, I would like to work with the President on ways that would create additional tax incentives for Americans to save and invest more as an augmentation, rather than as a replacement of Social Security. 
   "Lastly, I had hoped to hear more from the President regarding agriculture, rural development and the unique education and health care problems facing rural citizens. Neither party has all the answers, and I will work to build bridges of understanding and cooperation between the White House and Senate, and between Republicans and Democrats."
