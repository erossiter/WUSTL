SEN. JOHNSON REQUESTS MEETING WITH INCOMING VA SECRETARY TO DISCUSS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has requested a meeting with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Designate Jim Nicholson.  
 Earlier this month, Nicholson was announced as the President's choice to replace Secretary Anthony Principi.
   "I do not believe the yearly struggle to provide just enough funding for VA health care is sustainable or fair to our veterans. Therefore, during the past two Congresses I have introduced legislation to guarantee that the VA health care system receives sufficient funding each year by making VA health care spending mandatory," Johnson said in his invitation. 
   Johnson intends to introduce similar legislation in the 109th Congress. His legislation has been endorsed by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Disabled American Veterans.
   Today, Johnson is in Rapid City to present service medals in honor of five distinguished veterans. 
   South Dakota is home to more than 79,000 veterans, as well as seven clinics and three VA medical centers.
   Contact: Julianne Fisher and Noah Pinegar, 202/224-5842.
