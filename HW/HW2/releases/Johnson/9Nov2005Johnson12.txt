LEGISLATION TO FOSTER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN INDIAN COUNTRY PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that legislation to foster housing development in Indian Country, the Native American Housing Enhancement Act (NAHEA) passed unanimously in the Senate last evening. Johnson, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, introduced a version of this legislation earlier this year. 
   "Native Americans, including those in my home state of South Dakota, experience some of the worst housing conditions in the country. Having listened to tribal housing authorities in my state and across the nation, I know that there are several legislative changes that can make a big difference in the tremendous goal of getting tribal people appropriately housed," Johnson said. "This bill will give tribes the flexibility they need to have greater control over their housing needs and plans. After all, tribes know best what their specific housing needs are."
   Johnson's legislation was first introduced in the 108th Congress. Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives, and has bipartisan support. NAHEA was born out of conversations with tribal leaders and the National American Indian Housing Council. 
   The legislation (HR 797) will now go back to the House of Representatives for final approval.
   The parts of the legislation to foster housing development in Native communities, NAHEA, are as follows: 
   * Eligibility of Indian Tribes for Youthbuild Grants. The bill amends the Cranston-National Affordable Housing Act so that Indian tribes, tribally designated housing entities, or other agencies that primarily serve Indians can qualify for Youthbuild grants. 
   * Amends the NAHASDA to prevent reduction of grants. The bill clarifies Congress' requirement that HUD gives housing authorities the ability to retain program money for successive grant years, ultimately providing tribes and tribal entities more flexibility in planning.
   * Civil Rights Compliance. The bill amends the Civil Rights Act so it is clear that Indian tribes qualify for USDA funding without violating the Civil Rights Act. The Department of Agriculture has been a significant funding source for tribal housing projects. This bill would make sure that tribes are able to tap into all available sources to meet housing needs. Furthermore, this bill ensures that tribes are on equal footing with other groups that apply for USDA funding, rather than excluded as is happening pursuant to current law.
