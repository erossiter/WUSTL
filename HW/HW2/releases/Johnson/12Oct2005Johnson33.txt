SEN. JOHNSON: DON'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON MIERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in response to attacks on White House counsel Harriet Miers, President Bush's nominee to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court:  
   "Pundits and politicians across the country and political spectrum have rushed to judgment on Ms. Miers. While it is the Senate's constitutional duty to carefully consider nominees for this lifetime appointment, first we need the opportunity to actually consider her. In other words, the Senate Judiciary Committee has a job to do, and we must step back and let the process take its course. 
   "Calls from the left or the right for the President to withdraw her nomination are not only putting the cart before the horse, they are out of line at this stage. 
   "I hope Ms. Miers is both open and honest with the Committee so that all sides will have a chance to hear from her. I look forward to learning more about her and only then, will I make my decision."
