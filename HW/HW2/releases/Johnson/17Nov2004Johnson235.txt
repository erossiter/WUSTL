SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON DEBT LIMIT INCREASE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the Senate voting to increase the federal debt limit.  
 The Senate voted to raise the amount the federal government is legally allowed to owe roughly $800 billion to a new record $8.2 trillion.
   "I'm not sure if they felt it, but another $800 billion in debt was just placed on the backs of our children and grandchildren. While we have to keep the government running today, we must stop the flood of red ink in Washington, work in a bipartisan manner, and restore fiscal responsibility to the federal government. If South Dakotans managed their books this way, we'd all have lost the farm a long time ago."
   The debt ceiling equates to the amount of money the Federal Government is allowed to borrow to keep the government running. Overspending, including recent tax cuts and higher-than-expected costs for the war in Iraq have brought the country very near to the current debt ceiling.
