SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES JONATHAN ADELSTEIN TO SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today introduced Jonathan Adelstein to the Senate Commerce Committee, the panel that is charged with considering the nomination of the Rapid City native to the Federal Communications Commission for a full term. 
   "Jonathan's re-nomination is long overdue," said Johnson. "Jonathan's service on the FCC has provided critical insight into the telecommunications challenges facing rural communities. I want to work with the Commerce Committee to secure confirmation of Commissioner Adelstein before the adjournment of the 108th Congress."
   Adelstein's re-nomination has drawn significant bipartisan support. At least 17 members of the Commerce Committee contacted President Bush to express their support for his continued service on the FCC.
   "I'm confident Commissioner Adelstein will continue to be strong voice for rural America and will work with the other commissioners to determine telecommunications policy in a way that encourages telecommunications advances in rural areas of our country," Johnson added.
   Adelstein was selected to serve on the FCC by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD), and nominated this week by President George W. Bush for a full term. Adelstein was joined at the hearing this morning by his wife, Karen, and his two children, Adam and Lexi.
