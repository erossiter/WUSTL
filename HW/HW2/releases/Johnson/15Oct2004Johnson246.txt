SEN. JOHNSON EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE PRICE GOUGING OF FLU VACCINE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) encouraged South Dakota Attorney General Larry Long to investigate the possibility of flu vaccine price gouging problems in South Dakota. Due to the shortages of the flu shot vaccine nationally, their have been wide spread reports across the country of price inflation of the vaccine and even theft of the vaccine from doctors' offices.  
   "The recent shortages have lead to some people trying to take advantage of the crisis and charge as much as 10 times the usual price," Johnson said. "I would like to work with Attorney General Long to make sure it is not happening and does not happen back home. We should be working together to make sure the right people get the vaccine without any additional burden."
   Recently the nation's flu vaccine supply was cut in half due to the unfortunate contamination of the supply provided by one of only two manufacturers. 
   "South Dakota's hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other vaccine providers are doing a great job to deal as best as possible with the current shortage problem. We have even seen examples of voluntary sharing of vaccine supplies to make sure they get to the people most at risk. My fear is that there is the potential for vaccine wholesalers outside of South Dakota who distribute supply to our state's providers may try and take advantage of the vaccine shortage situation, charging far beyond what is considered a fair price," Johnson continued. 
   Earlier this week, Johnson joined several of his colleagues in asking Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tommy Thompson to investigate that officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were aware of potential manufacturing problems at Chiron's Liverpool, England facility as early as June of 2003, when there was still time to prevent a crisis. 
   Johnson also joined colleagues in introducing the Emergency Flu Response Act. This legislation, if enacted immediately upon the return from recess, will require the Secretary of HHS to seek to purchase additional stocks of vaccine if available from other countries, and only those that have been approved by the regulatory agencies of those nations. It also establishes a vaccine clearinghouse to facilitate the voluntary donation of vaccine from those companies who may have employees at low-risk, so that those in the high-risk categories can be ensured an adequate supply. 
   Who should be vaccinated? The existing flu vaccine supplies should be given to protect people who are at greatest risk from serious complications from influenza disease.
