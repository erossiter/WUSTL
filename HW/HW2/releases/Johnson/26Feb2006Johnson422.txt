SEN. JOHNSON READS TO KIDS AT RAPID CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today read to children at Knollwood Heights Elementary School in Rapid City as part of Read Across South Dakota Week. Children from Kindergarten through the 3rd grade gathered to hear Johnson read the book House Mouse, Senate Mouse. 
   "I enjoyed reading as a child, then reading to my children as a parent, and now to their children as a grandfather," said Johnson. "Reading is a fun activity, important to every child's education. The goal of this program is to make reading fun and part of the everyday lives of the children who participate."
   Originally created as a one-day event to celebrate the joy of reading, South Dakota Education Association's (SDEA) Read Across South Dakota, part of the National Education Association's Read Across America, is sponsored by the National Education Association, Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P., and more than 50 national sponsors including the National Football League Players Association, has grown into the nation's largest reading celebration.
   Read Across America culminates each year on or around March 2-the birthday of beloved children's author Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. The program provides children with motivation to read and delivers an important message: Kids who read-and are read to-do better in school and in life. Read Across America calls on every community to celebrate Dr. Seuss's birthday through reading motivation and awareness. The literacy program also provides SDEA members, parents, caregivers, and children the resources and activities they need to keep reading on their calendar 365 days a year.
   Senator Johnson was also pleased when he recently received an 'A' grade from the National Education Association (NEA) on its Congressional Report Card for his efforts on education-related issues in the first session of the 109th Congress.
