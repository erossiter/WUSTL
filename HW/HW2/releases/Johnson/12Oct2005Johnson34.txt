SEN. JOHNSON ATTENDS PRAIRIE ETHANOL PLANT GROUNDBREAKING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a negotiator on the Energy Bill conference committee and Member of the Senate Energy Committee, attended the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Prairie Ethanol Plant in Loomis and spoke about the role South Dakota will play in creating renewable fuels for America.  
 Johnson helped secure a 7.5 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) by 2012 as part of the Energy Bill, which was signed by the President in August. 
   "I'm excited to see another top notch ethanol plant being built in South Dakota," said Johnson. "The 7.5 billion gallon RFS and tax incentives for energy production will have long term benefits for South Dakota. I'm also pleased to know that in the long term, South Dakota-produced ethanol will help reduce the unpredictable price of gas and help make our country less dependent on foreign sources of oil." 
   The Renewable Fuels Standard that was adopted by Congress and signed into law by the President will implement a robust standard beginning in 2006 and require refiners to blend 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel. That standard would be gradually increased over the next several years until 2012 when refiners will be required to blend a total of 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels. 
   Additionally, the Energy Bill includes language introduced by Senator Johnson that expands the small ethanol producer tax credit. Now ethanol facilities that produce up to 60 million gallons of ethanol annually can take advantage of the credit. The total economic value to producers in South Dakota will exceed $12 million annually.
