SENATE COMMITTEE PASSES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson announced Senate Appropriations Committee passage of the Interior Appropriations Bill, which contains $26.052 billion in for forest, wildlife, and public lands programs. The bill is $108 million more than the House version, which passed on May 18th. 
   "The funding provided through the Interior Appropriations Bill directly improves the delivery of health care and social services to thousands of South Dakotans through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service," said Johnson. "The Interior Appropriations Bill also includes critical funding to enhance the stewardship and multiple uses of the millions of acres of public lands within our state.  
   "The work done at EROS data center is cutting edge, which is why it is so important to ensure that EROS is able to continue their mission and why I have worked to keep these high skill jobs at home," continued Johnson. "Further, after the Bush administration cut the Johnson-O'Malley funds, we fought to ensure that Indian children continue to receive a quality grade school education."
   SPECIFICS OF THE BILL INCLUDE:
   -$78.6 million for Geographic Research, Investigations and Remote Sensing, which is $2 million above the President's budget request. This includes $16 million in additional funds to prepare the EROS Data Center near Sioux Falls to receive and process data from a future satellite referred to as Landsat 8. 
   -$14.4 million to restore Johnson-O'Malley Education Grants, which affects the approximately 93% of Indian students who attend public schools in 23 states.
