SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS PRESIDENT FOR JOINING CALL FOR INVESTIGATION ON GAS PRICES
  In response to rising gas prices last September, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined with other members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct an investigation into concerns of price gouging on the part of oil companies and keep Congress and the public aware of any findings. Today, President George W. Bush joined in asking the FTC to finish that investigation. 
   "Gas prices are hurting consumers. We must do whatever is possible to moderate the price of gas. In South Dakota, farmers, small businesses, and the entire driving public are all too familiar with the sting of high gasoline prices," Johnson said. "Last year, the Energy Committee requested that the FTC investigate gasoline prices to determine if the consolidation of refinery capacity in the hands of a few companies is gouging consumers and increasing prices. I'm glad to see the President has finally joined that call."
   Members of the Committee sent a letter to FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras requesting immediate action. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires that the Federal Trade Commission conduct an investigation to determine if the price of gasoline is being artificially controlled by market manipulation or price gouging.
