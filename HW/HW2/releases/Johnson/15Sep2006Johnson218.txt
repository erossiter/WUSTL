SEN. JOHNSON REFLECTS ON VIETNAM MEMORIAL DEDICATION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will attend the parade and dedication of the South Dakota Vietnam War Memorial in Pierre.  
   Johnson, a tireless advocate for veterans and soldiers, reflected on the day's significance and hoped for healing with the memorial; in advance of Saturday's events in Pierre, Johnson released the following statement and actuality:
   This is an opportunity to honor the 28,000 South Dakotans who served during the Vietnam War and to pay special tribute to the 207 South Dakotans who died. I hope this will help to heal some old wounds. 
   We know that the Vietnam War was a particularly difficult time in American history. Our troops who fought with tremendous distinction, courage and professionalism didn't always come home to the kind of reception that they deserved. 
   We want to send a signal to all of these veterans and their families who stood by them that, at least at this time in our history, this generation does honor them and recognizes the great contributions and sacrifices they've made for the sake of America. 
   I'm very appreciative of all the effort that went into this, and it is going to be a very moving event.
