SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $2.97 MILLION IN FUNDING TO LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Inter Lakes Community Action, Inc will receive $2,967,576 in funding for the Head Start program.  
 The grant comes to the Inter Lakes Community Action, Inc. and will help cover Head Start and Early Head Start projects. 
   "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel. Head Start paves the way for a strong educational foundation. Head Start is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "The program allows kids, who normally would not be able to afford pre-school, the opportunity to get an excellent preparatory experience before entering school."
   Head Start and Early Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering school. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents.
   The grant is awarded by the Department of Health & Human Services.
