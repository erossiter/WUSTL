SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES INDIAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE ACTION ON TRIBAL PARITY ACT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced the Senate Indian Affairs Committee approved the Tribal Parity Act, which would compensate the Lower Brule Sioux and Crow Creek Tribes for the impact of the Fort Randall and Big Bend Dams on the Missouri River.  
 Johnson is a cosponsor of the legislation with Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD).
   The legislation was debated and approved in the Indian Affairs Committee, of which Johnson is a member.
   "The Tribal Parity Act would resolve inequities created by two Pick-Sloan projects, the Fort Randall and Big Bend Dams," said Johnson. "The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the Crow Creek Tribe have waited for this legislation. The Senate should take up and pass this legislation as soon as possible."
   The Fort Randall project began in 1946, the Big Bend project in 1960. Both resulted in the inundation of several thousands of acres of the reservation lands of the Lower Brule Sioux and the Crow Creek Tribes. The Tribal Parity Act, S. 1530, would increase the compensation to the tribes, creating 'parity' with the amounts per acre received by other tribes affected by Pick-Sloan projects.
   The Crow Creek Tribe's compensation would be raised from $27,500,000 to $105,917,853. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe's funding would increase from $39,300,000 to $186,342,140. The funding would be placed in the infrastructure development trust funds for the respective tribes. 
   The bill must next be considered by the full Senate.
