BANKING COMMITTEE PASSES INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANY BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) was pleased to see the passage of the Industrial Loan Company (ILC) bill out of the Senate Banking Committee today and released the following statement:  
  This legislation reforms the regulatory structure of ILCs, improves the supervision of ILCs, clarifies the appropriate use of an Industrial Loan Company, and closes the loophole for commercial ownership of taxpayer-insured depository institutions. 
  I was glad to see passage of this ILC bill because it will improve the safety, soundness, and competitiveness of the lending sector. 
  This bill is supported by ABA, ICBA, SIFMA, Sound Banking Coalition, AFL-CIO, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), Change to Win, International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT),Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBC), United Farm Workers of America (UFW), and the auto-companies.
  In May, Senator Johnson, along with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Wayne Allard (R-CO), introduced the bipartisan Industrial Bank Holding Company Act (S. 1356), to restore the separation of banking and commerce by preventing additional commercial firms from acquiring or establishing industrial loan companies (ILC).
