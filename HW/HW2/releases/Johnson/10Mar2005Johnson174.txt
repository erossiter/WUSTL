SEN. JOHNSON URGES CREDIT REPORTING OF CHAPTER 13 PAYMENT PLANS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, announced today that he is working to ensure that Americans who repay a portion of their debt under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code benefit from making good on their obligations.  
   "I believe that the credit reporting system may be able to play a positive role in helping bankruptcy filers rehabilitate their credit more quickly," Senator Johnson said during Thursday's Senate Banking Committee hearing.
   Johnson said that he intends to work actively with the Bankruptcy Advisory committees and trustees, the credit bureaus, and industry players to encourage full reporting of Chapter 13 payment plans to credit bureaus. 
   The Senate is poised to pass S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Bankruptcy petitioners with relatively high incomes could be required to file under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7, and repay some of their debt out of future income. In return, Johnson said he believes that debtors should have a positive incentive to choose a repayment plan whenever possible.
   "The credit reporting system is only as good as the information contained in it, and we have an important opportunity to encourage reporting that will help hard-working Americans who have fallen on hard times prove that they can handle credit responsibly," Senator Johnson said. "Those people who are able to repay any part of their debt should get credit for that, and I intend to work hard to make sure that happens."
