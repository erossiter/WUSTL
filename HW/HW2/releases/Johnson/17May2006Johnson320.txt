SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES OVER $1.2 MILLION IN FUNDING TO CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE HEAD START
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $1,230,376 in funding to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Head Start program located in Eagle Butte. The grants will be used to help all of the Head Start activities that include both full year and part day programs. 
   "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel. Head Start builds a strong educational foundation and Head Start is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "The program allows kids whose families might not be able to afford pre-school the opportunity to get excellent preparation before entering grade school. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering grade school. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents.
   The grant is awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's and Indian Country's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
