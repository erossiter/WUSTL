SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  In response to inquiries, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), who has been monitoring the situation, released the following statement in regard to the recent investigations involving Attorney General Alberto Gonzales:  
   At the time of his confirmation to be Attorney General I said that Gonzales' record made him unqualified to take on the role of representing the American justice system to the rest of the world. As the father of a soldier who served in combat in both Afghanistan and Iraq, I was particularly concerned that our nation's utilization of torture creates an environment where other nations and other organizations feel they have justification for torturing our troops or citizens. 
   Since that time, Gonzales has mishandled his position as Attorney General, most glaringly in the firing of up to nine U.S. Attorneys. The recent investigations have further weakened my confidence in his leadership. There has been a litany of evidence that has come forth during his tenure that casts serious doubt on his ability to lead the Justice Department, and I think it is time for him to step down. I would agree with a growing list of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and would cast a vote of no confidence for Attorney General Gonzales. It is time to return trust and integrity to the Justice Department. The American people deserve better.
