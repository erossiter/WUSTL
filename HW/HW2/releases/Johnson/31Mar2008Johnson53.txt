SEN. JOHNSON REACTS TO RESIGNATION OF HUD SECRETARY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in response to the resignation of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Alphonso Jackson amidst allegations of misconduct: 
   I have heard from many South Dakotans that have received poor treatment by HUD and experienced difficulties dealing with the agency at all levels.
   In the last couple years, tenant-based housing and property managers across South Dakota have contacted me to report that HUD has been delinquent making tenant-based Section 8 payments and that the agency has delayed contract renewals. When I contacted Secretary Jackson's office regarding revised estimates to cover the costs of owed payments, I was disappointed the Secretary resisted revising cost estimates to address this problem.
   It is my hope that President Bush will take this opportunity to nominate an individual who will put the interests of homeowners and secure, affordable housing first.
   In the current housing market our nation deserves nothing less than a HUD Secretary who will responsibly work to fulfill the agency's obligation to our nation's housing needs.
