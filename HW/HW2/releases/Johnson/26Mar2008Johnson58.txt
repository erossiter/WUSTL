SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES DEUEL TO RECEIVE FUNDS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the City of Gary in Deuel County will receive funding to improve local water infrastructure in the area. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
  The city will receive a $73,000 federal grant and a $231,000 low-interest federal loan to repair and enhance the existing wastewater system. Gary will also receive a $25,000 federal grant and an $82,000 low-interest federal loan to upgrade the interior and exterior of the water tower. 
  "Proper water infrastructure is crucial for our communities and this funding will greatly benefit the people in Deuel County and surrounding areas," said Johnson. "One of the pillars of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
