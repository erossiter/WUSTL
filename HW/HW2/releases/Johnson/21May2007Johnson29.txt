SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, S. 1348, currently being considered by the Senate:  
   Last year I supported the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate by a large bipartisan majority. That legislation sought many of the same goals as the current proposal; enhanced border security, a guest worker program, and an earned path to citizenship program to address undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. 
   I will continue to support legislation that first strengthens our borders, creates a temporary worker program, and requires undocumented immigrants to go to the back of the line, pay substantial fines, pass a background check, and learn English and American civics before being put on a path to citizenship. There are an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants inside the United States and reasonable reforms are necessary to bring them out of the shadows better utilizing the contributions immigrants make to our nation. It would be impossible to deport a population the size of Ohio, and I will continue to monitor the legislation moving through the Senate to ensure it remains realistic and reflects our nation's values. 
   Except for Native Americans, we are a nation of immigrants, and we all have relatives that risked the impossible coming to a foreign land to live out the American dream. True immigration reforms needs real solutions rather than bumper sticker slogans and punitive-but-unachievable strategies. I look forward to this debate and hope the Senate can again pass consensus driven solutions to secure our borders, crack down on employers who hire illegally, bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows, while continuing grow our economy.
