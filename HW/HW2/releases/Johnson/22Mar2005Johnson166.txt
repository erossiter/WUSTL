SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $3.24 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR JOE FOSS FIELD IN SIOUX FALLS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Sioux Falls Airport has been awarded $ 3,243,602.00 in funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for airport improvements, including rehabilitation of the taxiway and apron. 
   "This funding will improve transportation conditions at Joe Foss Filed in Sioux Falls. Our airports not only move people from community-to-community, but act as a source of economic growth. The goal is to keep them both safe and viable to help the entire region," Johnson said. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I support ongoing efforts to improve safety conditions at our airports."
   Federal funds are being provided to update the airport master plan and to reconstruct portions of Taxiways A, B and the terminal apron. The updated of the master plan will allow for development that meets the needs of the airport and complies with FAA regulations. The reconstruction of portions of Taxiways A, B, and the terminal apron are necessary to restore the structural integrity due to cracking and spalling of the existing pavement.
   The funds are provided through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Improvement Program and are made available to eligible public-use airports throughout South Dakota and the United States. The FAA Airport Improvement Program is targeted toward public-use airports for most capital improvement projects, including rehabilitating runway visual guidance systems, snow removal equipment, and rehabilitating taxiway aprons. The program also funds planning and design work, including airport master plans and environmental assessments. 
   "The Airport Improvement Program is an effective and critical aid-to-aviation program that ensures South Dakota's public-use airports take advantage of the latest safety improvements and advances in design and acquisition."
   The President's proposed Fiscal Year 2006 Budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program by $500 million to $3 billion and a full $600 million below the amount authorized for the program. As a member of both the Senate Budget and Senate Appropriation Committees, Senator Johnson will work to restore the proposed cuts to this important economic development and safety program.
