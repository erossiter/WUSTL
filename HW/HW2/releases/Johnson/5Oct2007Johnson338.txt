SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES COMMON SENSE TAX RELIEF FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) introduced the Local Officials Tax Relief Act,which would fix a provision in the tax code that leads to overly burdensome taxes for local community leaders. Johnson has introduced similar legislation during the 108th and 109th Congresses. 
  "Towns wouldn't function without the help of South Dakotans who give their time and effort to local government," said Johnson. "Communities shouldn't be forced to turn away those willing to give their time due to unnecessary and complicated tax laws."
  The South Dakota Association of Towns and Townships, which represents 497 townships and 79 small towns, has contacted Johnson extensively regarding the importance of this matter to the state's rural communities.
  "This legislation is a common sense fix to an overly complicated problem," Johnson said. "Most local government officials spend hours sifting through form after form and calculating the tax by hand. This bill would relieve them of that burden while allowing them to continue to their civic duty."
  The legislation would relieve local towns and townships of collecting payroll taxes on local board and commission members earning less than $1,300 a year. The cost of collecting the taxes often exceeds the amount of revenue they generate. The legislation requires board members to still pay regular income and payroll taxes on income earned for any employment outside their board or commission responsibilities.
