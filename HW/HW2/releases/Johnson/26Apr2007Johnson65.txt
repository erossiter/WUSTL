SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR STATE LABOR DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the South Dakota Department of Labor will receive a $581,995 grant that will be used to provide those receiving Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability with better access to the employment community and work incentive information. The grant funding is provided through U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA).  
   "Good jobs are the backbone of any community and it's important that all South Dakotans can access employment opportunities from across the state," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good. This funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment, which will pay long-term dividends in the future." 
   The ETA serves customers with disabilities by promoting outreach, establishing stronger links to employers and instituting an integrated workforce system. This funding will grant the South Dakota Department of Labor more opportunities to help those with disabilities in the state find jobs. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
