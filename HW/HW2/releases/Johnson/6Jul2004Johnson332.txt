SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS EFFORT TO EXTEND MILK INCOME LOSS CONTRACT PROGRAM FOR DAIRY PRODUCERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined in introducing legislation to extend a popular program that provides assistance to dairy producers when market prices fall below certain levels, the Milk Income Loss Contract Program (MILC).  
 The program allows milk prices for producers to remain relatively stable, even during fluctuating supply and demand.
   "Maintaining stable prices for milk is important for South Dakota families," said Johnson. "This bipartisan legislation is also important for independent dairy producers. Extending the current MILC program and adjusting the cap will allow 96% of South Dakota dairy producers to be covered. I am proud to support this equitable safety net on behalf of family producers."
   Johnson is an original cosponsor of the bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN) and Senator Herb Kohl (D-WI). The bill would extend the MILC program, which is set to expire September 30, 2005, for two years. The legislation would also raise the 2.4 million pound annual volume cap limit on MILC payment, as included in the original MILC program, to 4.8 million pounds. 
   Under the program, when milk prices are strong, no assistance is provided. The assistance only becomes available during dramatic drops in the price of milk. 
   Since the program's creation as part of the 2002 Farm bill, South Dakota producers have drawn over $22 million in assistance during dips in milk prices.
