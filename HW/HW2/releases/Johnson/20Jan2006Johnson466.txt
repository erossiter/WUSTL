SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON SUSPENSION OF U.S. BEEF IMPORTS TO JAPAN
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement after hearing that Japan has suspended U.S. beef imports after a recent shipment was found to possibly contain products at risk for BSE. 
   "The USDA has taken responsibility for the error that led to the suspension of U.S. beef imports to Japan and has taken steps necessary to correct the problem and punish the processing plant at fault. Although this is not a food safety issue, the timing of this error will surely cause our producers heartburn while this situation is cleared up. American beef is among the safest in the world, and it is my hope that Japan works with the USDA to open up trade again as soon as possible," said Senator Johnson.
   Earlier today, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said, "Under U.S. regulations, the backbone, or vertebral column that was exported to Japan is not a specified risk material because it was in beef under 30 months. However, our agreement with Japan is to export beef with no vertebral column and we have failed to meet the terms of that agreement... We take this matter seriously, recognizing the importance of our beef export market, and we are acting swiftly and firmly."
   Japan had just reopened its border at the end of 2005, in part, based on pressure from U.S. lawmakers. In October 2005, Johnson joined with a group of twenty other bipartisan Senators in writing a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman requesting that he employ economic measures against Japan when efforts to resume regular beef trade with that nation stalled.
   Japan initially banned U.S. beef and beef products in December of 2003 following the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States. That particular cow was born in Canada.
