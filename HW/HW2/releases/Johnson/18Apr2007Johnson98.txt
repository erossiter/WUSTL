SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES $1.6 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR NEW HIGH SCHOOL IN WOONSOCKET
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Santel Communications Cooperative, Inc. in Woonsocket will receive a low-interest federal loan of $1.6 million. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   The funding will be re-lent by the Santel Communications Cooperative, Inc. to the Woonsocket School District to build a new high school. The project will ensure the continuation of 37 jobs. 
   As part of his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for promoting economic development in South Dakota, Senator Johnson has pledged to defend USDA Rural Development infrastructure programs against proposed budget cuts. Johnson refers to these programs as an example of his strategy of "Investing in the Public Good," which means directing federal funds to initiatives that pay themselves back in the form of job creation and higher quality of life for South Dakotans. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
