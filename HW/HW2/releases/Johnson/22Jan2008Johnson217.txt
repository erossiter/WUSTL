ABERDEEN STUDENT SELECTED FOR SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Jacob Fuhrman of Aberdeen has been selected to take part in the 46th Annual United States Senate Youth Program. Fuhrman is one of two South Dakota students selected for the Washington, D.C. program, which drew hundreds of applicants from across the state. 
  "Each year two outstanding high school students from the state are chosen to take part in this merit-based program," Johnson said. "Jacob has demonstrated outstanding leadership abilities and a strong commitment to public service. I continue to be impressed by the caliber of students in South Dakota and I am sure that he will make our state proud." 
  Fuhrman attends Aberdeen Christian High School where he serves as the Student Council Vice President and takes part in the Math Olympiad. He is also a member of the cross country, swimming, basketball and track teams. He plans to attend college and study economics.
  Once a year two students from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are selected to participate in the Senate Youth Program. Each student delegate is awarded a $5,000 college scholarship for their pursuit of undergraduate studies and is encouraged to continue coursework in government, history and public affairs. The program teaches students the American political process and gives them an understanding of the important decisions made in Congress.
  The Senate Youth Program begins March 1, 2008 and runs through March 8, 2008 in Washington, D.C.
