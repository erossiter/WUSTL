SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $50,153 IN FUNDING FOR ADAMS MUSEUM AND HOUSE
  U. S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Adams Museum and House in Deadwood will receive a $50,153 grant through the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Museums for America program for software upgrades and the creation of a database to manage their collection. 
  "These funds will allow for the preservation of materials at the Adams Museum and House that will give individuals of all ages the chance to see the history of South Dakota for generations to come," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The grant program seeks to strengthen a museum's ability to serve the public more effectively by supporting high-priority activities that advance the institution's mission and strategic goals. The funds can be used for a wide variety of projects, including research, planning, new programs and other activities. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
