$95,000 GRANT FOR SPEARFISH CANYON NATURE AREA CONSTRUCTION AND UPGRADES
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Spearfish Canyon Nature Area will receive $95,000 to develop and update the area. The funding will be used to construct support facilities and picnic areas that will include several picnic tables and facility upgrades for restrooms. Observation and access platforms, as well as signage to help interpret the natural surroundings will also be paid for with this funding.  
   The federal grant funding comes from a National Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) grant to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks. 
   In the past, Johnson has remarked that "parks are important to our communities, giving children and families a safe, clean place for recreation." 
   The LWCF gives grants to states to help them purchase land, water and wetlands to be preserved for both present and future generations. The grants match state expenditures and impact the local communities directly. Through the National Park Service, Congress provided a total of $30 million for nationwide grants to improve local recreational facilities and park lands. Senator Johnson serves as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the National Park Service.
