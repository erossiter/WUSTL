SEN. JOHNSON: VETO SLOWS ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SOUTH DAKOTA
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today commented on President George W. Bush's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007, a comprehensive water resources bill that included several provisions particularly beneficial to South Dakota: 
  "Today President Bush vetoed legislation that would have not only provided clean drinking water to the region, but would have helped swing open the doors of economic opportunity in South Dakota. The bill would have expanded the water system that serves the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation and surrounding areas, and authorized a collaborative program to improve the ecology of the Missouri River. 
  "Without this critical measure, drinking water infrastructure will continue to deteriorate and thousands of people will go without clean, reliable drinking water. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power and a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work with fellow committee members and my colleagues in the full Senate to override the President's veto at the first available opportunity."
