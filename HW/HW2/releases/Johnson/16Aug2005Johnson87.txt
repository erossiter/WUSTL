SEN. JOHNSON ENCOURAGES SOUTH DAKOTA STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson today encouraged South Dakota students to apply for the United States Senate Youth Program.  
 Two outstanding South Dakota high school students will be selected to join 102 other delegates from March 4-11, 2006 in Washington, D.C. 
   The program, which was started under Senate Resolution 324 and is funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, allows students to visit Capitol Hill, the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, the Supreme Court and other highlights in Washington. They will meet with Senators, cabinet officers, government leaders and policy-makers. In addition, delegates will receive a $5,000 undergraduate college scholarship. 
   "It is important that South Dakota's students be recognized for their outstanding leadership, service and academic standing," said Johnson. "This program is an amazing opportunity for South Dakota students. I encourage all eligible applicants to take advantage of this opportunity." 
   Students should rank in the top one percent of their states academically, in addition to boasting outstanding leadership abilities and a strong commitment to service. Each student must be a permanent resident of the United States and currently enrolled in a public or private secondary school located in the state. 
   Names of students selected will be formally announced mid-December. The selection deadline for South Dakota is October 1, 2005. Interested students in South Dakota should contact their high school principal or visit www.ussenateyouth.org.
