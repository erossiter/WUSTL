SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $196,413 TO LUTHERAN SOCIAL SERVICES CHILDREN PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lutheran Social Services of Aberdeen will receive $196,413 to expand the capacity of its children program at the New Beginnings Center.  
 Johnson used his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to insert this funding within the 2005 Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) appropriations measure. 
   "The New Beginnings Center provides a safe and comforting environment where abused and neglected children can begin to build new lives," said Johnson. "I applaud their efforts to help more children that are in need." 
   Lutheran Social Services will use the grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to expand the capacity of its facility to from 20 to 24 children. At New Beginnings residents are offered counseling and a safe place to overcome the trauma associated with abuse and substance addiction. 
   "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee," continued Johnson, "I am proud of the work I do to secure earmarks like this one for the Lutheran Social Services children program. I will continue to support programs and grants such as this one that meet the pressing needs of South Dakotans."
