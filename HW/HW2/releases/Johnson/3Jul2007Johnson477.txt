SEN, JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR BADLANDS HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Badlands Head Start in Butte County will receive a $185,000 low-interest federal loan and a $27,500 federal grant that will be used to purchase and remodel an office building to house the Head Start program. The loan is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. 
  "Studies have shown that for every dollar invested in Head Start education, society gets a return of more than $9 in other benefits." said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding for Badlands Head Start is a wonderful example of an investment that will provide a place for children to learn and reap amazing returns in Butte County."
  Head Start is a comprehensive program that provides early education, health and nutrition services to children before entering elementary school. The program also provides resources, training and support for parents to help their children enter school ready to learn. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
