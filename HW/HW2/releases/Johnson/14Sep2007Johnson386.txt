SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR SOUTH DAKOTA RURAL ENTERPRISE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota Rural Enterprise, Inc. will receive a $386,984 federal grant to serve low-income communities lacking adequate access to affordable financial products and services. The grant is provided by the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Program.  
  The grant will be used to expand the capacity of financial institutions to provide credit, capital, and financial services to underserved populations and communities. In addition, the funding will be used to capitalize a revolving loan fund to stimulate small business growth, and for technical assistance to organizations that assist small businesses.
  "I applaud the Community Development Financial Institutions Program for putting money back into the communities that need it most. These funds will boost South Dakota's economic growth and build strong local economies," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding for South Dakota Rural Enterprise, Inc. is a wonderful example of that kind of an investment."
  Created in 1996, the South Dakota Rural Enterprise, Inc. is as a non-profit enterprise that helps grow emerging institutions through grants and other resources. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
