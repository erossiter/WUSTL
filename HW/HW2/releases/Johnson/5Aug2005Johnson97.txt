SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $899,996 TO FIGHT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ON PINE RIDGE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will award an $899,996 grant to Cangleska, Inc. to combat domestic violence on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  
   "Domestic violence tears families apart, and we must work prevent it," said Johnson. "Women and children affected by these crimes need to feel safe in their homes and communities. I applaud the continuing efforts to stop domestic violence." 
   Cangleska, Inc. will use the funding from the Rural Domestic Violence Enforcement Grant Program to continue and expand support services for victims, assist in improving the criminal justice system, and continue to develop education and prevention programs. 
   This program implements certain provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which is set to expire on September 30, 2005. Senator Johnson recently cosponsored legislation that will reauthorize VAWA and increase funding for the Act. 
   "With the reauthorization of VAWA, we can continue the strides that have already been taken to help combat domestic violence in Indian country," said Johnson.
