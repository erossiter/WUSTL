LIVING WILL AWARENESS GAINS MOMENTUM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined a bipartisan effort to make families and individuals aware of using "living wills" as a means of being certain that their wishes on end-of-life medical treatment will be clear to their physicians and loved ones.  
   "Terry Schiavo's sad and tragic case should, among other things, remind us all of the important voluntary option of having a simple living will to give direction and clarity to a person's wishes concerning end-of-life medical procedures," Johnson said. "Not all people may want to have a living will, but for many, there can be great comfort in knowing that direction can be given in advance which will reduce the likelihood of their family having to make extraordinarily difficult and emotionally draining decisions. They may also reduce the possibility of costly and extremely divisive court cases."
   "The goal of these bills is to increase access to information about living wills so that families can make their own very-personal decisions about these matters," Johnson said. 
   Johnson will join Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), who has led the effort on two separate bills dealing with living wills:
   The first bill, S.347, is also cosponsored by Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and provides all Medicare beneficiaries the option of visiting with a doctor to discuss end-of-life issues. In addition, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promote public awareness about the need for end-of-life planning and the role living wills can play.
   The second bill, S.570, creates a federal clearinghouse for state-specific information on living wills, so that people can easily find out how their state's laws impact them. The bill also creates a simply worded living will that people may choose to spell out their end of life medical treatment wishes.
