SEN. JOHNSON PUSHES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES MISSION AT ELLSWORTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (S-SD) expressed support again today for a financial services mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base. Johnson has been in frequent contact with the Air Force on this topic, and his staff will be meeting with Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne tomorrow. 
   "I will be pushing hard for this mission right up until the decision is made. Ellsworth is a world-class military installation due in large part to the upgraded facilities at the base. I have used my position on the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee to help direct money to improve the base. I will work with the Air Force to see if there are any further enhancements that would be needed to make this mission fit at Ellsworth," Johnson said. "This is a mission that can easily transition into the Ellsworth environment and we'd be proud have them join us in the Hills."
   In January, Johnson sent Wynne a letter offering support before the final decision is made this spring. This mission will consist of approximately 775 employees, both military and civilian personnel, who will perform customer service duties on behalf of our nation's military.
   In late September 2005, Air Force officials conducted a site survey of Ellsworth Air Force Base to see if it is capable of operating a central processing center (CPC) and a contact center to deliver financial management services to military personnel. The financial mission will consist of approximately 775 employees who will perform customer service duties. 
   Last year, after initially being targeted for closure by the Bush Administration, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recognized that Ellsworth Air Force Base is a premier military installation and voted to remove it from the base closure list.
