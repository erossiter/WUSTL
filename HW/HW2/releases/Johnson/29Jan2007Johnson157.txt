SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE: NEWS ON TAX EXTENDERS DEDUCTIONS
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office today announced that the currently printed IRS tax forms may not have lines for some important deductions for South Dakotans until a new printing is available on February 3rd.  
   While Congress acted to extend several deductions for the 2006 tax filing season, the tax forms currently available do not include lines for the deductions, as they were printed prior to that Congressional action. State sales and other tax deductions like those that would allow teachers to deduct classroom supplies, parents to deduct college tuition, and businesses to deduct research and development are available for the 2006 filing season. It is important for South Dakotans to know that these deductions exist, and that they should be sure to include those deductions when they file their taxes. Tax forms that include lines for certain deductions will be available in early February, according to the IRS. 
   This printing omission should not affect those who file electronically. 
   Johnson wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) in early December requesting that the Senate extend the package of middle class tax deductions in time for the 2006 tax filing season. In the letter, Johnson described these tax extenders as "targeted tax cuts that help working families - not just multi-millionaires." Johnson warned that action needed to be taken on the tax extenders as soon as possible because of their valuable impact on teachers, parents with college age students, and states like South Dakota, that do not have a state income tax. 
   The due date for individuals filing their 2006 taxes is April 16, 2007, because April 15th falls on a Sunday.
