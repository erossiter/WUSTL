SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR SOUTH CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson announced today that the Tripp County Water Users District will receive a $250,000 low-interest loan to finance the improvement of its storage reservoirs and wells.  
   "I am pleased that the users of the Tripp County Water District will receive this important infrastructure funding," Johnson said. "Developing and maintaining a solid infrastructure is important for communities, especially in our rural areas. I will continue to work with federal agencies and community leaders in South Dakota to ensure that our small towns are able to meet the needs of their residents." 
   This funding will be provided by the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, operated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Agency. The program provides affordable financial assistance for improving water and waste disposal systems in rural communities.
