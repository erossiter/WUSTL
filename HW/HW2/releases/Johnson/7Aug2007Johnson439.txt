SEN. JOHNSON: I'M HEADING HOME
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) and his wife Barbara announced today that they plan to return home to South Dakota at the end of August. Plans are currently underway and details will be forthcoming. 
  "The doctors have given me a 'thumbs up', and Barb and I are incredibly excited to head home. We have missed our friends and family and cannot wait to meet our two new grandchildren," Johnson said. 
  "I know my return has taken longer than some people have liked - count me among them. But I learned early on in this journey the importance and necessity of relying on the advice and counsel of those doctors, nurses and therapists without whom, my return would have been impossible. I am eternally grateful to each and every one of them. And frankly, I am very humbled and even a bit overwhelmed that the outpouring from South Dakotans has been one of support, prayer, understanding and patience. While I have always believed there is a special uniqueness in South Dakotans, my faith in the goodness of the people of our state has never been higher," continued Johnson. 
  "We were scheduled to head home last December to celebrate Christmas and Tim's 60th birthday. The celebration may be a little late, but planting our feet on South Dakota soil will be our Christmas morning. Our family and Tim's staff have been busy working to make sure things are in place when he returns. This is not the end of our journey to recovery, but it is a significant milestone." said Barbara Johnson, wife of Senator Johnson.
  The Johnsons announced earlier this week that their youngest son, Brendan, and his wife, Jana, adopted two children from Ethiopia. Trualem, age 10, and Peneal, age 8, join their sons Sutton and Cooper as the newest members of the Johnson family.
