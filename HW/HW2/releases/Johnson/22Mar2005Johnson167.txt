SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $132,000 FOR ABERDEEN BIKE PATH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced the release of $132,000 in funding for the pedestrian and bicycle trail in Aberdeen.  
 The funding was included, at Johnson's request, in the Transportation Appropriations bill, which passed during the last Congress.
   "The Aberdeen bike path is an exciting project that will benefit the community," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This funding will help Aberdeen to convert an abandoned railroad corridor to a path for bikers, walkers, and joggers."
   The funding assists the project to replace the abandoned railroad corridor with a path for recreation and alternative transportation.
   The $132,267 released today is a portion of the $200,000 included in the final Transportation Appropriations bill, signed into law last December. The remaining funding from that bill will be released in the coming months.
   This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Discretionary Grant program.
