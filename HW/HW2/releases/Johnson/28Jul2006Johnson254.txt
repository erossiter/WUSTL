SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FEMA ASSISTANCE FOR FIGHTING EAST RIDGE FIRE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved an emergency Fire Management Assistance Grant request for South Dakota. The grant will provide reimbursement for 75 percent of eligible costs associated with fighting the fire. Johnson's office remains in contact with state and federal officials monitoring the fire. 
   "I have pushed for additional homeland security funding for first responder grant programs just like the one funding this assistance," said Johnson. "States like South Dakota use these programs to keep their fire departments up and running. It is urgent that we receive this funding so that we can contain the fire. I am glad to help in any way I can to make sure that the safety of South Dakotans is not threatened."
   The fire was started by a lightning strike on the 26th of July and is located in Meade County, northwest of Rapid City and south of Piedmont. So far, one house and several other structures have been damaged, and other businesses and several other homes are in jeopardy.
