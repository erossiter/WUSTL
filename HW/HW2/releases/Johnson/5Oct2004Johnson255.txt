SENATORS ANNOUNCE $49,705 IN FUNDING FOR CANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT
  Sens. Tom Daschle and Tim Johnson announced today that $49,705 is on the way for the Canton School District.  
 The Senators secured the funding through the fiscal year 2004 appropriations process. The money will support continued operations of the district's Community Education Program.
   The Canton Community Education Program provides before- and after-school care for children, which is important in a school district where many parents commute 20 miles or more to the Sioux Falls area. The Community Education Program also offers adult education classes, literacy workshops, and GED tutoring.
   "Many working parents in Canton rely on extended day programs to make sure their children are safe and supervised," Senator Daschle said. "I'm glad that we were able to secure this funding for the school district's childcare and adult education programs."
   "I applaud the Canton School district for providing these services to the community," said Johnson. "It is important to support programs that keep our children safe and assures parents that their children will be taken care of while they are returning home from work. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues in providing more funding for such educational programs."
