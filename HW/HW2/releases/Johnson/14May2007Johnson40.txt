SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $33,250 IN FUNDING FOR FLANDREAU AIRPORT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Flandreau Municipal Airport will receive $33,250 in funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for airport enhancements.  
   "This funding will improve transportation conditions at the Flandreau Municipal Airport," Johnson said. "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I support ongoing efforts to improve travel conditions in and around South Dakota to help provide our communities with continued economic development opportunities. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   The grant will fund the expansion of the apron, to meet the needs of increased general aviation activity and assist the airport in meeting FAA regulations. 
   The President's proposed Fiscal Year 2008 Budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program by 23 percent, or $627 million, to $2.73 billion, as compared to the Fiscal Year 2007 budget level of $3.35 billion. As a member of both the Senate Budget and Senate Appropriation Committees, Senator Johnson has worked to restore the proposed cuts to this important economic development and safety program.
