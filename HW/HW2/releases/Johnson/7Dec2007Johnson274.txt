SENS. JOHNSON, BAUCUS PLACE FRIENDLY WAGER ON CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
  Bringing a bit of football to Capitol Hill, Senators Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Max Baucus (D-MT) have placed a friendly wager on the NAIA Championship game set for next Saturday, December 15th in Savannah, Tennessee. Johnson is betting that the University of Sioux Falls will be victorious against Carroll College and has put a South Dakota buffalo steak dinner against Baucus' Montana steak dinner.  
   "I have been craving a good steak dinner, and while it doesn't compare to South Dakota buffalo steak, I look forward to enjoying Montana's finest," said Johnson. "I am confident that the Cougars will make our state proud and again take the NAIA Championship title." 
   "Carroll College is the best football team in the NAIA and I have no doubt I will soon be celebrating another victory and enjoying a nice dinner of buffalo steak, at Senator Johnson's expense," Baucus said. 
  The University of Sioux Falls won the NAIA Championship in 2006 and is currently on a 27 game winning streak. Sioux Falls residents can listen to the game live on KWSN AM 1230 and online at www.usfcougars.com.
