SEN. JOHNSON FIGHTS TO MAINTAIN OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE LAW ENFORCEMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) recently contacted the U.S. Department of Justice in support of additional emergency funding for the law enforcement needs of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST). OST law enforcement, which receives monies from a variety of sources, is largely funded through the Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) within the DOJ's office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). 
   A TRGP grant requires a 25% match from the tribe, which OST is unable to fund. The tribe is currently working to have the match requirement waived and Senator Johnson, along with Rep. Herseth, recently sent a letter to COPS Director Carl Peed supporting the tribe. Obtaining a waiver of the match requirement would allow the tribe to maintain law enforcement levels while a long term solution is sought to combat the lack of funding available to tribal law enforcement.
   As the tribe works to obtain the match waiver, the tribal judiciary committee recently passed a resolution to use a federal appropriation, that Johnson helped secure in the fiscal year 2006 budget, for law enforcement needs.
   "Reservation communities have unique law enforcement needs, but face chronic under-funding," Johnson said. "The violent crime rate in Indian country is 50% higher than the national average. Yet, Indian country has far fewer police officers per capita then the national average."
   OST's COPS grant expires at the end of March and the COPS program has suffered continual funding cuts under this administration. This year, the program as a whole was cut to $31.1 million down from $46.5 in FY 2006, a 33% overall funding cut.
