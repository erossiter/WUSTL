SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT RESPONSE TO PRESDENTIAL DISTASTER DECLARATION FOLLOWING FLOODING IN EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in response to the Presdential Distaster Declaration following the flooding in eastern South Dakota:  
   I am pleased that President Bush responded favorably to repeated contacts from my office and other federal and state leaders regarding our disaster declaration. It's a relief to see that some forms of federal aid will now start flowing to South Dakota. But we must also keep pressing the White House for quick action on our request for public infrastructure assistance, which has not yet been answered. I have directed my staff to keep up a full court press on this issue. 
   Yesterday the President announced the official disaster declaration, which makes federal funding available to those affected Beadle, Brown, Clark, Davison, Hanson, Hutchinson, Miner, Sanborn, Spink, and Yankton Counties. 
   Johnson directed his staff to remain in contact with FEMA in the wake of the flooding. On May 8th, Johnson wrote a letter urging Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to release emergency funds to flood victims from the USDA's Rural Development programs, including the 504 housing program which would provide a critical source of grants and loans to many homeowners facing water damage.
