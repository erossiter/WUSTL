JERAULD COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) has selected Jerauld County as his July 2005 "County of the Month."  
 The county is highlighted on a special section of this website. 
   "Located on the prairies of South Dakota, Jerauld County is full of unique cultural experiences," Johnson said. "From the Mid-Dakota Rural Water Project to funding for law enforcement technology upgrades, I have always worked hard to help ensure the best standard of living possible for the citizens of Jerauld County." 
   Although Jerauld County was not officially settled until 1883, the Wessington hills were an area where trappers and Native Americans gathered to trade for many years prior to the settlement of the area. Today, visitors may visit one of the eight historic sites in Wessington Springs, hunt on the county's more than 3,000 acres of public hunting land, or attend the annual rodeo in Wessington Springs. 
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are great places to live. From beautiful scenery to thriving communities, Jerauld County has a lot to be proud of."
