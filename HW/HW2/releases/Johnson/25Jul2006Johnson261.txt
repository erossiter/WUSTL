SENATE TO PASS CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement on the Child Custody Protection Act, S.403, which is expected to pass the Senate this evening: 
   I intend to vote in favor of the Child Custody Protection Act, S. 403. Parents currently have a right to oversee virtually all medical procedures performed on their children. This legislation does not impose any requirements on states, but rather it strengthens the ability of states to enforce existing parental notification laws. The legislation does allow for a judicial bypass as permitted under South Dakota law in cases where the parents are either absent or clearly not acting in the best interests of the child, such as in cases of incest or abuse. 
   I voted for the Lautenberg amendment which creates a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Grant program to teach comprehensive sex education, increase funding for after-school programs, and provide academic enrichment for at-risk teens. 
   South Dakota law requires parental notification, and this federal legislation will assist in enforcing that state law.
