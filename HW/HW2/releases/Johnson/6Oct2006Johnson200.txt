SEN. JOHNSON LAUDS INAUGURATION OF NEW AUGUSTANA PRESIDENT
  Today Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) attended the inauguration for Augustana College's 23rd President, Robert Oliver today. Johnson had the following message regarding today's ceremony and Oliver: 
   I want to congratulate Rob Oliver on his inauguration as the 23rd President of Augustana College. His enthusiasm and commitment will make him an excellent leader of Augustana College. 
   Rob is no stranger to the Sioux Falls community, and his career experiences bring a unique perspective as he takes the helm of Augustana College. After many years in the banking industry, Rob joined Augie to teach at the Department of Business before being selected as the new President. 
   Because of his commitment to learning, Rob even found time to teach college courses when he was working in the financial services industry. Rob also found time to devote to many community boards and volunteer programs. 
   Augustana College has been an extraordinary higher education leader for the entire state, and the institution is fortunate to have someone of Rob's caliber leading the school. I wish President Oliver, the faculty, staff, and students at Augustana all the best the years to come.
