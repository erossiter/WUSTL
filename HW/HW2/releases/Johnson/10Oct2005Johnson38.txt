SEN. JOHNSON PRESENTS AWARD TO 2005 'ANGELS IN ADOPTION' FAMILY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today presented an award certificate to his 2005 "Angels in Adoption" parents, Jim and Sue Russo of Sioux Falls.  
 Johnson is a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption and chose this family from among six nominees in South Dakota. 
   "Jim and Sue Russo have provided a loving home for a number of children as a mentor family, and as adoptive and foster parents. They have been selfless in dedicating so much of their lives to helping the innocent children who have needed them," said Johnson. "Their values and their commitment to keeping families together whenever possible sets an amazing example." 
   Jim and Sue Russo have two grown daughters and began taking in foster children in 1993. After two years acting as foster parents to Brandon and as a mentor family for his mother, it became clear that Brandon would need to be adopted. Jim and Sue decided to continue caring for Brandon not as mentors but as his parents and adopted him in 1998. 
   The "Angels in Adoption" program was established in 1999 by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute to raise awareness about the importance of adoption. Since the program's beginning, 22 South Dakota families have been recognized for their commitment to children. 
   "I have been promoting adoption throughout my service in Congress. The 'Angels in Adoption' program is a great way to acknowledge people for doing something so noble, by adopting children and raising them in loving homes," continued Johnson. 
   Johnson recently cosponsored the Adoption Tax Relief Guarantee Act that would help make adoptions more affordable by making the current $10,000 tax credit for adoption expenses permanent.
