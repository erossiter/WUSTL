DEFENSE FUNDING ANNOUNCED; $12.335 MILLION FOR SOUTH DAKOTA SPECIFIC PROJECTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels in the Defense spending bill for 2007. The legislation was approved by the Defense Subcommittee and will be passed by the full Appropriations Committee, of which Johnson is a member, on Thursday. There is over $12.335 million in the bill for South Dakota projects.
   "I was very pleased the 2007 defense spending bill passed Senate Appropriations Committee today. I worked with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure funding for programs important to South Dakota," said Johnson. It is my hope that the Senate will work quickly to pass this important legislation."
   * Total Funding for SD specific projects: $12,335,000 
   * South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Projects ($3,335,000)
   * Future Affordable Multi-Utility Materials for the Army Future Combat Systems - $2,000,000
   South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will establish and staff a nationally competitive polymer and composites processing and prototyping laboratory in South Dakota, now known as the Polymer and Composites Engineering (PACE) Laboratory. Emphasis will be on advanced sensing and reinforcement fabric development, advanced processing strategies, advanced prototyping strategies and nano-reinforced polymer processing.
   * Transparent Nanocomposite Armor - $250,000
   South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) are working together to develop new transparent armor for the Army's Future Combat Systems. This is a critical requirement for Army vehicles as evidenced by recent assaults on US troops in Iraq. 
   * Shielding Rocket Payloads - $285,000
   This project will reduce the sound pressure levels within space vehicles to avoid damage to delicate payloads during launch. Applications of this work will be as ubiquitous, but the special niche area addressed here is the challenging problem of low-frequency noise insulation. 
   -Control System for Laser Powder Deposition - $300,000
   South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and RPM & Associates are partnering to combine their proven resources and knowledge to develop a control system for laser powder deposition (LPD), which is a relatively new technology currently being qualified for use in the manufacturing industry. 
   * Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Simulation in Different Soils - $500,000
   South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and RESPEC are partnering to develop a numerical modeling strategy that can serve as a starting point for the simulation of shallow buried explosive (SBE) blasts in loose, fully saturated, coarse-grained soils. This method of attack is becoming more prevalent in areas of conflict around the world, and it is important to be able to predict with reasonable accuracy the time history of the impulsive loads that will act on them as a consequence of the explosion. 
   Other South Dakota Specific Projects ($9,000,000)
   -Advanced Electronics Rosebud Integration Center (AERIC) - $5,000,000
   The Rosebud Sioux Tribe and Radiance Technologies, Inc., with program coordination and oversight by the U.S. Army's Space and Missile Defense Technical Center's (SMDTC) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) office, are working to research, develop, test, and demonstrate advanced electronics integration and fabrication technology on the Rosebud Sioux Tribe reservation in South Dakota. The primary focus of this research and development effort will be to establish a Native American advanced electronics technology center of excellence that will advance the state-of-the-art space and missile defense system electronics. 
   * Fatigue Odometer for Vehicle Components and Gun Barrels Project - $3,000,000
   The Batcheller Consulting Group is working with the U.S. Army Benet Laboratories (ABL) to develop innovative on-board sensor systems, and associated electronics and software, to provide more accurate and timely information on the wear-and-tear to military vehicle and weapon systems. Such high-tech solutions would reduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and improve the safety of vehicle and weapon systems. This is a continuation of previous funding and involves 
   * Transition Laser Engineered Shaping (LENS) Technology - $1,000,000
   RPM & Associates in Rapid City is using their 22 years of welding and repair expertise to employ LENS technology into Department of Defense and aerospace applications. This will reduce costs for sustainment of weapons systems, improve readiness, and increase design flexibility through creative freeform additive fabrication strategies.
   * B-1B Fleet ($65,200,000)
   AN/APQ-164 Radar Upgrade Program for the B-1B - $65,200,000
   The B-1 aircraft provides a unique long range strike capability with a large and varied payload. The B-1's Offensive Radar System (AN/APQ-164) was designed in the 1980's to provide target detection, location, tracking and accurate weapon delivery capability. However, in recent years radar system reliability has degraded, and as a result, the B-1 Radar Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program (RMIP) was established to improve reliability. This funding will continue implementation of this program.
   National Guard ($34,900,000): The following projects will benefit the National Guard, including units from SD:
   * M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm for the Army National Guard - $12,000,000
   The Army National Guard has a stated need for more than 18,000 chemical point detectors to adequately protect its troops. As our Army National Guard units play an increasing role in our national security planning, it is essential we equip them with the best available equipment. This funding will provide additional M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarms (ACADA) for the Army National Guard. 
   * Improved Chemical Agent Monitor for the Army National Guard - $10,000,000
   Improved Chemical Agent Monitors (ICAM) can quickly locate the presence or absence of nerve and blister agent contamination on personnel and equipment in both combat and homeland defense missions. The ICAM is an improvement over the currently fielded CAM since its modular design is less expensive to repair, requires less maintenance, and eliminates depot level repair. This funding will provide additional ICAMs for the Army National Guard. 
   * Targeting Pods for Air National Guard F-16 Aircraft - $10,000,000
   The Air National Guard F-16 Block 25/30/32/42 aircraft require precision attack capability in order to fulfill their warfighting requirements. This includes advanced targeting pods to allow for improved battlefield management and standoff capability. The addition of this funding will allow the Air National Guard to increase its acquisition of advanced targeting pods and provide pilots with the ability to employ precision-guided munitions.
   * F-16 Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) - $2,900,000
   The Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) significantly improves the situational awareness of F-16 pilots and provides them with the first shot advantage in a visual range fight. In addition, the HMCS helps pilots better manage the information-centric battlefield they confront today.
