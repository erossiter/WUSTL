SEN. JOHNSON PUSHES MEASURE TO CURB METH IN INDIAN COUNTRY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) is supporting a bill that would allow tribes to gain federal funding to fight meth. The Native American Methamphetamine Treatment and Enforcement Act of 2006 would make tribes eligible for funding through the "Hot Spots" program. 
   "Meth is one of the most dangerous problems facing rural America today and Indian Country is especially vulnerable. We must do everything we can to stop the toll it is taking on South Dakota's communities," said Johnson. "Funding that is already given to the rest of America should also be available to tribes that are facing a severe meth crisis."
   The "Meth Hot Spots" program is designed to train state and local law enforcement to investigate and lock-up methamphetamine offenders. Funding for the "Hot Spots" program is authorized by the Combat Meth Act.
   The Combat Meth Act of 2005, which Johnson cosponsored, contained provisions that would limit access to large quantities of cold medicines that contain pseudophedrine, a major component of methamphetamines.
   "The reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in March included anti-meth legislation based on the Combat Meth Act of 2005, which I cosponsored," Johnson said. "The funding for the Hot Spots program would ensure that law enforcement has the tools necessary to fight this drug epidemic. It is vital that Indian Country has access to these funds."
