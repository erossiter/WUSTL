SEN. JOHNSON RESPONDS TO EXCLUSION OF SOUTH DAKOTA FROM DROUGHT ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement in response to reports that South Dakota has been excluded from a drought assistance program, providing surplus nonfat dry milk for livestock feed in drought-stricken counties in nine states: 
   "I am appalled that once again the Administration refuses of any type of meaningful drought assistance for South Dakota producers. USDA has been, at the very least, evasive about working with us to achieve drought relief. Stopgap water hauling measures are insufficient, and our producers can't even benefit from this non-fat dry milk initiative.  
   "The fact that nine states are eligible and South Dakota is not among them, frankly, smells of politics. If this is Secretary Veneman's way of declining our invitation to visit South Dakota, I'd have preferred a simple, 'no thanks.'"
