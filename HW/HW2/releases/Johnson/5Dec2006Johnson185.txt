SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON AG DISASTER AMENDMENT
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Senate voted on a procedural motion in relation to an Agriculture Disaster Assistance package he co-sponsored with Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND). The package was considered as an amendment to the coming year's Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill. After the amendment failed on a procedural vote, the Agriculture Appropriations bill was pulled from the floor by Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and the Senate moved to other business, in effect, killing aid for this year.  
 "Though the Senate has been working for months for this funding, the need for real ag disaster relief in the heartland has only grown," Johnson said. "It took a great deal of hard work for the amendment to even be considered, but I am extremely disappointed that continual opposition has stopped Congress completing work on disaster relief this year."
 There has been continual opposition to ag disaster assistance by the President, who has repeatedly issued veto threats to this kind of aid. The amendment considered today is similar to a stand alone aid package Johnson co-sponsored last summer. It included nearly $4.5 billion in aid for producers for 2005 and 2006 drought damage.
