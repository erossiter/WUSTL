SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $200,000 IN FUNDING TO SINTE GLESKA UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Sinte Gleska University Tribal College will receive $200,000 in funding for a construction project to build a new student services center. 
   "Improving our education facilities and campuses improves the educational experience for our students," said Johnson. "The new facility will provide a valuable new center to students and help the university function more smoothly overall."
   The funding will help the university build a student services center, which will house the Registrar, Financial Aid and Financial Offices. The construction will locate the offices on the new Antelope Lake Campus to provide ready access for students. Currently, these offices are located in Rosebud, South Dakota, 15 miles from the campus. 
   The grant was awarded under the American Indian Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Program. The program assists institutions of higher education to become self-sufficient by providing funds to strengthen their academic quality, management and fiscal stability.
