SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ELKTON LOCKER, INC. TO RECEIVE $130,000 IN FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Elkton Locker, Inc. in Brookings will receive a federal grant of $65,000 and a low-interest federal loan of $65,000 to assist farmers in developing renewable energy systems. Funding will be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development.  
  "We must do all we can to encourage alternative sources of energy in our state. This funding for Elkton Locker, Inc. will help farmers and agricultural producers make the changes that can contribute to decreasing our use of fossil fuels," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment to help farmers."
  The funding will be used to install a geothermal heating and cooling system that will save up to 45 percent of the energy used by a conventional heating system.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
