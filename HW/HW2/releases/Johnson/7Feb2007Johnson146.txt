$20,000 GRANT FOR BURYANEK RECREATION AREA CONSTRUCTION, UPGRADES
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Buryanek Recreation Area, near Platte, will receive $20,000 to develop and update the camping area with a new, rentable cabin and RV accomodations. The cabin will be a one-room, log-style camper cabin complete with electricity, heating, and air conditioning and will be available for rental year round. The funding for the construction comes from a National Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) grant to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks.  
   In the past, Johnson has remarked that "parks are important to our communities, giving children and families a safe, clean place for recreation." 
   The LWCF gives grants to states to help them purchase land, water and wetlands to be preserved for both present and future generations. The grants match state expenditures and impact the local communities directly. Through the National Park Service, Congress provided a total of $30 million for nationwide grants to improve local recreational facilities and park lands. Senator Johnson serves as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the National Park Service.
