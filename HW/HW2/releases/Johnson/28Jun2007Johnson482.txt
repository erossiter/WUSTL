SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION VOTE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the immigration bill, S.1639, which the Senate blocked from moving forward today: 
  I have been actively following the immigration reform legislation pending in the Senate and am disappointed progress on the bill has been blocked. Failure to move forward with immigration reform will leave an estimated 13 million illegal immigrants in the shadows, and do nothing to strengthen our border or stem the tide of illegal immigration.
  There will never be a perfect bill to address this problem, but by rejecting efforts to improve this bill and closing the door on reform our nation still faces a broken immigration system.
