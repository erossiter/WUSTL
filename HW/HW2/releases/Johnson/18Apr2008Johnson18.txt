SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $84,633 FOR AVERA HEALTH INSTITUTE, REGIONAL TELEMEDICINE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Avera Health of Sioux Falls will receive a $84,633 federal grant to advance telemedicine. This grant is funded by the Department of Health and Human Services as a part of the Telehealth Grant Program. 
   "Living in a rural area should not mean sacrificing access to the best doctors available. Telemedicine is one way to make sure rural health care is not second class health care," Johnson said. "My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   The funding will support Avera's eEmergency initiative, a new program that is meant to support emergency care provided to South Dakotans by allowing instant collaboration between rural health care professionals and emergency physicians in rural facilities. This collaboration will support quality care, aid in the recruitment and retention of rural health care professionals and enhance emergency transport preparedness, and ultimately improve health care for South Dakotans in rural communities.
   The grants made will enable Avera Health to treat patients in nine rural South Dakota communities linking urban physicians and rural physicians and patients more easily over long distances.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
