SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF DETERMINATION ACT
  U.S. Senator Johnson announced that the reauthorization to the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA) was introduced in the Senate today. Johnson is an original co-sponsor of the bill. 
  "This bill will help ensure that more and more families can have a place to call home and tribes can offer positive housing solutions to the unmet housing needs in Indian Country," Johnson said. "I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to pass this bill in the full Senate, because we can not and should not ignore the deplorable housing situation on our reservations."
  The legislation would reauthorize the 1996 passed NAHASDA, renewing popular grant and loan funding programs like the Indian Housing Block Grant program, which provide opportunities for tribes to expand affordable housing opportunities in Indian Country. Johnson was an original co-sponsor of the 1996 version of NAHASDA as a member of the House of Representatives.
  Johnson has long supported housing programs like NAHASDA as a co-sponsor and advocate for filling the unmet housing needs in Indian Country. In the past year, he has worked to get emergency temporary FEMA housing to tribes as an effort to relieve the housing crisis tribes face.
  According to the 2003 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report, "A Quiet Crisis: Federal Funding and Unmet Needs in Indian Country," approximately 90,000 Native American families are homeless or under-housed.
