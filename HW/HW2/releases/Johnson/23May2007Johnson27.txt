SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $99,723 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE GRANT FOR FLANDREAU SANTEE SIOUX TRIBE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe will receive a $99,723 grant through the Indian Health Service's Tribal Health Clinic Electronic Health Record Implementation program. The grant is funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Planning Grants for Tribal Management of Health Services Program.  
   "I'm pleased that the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe will be able to use this funding to further improve their standard of living," said Johnson. "This funding creates an opportunity to make health records more accessible so that clinical and public health data can be more easily compiled and studied, creating a foundation for doctors to better understand the health conditions and statistics of members of the tribe." 
   According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Indian Health Service Electronic Health Record is a software package designed to improve quality of care and patient safety. It provides a "front end" to the robust Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) database, which permits improved access to important clinical information, direct entry of data by clinicians and other users, and clinical decision support tools at the point of care.
