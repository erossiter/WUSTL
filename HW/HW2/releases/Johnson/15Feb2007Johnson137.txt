SEN. JOHNSON COSPONSORS DROUGHT ASSISTANCE BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has cosponsored his first piece of legislation of the 110th Congress after undergoing surgery for a brain hemorrhage in December. While Johnson's focus remains his daily therapy sessions, he has read through memos from his staff and will cosponsor the Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2007.  
   As in past versions, this bill includes comprehensive crop disaster assistance, livestock provisions for cattle, swine, sheep, and bison, conservation dollars, and economic assistance measures. Johnson has been updated and agrees with the modified version of the bill introduced last month, which ensures blizzards occurring this past December and spread into 2007 are covered. Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), the lead sponsor of the legislation, estimates the cost should be less than $4.5 billion. 
   Johnson has begun reviewing additional documents, and also wanted to thank South Dakotans for their support and prayers. 
   "This is a first step for the Senator. He spends much of his day in therapy sessions, but as time allows, he has begun reviewing work. True to form, Tim is a hard worker and is already requesting more from the staff. The process will be slow, but we are excited about crossing this hurdle," said Drey Samuelson, Chief of Staff to Senator Tim Johnson. 
   A similar bill was considered last year, but fell short of final passage. Johnson was a vocal advocate of the bill last year and had spoken with countless producers across South Dakota about the effects of the drought over the past several years. 
   Previously, Johnson said, "it's my hope that we can set aside the partisan politics and appreciate that the losses being sustained are losses that are happening to American farmers and ranchers and American main streets. It needs an American response."
