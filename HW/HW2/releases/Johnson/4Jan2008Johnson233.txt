SEN. JOHNSON THANKS HOMETOWN FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today attended a "Welcome Home" event in Vermillion and marked his first trip back to his hometown since his return to the Senate in September. Johnson thanked community members for their continued support and patience throughout the past year.  
  "It was great to be home and see so many dear friends in one place," Johnson said. "This past year has been a long journey for me, and it was so humbling to receive such strong support from all corners of the state, especially from my hometown of Vermillion. I am grateful to have this second chance to serve our communities and give back to the state I call home."
  Mayor Dan Christopherson and members of the Vermillion community joined Johnson and his wife, Barbara, at the event. 
  Later this afternoon, Johnson will take a Windshield Tour of neighboring Yankton to see local economic development projects firsthand. He is spending the Congressional district work period traveling throughout South Dakota, and will hold events in Sioux Falls, Yankton, Watertown and Brookings before returning to Washington, DC later this month.
