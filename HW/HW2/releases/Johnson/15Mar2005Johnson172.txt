SEN. JOHNSON MOVES TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY DURING BUDGET DEBATE
  Today, during the budget debate on the Senate floor, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) voted to protect the future of the Social Security system.  
   Joining Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), Johnson voted to reject any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a massive increase in debt. In voting for a second amendment, Johnson aimed to ensure that the Social Security program is made solvent for 75 years before moving forward with new tax cuts or additional mandatory spending in the budget. 
   "It's true that we cannot bury our head in the sand when it comes to Social Security. The program will need attention, but it needs to be protected - not dismantled. We must protect the bedrock guarantee for all beneficiaries. Private accounts will do nothing to address the solvency of Social Security while adding up to $5 trillion in additional debt," Johnson said. 
   Johnson also announced details on a series of Social Security meetings from March 29th- April 1st to discuss the future of the program. Johnson will hold meetings in Aberdeen, Mitchell, Rapid City, Sioux Falls, Watertown, and Yankton. 
   "Nearly one out of every five South Dakotans receives Social Security benefits. This is more than just a statistic. I am committed to improving the long-term outlook of the Social Security system. I want to hear from people across this state on what they value most in Social Security and provide them with information on the risks associated with privatization," said Johnson.
   Johnson is encouraging South Dakotans to join him for this important discussion by attending one of the following:
