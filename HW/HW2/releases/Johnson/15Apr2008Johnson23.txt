SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL LITERACY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota will receive a $12,000 grant from Chase Card Services, the credit card division of JPMorgan Chase and Company. This funding will be used to support financial literacy programs in South Dakota. 
  "I am proud to see companies like JP Morgan taking action to help improve financial literacy around the state," said Johnson. "I have strongly supported financial literacy and I will continue to fight for funding for programs to help South Dakotans take control of their finances. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help South Dakotans."
  Chase initiated the financial literacy program to help community-based organizations provide resources to families to help improve their financial situations. This funding will be applied to the College Credit Program, which teaches young adults about goal setting, budgeting, and wise spending. 
  The grants from this nationwide program will be sent to more than 30 organizations, including credit counseling agencies and consumer financial research groups.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
