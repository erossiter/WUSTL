SEN. JOHNSON: BRING QUALITY HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM WITH PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) opposed legislation being debated on the Senate floor today that would do more to line the pockets of health insurance executives than bring quality health care to the millions of Americans in need. S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act (HIMMA), would likely bring fewer consumer protections, a loss of coverage for medical treatments and higher premiums.
   "South Dakota's own Attorney General Larry Long opposes this bill. Access to affordable health insurance is in critical need in places like South Dakota, but we shouldn't be giving away the farm to the big insurance companies. We need to make sure there are certain protections in place so that the coverage is actually worthwhile," Johnson said. "Finding a way to provide quality health insurance back home protects our pocketbooks and the continued economic development of South Dakota. I will continue to fight for quality health care." 
   S. 1955 would allow participating plans to be exempt from most state laws that regulate the health insurance market. The bill goes even further, permitting this exemption for insurers in the individual, small group, and large group markets. This means that such plans could operate without regard to most state laws. The bill would reduce the affordability of coverage and would disproportionately affect small businesses with an older, sicker workforce.
   "This bill allows insurance companies to come into our state and offer coverage that excludes basic benefits that have been mandated by the South Dakota legislature. The bill benefits the insurance industry rather than protecting consumers by allowing plans to cherry pick healthy employer groups," Johnson continued.
   According to Families USA, more than 260,000 South Dakotans will lose important consumer protections that now apply to their health insurance if S. 1955 becomes law. Not only does the bill wipe out these existing laws, but it also prevents South Dakota state legislators from making decisions in the future about even minimal protections for the state's health care consumers. This would undermine state rights and hurt beneficiaries, providers and small businesses.
   South Dakotans could see certain benefit protections disappear such as: diabetic supplies and education, emergency services, mammography screening, mental health parity, off-label drug use, and prostate cancer screening.
   A WISE ALTERNATIVE: Johnson has joined an effort with more than twenty of his colleagues to help small businesses offer affordable health care that provides both options and protections for their employees. Johnson is a cosponsor of S.2510, the Small Employers Health Benefits Program (SEHBP) Act, which would create a new program, modeled after the successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The SEHBP proposal includes strong consumer protections, ensuring that participating plans be licensed in every state where they operate.
   The program will be open to all employers with up to 100 employees. According to the most recent data from the Small Business Administration, 19,750 South Dakota businesses fall in this category, employing 136,560 people.
   LIST OF GROUPS OPPOSED TO S.1955 (as of 05/05/06): This legislation is opposed by countless consumer and provider groups including: AARP, the American Cancer Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics. It has also been opposed by 41 Attorney Generals including Larry Long of South Dakota. For a full list of groups opposed, please go to Senator Johnson's website at http://johnson.senate.gov.
