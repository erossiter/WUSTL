SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING MAMMOTH SITE OF HOT SPRINGS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs will receive a $198,000 earmark to expand their facility to provide a venue for scientific lectures and othereducational events. Johnson, a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for this project in the 2006 spending bill.  
    "Economic development is a 'lynchpin' issue in the sense that strengthening our economy leads to progress on many other issues -- generating additional resources for education, reducing crime rates, and making it easier for people to provide for their families," Johnson said.
  Funding, like this one, is secured by members of Congress to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member's ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with a seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
