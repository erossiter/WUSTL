SOUTH DAKOTA DELEGATION ANNOUNCES PROJECT FUNDING IN TRANSPORTATION SPENDING BILL
  Sens. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Rep. Stephanie Herseth (D-SD) today announced funding levels for South Dakota projects contained in the Transportation spending bill. The bill passed the House and Senate late Saturday as part of the Omnibus spending bill, which comprised 9 federal funding packages. 
   "This bill contains important funding for transportation projects across our state," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "Roads, bridges, and airports are critical to our state's economy and our communities. I will continue to work for critical funding for important transportation projects."
   "South Dakota has benefitted from significant investments in transportation priorities," Senator Daschle said. "This bill includes additional funding for projects such as the Heartland Expressway, improvements to the infrastructure on our reservations, and investments in aviation-related projects. These efforts are critical to South Dakota's economic future, and I am proud to have worked together to secure this essential funding."
   Rep. Herseth said, "Numerous communities across the state will benefit from the investment in transportation infrastructure contained in this bill. In my relatively brief time in the House, I have made the Meridian Bridge in Yankton a particular priority, and I'm extremely pleased that project will receive $4 million to jumpstart its construction. Next year, Congress will again try to complete work on a multi-year transportation bill, and I will continue to work with House colleagues and with our delegation to ensure that South Dakota transportation projects receive necessary further funding as part of that larger measure."
