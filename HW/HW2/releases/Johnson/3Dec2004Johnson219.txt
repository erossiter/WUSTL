SEN. JOHNSON INVITES SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE DESIGNATE TO MEET
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has invited Secretary of Agriculture Designate Mike Johanns to a meeting to discuss the needs of South Dakota's family farmers and ranchers.  
   In his letter to Johanns, Johnson said, "It is very important to the farmers of South Dakota and across the nation that the next Secretary of Agriculture represent them in the best possible way. There are many critical issues facing farmers across the nation, including mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL), targeting farm program payments, concentration in the agriculture industry, and the ban on packer ownership of livestock to name a few. I continue to hear from producers across the state on these initiatives, as they continue to be a high priority in shaping the opportunities producers and ranchers will have in the agricultural industry."
   Johnson welcomed the fellow Midwesterner to the new post and Washington, DC, and offered to host a meeting for the entire South Dakota delegation. 
   "As Congress prepares for a new farm bill in 2007, the new Secretary will be at the heart of helping our farmers and ranchers. It is important to start on the right foot with an open dialogue," Johnson said.
