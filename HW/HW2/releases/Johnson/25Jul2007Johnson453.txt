SEN. JOHNSON: DISABLED VETERANS MEMORIAL APPROVED BY COMMITTEE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced an update today to legislation to honor America's disabled veterans. Johnson, a member of Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, announced the committee passed a bill he has co-sponsored to extend the authorization until 2015 for a memorial in Washington, DC, to honor veterans who became disabled while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. This legislation, similar to a bill authored by Johnson last Congress, has already been passed by the House of Representatives and was introduced this year by Senator John Thune (R-SD) and Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND). 
  "By reauthorizing the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, today's action supports expanding the amount of time available to raise funds to build the memorial. I am glad to see this commitment to a Memorial and the legislation needed make it a reality, which is so long overdue. It is my hope this will be one way we can honor veterans disabled for life for their service and commitment to protecting the freedoms we hold dear," Johnson said. 
  Johnson's support for the memorial has extended to measures that would help fund the memorial's construction.

That bill did not pass the House in

The Foundation describes the memorial's purpose as a way to "embody America's lasting gratitude for the men and women whose lives are forever changed in service to our country."
