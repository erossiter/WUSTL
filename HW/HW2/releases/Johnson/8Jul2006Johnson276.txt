SEN. JOHNSON TOURS EPSCOR LABORATORY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) toured labs at South Dakota State University (SDSU) today that were assisted by a recent federal Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) funding.  
   "Today's tour of research labs at SDSU are a great example of what federal funds, universities, and the private sector can do to advance technology and research. This meeting allows me to bring back first-hand knowledge of the positive effects of EPSCoR grants, and I will certainly share this in the coming months as the Senate considers spending bills that fund this important tool for promoting research," Johnson said.
   As a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson is a perennial advocate for EPSCoR grant funding, which this year allocated a $6.75 million federal grant to laboratories at several South Dakota Universities for research infrastructure upgrades. Johnson and his staff meet with representatives who use and maintain South Dakota's EPSCoR labs almost every year, and he has written letters to support South Dakota applications for EPSCoR grants.
   James Rice, Director of EPSCoR in South Dakota, showed Johnson the fruits of that funding today, and introduced him to faculty and students who have directly benefited from the labs. 
   Grants for programs like EPSCoR are an integral part of Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan. This project emphasizes three of the four pillars of that plan, encouraging economic growth by "promoting partnerships," "emphasizing entrepreneurship" and "investing in the public good."
