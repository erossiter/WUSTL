  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the South Dakota Parent Connection (SDPC) in Sioux Falls will receive a $95,700 discretionary federal grant through the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration. 
   "Institutions like the South Dakota Parent Connection provide invaluable advice and guidance to parents of children with special health care needs," Johnson said. "It is critical that parents and families of children living with disabilities get the help and access to quality care they need."
   According to their website, the South Dakota Parent Connection works with families to establish strong foundations of understanding for families with children who have disabilities or special health care needs. In addition to offering workshops and resources, the SDPC brings together the families of children with special health care needs to share experiences and refer families to services to help care for their child.
