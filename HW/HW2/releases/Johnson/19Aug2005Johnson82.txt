SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES HEARING ON RISING PRICES AT GAS PUMP
  Troubled by the rising price of gas at the pumps, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced a Senate Energy Committee hearing to examine the issue. Johnson, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, said the hearing will take place on September 8th, when Congress returns next month. 
   "With gas prices topping three dollars per gallon in some parts of the country, paying for gas has become a near painful experience as prices rise higher and higher. South Dakota's working families are finding it difficult to dig a little deeper into their pockets to make ends meet," Johnson said. "It is important that the Senate Energy Committee take this issue up, and I am looking forward to hearing from industry, consumer groups and the government on how to address the challenge of spiraling gasoline prices and the contributing factors." 
   "Any increase in fuel prices has economic consequences for South Dakota families and businesses that cannot be ignored. As part of an effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil imports and grow the South Dakota economy, I have worked to implement a strong renewable fuels standard to promote the production of ethanol and biodiesel as part of the Energy Bill, but this is a long term solution. The administration has no short term strategy to lower the price of gas," said Johnson.
