USDA TO EXPAND EMERGENCY HAYING OF CRP ACRES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced tonight that the USDA will expand emergency haying & grazing of CRP acres.  
   "The drought in South Dakota has reached a critical point, and this Department has finally taken a step toward acknowledging this. While I am hopeful that producers suffering from severe drought conditions in the state will find some relief with this action, I will continue to push this Administration toward meaningful agriculture disaster assistance," Johnson said. Just yesterday, Johnson invited the Secretary of Agriculture out to South Dakota to tour the damage.
   USDA will expand emergency haying & grazing of CRP acres in South Dakota. The expansion will hopefully allow livestock producers from eligible counties to obtain needed hay or forage. The expanded area radiates 150 miles out from any county approved for emergency haying and grazing in the state. For convenience of CRP participants and the public, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) will post a map of counties approved for emergency haying and grazing with an approximate 150-mile radius to its web site by clicking "Conservation" at www.fsa.usda.gov .
   Producers' CRP rental payment will also be reduced by only 10% instead of the standard 25% on CRP lands that are grazed in 2006.
