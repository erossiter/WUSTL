SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE SAYS LOWER BRULE, CROW CREEK TRIBES TO RECEIVE HOUSING GRANTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe will receive $281,418 and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe will receive $292,475 in federal funding for housing assistance through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program.  
   Johnson has said in the past, "This funding will help South Dakota tribes develop more safe and affordable homes for their members. Unfortunately, unsafe and inadequate housing is an all too familiar reality on many of the reservations in the state. The IHBG program is an important federal resource for tribes to improve living conditions and increase home ownership." 
   The grant funding is eligible to be used for housing development, housing services to eligible families and individuals, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. 
   Johnson has long been a supporter of the IHBG program, and as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee, he has consistently fought to provide this important program with sufficient funding. 
   The Indian Housing Block Grant Program (IHBG) was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). Federally recognized Indian tribes or their designated housing authorities are eligible for the block grants.
