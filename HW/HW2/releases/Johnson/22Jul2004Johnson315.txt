SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PROPOSAL OF VOLUNTARY COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN LABELING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), the author of the country-of-origin labeling provision signed into law as part of the 2002 Farm Bill, today released the following statement regarding proposed House legislation to make country-of-origin labeling for meat voluntary: 
   "The proposal of voluntary country-of-origin labeling is ridiculous," said Johnson. "No importer of foreign meat would voluntarily mark it as such when they could more easily hide it among the high-quality, safe American meat consumers enjoy. 
   "Imagine making brake lights optional on a car; manufacturers might save a nickel, but how would drivers know when to slow down?
   "This is quite simply an attempt to kill mandatory COOL. Domestic consumers and producers deserve better. I will fight this proposal on their behalf."
