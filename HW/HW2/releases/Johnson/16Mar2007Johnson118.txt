PASSPORTS APPLICANTS COULD FACE PROCESSING DELAYS
  Increased calls from constituents has led Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) to remind people today to plan ahead when applying for a passport. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's new travel rules requiring a passport to enter the United States when arriving by air from any part of the Western Hemisphere, including Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda. Due to this new requirement, there has been a significant increase in demand for passport processing, and the process itself has also slowed.  
   The new regulation took effect on January 23, 2007. Since that time, the US Department of State has seen an unprecedented increase in passport applications; as a result, passport processing times have increased dramatically. The U.S. Department of state estimates that passport applications usually take six weeks to process. Currently, the process is taking 10 or more weeks. Expedited applications, which usually take 2 weeks, are currently taking 4 or more weeks to process. 
   This change in travel document requirements is the result of recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission, which Congress subsequently passed into law in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.
