SEN. JOHNSON: LEGISLATION NECESSARY TO KEEP OUT CANADIAN CATTLE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that legislation to keep the U.S.-Canadian border closed to imports of live Canadian cattle until mandatory country-of-origin labeling is implemented is necessary, as the Department of Agriculture (USDA) proceeds toward opening the border. Sen. Johnson said he will introduce bipartisan legislation when the Senate returns to legislative session. 
   "No Canadian cattle until COOL is implemented," said Johnson. "I've always thought COOL should be in place to let people make an informed choice about their meat. Now, with two Canadian cases of Mad Cow in as many weeks, we need COOL to protect consumer confidence in beef. Anything less is reckless. We can't have USDA opening the floodgates to Canadian cattle - this legislation is necessary."
   Johnson was joined at a Sioux Falls press conference by South Dakota Stockgrowers Association Member and Regional R-CALF USA Director Herman Schumacher.
   "Our food safety is at stake," said Schumacher. "Without consumers, we ranchers are out of business. With COOL in place, consumers have a choice and producers have a fair deal." 
   Johnson, the author of the country-of-origin labeling provision included in the 2002 Farm Bill, expressed concerns to USDA and the White House in letters dated January 3, following confirmation of the last case of Mad Cow. Johnson requested that USDA reconsider the March timeline for opening the U.S.-Canadian border to live cattle. Johnson renewed those concerns last Tuesday following Canada's second announcement of a case of Mad Cow in as many weeks.
   Mandatory country-of-origin labeling is scheduled to be implemented by September 2006. USDA's proposed rule to open the U.S.-Canada border to imports of live Canadian cattle would take effect in March of this year.
