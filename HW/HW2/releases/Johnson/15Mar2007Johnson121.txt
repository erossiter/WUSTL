SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE: $10,000 GRANT TO HELP EXPAND LAKE HERMAN STATE PARK RECREATION FACILITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that Lake Herman State Park, near Madison, will receive $10,000 to renovate and expand an RV dump station. The funding for the improvements comes from a National Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) grant to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks.  
   In the past, Johnson has said that "parks are important to our communities, giving children and families a safe, clean place for recreation." 
   The LWCF gives grants to states to help them purchase land, water and wetlands to be preserved for both present and future generations. The grants match state expenditures and impact the local communities directly. Through the National Park Service, Congress provided a total of $30 million for nationwide grants to improve local recreational facilities and park lands. Senator Johnson serves as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the National Park Service.
