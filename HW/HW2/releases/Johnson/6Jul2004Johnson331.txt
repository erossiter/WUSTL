SEN. JOHNSON MEETS SOUTH DAKOTA PRESIDENTIAL CLASSROOM STUDENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) met with Ashley Evenson from Springfield this week to congratulate her on her work in representing the Presidential Classroom program for 2004 for South Dakota.  
 Evenson attends Bon Homme High School in Bon Homme. 
   "The Presidential Classroom program is an excellent educational tool and opportunity for high school students to experience Capitol Hill and Washington, D.C.," Johnson said. "With this type of program, students have a chance to better appreciate the American political process." 
   The students are here for a one week session attending seminars and discussion groups with other high school students from around the country learning about the federal government. There are two other one week sessions after this week where three more South Dakota students will be representing the state. 
   The Presidential Classroom program is a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to providing an insider's view of the federal government to high school students. Students are chosen based on academic excellence and strong leadership in their high schools.
