SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement after voting against closing debate on the Defense Appropriations Bill conference report: 
   "The Defense Appropriations conference report is being held hostage by those who want to use this important bill as a vehicle for a completely unrelated and controversial matter. To include an Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) drilling amendment in the Defense conference report when neither the House nor the Senate had included it in their respective bills, is an outrage. 
   "This would set a terrible precedent of using the annual Defense Appropriations Bill to pass all sorts of pork-barrel and other extraneous matters that cannot pass on their own merit. The integrity of the Senate and our political system requires that Senators demonstrate they have the backbone to resist this kind of back-door legislating. 
   "It is obvious that there are those who think that Senators will capitulate to this kind of irresponsible legislating out of fear of their patriotism or support for our troops being attacked. Clearly, there is near unanimous bipartisan support in the Senate for the underlying Defense Appropriations conference report-- the only thing holding things up is the effort to pack the bill with the non-relevant ANWR provision. 
   "Once the ANWR provision is removed and scheduled for debate and votes on its own, the Defense funding bill can proceed. As the father of a son who serves in the US Army, I resent the suggestion of some that any opposition to this non-relevant amendment is somehow an indication of lack of support for the military-- to the contrary, it is those who included this measure in the Defense bill who by their actions are slowing down final passage."
