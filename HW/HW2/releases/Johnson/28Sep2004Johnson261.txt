SENS. JOHNSON, DASCHLE ANNOUNCE $393,664 IN FUNDING FOR ABERDEEN AREA TRIBAL CHAIRMAN'S HEALTH BOARD
  Sens. Tim Johnson and Tom Daschle (both D-SD) announced today that the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health Board will receive $393,664 in funding for healthy start programs.  
 The Healthy Start program covers the Aberdeen regional area, which includes Iowa, Nebraska, and North Dakota. 
   "Programs like Healthy Start are an investment in healthy children and strong families," said Johnson. "Educating new parents on caring for their newborns are lessons of a lifetime. I am happy to have helped secure funding for this significant program."
   Without a doubt, babies' first months are crucial to their long-term health," Senator Daschle said. "Tribal Healthy Start programs bring vital resources and training to families on reservations."
   The purpose of the Healthy Start program is to educate new mothers on prenatal care and early infant care. Northern Plains Healthy Start is committed to the mission of promoting healthy families and improving birth outcomes for Native American women. The Targeted Case Management (TCM) services are a culturally relevant program, which empowers individuals to make better health care choices.
   Northern Plains Healthy Start and the Targeted Case Management program is a holistic approach respecting the importance of family, extended family, physical, emotional, psycho-social and spiritual health and the continued support for Indian family values.
   This grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
