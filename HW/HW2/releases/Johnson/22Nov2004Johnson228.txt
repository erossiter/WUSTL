SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FIELDING OF NATIONAL GUARD HOMELAND SECURITY TEAMS
  The Department of Defense notified Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today that they will field a Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team (WMD-CST) in South Dakota. This includes training and necessary equipment for the South Dakota National Guard to assist first responders to address any possible WMD attack. With today's announcement, every state in the nation will have a team.  
   In addition to South Dakota, the ten other teams that will be funded in the Defense Appropriations Act for 2005 are: The District of Columbia, Delaware, Guam, Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, and Wyoming. The fielding and certification of these final 11 teams will bring the total number of WMD-CST's to 55. 
   "This is positive news for South Dakota. I have worked with General Gorman and the South Dakota National Guard to ensure our state will receive a civil support team. The South Dakota National Guard is at the forefront of protecting our state and our communities, and I am pleased that with this announcement they will receive additional resources."
   According to the Department of Defense, the WMD-CSTs are able to deploy rapidly to assist local first responders in determining the nature of the attack, provide medical and technical advice, and pave the way for identification and arrival of follow-on state and federal response assets. Each team consists of 22 highly skilled, full-time members of the Army and Air National Guard who are federally resourced, trained and evaluated, but fall under the command and control of the state governors. The initiative is part of the Department's overall effort to support local, state, and federal civil authorities in the event of an incident involving weapons of mass destruction in the United States.
