SEN. JOHNSON MEETS WITH SOUTH DAKOTA CONGRESSIONAL STUDENT LEADERSHIP DELEGATES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) met with the two South Dakota Congressional Student Leadership Conference (CSLC) delegates earlier this week.  
 April Genovese from Custer and Benjamin Curnow from Pierre represented South Dakota this week at the conference. 
   "I am pleased to see April and Benjamin representing South Dakota at this year's conference," said Johnson. "I hope with this week's events and past school and community involvement they will want to continue participating in public service."
   The Congressional Student Leadership Conference is a program that allows high school students to experience Washington, DC while learning and building valuable leadership skills which will better serve them in college and life.
