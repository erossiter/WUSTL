SEN. JOHNSON ASSIGNED TO INTERIOR, TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has been named to two new Appropriations Subcommittees, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee.  
   Johnson will continue to serve as a member of the Agriculture and Rural Development Appropriations Subcommittee, the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. Last week, Johnson was named Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee.
   In past years, the Interior and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittees have funded numerous projects across South Dakota, including the EROS Data Center, Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), the Highway Trust Fund, Bus and Bus Facility Funding, Community Development and Financial Institutions (CDFI) funding, and operational funds for the National Park Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which includes funding for the Indian Health Services program.
   Although Senator Johnson underwent surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage on December 13th, he retains his seniority in the Senate and will lose none of his rights during his absence.
