SEN. JOHNSON TO CHAIR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office today announced his assignment to be the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. The Financial Institutions Subcommittee legislation has legislative jurisdiction over banks, savings, associations, credit unions and other financial institutions and has oversight of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve System.  
   Johnson was first named to the Senate Banking Committee in 1997 and has served continuously on the committee during his tenure in the Senate. He previously served as Chairman of the Subcommittee from 2001 to 2003, and was Ranking Member (the senior Democrat) from 2003 to 2006. 
   When he was named Chair of the Financial Services Subcommittee in 2001, Johnson observed that "banking issues are unique in rural areas, and I will be able to bring the concerns of South Dakota banking consumers and the banking community before this important subcommittee." 
   Johnson will also sit on the Securities, Insurance and Investment Subcommittee and Security and International Trade and Finance Subcommittee. 
   In addition to this Subcommittee Chairmanship, this Congress Johnson has been named Chairman of the Ethics Committee, as well as Chairman of the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee and Chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee.
