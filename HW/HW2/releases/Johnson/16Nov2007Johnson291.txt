SEN. JOHNSON NAMES MOODY COUNTY AS COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that he has selected Moody County as his November 2007 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his Senate website http://johnson.senate.gov.  
   "Moody County has a rich history and has much to offer," said Johnson. "From helping to secure funding for the Trent Fire Department to funding for improved flood control and health standards, I am always proud to work on projects important to the people of Moody County."
   Home to the towns of Flandreau, Colman, Egan, and Trent, as well as the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, Moody County was founded in 1873. It was named in honor of Gideon Curtis Moody, the first U.S. Senator from South Dakota.
   Johnson is a strong advocate of homeland security and economic development grant programs that help small communities continue to grow. Recently, he announced funding for the Trent Fire Department to purchase a new pumper truck and for the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe to modernize how they store medical records.
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places."
