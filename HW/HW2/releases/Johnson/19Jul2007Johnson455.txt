SEN. JOHNSON: FUNDING FOR SOUTH DAKOTA CLEARS HURDLE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that funding levels he secured for South Dakota in the coming year's agriculture spending bill have been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee. Johnson is a member of the Senate Agriculture and Rural Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which approved the spending levels earlier this week. The bill is now ready for consideration by the full Senate and includes provisions that will mean nearly $8 million in funding specifically for South Dakota projects.  
  The Committee included an amendment supported by Johnson that reinforces that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) should implement Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) by September 30, 2008. The amendment ensures that USDA meets certain benchmarks with its implementation process. Johnson was the author of the COOL provision that was included in the 2002 farm bill, but has not been fully implemented due to opposition by the Administration.
  "The bill includes funding for producers, community development and agricultural research that will directly benefit South Dakota," said Johnson, a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. "Funding included in this bill will go toward a ruminant nutrition research and education at SDSU, enable South Dakota's Natural Resource Conservation Service to analyzethe impact of Missouri River Sedimentation and fund an investigation of the honey bee colonies collapse."
  "I thank my colleagues including Chairman Byrd and Subcommittee Chairman Kohl for their help throughout this process, and I am particularly pleased to see the full committee added provisions to push for COOL to advance," Johnson said.
