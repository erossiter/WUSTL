SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $998,009 FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN FORT PIERRE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that Fort Pierre-based Rural Health Care, Inc (RHCI), will receive a $998,009 federal grant to enhance affordable, quality healthcare for surrounding rural communities. The ongoing competitive federal grant comes through the Health Resources and Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   "This funding will improve and expand the health care we provide to those South Dakotans who need it most," Johnson said. "I have confidence that the folks at RHCI will continue to do the good work which makes them a linchpin of South Dakota's rural health care system."
   RHCI's clinics in Murdo, Highmore, Gettysburg, Onida, Ft. Pierre, and Presho provide local residents with primary medical care, lab and x-ray services. RHCI offers patients reduced prices on office visits and services through a sliding fee program based on income level. Clinicians also reach out to communities through health fairs, public education, American Cancer Society functions, and EMT training.
   As a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson has always made rural health services a priority, and has pledged to continue to work to fully fund programs that help provide rural areas with health care.
