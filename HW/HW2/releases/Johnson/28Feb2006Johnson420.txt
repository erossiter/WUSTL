SEN. JOHNSON DEFENDS SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement upon hearing Sen. Mark Dayton's (D-MN) comment regarding South Dakota and Sen. John Thune (R-SD). Dayton was quoted by Fortune Magazine as saying: "the Mayo Clinic is worth a hell of a lot more than the entire state of South Dakota." 
   "Regarding Senator Dayton's comments about the relative value of South Dakota to the Mayo Clinic and the railroad interests of Sen. John Thune, let me observe that the Senate is in need of more thoughtful and respectful discussion and less political bombast. Senator Dayton owes South Dakota an apology for his uncharacteristically negative and unfair assertions. South Dakota and Minnesota are both wonderful states, and I believe that Senator Thune's work on behalf of the DM&E Railroad has been motivated by his concern for the welfare of our state as he sees it. With that, I am confident that we can all move on in a bipartisan and constructive manner," Johnson said.
