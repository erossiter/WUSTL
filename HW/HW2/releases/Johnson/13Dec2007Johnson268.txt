SEN. JOHNSON COMMITTED TO STRONG FARM BILL FOR GREAT PLAINS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today was disappointed with the failure of the Senate to move the Dorgan-Grassley payment limitations amendment forward as part of the Farm Bill. Johnson co-sponsored the amendment, which failed to clear the 60 vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster after a vote of 56 to 43 earlier today. The legislation would cap farm payments at $250,000 for a farmer and spouse. 
  Johnson has released the following statement:
  "The Dorgan-Grassley payment limitations amendment was a straight-forward and fiscally responsible proposal that would fix the current farm program payment structure that has failed rural America. Unfortunately, today's filibuster by a small group of Senators blocked the amendment from being included as part of the Farm Bill.
  I find it unconscionable that a member of Congress would not vote to restrict such egregious spending. In 2002, the Senate saw a strong vote in favor of payment limitations, and I was optimistic we would have similar results today. Though a majority of the Senate, including Senator Thune, came together to help rural America, a small group blocked that effort. 
  Despite the outcome of today's vote, I will continue to work with Senators from both sides of the political aisle to ensure South Dakota and the Great Plains get a strong bill that will promote the nation's agricultural communities."
