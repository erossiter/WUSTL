 The SDHCA Federal Legend Award is given to those who demonstrate stellar political leadership in the area of long term care at the highest levels of government.

   Senator Johnson has consistently fought to ensure that the people of South Dakota have access to long term care facilities for many years to come including through better long term care with Medicare and Medicaid, and through funding to battle the nursing shortages that have been a problem in South Dakota. 
   The SDHCA is a long term care association, representing including skilled nursing home care, assisted living, and congregate living throughout South Dakota.. 
   "The South Dakota Health Care Association and its members serve an important role in our communities and I want to thank them for all the work they do to take care of the elderly and disabled in South Dakota," continued Johnson.
