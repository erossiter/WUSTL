SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $74,547 IN FUNDING FOR HERITAGE CENTER MUSEUM OF RED CLOUD INDIAN SCHOOL
  U. S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Heritage Center Museum of the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge will receive a $74,547 grant through the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Museums for America program for the inventory of Native American artwork. 
  "This funding will help the Heritage Center Museum of the Red Cloud Indian School preserve Native American art, which will ensure that individuals of all ages have the chance to experience an important part of South Dakota's history," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  The grant program seeks to strengthen a museum's ability to serve the public more effectively by supporting high-priority activities that advance the institution's mission and strategic goals. The funds can be used for a wide variety of projects, including research, planning, new programs and other activities. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
