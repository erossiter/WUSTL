SENS. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS
  Today, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon hearing President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to replace Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court:  
   "At a press conference this morning at the White House, President Bush nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. It is the Senate's Constitutional duty to carefully consider nominees for this lifetime appointment. That includes a review of the nominee and hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   "I have had several conversations with Harriet Miers in her capacity as White House counsel, including when she called to ask me if I had a recommendations for the Court and my views on Roberts. While Ms. Miers has a long, notable career as an attorney, she has not yet served as a judge. Given how little is known about her at this point, the Senate hearings will be as important as ever, especially since this nomination could affect the balance of the Court. 
   "Hearings are central to the nomination process. It is important not to prejudge a nominee before all the facts are in. 
   "I look forward to learning more about Ms. Miers."
