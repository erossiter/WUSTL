SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE: BIA NOMINEE CONFIRMED
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the full Senate approved nominee Carl Artman to head the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Johnson met with Artman in September 2006. The Assistant Secretary position to which Mr. Artman is nominated has been vacant since February 2004, following the departure of Dave Anderson.  
   Carl Artman is a member of the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin and for the past ten months has served as Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs at Interior. 
   In September, Johnson said that "it's been nearly two years since someone has held this post - far too long. We need someone in place that will keep the lines of communication open and consult with our tribes." 
   Johnson encouraged Artman in their September meeting to focus on the serious problems South Dakota tribes are having with BIA law enforcement and to ensure the BIA engages tribes in meaningful consultation on all issues. They discussed in that meeting the shockingly low level of BIA law enforcement in South Dakota, to the point where the Crow Creek tribe has only two officers and other tribes have less than ten officers to patrol reservations the size of Connecticut. 
   During the Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing in September to review Artman's nomination, Johnson said that "in my State, several lawsuits have arisen between tribes and the BIA. While some disputes are probably unavoidable, in many cases an improved commitment to providing meaningful consultation with tribal governments would go a long ways toward reducing the amount of litigation the tribes have felt forced to pursue." 
   While Johnson's office remains in contact with the tribes and BIA, Johnson has repeatedly expressed in the past that there needs to be a more concerted effort by the BIA to consult and respond to the on-the-ground problems tribes face everyday.
