SEN. JOHNSON WORKS TO IMPROVE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined with colleagues in recommending concrete areas within the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act regulations that should be closely reviewed and improved by Congress. 
   "I applaud efforts to raise standards and achievement in our nation's schools, but there are very real problems with No Child Left Behind that need to be addressed," Johnson said. "We all want students to reach high standards, but we need to make sure educators have the resources and the flexibility they need to ensure student achievement."
   Johnson and his colleagues wrote to the leadership of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which has jurisdiction for NCLB. The Senators provided a list of suggested topics for any upcoming hearings related to the implementation of NCLB to enhance flexibility and improve the program.
   "Unfortunately, many educators, administrators, students, and parents are still struggling to wade through the maze of new, and often complex, rules and regulations associated with NCLB. Every state and every school district is different, and we are concerned that the Department's rigid approach to implementation to date has not taken into account, and could actually undermine, the variety of successful and innovative education methods that exist around the country," the Senators wrote, referencing the U.S. Department of Education.
   Hearing topics that the Senators recommended include:
   * The unique circumstances of rural and smaller school districts
   * The effect of crucial programs such as Title I and special education at the federal level
   * The federal sanctions structure, which is more focused on taking away from schools than targeting resources to schools that need them most
   * The need for additional federal funding for professional development, teacher and principal recruitment and retention to meet NCLB requirements for highly qualified teachers
   * Ongoing efforts to align NCLB and the Individuals with Disabilities Act
   In 2003, Johnson and several other Senators from rural states requested that the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a study on the unique challenges facing rural school districts in complying with NCLB. That study found that more needed to be done for rural districts, including additional assistance and greater flexibility.
   Johnson also believes that it's important to consistently fund education programs. The President's recently proposed budget would make a $2.1 billion reduction - the largest cut to federal education funding in the 26-year history of the Education Department. As a member of both the Senate Appropriations and Budget Committees, Johnson will work to restore those cuts.
