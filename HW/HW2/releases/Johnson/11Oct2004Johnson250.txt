SENATE PASSES DEFENSE REAUTHORIZATION BILL; INCLUDES PAY RAISE FOR MILITARY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced passage of the Defense Authorization Act of 2005 conference report. The bill negotiated between the House of Representatives and the Senate will now be ready for the President's signature in the coming days. 
   "We have the strongest military in the world," said Johnson. "This bill approves a much deserved pay increase and will ensure that our servicemen and women have the best equipment with which to defend our freedom. Senator Daschle is also to be commended for all he has to done to bring health care benefits to National Guard and Reserve members as part of this bill."
   The bill authorized $420.6 billion for defense programs for 2005, an increase of $19.3 billion above last year's amount. In addition, the bill authorized $25.0 billion for additional war-related costs for Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. 
   CONFERENCE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS 
   The bill addressed a number of defense priorities, including:
   * Authorized a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed service personnel. 
   * Created a new health care benefit for members of the reserve component by authorizing Senator Daschle's TRICARE coverage for Reserve members who have served on extended active duty.
