SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR YANKTON SIOUX TRIBE
  U.S. Senator Johnson announced today that the Yankton Sioux Tribe will receive a federal grant of $444,370 from the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). This funding will help targeted jurisdictions combat the problem of methamphetamine production, use and abuse, and distribution.  
  "Methamphetamine use and abuse is a critical problem across rural America and has increased in South Dakota," Said Johnson. "We must do more to combat this deadly and highly addictive drug in South Dakota and on our Indian Reservations."
  This Methamphetamine Initiative conducted by the COPS Office awards these funds to jurisdictions with high meth production, use and distribution. These jurisdictions are able to work with other entities to further prevent and treat meth use and abuse. 
  The COPS program began in 1994 as a part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This program has repeatedly been targeted for elimination in recent years, only to have Congress restore the funding annually, essentially saving the program.
