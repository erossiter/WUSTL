SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $189,600 IN FUNDING FOR PETER NORBECK SCENIC BYWAY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced a $189,600 federal grant to improve trails and ensure safety within the Wrinkled Rock Climbing Area along the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway. The funding is provided to the state through the United States Department of Transportation.  
  "The trails and hiking areas found at the Wrinkled Rock Climbing Area offers a glimpse of the sort of beautiful scenery and wildlife that South Dakota has to offer," said Johnson. "This funding will ensure the area remains safe and accessible for residents and visitors taking advantage of the recreational and scenic opportunities the area provides. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment"
  Funding will create safe visitor access, rehabilitate existing resource damage, and reconstruct trails in the Wrinkled Rock Climbing Area. Located near Mount Rushmore in the northeast portion of the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway, it is the fourth busiest rock climbing area in the National Park System. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
