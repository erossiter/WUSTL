SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON HOUSE EXTENSION OF 2002 FARM BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement after the House approved a one week extension of the 2002 Farm Bill: 
   An extension of one week is a positive sign that we're nearing a final agreement on the farm bill. There are clearly some policy pieces to hammer out yet before Congress puts something on the president's desk for signature, but I hope we're in the home stretch. Part of these negotiations involves striking a balance to ensure a solid safety net for our ag producers as well as ensuring other programs have satisfactory funding behind them. Once this work is done, it is my hope that the President will sign this bill without delay.
