SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $700,000 IN GRANTS TO SOUTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the South Dakota Department of Corrections will receive a total of $700,000 from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the United States Department of Justice. 
   The funds came in the form of two grants, $600,000 through the Formula Grants Program and $100,000 through the Community Prevention Grants Program.
   "By decreasing juvenile delinquency rates, we can ensure that South Dakota's children grow up in a safe environment," said Johnson. "It is necessary that we develop effective programs to work toward that goal."
   The Formula Grants Program, which is authorized under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 2002, supports state and local delinquency and prevention efforts. Funding may be allocated for planning and administration, state advisory group allocation, compliance monitoring, as well as prevention of delinquent acts, including substance abuse, serious and violent crimes and gang involvement. 
   Funding from the Community Prevention Grants Program, which is authorized under Title V of the 2002 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, will support delinquency prevention programs for youth who are likely to have contact with the juvenile justice system. It will provide a wide range of services, including recreation, tutoring, mentoring and leadership development activities.
