TURNER COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Turner County as his September 2006 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website.  
   "Turner County has a rich history and that makes it a wonderful place to live and visit," Johnson said. "I am thankful for the county's great help on many issues, ranging from installing weather radio transmitters to drinking water and road improvements." 
   Home to the towns of Parker, Centerville, Marion, Viborg, Irene, Hurley, Chancellor, Dolton, and Monroe, Turner County was founded in 1871. The county was named for John W. Turner, a member of the Dakota Territory Legislature in the 1860's. With the coming of the railroad came the "County Seat War," which moved the county seat from Swan Lake City to Parker in 1855. 
   Johnson is a strong advocate of homeland security grants and economic development grant programs that help our small communities continue to grow. He was proud to announce funding for programs in Turner County that range from federal funding for the Parker Fire Department to federal funding for the resurfacing of roads in the county to E-Rate funding for Telecommunication and Internet services in the Viborg School District. 
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and I am happy to feature Turner this month," continued Johnson. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places."
