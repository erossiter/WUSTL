SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $121,670 FOR SIOUX EMPIRE SAFETY VILLAGE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Sioux Empire Safety Village, Inc. in Sioux Falls will receive a $121,670 federal grant from the Department of Homeland Security's Fire Prevention and Safety program. The funding will be used to help South Dakotans reduce fire related hazards. 
  "Fire prevention and safety programs like the Sioux Empire Safety Village play a crucial role in keeping South Dakota residents safe," Johnson said. "It is essential that people are aware of fire hazards and are taught how to reduce them. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
