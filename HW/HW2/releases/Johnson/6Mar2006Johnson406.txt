SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $306,900 TO EASTSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER IN PIERRE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Eastside Neighborhood Center (ENC) in Pierre will receive a $306,900 grant to help maintain health care services in South Dakota. The center provides health care to children and needy families throughout central South Dakota. 
   "This is a very important center that helps care for our children," Johnson said. "Many families are struggling to meet their health care requirements. This center helps those that have limited access to medical care get the help they require."
   ENC provides primary health care services in central South Dakota school health clinics located in the Cheyenne-Eagle Butte Schools in Eagle Butte; Tiospaye Topa School in LaPlant; Takini School in Howes; and Buchanan School in Pierre: and at its health clinic in Pierre.
   ENC provides health care to everyone who is in need of services and are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private health coverage, or have no coverage at all. No one is refused services due to their financial circumstances.
   "So many people lack the insurance coverage they need," Johnson said. "It is wonderful to have an organization that is open to all people regardless of their circumstances."
   The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is a Federal agency that funds 911 federally qualified health centers including ENC which has provided care since 1998. The Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) grant program has provided access to care for vulnerable populations nation wide.
