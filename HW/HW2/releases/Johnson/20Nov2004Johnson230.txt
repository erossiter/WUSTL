SEN. JOHNSON: OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL GOOD TO SOUTH DAKOTA PRIORITIES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that several South Dakota priorities fare well in the Omnibus spending bill, which was expected to pass late Saturday. Mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat, South Dakota's water projects, and the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls all benefit from the large spending bill, which contains 9 of the 13 federal funding packages. 
   "Mandatory COOL lives to fight another day," said Johnson, a member of the Appropriations Committee and the conference negotiations that produced the final bill. "Consumers have the right to know the origins of the food they feed their families. We secured more total funding for our water projects than ever before-Lewis & Clark will be able to move ahead on schedule." 
   The same House Republicans opposed to COOL who were successful last year in delaying the program's implementation for two years mounted a significant effort to gut the program and make it voluntary. Those efforts were eventually defeated, protecting the 2006 mandatory COOL timeline. 
   Below is the funding secured for South Dakota's water projects:
   Lewis and Clark 
   * FY'05 $18.75 million 
   * FY'04 enacted $17 million 
   Mid-Dakota 
   * FY'05 $17 million 
   * FY'04 enacted $15 million 
   Mni Wiconi 
   * FY'05 $25.282 million 
   * FY'04 enacted $25.217 million 
   Perkins County
   * FY'05 $2.25 million 
   * FY'04 enacted $1 million 
   Total 
   * FY'05 $63.282 million
   * FY'04 enacted $58.217 million
   The Omnibus spending bill also contains language to insure that adequate supplemental funds are available for the EROS Data Center in the coming year.
   "This is a tremendous victory to sustain operations at EROS and key to the survival of nearly 150 technical jobs in the Sioux Falls area," added Johnson.
   Due to a malfunction with the current LANDSAT 7 satellite, the imagery from the satellite has been significantly diminished. Much of EROS's budget is comprised from sales of LANDSAT 7 imagery.
   The problems with the satellite have significantly curtailed data sales and this has resulted in serious financial shortfalls at EROS and jeopardized the long-term viability of the institution. As many as 150 key technical positions could be lost if the necessary resources are not available.
   This year, Senator Johnson worked diligently with Secretary Gale Norton of the Department of Interior, Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD), and appropriators to reprogram the necessary funds to safeguard these positions.
