SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $99,200 FOR NORTHERN HILLS YMCA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced the release of $99,200 in funding for the Northern Hills Family YMCA in Lead.  
 The funding was included in last year's Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill at the request of Johnson and former Senator Tom Daschle.
   "This funding will help the Northern Hills YMCA to continue programs for young people and adults in the community of Lead," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Whether after school programs for children or exercise programs for adults, the YMCA helps contribute to healthy living and a positive community."
   The funding comes through the Department of Education's Funds for the Improvement of Education Earmark Grant Awards program (FIE).
   "The funds from the FIE grant will be used to assist running programs in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007," said Stuart Hofer, Executive Director of the Northern Hills YMCA. "I would like to thank former Senator Daschle for providing assistance by way of access to the application for this grant. Senator Johnson's office helped us through the application process."
   Over 1,000 youth and adults in the Lead community are served each year by the Northern Hills YMCA's 41 programs. Additionally, the YMCA hosts an annual basketball tournament that welcomed 67 teams last year.
