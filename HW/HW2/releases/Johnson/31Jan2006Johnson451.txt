JUDGE ALITO CONFIRMED BY SENATE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement about the Senate confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "Alito's approval by the U.S. Senate today allows this chamber to move past this divisive period and on to other issues, such as balancing the budget, providing health care and quality education, enhancing job creation, and firming up our national defense.
   "This was a solemn occasion. It is essential to our democracy that the Supreme Court continues to remain independent and protect the system of checks and balances. I wish Judge Alito and his family well as they enter this new phase."
