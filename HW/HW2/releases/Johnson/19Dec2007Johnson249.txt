SEN. JOHNSON FIGHTS FOR AMT TAX RELIEF
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today urged the President to sign Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) relief legislation that will provide tax relief for millions of middle-class Americans. The legislation is now on the President's desk following Senate passage earlier this month and today's vote in the House.  
  "Without this relief, at least 13,000 more South Dakotans and 19 million more Americans will fall victim to the AMT and face increased taxes," Johnson said. "This bill will provide South Dakotans and taxpayers across the country with relief for one year, at which time it is my hope we can again act to institute permanent changes to the tax code."
  Congress has enacted temporary AMT relief, known as "patches," covering the tax years since 2000. The most recent AMT patch expired at the end of the 2006 tax year. 
  "This is great news for middle-class taxpayers across South Dakota who were expecting Congress to provide AMT tax relief by the end of the year," said Johnson. 
  Congress created the AMT in 1969 to ensure that corporations and the extremely wealthy could not use various tax deductions and complicated tax shelters to avoid paying taxes altogether. Unfortunately, the AMT statute was not indexed to inflation. As a result, while regular income tax brackets and personal exemptions adjust for higher prices and income over time, the AMT is roping in more and more middle-class families who were never intended to be subject to this system. 
  Recent estimates predict that 33 million Americans--or one-third of all taxpayers--will be forced to pay the AMT by the end of this decade.
