SEN. JOHNSON RECOGNIZES ARMED FORCES AS VETERANS DAY APPROACHES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) issued the following statement today to mark Veterans Day, which will be observed Monday, November 12, 2007: 
  "As the father of a solider, I know firsthand what it is like to have a loved one serve our country in the U.S. Armed Services. As Veterans Day approaches, our nation has the chance to reflect on both the service of our veterans and the sacrifices our men and women are currently making at home and abroad. Recognizing our veterans, young and old, is something we should make a better effort to do throughout the year. I will continue to keep America's men and women in uniform in my thoughts and prayers."
