SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ENERGY, WATER SPENDING LEVELS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels for South Dakota's water projects contained in the Energy and Water spending bill. The bill passed the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee today, on which Johnson serves.  
   "We will be working to hang onto these numbers amid increased competition for every federal dime," Johnson said. "Budgets are about priorities, and moving forward it is my hope that we can provide more for critical infrastructure, including drinking water and flood control projects."
   Drinking Water Projects:
   * Lewis & Clark $20 million (Senate) $15 million (House) $15 million (Administration Budget) 
   * Mni Wiconi $26 million (const) (Senate) $15 million (House) $22 million (Administration Budget) 
   * Mid Dakota $4 million (Senate) $0 (House) $0 (Administration Budget)
   * Perkins County $2 million (Senate) $0 (House) $0 (Administration Budget) 
   Total $52 million (const)(Senate) $30 million (House) $37 million (Administration Budget) 
   The Mni Wiconi Project also received $7 million for operations and maintenance. 
   The bill includes funding for the following South Dakota water and flood control projects: 
   * $5 million for Missouri River Mitigation construction costs; $2 million for operations and maintenance. The funding will allow for wildlife, recreation, and cultural enhancement and mitigation projects to compensate for flooded lands as a result of the Pick* Sloan Flood Control Act and construction of the Missouri River dams.
   * $2 million for the Big Sioux River Flood Control Project located near Sioux Falls.
   * $600,000 for the James River Water Development District Environmental Impact Statement to continue environmental preparation for flood control mitigation projects.
   * $100,000 for the Missouri River Restoration Act.
   The bill also includes funding for the following energy projects in South Dakota:
   * $1 million for the Heartland Grain Fuels project, located in Aberdeen.
   * $500,000 for the Fox Ridge Energy and Education Center, located in Faith.
   "We are working against misplaced priorities," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "The Administration's tax cuts for those making over one million dollars a year will cost thirty* two billion this year alone, yet drinking water and other infrastructure projects are supposed to take a backseat."
   The Energy and Water Appropriations Bill will next be considered by the full Appropriations Committee. The House of Representatives has already passed their version.
