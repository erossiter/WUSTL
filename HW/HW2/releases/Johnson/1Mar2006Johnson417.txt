SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $1.6 MILLION IN FUNDING TO LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $1,664,268 in funding to the Head Start program located in Wagner. The grant will be used to help coordinate early childhood educational opportunities for area kids. 
   "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel. Head Start builds a strong educational foundation. Head Start is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "The program allows kids, whose families might not be able to afford pre-school, the opportunity to get excellent preparation before entering school."
   Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering school. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents.
   The grant is awarded by the Department of Health & Human Services.
