SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES ENERGY, WATER SPENDING LEVELS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels for his requests for South Dakota's water projects contained in the Energy and Water spending bill. Johnson, a member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, worked with Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), the Chairman of the Subcommittee, to target these projects, which also includes funds for the continuing development of renewable fuel sources in South Dakota. 
  The bill, which included $28 million for Lewis and Clark Regional Water System and nearly $31 million for Mni Wiconi Rural Water System, passed the subcommittee today and is expected to pass the full Appropriations Committee on Thursday. Johnson's Chief of Staff, Drey Samuelson, met with Sioux Falls Mayor Dave Munson today to deliver the news in person in Sioux Falls.  
  "These water projects are crucial to the continued economic growth of our state. The Bush Administration has continued to slow down funding, which will only cost the government more money in the long run. By substantially increasing the funding level above and beyond the Administration's budget request for the Lewis and Clark project we have paved the way for significant progress in 2008. I am thankful to Chairman Dorgan for working with me on this request. It was important to get the funding levels as high as possible before the House and Senate go to conference," said Johnson.
  "Senator Johnson and I discussed our priorities for the Upper Midwest as we put this bill together," Senator Dorgan said. "I'm confident that the legislation we approved today will help us move forward in a significant way on energy and water projects in our states and across America."
  The bill includes funding for the following South Dakota water and flood control projects:
   * $4 million for Missouri Riverwildlife habitat and recreation site construction costs; additionally, $3 million for operations and maintenance. The funding will allow for wildlife, recreation, and cultural enhancement and mitigation projects to compensate for flooded lands as a result of the Pick-Sloan Flood Control Act and construction of the Missouri River dams. 
   * $3 million for the Big Sioux River Flood Control Project located in Sioux Falls to improve 100-year flood control protection along the Big Sioux River. 
   * $500,000 for the James River Water Development District Environmental Impact Statement to continue environmental preparation for flood control mitigation projects. 
   * $450,000 for the Watertown Flood Control Feasibility Study located near Watertown. 
   * $100,000 for the Canyon Lake Flood Control and Water Quality Study in Rapid City. Funding will improve the water quality and repair the Canyon Lake Dam and surrounding park facilities. 
   * $100,000 for the Missouri River Restoration Act to develop plans to reduce sedimentation of the Missouri River mainstem dam system. 
  THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING FOR THE FOLLOWING ENERGY PROJECT IN SOUTH DAKOTA:
   * $1 million for the Dakota Gold Research Association to fund new chemical processes for producing ethanol from cellulose material. 
   * $3.5 million for the Sun Grant Initiative regional feedstock partnership at South Dakota State University to continue Department of Energy biomass research and development. 
  ADDITIONALLY, THE BILL HAS FUNDING FOR THE FOLLOWING NATIONAL PROJECTS WHICH WOULD AFFECT SOUTH DAKOTA:
   * $244 million for Biomass and Biorefinery Research and Development. These funds are dedicated toward fulfilling the Biofuels Initiative and reducing U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years by increasing the amount of renewable fuels. 
   * $240 million for Weatherization Assistance. The program provides grants to states and community organizations for technical assistance and cost share programs that increase the energy efficiency in residential buildings. 
   * $57.5 million for Wind Energy Research and Development. Funds will improve the development and wind energy systems that can operate at low speeds and bring down commercial costs to increase wind energy deployment in the United States. 
   * $5 million for the Renewable Energy Production Incentive for grants to electric cooperatives and public power utilities for the construction of renewable energy projects.
