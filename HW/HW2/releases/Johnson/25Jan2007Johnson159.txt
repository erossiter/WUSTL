SEN. JOHNSON CONTINUES TO MAKE ENCOURAGING, STEADY PROGRESS IN HIS RECOVERY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) continues to make encouraging and steady progress in his recovery at the in-patient rehabilitation unit at the George Washington University Hospital.  
   "Senator Johnson is showing evidence of more functional, spontaneous speech and is indicating preferences. He is answering questions and following commands appropriately," said Philip Marion, MD, Medical Director for the Department of Rehabilitative Medicine. 
   This week, his speech therapist, Jen Speer, was discussing the names of his family members and Senator Johnson offered up the name of his youngest grandson, Cooper, when she couldn't recall it. He is watching movies with his family and requested to have his television set to CNN during the day. Johnson is also following the Colts progress in the NFL playoffs and rooting for South Dakota native, Adam Vinatieri. 
   "This has been an exciting week filled with progress. Tim is following the news closely and was honored that the President remembered him," said Barbara Johnson, wife of Senator Johnson. "His family remains his primary concern, and he even reminded his speech therapist when she forgot the name of his youngest grandson."
