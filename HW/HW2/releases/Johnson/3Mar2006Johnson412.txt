SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES NEARLY $900,000 TO LAKOTA FUND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lakota Fund will receive $899,956 for economic development through the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program. 
   "With this grant, the Lakota Fund will be able to further promote economic development on Pine Ridge," said Johnson. "The ICDBG program is an important source of federal assistance to tribes to help them meet their development needs. As a member of both the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight for funding for this vital program."
   The Lakota Fund is dedicated to improving economic opportunities on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation through business loans, technical assistance, and targeted community and business development strategies. According to its mission statement, the Lakota Fund actively promotes the socioeconomic sustainability of the Oglala Lakota Oyate (people) with culturally appropriate strategies.
   ICDBG funding goes toward improvement projects for tribal communities across America. In South Dakota, ICDBG funds have been used to build housing, upgrade water systems, train workers, and educate children, among other things.
   The ICDBG program provides grants to tribal communities to develop viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low and moderate-income persons. This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
