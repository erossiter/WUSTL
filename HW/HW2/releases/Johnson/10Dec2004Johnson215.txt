SEN. JOHNSON SPEAKS WITH NEW ENERGY SECRETARY DESIGNATE BODMAN
  On the same day his nomination was announced by the White House, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Energy Committee, spoke with Dr. Samuel Bodman. Bodman, who was nominated by President George W. Bush, will replace retiring Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham. Sen. Johnson released the following statement:
   First, I would like to thank Secretary Abraham for his service to our nation, and congratulate Dr. Bodman on his nomination. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee, Dr. Bodman and I will likely cross paths quite often. As such, I was pleased to receive a call from him this afternoon.
   During our call, I emphasized the importance of passage of comprehensive energy legislation similar to that which had overwhelming, bipartisan Senate support last year. With one of every three rows of corn in South Dakota going towards ethanol production, I also emphasized that any energy bill should contain an RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard) and encourage ethanol, bio-diesel and wind energy production. 
   I will work with my colleagues on the Energy Committee so that Dr. Bodman's nomination will be dealt with expeditiously, and hope that an energy bill is placed at the top of the Committee's agenda. 
   I look forward to working with Dr. Bodman and his staff, and hearing more from him as the nomination process moves forward. 
   Dr. Bodman has most recently served as Deputy Secretary of Treasury since February, 2004. Prior to that, he had served as Deputy Secretary at the Commerce Department since 2001.
