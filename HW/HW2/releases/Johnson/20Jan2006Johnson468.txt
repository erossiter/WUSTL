SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS FDIC'S EFFORTS TO HOLD HEARING ON WAL-MART BANK APPLICATION
  In response to his request last month, Sen.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) received word that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expects to hold a public hearing on the Wal-Mart Bank application for deposit insurance as part of its application for a Utah ILC charter. Last month, Johnson requested that the FDIC hold an open hearing to allow the public to better air their views as part of the process.
   "There is a growing sentiment in the financial services industry that the Wal-Mart application presents unique concerns and serious public policy issues that should be fully aired before the FDIC acts and renders its decision. I appreciate the FDIC's due diligence on this matter and hope they are able to set a date soon to allow this to be fully vetted in the public eye," Johnson said. "This is an important first step."
   In a letter, Acting Chairman Martin Gruenberg states, "I expect that any final determination on this application will be made by the Board of Directors and will not be acted on by the Board without the benefit of a public hearing."
   The application has potentially far-reaching implications. Generally, commercial companies may not own banks in the U.S. The application presents critical issues such as mixing banking and commerce, conflicts of interest, and risk to the federal deposit insurance funds.
   Johnson is a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee.
