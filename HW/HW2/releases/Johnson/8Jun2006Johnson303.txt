SEN. JOHNSON REACTS TO DEATH OF TERRORIST AL-ZARQAWI
  Sen. Tim Johnson released the following remarks on the death of Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi: 
   "I think this is a real victory in our war against terror. Zarqawi was a bad guy. He really is the personification of evil in that part of the world. So I think this is a success, and I applaud our military in their success with this strike.
   "On the other hand, I think we also need to be realistic about this?That his death does not mean the end of the insurgency. In fact, if anything the insurgency could be even more aggressive as those violent terrorists respond to this incident.
   "But I think that it does take away a major strategist on the part of those who are trying to impose terror on the world. While it isn't going to change everything overnight, it is certainly a very successful circumstance for the United States and for peace loving people everywhere."
