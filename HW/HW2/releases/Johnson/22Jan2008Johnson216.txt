RAPID CITY STUDENT SELECTED FOR SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that John Wilson of Rapid City has been selected to take part in the 46th Annual United States Senate Youth Program. Wilson is one of two South Dakota students selected for the Washington, D.C. program, which drew hundreds of applicants from across the state. 
  "Each year two outstanding high school students from the state are chosen to take part in this merit-based program," Johnson said. "John has demonstrated outstanding academic ability and has a strong commitment to improving his community. I am sure that he will make South Dakota proud." 
  Wilson attends St. Thomas More High School where he serves as the President of the Student Council. He serves as the Chair of Youth Council, is a member of South Dakota Voices for Children and volunteers at a retirement home in Rapid City. He plans to attend college and study pre-med or political science.
  Once a year two students from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are selected to participate in the Senate Youth Program. Each student delegate is awarded a $5,000 college scholarship for their pursuit of undergraduate studies and is encouraged to continue coursework in government, history and public affairs. The program teaches students the American political process and gives them an understanding of the important decisions made in Congress.
  The Senate Youth Program begins March 1, 2008 and runs through March 8, 2008 in Washington, D.C.
