SEN. JOHNSON: IF YOU CHEAT GOVERNMENT, YOU DON'T DESERVE FUTURE CONTRACTS
  In an effort to bring honesty and accountability back to the federal contract system, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined colleagues today to introduce the Reconstruction Accountability and Anti-Fraud Act. The bill would ensure that future federal reconstruction dollars to rebuild Iraq and the Katrina-ravaged Gulf Coast are not used to reward companies with histories of cheating American taxpayers. 
   "If you've cheated the American tax payer, you don't deserve more of their money. It's just that simple. We need to prevent companies from abusing the system and not reward those that already have," Johnson said. "The money going to the Gulf Coast and Iraq is desperately needed to rebuild those regions and help victims get back on their feet. We need honesty and transparency - not profiteering."
   Specifically, the legislation would promote accountability and help prevent fraud by barring contractors from receiving further federal contracts related to Iraq or Gulf Coast reconstruction if, at any time over the past five years, they have:
   (1) Over-billed the federal government by at least $10 million;
   (2) Defrauded the government of at least $10 million; or 
   (3) Been suspended or debarred.
   The bill would give the President the ability to waive this restriction in the interest of national security, if he provides notification to Congress. 
   The lead sponsor of the legislation is Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL).
