  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced a $4,375,986 federal grant for South Dakota State University's (SDSU) Sun Grant Research Center. The funding will be provided by the Department of Energy's Regional Biomass Energy Feedstock Partnership to conduct bio-based renewable energy research at SDSU's Sun Grant Center. 
   "We need renewable energy policies that will have a positive impact on our energy security, and create new markets in South Dakota," said Johnson. "This funding will allow SDSU to continue to lead the way in developing bio-based energy technologies."

  The Sun Grant Initiative received a total of $8.8 million for bio-based research in the comprehensive 2005 highway bill. Additionally, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Johnson has secured a total of $3.1 million from 2002 through 2006 for the Sun Grant Initiative, and the Senate's version of the FY08 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill includes an additional $3.5 million for FY08.
