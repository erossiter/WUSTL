SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $52,000 TO NORTHEAST COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Northeast Council of Governments (NECOG) in Aberdeen will receive a $52,000 federal grant from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to continue supporting long-term economic development planning in the region. 
   "This funding marks an important federal investment in local communities," Johnson said. "The Northeast Council of Governments plays an important role in community and economic development projects throughout the region, making South Dakota an even better place to live and work. I applaud their efforts and will continue to work at the federal level to make sure that resources are available for economic development in South Dakota."
   Johnson has continually supported the EDA and economic development in South Dakota as a member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees. Last year, Johnson joined with colleagues to successfully oppose the President's proposal to eliminate EDA. He also worked to resolve problems with a set of new operating rules that would have prevented NECOG and similar organizations around the state from continuing to provide its services to South Dakota communities.
   The Economic Development Administration, which is a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was established in the 1960s to generate jobs, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas of the United States. EDA assistance is available to rural and urban areas of the nation experiencing high unemployment, low income, or other severe economic distress.
