SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SISSETON-WAHPETON HOUSING AUTHORITY TO RECEIVE $100,000 GRANT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Sisseton-Wahpeton Housing Authority will receive $100,000 from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). This grant will assist organizations and Indian Tribes in providing assistance in recruitment, screening, loan packaging to low-income Native American families.  
   "Homeownership is the cornerstone of the American dream," said Johnson. "I am glad Sisseton-Wahpeton Housing Authority is receiving this funding. With this program, families will be able to get the safe, affordable housing they need. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind investment."
   USDA Rural Development provides programs that increase economic opportunity and improve quality of life of rural residents'. This program will assist 32 low-income Native American families over the course of two years in obtaining loans to repair their homes. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
