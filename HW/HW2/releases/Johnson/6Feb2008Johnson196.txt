SEN. JOHNSON: VERASUN FINDS HOME IN SIOUX FALLS
  Earlier today, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) spoke with Don Endres, VeraSun Chairman and CEO, regarding the news that VeraSun and US BioEnergy have agreed to locate the newly-combined company headquarters in South Dakota. Johnson released the following statement in response to the good news: 
   This is great news for our state and further demonstrates that South Dakota is the epicenter for renewable fuel production in the United States. 
   Last week, I called Mr. Endres and Gordon Ommen, US BioEnergy President and CEO, encouraging the new company to keep a significant presence in South Dakota instead of moving the corporate offices out of state. As home to the two largest ethanol companies in the United States, South Dakota has industry leaders and senior officers already in place to contribute to the success of the new company. I am glad the combined company realized these advantages. 
   In 2008, South Dakota will produce nearly 1 billion gallons of ethanol and the ethanol industry will continue to create hundreds of millions of dollars in new wealth in our state every year. 
   I have often said that South Dakota is a wonderful place to live, but it hasn't always been the easiest place to make a living. Fortunately, thanks to the work of oustanding companies like VeraSun, as well as a great deal of cooperation among the congressional delegation and state and local leaders in South Dakota, we are building a stronger economy in our state. As Congress works on a stimulus package to reverse a national economic slowdown, it is encouraging to see the strength of South Dakota companies like VeraSun and others, who are building our reputation as a leader in renewable fuels, wind energy, and other growing industries.
