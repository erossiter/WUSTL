SPINK COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Spink County as his March 2006 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted on a special section of his website. 
   "Spink County has much to offer," Johnson said. "From helping secure funds to promote economic development to protecting Spink County's natural beauty, I am always proud to help the people of Spink County."
   Spink County, located in northeast South Dakota, was founded in 1879 and named after Solomon L. Spink, the Delegate to Congress and a Territorial Secretary of State. Spink County is an immensely popular destination for outdoor activities, especially pheasant hunting. Tim will be visiting Spink County later this month to discuss economic development with local officials.
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson.
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are great places to live. Spink County has a rich history and friendly people that make it a wonderful place to visit or live."
