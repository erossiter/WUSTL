SEN. JOHNSON'S DOCTOR: HE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME HIS DUTIES
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) attending physician at National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) said the Senator is doing well and will be able to fully resume his duties as a Senator.  
  The attending physician at NRH, Dr. Michael Yochelson, Director of Brain Injury Programs, said, "In my discussions with Senator Johnson, I am very well aware that he is interested in continuing his work as a Senator and I am confident that he will be able to resume his duties. During my last visit with him last week, he demonstrated physical improvement in his ability to walk across the room himself. I could also see continued improvement in his speech as it has become more fluid. With his improving language skills, the Senator is able to express himself more clearly, which allows us to recognize the fact that he is doing well cognitively. He is reading the paper daily and talking with friends, family and colleagues. His memory and processing skills are strong."
  Johnson also had a follow up visit last week with the neurosurgeon who performed the December 13, 2006 surgery, Vivek Deshmukh, MD. Dr. Deshmukh said he was pleased with Senator Johnson's progress and that the Senator's most recent MRI indicates continued healing.
  Johnson remains in therapy five days a week several hours every day. Johnson is working from home and says he's focused on getting back.
  Johnson left George Washington University Hospital in mid-February to work more intensively on his rehabilitation at NRH. He suffered from an intracerebral bleed caused by an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) on December 13, 2006. According to their website, National Rehabilitation Hospital consistently ranks among "America's Best Hospitals," as reported by U.S. News & World Report.
