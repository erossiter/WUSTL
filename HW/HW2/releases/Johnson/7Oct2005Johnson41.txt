DEFENSE FUNDING BILL PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced funding levels in the Defense spending bill for 2006. The legislation passed the full Senate unanimously and now to negotiations with the House of Representatives. There is over $40.5 million in the bill for South Dakota related projects.  
   "It was necessary to pass this bill as soon as possible to make sure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need as they serve our country. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was able to use my position to secure funding for a number of programs important to South Dakota, including funds for critical upgrades to the B-1 fleet. The B-1 is the workhorse of our Air Force and has proven its worth time and time again," Johnson said. 
   The bill included an additional $5 million to be allocated toward secure communications for the B-1B bomber. The funding will start the process of replacing old communications equipment and providing Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant satellite data access, via the ARC-210 radio, to the B-1. This will allow B-1 crews to maintain voice contact with ground troops and provide secure voice communication for emerging target information. 
   The overall bill provides $440.2 billion in new discretionary spending authority, including $50 billion for contingency operations related to the Global War on Terror. Below are South Dakota specific projects including $16 million in projects which utilize the specific technology of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. 
   Below is a list of several of the South Dakota-specific, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T), and SDSU Projects: 
   * SDSM&T, Strategic Defense Systems Manufacturing Technology - $3million 
   * SDSM&T, Nano-Reinforced Structures and Advanced Multi-Functional Structures for Space Program - $4 million 
   * SDSM&T, Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology for Ammunition - $3 million 
   * SDSM&T, Future Affordable Multi-Utility (FAMU) Materials for the Army Future Combat Systems - $4 million 
   * SDSM&T, Next Generation Joining Technology Research Initiative - $2 million 
   * RPM & Associates, Inc., Rapid City, Transition Laser Engineered Shaping (LENS) Technology - $1 million 
   * Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Advanced Electronics Rosebud Integration Center (AERIC) - $3 million 
   * SDSU/Batcheller Consulting Group, Fatigue Odometer for Vehicle Components and Gun Barrels Project - $4 million
