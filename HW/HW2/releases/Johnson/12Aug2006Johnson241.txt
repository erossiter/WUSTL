SEN. JOHNSON ATTENDS MID-DAKOTA RURAL WATER SYSTEM CEREMONY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today attended the Mid-Dakota Rural Water System (MDRWS) ceremony. The project was authorized in 1992 and is finally being realized. The federal financial contribution is $145 million in federal appropriations, including a $2.756 million federal wetland component. Johnson also gave a Congressional Record statement in honor of Miller's 125th anniversary. 
   "As South Dakota copes with the effects of a severe drought, the significant and reliable capacity of Miller's treatment plant and distribution system is vital," Johnson said. "I'm glad to be here to celebrate this great achievement."
   The MDRWS project provides dependable and high-quality water to over 30,000 South Dakotans. Others in attendance will include Mayor Tom McGough; Kurt Pfeifle, the General Manager of MDRWS; Governor Mike Rounds; and current and past board members.
