SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES $3.9 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR WEB WATER
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the WEB Water Development Association, Inc. in Brown County will receive a low-interest federal loan of $3,900,000 for expansion and renovations. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   The funding will be used to fund the second phase of a two-part water treatment plant expansion. The expansion will allow the facility to meet increasing demands, boosting its capacity by an additional 8 million gallons a day. The association serves 7,740 rural hookups and 104 towns and bulk use customers in parts of 14 counties in Northeastern South Dakota, including water service to five ethanol plants and two electrical peaking plants. 
   "Proper water infrastructure is crucial for our communities," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding for WEB Water is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
