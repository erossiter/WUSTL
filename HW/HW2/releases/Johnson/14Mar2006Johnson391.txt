SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $40,000 FOR NEW AMBULANCE IN CHARLES MIX
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Wager/Lake Andes Ambulance District will receive a $40,000 grant to purchase a new ambulance. 
   "Emergency responders play an invaluable role in the communities they serve," Johnson said. "In rural areas, emergency responders and law enforcement officials must cover vast areas. It is essential that officials have the vehicles needed to access the entire community in the event of an emergency. I will continue to support federal programs that help keep our rural communities safe."
   Their funds come from Community Facility Grants program operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development.
