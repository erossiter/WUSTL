SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $245,516 TO CLARK FOR HEALTH CARE FACILITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the City of Clark will receive $245,516 for the construction of the new medical clinic.  
 Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was able to secure this funding for Clark in the 2005 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Bill. 
   "This new medical clinic will expand the health services available to the people of Clark County," Johnson said. "The clinic will provide new services including optometry, orthopedics and podiatry, and also provide space to accommodate dental, chiropractic, and physical therapy practitioners. People everywhere deserve access to high-quality health care." 
   The new facility would be able to serve the growing number of patients visiting the clinic each year, as well as remedy problems of inadequate space and accommodations. Despite an increased need for expanded medical services in the area, space limitations prohibited growth. The new clinic would provide the much-needed facility space, allowing Clark to ensure the stability of medical services and also attract new practitioners. 
   "I was proud to work with local officials to help secure federal funding to assist with construction costs of the clinic. Enhancing rural health care has always been an important priority for me," Johnson concluded, a member of the Rural Health Care Caucus. 
   Earmarks, like this one, are secured by members of Congress, enabling them to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member of Congress' ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
