SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY TO RECEIVE $213,000 TO STUDY CANCER
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota State University (SDSU) received $213,000 to study cancer with the hope of developing new ways to treat the disease.  
   "I'm glad that SDSU received this funding, which demonstrates South Dakota's position on the forefront of medical research," Johnson said. "The potential is that this research may result in a new treatment for cancer that could benefit not only many South Dakotans but also many Americans. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   The funding for this grant comes from the National Cancer Institute under its Cancer Treatment Research program. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
