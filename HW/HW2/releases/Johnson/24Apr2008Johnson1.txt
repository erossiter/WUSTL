SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $1.2 MILLION IN FUNDING TO LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAM
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $1,255,450 in federal funding to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Head Start program in Eagle Butte. The grant will be used to help coordinate early childhood educational opportunities for area children. 
   "This program is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel and Head Start builds a strong educational foundation. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering elementary school. The programs provide comprehensive educational, nutrition and health services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents.
   The grant is awarded by the Department of Health & Human Services.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
