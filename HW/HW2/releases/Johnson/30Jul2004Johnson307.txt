SOUTH DAKOTA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION CALLS FOR RESTORATION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVE
  Members of Congress from South Dakota and North Dakota joined together in calling upon the Bush Administration to fill the vacant position of "economic development representative" (EDR) responsible for serving their two states. The individual in this position helps local governments and community organizations in economically distressed areas of South Dakota and North Dakota compete for federal grants from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA). The Bush Administration recently revealed it does not intend to replace the previous EDR, who served both South Dakota and North Dakota, but resigned earlier this month.  
   Senator Tom Daschle, Senator Tim Johnson, and Representative Stephanie Herseth, who were joined by their colleagues from North Dakota in signing the letter, said the EDA has provided millions of dollars to South Dakota communities in need of economic assistance. 
   For example, in 2004 the City of Yankton received $350,000 for relocation of an existing road to facilitate industrial expansion. In 2003, EDA provided $251,100 to help Lead overcome the closure of the Homestake Gold Mine and $780,000 to help Lake Norden build a new water supply system needed to accommodate a new cheese plant.
   In their letter to Secretary of Commerce Don Evans, the members of Congress warned that the elimination of the South Dakota/North Dakota EDR position could jeopardize communities' ability to continue to access this federal funding. 
   "EDRs act as the EDA's local eyes and ears. Among other responsibilities, EDRs are charged with informing local leaders about resources offered by the EDA, identifying worthwhile investment opportunities, and providing analysis of grant applications based on knowledge of local economic conditions and needs," they wrote.
   The members of Congress also said that failure to replace the EDR would put South Dakota and North Dakota at a disadvantage, especially since many other states have EDRs dedicated solely to their needs. Under the EDA's plan, South Dakota would be served by an individual already serving two states, Colorado and Utah. 
   "Relative to the many fortunate states served by their own EDRs, South Dakota and North Dakota have long suffered the disadvantage of sharing an EDR. We are alarmed that your Department has chosen to exacerbate this inequity by failing to hire a qualified individual to replace the recently departed EDR responsible for serving our states," the members of Congress wrote. "This further stretches the limited resources available to these existing EDRs, and diminishes their ability to provide adequate service to any of the states under their responsibility. As a result, some communities that would otherwise have benefited from EDA's assistance will instead continue to struggle."
