MINNEHAHA COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Minnehaha County as his April 2008 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website at http://johnson.senate.gov. 
   "Although Sioux Falls may be the largest city in the county, our smaller communities truly add to the beauty and diversity of our state," Johnson said. "No matter the size, I am proud to have helped the county on many issues, from improving the Hartford Fire and Rescue to funding crucial infrastructure investments like the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System."
   Minnehaha County was founded in 1862 and is home to the City of Sioux Falls and the towns of Dell Rapids, Baltic, Hartford, Humbold, Brandon, Corson and Garretson. It is the most populated county in the state.
   Johnson is a strong advocate of economic development programs that help our communities grow. He was proud to announce funding for Minnehaha County ranging from the Hartford Fire and Rescue and the Baltic Fire Department to federal funding for the improvement of the South Dakota Air National Guard base.
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," Johnson said. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places."
