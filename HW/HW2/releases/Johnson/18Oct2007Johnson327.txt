SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON HOUSE FAILURE TO OVERRIDE CHIP VETO
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement regarding the House of Representatives failed vote to override President Bush's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization: 
   I am deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives failed to override the President's veto of the bipartisan legislation to reauthorize CHIP.
   The failure of the Congress and the President to make this bill law is even more disappointing given that the CHIP legislation would not have added to the debt. At a time when we are adding $10 billion in debt each month to pay for the war, our nation should be able to afford $7 billion each year to provide the poorest of our children with health insurance.
   In an average month, 11,000 children in South Dakota are enrolled in CHIP. Another 18,000 South Dakota children are uninsured with as many as 12,000 of them eligible for CHIP but unable to access the program because of a lack of funds. These children do not represent wasteful spending.
   We must now work to craft another bipartisan bill to provide health insurance to children eligible for CHIP. Our children's health is too important to jeopardize by failing to reauthorize this effective program.
