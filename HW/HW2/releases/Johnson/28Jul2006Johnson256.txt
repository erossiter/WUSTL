SEN. JOHNSON TO ATTEND AIR FORCE ACADEMY BOARD OF VISITORS MEETING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will attend a quarterly Board of Visitors meeting today at the United States Air Force Academy. Johnson, a member of the prestigious Board of Visitors since February, will be briefed by Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and Vice Chief of Staff General John Corley. A wide range of topics will be discussed including manpower and budget issues facing the academy. Johnson will receive flight briefings and will spend time meeting with Air Force Academy cadets to get their input on issues facing today's Air Force.  
   "The Air Force Academy is one of our nation's finest service academies and institutions of higher learning," said Johnson. "I am honored to be a part of this event."
   Under its statutory charter, board members meet to review, the morale, discipline, and social climate, the curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters relating to the Academy.
   The Board meets four times annually and within 60 days after its annual and semi-annual meetings, the Board submits a written report of its actions, views, and recommendations of the Academy.
