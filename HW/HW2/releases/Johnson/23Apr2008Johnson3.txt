SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SISSETON WAHPETON OYATE TO RECEIVE FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL WATER SOURCE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate will receive a $450,000 federal grant to improve the current wastewater system and construct a new lagoon. The funding is provided through the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal Grant Program. 
   "Proper water infrastructure is crucial for our communities to continue to grow and this funding will greatly benefit the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate," said Johnson. "One of the pillars of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   The funding will be used to construct water distribution lines, update the current sewer lines and to build a new lagoon. The existing housing units along with 54 new units will be served by these upgrades.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
