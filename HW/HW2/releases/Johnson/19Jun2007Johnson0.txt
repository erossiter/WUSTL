APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PASSES INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee passed the Interior Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2008, which contains $27.202 billion for forest, wildlife, and public lands programs that benefit South Dakota annually. This spending level is an increase of $1.5 billion over the President's request. Johnson, a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, secured $4.4 million in projects for South Dakota that are included in the bill. Johnson said the bill is expected to pass the full Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday, and will then move to the full Senate for consideration.
  "Thousands of South Dakotans are affected by this funding, from delivery of health care to social services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services," said Johnson. "I am glad to see the Interior Appropriations Bill also includes critical funding to enhance the stewardship and use of public lands within our state. I appreciate that Subcommittee Chairwoman Feinstein (D-CA) included the funding needed for so many of my priorities for this bill."  
  "The work done at EROS Data Center means both cutting edge technology benefits for our nation and jobs for South Dakotans, which is why EROS should see solid funding to carry out their work," continued Johnson. "Further, after the Bush administration proposed to cut the Johnson-O'Malley funds again, I fought to ensure that funding was included to improve education for Indian children through this program."
