SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $97,500 IN FUNDING FOR LOW-INCOME TAX CLINICS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that two low-income tax clinics (LITC), Rural Alliance, Inc. and Technology for Rural Enhancement of Communities, will receive a combined total of $97,500 in funding for educating low-income taxpayers.  
 During the appropriations process, Johnson supported the program set-up by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
   "I am pleased to have helped secure funding for these two resourceful clinics," said Johnson. "These two organizations provide a worthy service for low-income families and for people who are new to the United States tax system."
   Rural Alliance, Inc. and Technology for Rural Enhancement of Communities educate low-income persons on tax rights and responsibilities, represent taxpayers involved with tax-disputes with the IRS, and also work with taxpayers for whom English is a second language or who have limited English skills. Both organizations are directed out of Nisland, S.D., near Belle Fourche. 
   Services will be available for the 2005 tax season. For other tax questions, the IRS has set up Volunteer Information Tax Centers (VITA) across South Dakota to answer questions about filing taxes for this year. There are also centers that specifically counsel the elderly on their taxes. For more information about these centers and where they are located please visit, http://johnson.senate.gov/vita.html. 
   Funding for the grant comes from the IRS.
