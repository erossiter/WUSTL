SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO REDUCE GANG VIOLENCE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Northeast Council of Governments in Aberdeen will receive a $104,870 federal grant from the Department of Justice to reduce gang violence through education and training. 
  "We must do all we can do help end the violence that plagues rural communities," Johnson said. "This funding is a step in the right direction, and will provide the Northeast Council of Governments with the resources necessary to provide education and training opportunities to curb gang violence."
  The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. The Northeast Council on Governments serves as the fiscal agent for the Judicial District of South Dakota's Anti-Gang Initiative and will focus prosecuting outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMG) involved in criminal activity. Additionally, the funding provides training to law enforcement officers throughout the state. 
  The program will cover 12 counties in northeast South Dakota: Beadle, Brown, Campbell, Day, Edmunds, Faulk, Hand, Marshall, McPherson, Potter, Spink, and Walworth.
