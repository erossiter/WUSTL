SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON FDIC MORATORIUM, AFFECTS ON WAL-MART BANK
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) learned today that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has issued a moratorium on industrial loan company (ILC) applications for the next 6 months. This means that for the time being, pending applications by Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and others will not be approved. Johnson issued the following statement reacting to the FDIC's moratorium announcement: 
   "I am pleased that the Board of Directors of the FDIC has voted to place a six-month moratorium on applications for deposit insurance by industrial loan companies (ILCs). The FDIC is to be commended for taking this prudential approach. During this moratorium, it is critical that both Congress and the FDIC take the time to continue to closely examine this emerging issue and the overall supervisory and regulatory implications of commercial companies owning these charters. It is also my hope that the Senate Banking Committee will hold hearings as our colleagues in the House of Representatives have."
   Johnson has raised questions about Wal-Mart's application for an ILC due to concerns that it would mix banking and commerce, causing potential risks to the deposit insurance fund, and possibly threatening the nation's payments system. In March, Johnson called on the FDIC to look objectively at the risk weighting for ILCs as it moves through the rule-making process for the recently enacted deposit insurance reform legislation. Johnson was a leading advocate for that reform as it moved through Congress.
