SEN. JOHNSON CALLS ON COLLEAGUES TO RESTORE URBAN INDIAN HEALTH PROGRAM FUNDING
  Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) is calling for funding to be restored to the Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHPs). The President's 2007 budget request proposes to eliminate funding for the urban Indian non-profit organizations providing health care services at 41 sites across the country, including clinics in Aberdeen, Pierre, and Sioux Falls. 
   "The Urban Indian Health Program provides culturally appropriate care that focuses on the health risks that disproportionately affect the Native American population," Johnson said. "The ill-advised proposal to eliminate UIHP ignores the federal government's responsibility to Native Americans and would further disadvantage an already underserved population. Through my seats on the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees, I will continue to fight to restore this important funding."
   Johnson joined with 15 bipartisan colleagues in writing a letter to the leadership of the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the Interior to request that the funding be restored. The senators asked that the funding level be reinstituted at the 2006 level of $32.7 million. In 2006, South Dakota received more than $700,000 through this program.
   "Without access to affordable and accountable health care centers, we fear that many urban Indian families will go without the services the federal government has been tasked with providing them. It is irresponsible to deny health care access to such a large and underserved population," the Senators wrote.
   According to the 2000 census, 64.1 percent of the native population lives outside tribal areas, many in urban locales.
