SEN. JOHNSON MEETS WITH SOUTH DAKOTA'S NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED PRINCIPAL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today met with Mrs. Ruth Claeys of Box Elder, South Dakota to congratulate her on being selected as the South Dakota National Distinguished Principal for her work at Badger Clark Elementary School. Claeys was recommended for the award by a fellow co-worker and is the first winner from the Douglas School District. 
   "Principals are dedicated public servants who rarely receive the recognition they deserve. Ruth Claeys has committed her professional life to educational excellence, which is truly something to be commended," said Johnson. "I congratulate her on this distinguished honor."
   Award winners are chosen from a pool of statewide nominees. The honorees are chosen for their outstanding contributions to the well-being of the educational community and for assuming an active role in the academic and social needs of all students.
   The National Distinguished Principals Program was established in 1984 to honor one exemplary elementary and middle school principal from each state every year who set the pace, character, and quality of the education children receive during their early school years. The program is sponsored by the National Association of Elementary School Principals in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education.
