SEN. JOHNSON CONGRATULATES DONALD POWELL ON APPOINTMENT TO OVERSEE GULF COAST REGION'S RECOVERY
  Today, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) congratulated FDIC Chairman Donald Powell on his new appointment to oversee the federal disaster recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast Region. As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, Johnson has worked with Chairman Powell on Federal Deposit Insurance Reform and other banking issues. 
   "I want to congratulate FDIC Chairman Donald Powell on his appointment today by President Bush to head up the federal disaster recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast Region. Chairman Powell has served the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation since August of 2001 with the utmost integrity and has demonstrated his commitment to addressing the many issues facing the financial services industry. 
   "Chairman Powell proved to be a very accessible and thoughtful leader of the FDIC. As a former community banker, he brought a unique perspective and appreciation for local community issues and needs. Besides nearly 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, he has made notable contributions to his community ranging from service on the City of Amarillo Housing Board, to Chairman of the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce, to service on boards of hospitals. I feel confident this experience will serve him well in his new post and that he will bring much to the hurricane recovery efforts.
   "Finally, I thank Chairman Powell for his leadership on the issue of Federal Deposit Insurance Reform. He has long recognized the importance of reform, and it has been a pleasure working with him and his talented team at the FDIC.
   "I have called for a central person to be in charge of the recovery efforts in the Gulf Region. I wish Donald Powell the best of luck, hope he has the authority to rebuild the region, and can stop any reported waste and corruption."
