SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $750,000 FOR CANGLESKA, TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Cangleska, Inc. will receive a $750,000 federal grant to decrease violent crime in the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and strengthen the tribe's authority to prosecute violent offenders. The funding comes through the Department of Justice's Reduce Violence Against Women Grants to Tribal Governments Program. 
   "This funding will create more resources for Oglala Sioux women who may be experiencing domestic violence. Cangleska's efforts on the Pine Ridge Reservation and around Rapid City have already offered a safe place for women, it is my hope this funding will continue that work and expand the help available to victims of domestic violence." Johnson said. "My office and I have worked with the tribe to find funding for this project, and I will continue to work as an appropriator to defend funding for effective programs to reduce violence against women." 
   Cangleska, Inc. is a non-profit organization chartered by the Oglala Sioux Tribe to offer services to women who are victims of violent crime, including a shelter on the Pine Ridge Reservation and another shelter in Rapid City. The group created the Stronghold Civil Legal Services Project for women in Indian Coutnry to have access to sound legal advice. The goals of Cangleska, Inc. include working to prevent incidences of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and to expand services in their tribal community to respond to violence and offer culturally appropriate intervention services.
