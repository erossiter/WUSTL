SEN. JOHNSON FIGHTS FOR SAFE CATTLE IMPORTS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined with Senator Dorgan (D-ND) and others to support a Resolution of Disapproval to object to USDA's over thirty months (OTM) rule, which would allow for the importation of all live Canadian cattle born after March 1, 1999, including beef, beef products, and beef byproducts from older cattle. The rule is scheduled to take effect on November 19, 2007 and the resolution was introduced today. 
  "The United States Department of Agriculture continues to pay closer attention to the needs of big business and the packing industry than to the needs of our own U.S. producers," said Johnson. "I will continue to push for the implementation of my mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) law, which would ensure consumers have a choice in the grocery store aisle."
  Currently, only cattle under 30 months of age are allowed to be imported from Canada. Younger animals are considered to be a lower risk of carrying BSE. Since the beginning of last year, five of the seven cases of BSE discovered in Canada were found in animals born after March 1, 1999, the date set forth by USDA in its proposed OTM rule.
  Johnson has long fought to ensure the safety of imported cattle and beef. In 2005 he opposed efforts by the USDA to prematurely reopen the Canadian border to live cattle and beef products after multiple cases of BSE were discovered in the country. In September, Johnson sent a letter with 30 of his collogues to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA) urging him to include legislation in the upcoming farm bill that would implement mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL).
