SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES DESIGNATION OF SEPTEMBER AS 'LIFE INSURANCE AWARENESS MONTH'
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) in sponsoring a Senate Resolution to designate September 2005 as "Life Insurance Awareness Month."  
   "In a time of loss, a life insurance policy can help prevent having to sell the family home, pulling the kids out of college, or even, in some cases, having enough money to put food on the table," Johnson said. "As the country pulls together in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I encourage all Americans to educate themselves on the importance of life insurance, and develop financial contingencies for unexpected events." 
   Johnson cosponsored this legislation, S. Con. Res. 19, in order to promote the value of life insurance and raise consumer awareness of the important role that life insurance can play in helping families plan their financial futures.
