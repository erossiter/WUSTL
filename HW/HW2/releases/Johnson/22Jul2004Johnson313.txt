SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon release of the final report for the Commission investigating the September 11th, 2001 attacks on the United States: 
   "The report released today by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States is a thorough, bipartisan investigation of the September 11th terrorist attacks. I thank the Commissioners for their service. 
   While the report does not assign blame for the attacks, it does demonstrate that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies failed to cooperate effectively and missed several opportunities to stop the hijackers. 
   The Commission has recommended a number of changes to address these deficiencies and to streamline our counterterrorism efforts. It is my hope Congress will carefully examine and act on these proposals to improve our nation's security as soon as possible. 
   There are currently several pieces of homeland security legislation that can, and should be, acted upon by the Senate immediately. These measures include the FY2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill (S.2537), the Transit Security Bill (S. 2453), the Port Security bill (S. 2279), the Rail Security Act (S. 2273), and the Chemical Security Act (S.157). Two weeks ago, after Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge made his latest announcement regarding increased terror threats in the United States, several of these bills were temporarily cleared for debate after months of delays in committees and the Senate floor. Within hours, however, the bills were again held up by Republican objections.
