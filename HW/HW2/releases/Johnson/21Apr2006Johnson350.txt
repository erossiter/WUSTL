SEN. JOHNSON TO TOUR SNOW DAMAGE IN NORTHERN BLACK HILLS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will be in Sturgis, Spearfish and Belle Fourche today and will tour the storm damage in Belle Fourche with local officials. Johnson also spoke with Governor Mike Rounds earlier this morning, and has had staff in communication with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the South Dakota Department of Public Safety. 
   Johnson released the following statement:
   "I have spoken with the Governor to offer any federal support possible at the federal level. Currently, Governor Rounds has declared a state of emergency and reports that FEMA officials expect to view the damage next week. My staff has also been in touch with FEMA and will continue to monitor the progress.
   "I will tour the area later today. Safety and "rapid melt" remains a concern. April in South Dakota can be unpredictable, but with nearly 60 inches of snow in some areas and warm weather expected, this is a situation where we need to keep careful watch."
