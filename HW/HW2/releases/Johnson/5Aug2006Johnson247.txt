SEN. JOHNSON VISITS DROUGHT PLAGUED AREAS NEAR WALL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) visited several areas today, in and around Wall, to observe drought conditions and talk with local producers.  
   "I have listened to producers throughout the state describe the financial hardships they face because of the current drought. They are selling off their herds early and there is no grain for cattle," Johnson said. "To this President, 'less government' continues to mean ignoring the desperate conditions in rural areas, though the circumstances are as devastating as a hurricane and are continually getting worse."
   Much of the state faces conditions rivaling the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. These prolonged conditions have caused significant damage to farms, ranches, and our rural communities, with no end to these circumstances in sight.
   Johnson invited USDA Secretary Mike Johanns to travel to South Dakota and see the damage first-hand, but received no response.
   Johnson has been committed to drought relief, and recognizes the dire circumstances producers face. Due to threat of veto by President Bush, drought aid has repeatedly been denied to producers throughout South Dakota and other extremely dry areas. 
   Johnson also wrote to President George W. Bush urging him to establish a drought relief program that would target those who suffer from actual losses, avoiding the type of waste and abuse that was disclosed with implementation of the 2002 program. Additionally, Johnson is calling on all South Dakotans to write to the President and has started a petition drive on his website.
   As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Johnson worked with his colleagues to attach a comprehensive agriculture disaster relief package to the Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill. This package contains roughly $100 million for producers in state who are suffering from severe drought conditions.
