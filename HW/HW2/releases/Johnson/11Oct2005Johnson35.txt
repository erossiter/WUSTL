SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CHEYENNE RIVER YOUTH PROJECT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Cheyenne River Youth Project will receive two grants, one for $248,000 and another for $120,280, to build a new teen center.  
 Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was able to secure this funding in last year's VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   "By building a new teen center we are giving young people a safe and healthy place to interact with their peers," Johnson said. "The Cheyenne River Youth Project has been working hard for over a decade to improve the lives of youth, and I'm pleased to support their great work." 
   The Cheyenne River Youth Project is a non-profit organization working to improve the lives of children on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. The youth center provides a safe, substance-free environment for youth. The center provides resources for recreational activities as well as a library for studying and reading. 
   The grants will be administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
   Earmarks, like this one, are grants secured by members of Congress, enabling them to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member of Congress' ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, Senator Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
