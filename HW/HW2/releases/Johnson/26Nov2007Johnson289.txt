SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF SEN. LOTT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today issued the following statement in response to the resignation of Senator Trent Lott (R-MS): 
  "I was as surprised as anyone else to hear that Senator Lott is resigning. I've served in both the House and Senate with him and have always found him to be a dedicated public servant who was devoted to serving his constituents. Senator Lott worked very closely with Tom Daschle when they were both the leaders of their parties in the Senate, and both set a great example of how elected officials can work together in a bipartisan fashion for the good of our country. He definitely will be missed."
