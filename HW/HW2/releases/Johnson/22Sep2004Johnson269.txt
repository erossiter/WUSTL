SENS. JOHNSON, DASCHLE ANNOUNCE $223,672 IN FUNDING FOR EAGLE BUTTE RESTORING THE BALANCE PROJECT
  Sens. Tim Johnson and Tom Daschle (both D-SD) announced today that Eagle Butte will be receiving $223,672 in funding for a substance abuse and mental health services program called Restoring the Balance Project.  
   "I am pleased to have helped secure this funding," said Johnson. "It is important that we provide assistance for people addressing their addictions and preventing further addictions. Dispersing this information educates the Eagle Butte community on substance abuse and will benefit the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe." 
   Restoring the Balance Project is a program created in part by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and by Tribal leaders from across the nation. The program comes under the "Circles of Care" program which was created to serve the Native American population on substance abuse and mental health. 
   "The enslaving habits and behaviors associated with substance abuse can destroy families and burden communities," Senator Daschle said. "The funding that Senator Johnson and I secured for Restoring the Balance will help people on Cheyenne River prevent and treat this affliction." 
   SAMHSA is the lead agency responsible for improving the quality and availability of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services in order to reduce illness, death, disability, and cost to society resulting from substance abuse and mental illnesses.
   This grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
