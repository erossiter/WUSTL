SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF BERNARD KERIK AS SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon hearing that President George W. Bush has nominated for New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik to be the next Secretary of Homeland Security: 
   First off, I would like to thank Tom Ridge for his fine service to our nation as the first person to hold the post of Secretary of Homeland Security. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
   Kerik understands firsthand the challenges our nation faces. On September 11, 2001, not only was he New York City's Police Commissioner, but he was at Ground Zero as the buildings fell. He understands the needs of our first responders. It is my hope that he continues to represent them in this new post so that they may protect our nation from emerging threats.
