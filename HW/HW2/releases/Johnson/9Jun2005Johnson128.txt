SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $4.6 MILLION LOAN FOR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced a $4,681,000 loan to a utilities server in Grant and Codington Counties to enhance broadband services in the area. 
   "This loan will improve the quality of life for the residents of Milbank and the surrounding area, by enhancing technology services to the community," said Johnson. "Technology infrastructure is critical to business growth and economic development. Broadband, high-speed data, allows people to connect with the entire world."
   The funding will be used to deploy a Fiber-to-the-Home system in the town of Milbank, as well as provide availability of broadband service, including data, voice and video, available to 2,224 households.
   "With the aid of programs such as the Rural Utilities Service agency within the USDA, our smaller communities continue to thrive. I will continue to support funding for these important programs that serve rural America," Johnson said. 
   SSTelecom, Inc. of Stockholm, SD will receive the loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Utilities Service.
