EXTRA HELP AVAILABLE TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today reminded Medicare recipients and their families about a program available through Social Security, called Extra Help, that may help pay for part of their monthly premiums, annual deductibles and prescription co-payments. Eligible individuals could receive more than $3,300 per year to assist in health care payments. 
   "It is important that we get financial help to those who need it most," Johnson said. "While I remain committed to seeking out and enacting better solutions to the health care crisis at home, I hope people will make use of this program and the resources allocated to it."
   Social Security has an online application available to family members, caregivers, third parties and Medicare recipients who may be eligible. The Application for Help with Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Costs (SSA-1020) can be found online at www.socialsecurity.gov. To obtain an application or apply by phone contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778). 
   For more information on the documents needed to apply and qualify for the Extra Help program, go to Johnson's website at http://johnson.senate.gov.
