GRANT COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Grant County as his May 2006 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted on a special section of his website. 
   "Grant County has much to offer those that live there and those that visit," Johnson said. "From helping promote the Northern Light Ethanol plant, to promoting economic development, to helping efforts to save St. Bernard's Providence Hospital from closing and fighting to prevent meth abuse, I am always proud to work on projects of importance to the people of Grant County."
   Home to the towns of Milbank, Big Stone City, Stockholm, La Bolt, and Revillo, Grant County was founded in 1873. The railroad played a huge role in the history of the county and the towns within it. Grant County is also known for its granite, as it has some of the best granite deposits in the world.
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson.
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are great places to live. Custer County has a rich history and immense natural beauty that make it a wonderful place to visit or live."
