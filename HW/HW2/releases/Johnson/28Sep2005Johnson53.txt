SEN. JOHNSON CALLS FOR HEARINGS ON POTENTIAL FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICE CLOSURES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today called for hearings to be conducted on the United States Department of Agriculture\'s (USDA) consolidation plan for Farm Service Agency (FSA) service centers that could potentially close 14 service centers in South Dakota.  
   Johnson sent a letter today to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture requesting the hearings. In May of this year, Johnson sent a letter to Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns expressing concern about the initial stages of the consolidation plans and urged the department to incorporate producers in the process. 
   \"South Dakota is well served by the 59 South Dakota FSA offices, and I oppose the closure of any of the offices in the state,\" Johnson said. \"Face-to-face communication between service center employees and producers encourages proper Farm Bill implementation and ensures that our farmers have access to important USDA program information and assistance.\" 
   The USDA is currently considering 14 office sites in South Dakota for closure, which represents 24% of the service centers in the state. The USDA recently increased the potential closure number nationwide from 665 proposed sites to 714. 
   \"I find it troublesome that the USDA initiated the process of FSA service center consolidation without public notice or comment. Given the size and scale of potential office consolidation in South Dakota, I am requesting that hearings be conducted on the USDA\'s consolidation plan,\" Johnson concluded.
