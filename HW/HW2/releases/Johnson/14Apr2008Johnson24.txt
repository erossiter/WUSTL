SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE EDUCATION
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the South Dakota Department of Social Services will receive a $251,657 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services' State Health Insurance Assistance Program. The funding will be used to continue the Senior Health Information and Insurance Education (SHIINE), a health insurance counseling program. 
  "The SHIINE program is an invaluable resource to help individuals understand health insurance," said Johnson. "I have strongly supported the work that they have done for the people of South Dakota, and I will continue to fight for this funding. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help South Dakotans." 
  The SHIINE Program provides free health insurance counseling to Medicare recipients and provides people with information about health care plans. This program is federally-funded and administered by the South Dakota Department of Social Services' Adult Service and Aging Program and The Center for Active Generations, in partnership with the South Dakota Division of Insurance and SDSU Cooperative Extension Service.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
