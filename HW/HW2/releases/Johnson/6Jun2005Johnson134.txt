LAWRENCE COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) has selected Lawrence County as his June 2005 "County of the Month."  
 The county is highlighted on a special section of this website. 
   "Located in South Dakota's beautiful Black Hills, Lawrence County boasts a unique and colorful history as well as thriving communities in the present day," Johnson said. "From efforts to transform the Homestake Mine into an underground laboratory to helping Black Hills State University secure federal money to promote programs addressing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, I am proud to work on issues of direct importance to the people of Lawrence County." 
   Lawrence County was founded after the discovery of gold in the Black Hills brought an influx of people to the area. The county claims a number of historic distinctions, with Deadwood becoming the only city in the United States to be named a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and Lead claiming the first kindergarten in the entire American West.
   "Each county offers something wonderful to our state, and each will get the chance to be featured in this section of my website," continued Johnson. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are great places to live. From family farms to various small family businesses, Lawrence County has a lot to be proud of."
