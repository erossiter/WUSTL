SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR RED CLOUD INDIAN SCHOOL'S AMERICORPS PROGRAM
  U.S.Senator Tim Johnson (D?SD) announced today that the Teaching the Young People AmeriCorps program at the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge will receive a $197,691 federal grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service. The funding allows 19 AmeriCorps members to receive up to $4,725 to pay for college or qualified student loans. 
  "AmeriCorps volunteers are meeting local needs in Pine Ridge and strengthening that community," Johnson said. "The Corporation for National Service facilitates community service. These programs maintain hundreds of thousands of volunteers and generate millions of hours of service to communities and families throughout the nation."
  AmeriCorps volunteers at the Red Cloud Indian School provide tutoring and mentoring to students in structured after-school and service learning programs. Activities include developing classroom curricula, tutoring at-risk students, assisting students with computer-based reading and math testing software, monitoring standardized test results, and supporting expansion of after-school activities including cultural activities. 
  AmeriCorps supports community volunteer activities, mentors youth, builds affordable housing and helps communities respond to disasters. They serve in hundreds of nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and community and faith-based organizations in rural and urban communities across the nation.
