SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $148,800 FOR OGLALA BIKE PATH
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced the release of $148,800 in funding for the pedestrian and bicycle trail for the Community of Oglala on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  
 The funding was included at Johnson's request in the Transportation Appropriations bill, which passed during the last Congress.
   "The Oglala bike path is an important project that will benefit the community," said Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "This funding will help to construct a path for bikers and walkers. It is important for public safety that walkers have a path and can leave the highway to cars." Senator Johnson became involved in this project after hearing from local community members about deadly accidents involving children along the road. 
   The Oglala pedestrian and bicycle trail will run 3 miles along Highway 18, then 1 mile north to Loneman School in Oglala on the Pine Ridge reservation.
   The $148,800 released today is a portion of the $225,000 included in the final Transportation Appropriations bill, signed into law last December. The remaining funding from that bill will be released in the coming months.
   This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Discretionary Grant program.
