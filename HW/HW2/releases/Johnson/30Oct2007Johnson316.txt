SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S PICK FOR VA SECRETARY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, released the following statement upon receiving news that President George W. Bush has selected Lieutenant General James Peake as his choice to replace Jim Nicholson as Secretary of Veterans Affairs: 
   President Bush has today announced the nomination of Lieutenant General James Peake to become the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Lieutenant General Peake has served our nation honorably as member of the Armed Forces and as the Army Surgeon General. He is a decorated combat veteran, and I look forward to hearing from him during the confirmation process about ways we can address the needs of the veterans of South Dakota and our nation. As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, I hope Lieutenant General Peake, if confirmed, will work with Congress to ensure funding is in place that will provide our nation's veterans with the quality heath care they need and deserve.
