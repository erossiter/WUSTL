SENATE TO CONSIDER FENCE BILL TO IMPROVE BORDER SECURITY
  Today, the U.S. Senate began debate on H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006. The bill calls for a 700 mile fence to improve border security. Sen. Tim Johnson said today he is glad to see the issue considered by the Senate, but wants the leadership to allow amendments to the bill so we can address a comprehensive immigration policy.  
   "This is a good start, but it is not enough to build a fence without addressing immigration policy directly," Johnson said. "We need to work out a fair and comprehensive immigration bill that provides real security for our borders and addresses the 11 million people already in the U.S. illegally."
   The Secure Fence Act of 2006 passed the House last week, and if passed by the Senate, will move to the President for his signature. 
   The Secure Fence Act of 2006 is not as comprehensive as S. 2611, the bipartisan immigration reform bill that the Senate passed in May, which included a fence provision, as well as a guest worker program and a path to citizenship. 
   S. 2611 will establish additional requirements that businesses must take to ensure there are no available American workers before a job can go to a guest worker. It also provides for temporary assistance by the National Guard to beef up the Border Patrol. 
   "In a post 9/11 world it is imperative to the safety and security of our country that we are able to monitor and control who enters from a foreign country. We need a plan that offers real solutions - tough, effective enforcement and smart reforms that will secure our borders, crack down on employers who hire illegally, and bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows," Johnson said. "We still need a comprehensive plan that is realistic, strong and delivers the reforms we need to secure our borders and keep our economy growing."
