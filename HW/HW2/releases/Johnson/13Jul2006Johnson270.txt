SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS FUNDING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced funding levels approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee for the coming year's Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) funding bill. Among the funding Johnson secured is a $500,000 earmark for the creation of the High Plains Center for Product Innovation, Commercialization, and Support (Hi-PICS) at the School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City.  
   "Congress must invest resources in activities proven to help citizens and communities grow, like the ones operated by the Economic Development Administration and the Small Business Administration." Johnson said. "These programs, including the funding earmarked for Hi-PICS, are a great example of the 'investment in the public good' I'm trying to promote as part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan." Among the projects and programs funded in the coming year's CJS appropriations bill:
   * $500,000 for the creation of the High Plains Center for Product Innovation, Commercialization, and Support (Hi-PICS) at the School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City. The center will pair engineering and science students with industry partners to create, develop, and support innovative economic development in South Dakota and the region. 
   * Cracks down on Child Pornography by increasing fines on internet providers who do not report child pornography sites to authorities. The bill also mandates warning labels for sexually explicit websites and creates stiff punishment for people who use deceptive website devices to lure children to explicit websites.
   * The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program would receive $537.6 million. Last year it received $457.4 million. The President had proposed to slash the program's funding to a level of $102 million in his budget proposal.
   * $85 million to State and local law enforcement programs to combat methamphetamine production and distribution, to target drug "hot spots" and to remove and dispose of hazardous materials at clandestine methamphetamine labs. 
   * $55 million for a new national initiative to provide grants to States and local governments to locate, arrest, and prosecute sexual predators. Johnson's efforts to safeguard children from sexual predators include supporting a bill to create a national amber alert system and the bill that created a national sex-offender registration database accessible online.
   * The Economic Development Administration, (EDA), which is within the Department of Commerce, would receive $280.4 million. This is the same last year's enacted funding level. Johnson cheered the program as a crucial way to encourage development in rural America.
   * The National Science Foundation would receive $5.992 billion. This is $411 million above the last year's funding level.
   * The Small Business Administration (SBA) would receive $639 million. This is $188 million more than last year. Johnson mentions the benefits of this program in his Hometown Prosperity Plan.
   The Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill now moves to the full Senate for its consideration, following today's approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
