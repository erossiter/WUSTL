OFFICE OF SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA STUDENT
  The office of Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Brittany Neiles of Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Johnson's Washington, DC office. Neiles graduated from Lincoln High School in 2004 and will receive her degree in History and English Education from the University of South Dakota in May of 2009. 
   "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," Johnson said. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital."
   "I love studying government and our nation's history," said Neiles. "I want to learn how the Senate works and get as much out of this internship as I can." 
   The Washington, DC internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a first-hand opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with Senator Johnson and his staff.
   College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's internship program this summer. College credits or a stipend are available.
