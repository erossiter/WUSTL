SEN. JOHNSON COSPONSORS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT BILL TO FUND EDUCATION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has joined Sens. Harkin (D-IA) and Hagel (R-NE) in co-sponsoring legislation to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the IDEA Full Funding Act, S.1159.  
   "The federal government must finally live up to the promises it made when No Child Left Behind and IDEA were enacted," said Johnson. "State and local education budgets are stretched too thin. In fully funding IDEA, we would give local school districts the chance to use local revenue for priorities like smaller class sizes, increased teacher pay and technology upgrades." 
   The IDEA Full Funding Act would gradually increase the amount of federal funding for IDEA every year for the next eight years to reach 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure by 2016. The funding would cover the cost of resources needed to educate those with disabilities, including teacher's aides, specialized equipment and other materials. 
   Despite increased requirements in No Child Left Behind, IDEA funding has consistently declined over the past four years. The President's 2007 budget provides less than half the federal obligation to education programs that affect children with disabilities. Currently, the government contributes only 18% of the total cost, the lowest percentage since 2002. 
   Johnson has long advocated fully funding IDEA and cosponsored similar legislation last year.
