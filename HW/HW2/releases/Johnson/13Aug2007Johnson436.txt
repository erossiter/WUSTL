SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR LEMMON TO PURCHASE AMBULANCE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Perkins County's Lemmon EMT Association will receive a $15,575 federal grant and a $94,425 low-interest federal loan to purchase a new ambulance. The loan is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
   "It is critical that emergency responders have the resources they need to serve the people of Perkins County, and this funding will help purchase a new ambulance to serve the community in and around Lemmon," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is 'investing in the public good,' and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help people in need of quality emergency health services."
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
