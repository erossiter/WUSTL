SEN. JOHNSON MEETS ADOPTION AWARD RECIPIENTS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) met with the honorees he selected as South Dakota's 2007 and 2006 Congressional "Angels in Adoption," and discussed the rewards of adoption with them in Rapid City today.  
  "Adoptions are as unique as the children and families involved in the process," Johnson said. "These award winners have shown love and patience throughout the adoption process, and their stories are an example to all of us what amazing blessings adoption can bring."
  The 2007 Angels in Adoption winner, Audrey Kirkpatrick, is a social worker employed by Catholic Social Services in Rapid City who has guided numerous families through the adoption process. The 2006 winners, Thomas Cook and Shezalle Simmons, are parents from Hot Springs who have adopted five special needs children all younger than age 10. 
  The nominees were formally honored at the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's annual "Angels in Adoption" reception and dinner in Washington, DC in their respective years.
  Johnson's legislative support of adoption extends to his work to establish a permanent adoption tax credit to lessen the initial financial burden for adoptive families. Adoption proceedings and legal fees for some domestic adoptions can cost more than $40,000. 
  The Johnsons are the proud grandparents of five children, including two that were adopted last summer by their second eldest son, Brendan, and his wife, Jana. 
  The "Angels in Adoption" program was established in 1999 by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute to raise awareness about the importance of adoption. Johnson and his wife, Barbara, are active members of the coalition.
  On this trip home to South Dakota, Johnson has visited Tea and Huron, and will hold meetings and attend events in Pierre, Rapid City, Brookings and Vermillion before returning to Washington this weekend.
