SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON MAD COW DISEASE TEST
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) made the following statement after hearing the final test results from the United States Department of Agriculture on the potential case of mad cow disease: 
   Yesterday afternoon, USDA ruled out a potential case of mad cow. No other information was released concerning the animal's location, age, or origin. Our producers provide quality, wholesome agricultural products, and I remain confident in the safety of our domestic beef industry.
   I continue to hear from farmers and ranchers who are concerned by the fashion in which the inconclusive information is released. The cattle market takes a hit with each announced unconfirmed result, and I share those producer concerns.
