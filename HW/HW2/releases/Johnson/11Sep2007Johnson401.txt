SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON TROOP DRAWDOWN
  Today, President George W. Bush announced his support of the General Petraeus update on Iraq. On a Thursday evening address to the nation, Bush will announce that he plans to pull back troop level to the pre-surge amount. The drawdown of 30,000 troops will still leave roughly 130,000 American soldiers on the ground in Iraq. Johnson released the following statement: 
  A year later and we're in the same place. While the White House will pull 30,000 troops out of Iraq by next August to return to the level we were at earlier this year, the picture we received yesterday hides the truth. 
  The Washington Post reported today that the Petraeus report may not take into account Shiite-on-Shiite violence, Sunni-on-Sunni violence, or fully account for all car bombings - only giving us part of the picture. A recently released report from the independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) could not determine if sectarian violence had declined since the start of the surge because measurements vary. 
  We are treading water, at best, in Iraq and the clock keeps ticking. Our brave men and women have been working valiantly in Iraq, but this war has lasted longer than World War II.
  As I said yesterday, it is time to transition our mission to one that focuses on training Iraqi security forces, conducting counter-terrorism operations, turning power over to the Iraqis, and decreasing the American footprint in Iraq.
