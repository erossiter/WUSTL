SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES WATERTOWN STUDENT APPOINTED TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today extended congratulations to Jared Hoff of Watertown on his recent offer of an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy, West Point. Johnson nominated Hoff to the service academy in December of 2007. 
  "This is a tremendous opportunity for outstanding students like Jared. He has proven himself to be a responsible, disciplined individual with high academic abilities and strong leadership skills. These young people represent the best and the brightest of South Dakota. I wish them good luck and congratulate them as they begin their service to our country," said Johnson.
  "The United States has given me so many freedoms, both individually and as a part of a group, that it is a very small repayment for me to be involved in the continued defense of our great country," Hoff said in his application to Johnson. 
  He is the son of John and Denise Hoff, and attends Watertown High School. As the co-president of the Watertown High School Video Club, the captain of his high school's Quizbowl team and a peer tutor, Hoff has demonstrated a commitment to his school and the community. 
  In order to be nominated for a service academy, young men and women must be of good character and must meet strict requirements in academics, physical aptitude, medical fitness, character, and leadership potential. Applicants must also meet the minimum medical requirements of the respective academies which are reviewed by the Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB). Candidates must also receive a nomination from a nominating source, one of which is through a member of their Congressional delegation.
  The service academies notify students who have qualified for appointments on a rolling basis. Johnson nominated 18 highly-qualified South Dakota students to the military service academies this year.
