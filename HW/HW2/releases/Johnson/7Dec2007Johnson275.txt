ENERGY BILL STALLED BY THOSE WANTING TO GIVE MORE TAX BREAKS TO OIL COMPANIES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) was disappointed today with the filibuster that blocked the Energy Bill, which included a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) of 15 billion gallons of ethanol by 2015. Johnson released the following statement after a Senate procedural vote that stalled the bill:  
   "At the same time oil is hitting the $100 per barrel mark and Americans are paying record prices for gas, there are some in Congress that believe the top five oil companies deserve more tax breaks. The Energy Bill package, which passed the House on Thursday, rolls back misguided tax breaks for some of our nation's largest oil corporations. Rather than move towards energy independence, the minority has filibustered the Energy Bill in the Senate today. 
   "This is a strong Energy Bill for South Dakota and for our nation. It includes the RFS we have been fighting for by requiring 15 billion gallons by 2015: 15 by 15. Americans are tired of depending upon unstable areas of the world for our energy supply. We're ready for renewable fuels, renewable electricity, and fuel efficient vehicles that keep more money in our pockets, rather than sending it to the Middle East. 
   "I am undeterred by today's vote, and will continue to fight for an Energy Bill with this RFS by the end of the year. The American people want results. It will take compromise, cool heads and patience, but I am sure we can find common ground."
