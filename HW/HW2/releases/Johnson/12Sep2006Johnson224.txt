SEN. JOHNSON JOINS SENATORS IN PUSH FOR DISASTER ASSISTANCE
  At a press conference today in Washington, DC, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) joined a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues to urge the White House to approve disaster assistance immediately for our nation's producers.  
   "The Secretary of Agriculture wants to take a 'wait and see' approach to the emergency. Secretary Johanns wants to wait for the fall harvest before more assistance is considered, but in our neck of the woods, there is little to harvest because it never grew in the first place. Some will say this package is expensive, but when you have toured the area and seen the extensive damage first hand as I have, you understand it's necessary," Johnson said. 
   KEY COMPONENTS OF S. 3855:
   * Covers both the 2005 and 2006 production years. 
   * Emergency funding - no budget offsets
   * Production loss threshold at 35% and payment rate at 50% of the established price. Similar to prior disaster programs for insured and uninsurable crops. 35% for insurable crops that were not covered by the producer. 
   * Establishes a Livestock Compensation Program to help cover increased feed expenses for producers in disaster counties designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. 
   * Provides livestock indemnity payments for livestock losses due to hurricanes, floods, wildfires and anthrax. 
   * Provides $13 million for a Ewe Lamb Replacement Program. 
   * Provides $300 million in economic assistance grants for small businesses who suffered material economic losses as a result of weather related agricultural losses.
   * Funds additional personnel for the Farm Service Agency county offices to implement the disaster assistance program.
   The Senate is currently considering legislation that would aid areas affected by the drought as a part of this year's Agricultural Appropriations bill. Johnson has continued fighting for more federal aid for drought relief after the Bush administration announced a drought aid package that falls far short of the needs of South Dakota's farmers. 
   Senator Johnson has toured the drought-affected region on several occasions, including a drought tour with Senator John Thune earlier this summer.
