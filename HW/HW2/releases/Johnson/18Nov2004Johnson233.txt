SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON POSSIBLE CASE OF MAD COW DISEASE IN U.S.
  This morning, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced an inconclusive result in the testing of an animal through USDA's mad cow surveillance program.  
 USDA will be conducting additional tests on this inconclusive result. At this time, USDA has released no information on the animal, including the animal's country of origin. 
   U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement:
   I have faith in the safety of our domestic food supply, and I have the greatest confidence in the food our farmers and ranchers produce. 
   That said, we must take steps to maintain consumer confidence in American beef for our domestic market and trading partners. The best way to do that is implement country-of-origin-labeling (COOL). 
   While some in Congress are attempting to kill COOL, we are faced with yet another example of where it would be helpful.
