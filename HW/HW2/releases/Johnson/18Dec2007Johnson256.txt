SHANNON COUNTY NAMED COUNTY OF THE MONTH
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that he has selected Shannon County as his December 2007 "County of the Month." The county is highlighted in a special section of his website http://johnson.senate.gov. 
   "Shannon County has a rich history and has much to offer," Johnson said. "I am pleased to have worked with the Shannon County community on many issues over the years, ranging from securing funding for the Oglala Lakota College and Loneman School to improving health care." 
   Home to the towns of Pine Ridge, Kyle, Porcupine, and Wounded Knee, Shannon County was founded in 1875. The county was named after Peter Shannon, the Chief Justice of the Dakota Territory Supreme Court from 1873 to 1882. It is located within the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and has the highest percentage of Native American residents in the nation.
   Johnson is a strong advocate of homeland security grants and economic development grant programs that help our small communities continue to grow. He has announced federal funding for programs in Shannon County ranging from higher education, to law enforcement, to veteran housing. 
   "I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities," said Johnson. "South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments - they are truly great places."
