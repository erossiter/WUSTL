SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $150,000 IN FUNDING TO LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced $150,000 in funding to the Head Start program at the Oglala Lakota College as part of the Head Start Partnerships with Tribally Controlled Land Grant Colleges and Universities.  
   "Every child should have the same opportunities to excel. Head Start paves the way for a strong educational foundation. Head Start is one of the best ways to even the playing field for kids from low and moderately low-income families," Johnson said. "The program allows kids, who normally would not be able to afford pre-school, the opportunity to get an excellent preparatory experience before entering school."
   The purpose of this program is to use the capabilities of these institutions of higher education to improve the quality and long-term effectiveness of Head Start and Early Head Start programs. Under this program, Tribally Controlled Land Grant Colleges/Universities form a partnership with one or more Head Start grantee, or Head Start grantee and delegate agencies, to provide education/training to the Head Start agencies.
   Head Start programs are designed to provide all children with the opportunity to start their learning process before entering school. The programs provide educational services for young children, as well as resources, training and support for parents.
   The grant is awarded by the Department of Health & Human Services.
