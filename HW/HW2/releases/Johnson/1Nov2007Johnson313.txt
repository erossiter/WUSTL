SEN. JOHNSON: PRESIDENT'S SHIFTING RATIONALE LEAVES CHILDREN UNINSURED
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement regarding Senate passage today of a revised, bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization bill:  
  "When the President asked Congress to take another look at CHIP, his call was heard. Members from both political parties came together to revise this bill and provide quality health care to the more than 10 million children across the nation who are currently uninsured. Unfortunately, President Bush and House Republican opponents of the bill have moved the goal posts when it came to his rational for vetoing CHIP, insisting that tobacco industry money shouldn't be used to provide our children with health care.
  "This legislation is vital to families across the nation and in South Dakota. Each month, 11,000 South Dakota children are enrolled in CHIP. Another 18,000 South Dakota children are uninsured with as many as 12,000 of them eligible for CHIP but unable to access the program because of a lack of funds. This shifting rationale sends a message that some in Washington are more concerned with the well being of Big Tobacco than the health of our nation's children. I urge the President to do the right thing and provide our nation's children with the healthcare they need. This bipartisan bill should be signed into law."
