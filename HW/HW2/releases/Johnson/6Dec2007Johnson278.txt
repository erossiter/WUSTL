SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR LYMAN COMMUNITY HALL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Vivian Community Hall Corporation in Lyman County will receive a $9,943 federal grant to repair roofing and replace a heating unit. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
  "I am glad that the much-needed repairs will be made to the community hall in Vivian," Johnson said. "It is important that the community have access to a safe and modern facility. One of the pillars of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
