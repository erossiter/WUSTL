SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES YANKTON NATIVE TO WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today welcomed Alissa Hein to his Washington, DC office. Alissa currently attends St. Cloud University in Minnesota, where she studies international relations. She will be interning in the Senator's office for the spring semester. 
   "Through internships, students gain valuable insight into the political and legislative process in Washington," said Johnson. "I encourage all interns to make the most of their time in our nation's capital. I am glad Alissa has been able to join us this spring."
   "Senator Johnson is a good man who works hard to represent the people of South Dakota," Alissa said. "It is a wonderful experience to work in his office and serve South Dakotans."
   Alissa is the daughter of Dr. Michael and Connie Hein, of Yankton. Alissa went to Yankton high school, where she graduated in 2004.
   The Washington D.C. spring internship program matches interns' interests to South Dakota and federal issues while providing a "hands-on" opportunity to experience a wide-range of office duties. Interns may attend hearings, research issues for projects, and work with the office administrative staff.
   College sophomores, juniors and seniors are encouraged to apply for Johnson's summer internship program. College credits or a stipend are available.
