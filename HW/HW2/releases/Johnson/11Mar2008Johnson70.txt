  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the county of Charles Mix will receive a $193,000 federal grant and a $450,000 low-interest federal loan to upgrade the current water system and to repair and enhance the existing wastewater system. The funding is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
   "Proper water infrastructure is crucial for our communities and this funding will greatly benefit the people in Charles Mix County and surrounding areas," said Johnson. "One of the pillars of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks."
