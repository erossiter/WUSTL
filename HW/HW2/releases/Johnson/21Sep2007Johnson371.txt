SOUTH DAKOTA DELEGATION INVITES SOUTH DAKOTANS TO APPLY TO U.S. SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), Senator John Thune (R-SD) and Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota young people interested in being nominated to one of the four U.S. Service Academies for the Class of 2012 should apply by October 31, 2007. 
   South Dakota residents between the ages of 17 and 23 may apply to any of the four service academies if they meet eligibility requirements in leadership, physical aptitude, scholarship and character. The four service academies are the Military Academy at West Point, New York; the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland; the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado; and the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York.
   "The service academies provide excellent educational and leadership opportunities for a select number of young men and women each year. I look forward to the honor of nominating some of South Dakota's best and brightest to be considered for an appointment by the academies," Thune said.
   Herseth Sandlin said, "The U.S. Service Academies can offer invaluable experiences for a young person who not only wants to serve his or her country, but to grow and develop as an individual. I encourage any young person in South Dakota who is interested in attending a Service Academy to apply, and I look forward to recommending excellent candidates from South Dakota once again."
   Johnson, Thune, and Herseth Sandlin will each compile separate lists and make final recommendations to the academies on the most qualified candidates by January 31, 2008. Applicants are encouraged to submit applications to all three Congressional offices in order to better their chances of receiving a recommendation. The academies will make offers of appointment next spring.
