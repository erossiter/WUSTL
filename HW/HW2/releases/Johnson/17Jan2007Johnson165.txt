OFFICE OF SEN. JOHNSON WELCOMES BACK SOUTH DAKOTA NATIVE STEVE JARDING TO STAFF
  Drey Samuelson, Chief of Staff for Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), today announced that Steve Jarding would join Sen. Johnson's staff on February 1, as Deputy Chief of Staff.  
   Jarding is a native South Dakotan, a graduate of the University of South Dakota, and previously had held the same position on Senator Johnson's staff in 1997 and 1998. Additionally, Jarding is the co-author of Foxes in the Henhouse, published earlier this year by Simon and Schuster, and has worked in senior positions for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and the campaigns of Senator Tom Daschle, Senator Jim Webb, and Governor Mark Warner, both of Virginia. 
   Jarding was offered the position by Senator Johnson in early December, prior to Johnson's December 13th surgery. 
   "All of us are delighted that Steve is once again coming to work for Tim," Samuelson said, "He did a great job for South Dakota when he worked for us 10 years ago, and this is great news. He brings a wealth of experience to the job, and he and his wife, Brenda, are excited to move their family back to Rapid City, where they previously lived." 
   "Tim Johnson has always been a voice of honesty and integrity for South Dakota and the nation," Jarding said. "He has never lost his South Dakota values. Tim's continued commitment and focus to do what is right is exactly the leadership we need right now and it will be an honor to work for him and with his staff again as we move down the road tackling the difficult issues facing South Dakota and our nation."
