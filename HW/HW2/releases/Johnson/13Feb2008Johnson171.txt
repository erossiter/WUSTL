BIPARTISAN STIMULUS BILL SIGNED INTO LAW
  With President George W. Bush signing the economic stimulus bill into law, U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement: 
  The goal was to act swiftly to help bring immediate relief and we've done just that by working together. People will start to see checks by May. It is our hope that extra cash delivered to people's doorstep gives the economy the kickstart it needs. This package is proof that when Congress and the White House put politics aside the American people are put first.
