SEN. JOHNSON: LOCAL PROJECTS FARE WELL IN OMNIBUS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today vowed to work with his colleagues to secure funding for vital projects for South Dakota's tribal communities included in the Omnibus spending bill, which combines 11 federal appropriations bills. The Omnibus, which will fund the federal government through Fiscal Year 2008, includes funding for several tribes to expand their criminal justice and health care treatment efforts. 
  "As an appropriator, I am pleased that I can help fund worthy these projects for our tribal communities," said Johnson. "This funding to increase justice programs, expand health care and improve transportation is good for Indian Country and our state. It is my hope that the House and Senate will work quickly to pass this important bill. Getting the Omnibus passed and signed into law will be good news for South Dakota."
