SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS REASONABLE TAX REFORM
  Sen. Tim Johnson voted today against a procedural motion on the Estate Tax repeal bill (H.R. 8), that will allow the Senate to move to other important business. 
   "I am in support of permanent reform of the estate tax structure, but I will not support policies that come at the expense of South Dakota's working families," Johnson said. "This is an effort by Senator Frist to divide the Senate and prevent work from being done on important issues like education, health care, defense, homeland security, and immigration. This is about priorities. We simply can not afford full repeal without sinking even deeper into debt."
   It is projected that the permanent repeal of the estate tax would cost $1 trillion in the first ten years. This cut on behalf of the fabulously wealthy means that our government will be less able to provide tax cuts for middle class families. The tax revenue saved by retaining the estate tax, which affects only the largest three-tenths of 1 percent of estates, funds education, health care, defense, and other important social programs.
   At the 2009 exemption level of $3.5 million, the Congressional Budget Office recently stated that only 94 family-owned businesses and 65 family farms nationwide would have had to pay the estate tax if there was a $3.5 million exemption. Reasonable reform protects all but the wealthiest inheritors. For 2006, the exemption level is $2 million or $4 million for a couple. Those exemptions will increase to $3.5 million, or $7 million per couple, in 2009. At those levels, 99.7% of all estates would pay absolutely no estate tax. Johnson has supported exemptions at this level.
