PATRIOT ACT PASSES THE SENATE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement on the passage of the Patriot Act reauthorization: 
   "This bill aims to find the right balance between protecting our homeland without infringing upon our civil liberties. It enhances congressional oversight with respect to roving wiretaps and business record searches - more so than current law and the initial House passed bill.
   "Most importantly in my consideration, the Senate bill would allow Congress to review certain provisions of this law within four years. It will allow us to modify or strengthen the law as our national security needs change over time. A permanent extension of this bill would ignore the fluid nature of the risks we face from the global war on terrorism."
   Johnson is a strong supporter of the anti-meth provision included in the bill, which is based on the Combat Meth Act of 2005 that Johnson cosponsored. This provision would limit access to large quantities of cold medicines that contain pseudophedrine, a major component of methamphetamines.
   "Meth is a highly addictive, powerful, and toxic drug that is becoming an increasingly serious problem in rural areas. It has devastated many lives and communities. We need to put the tools in place to stop the spread of this horrible drug," Johnson continued.
