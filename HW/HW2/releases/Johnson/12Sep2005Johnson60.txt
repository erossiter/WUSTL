SEN. JOHNSON TO RECEIVE GOLDEN TRIANGLE AWARD FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF FAMILY FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will receive the Golden Triangle Award from the National Farmers Union (NFU) for his work on issues affecting rural America.  
 The award is the highest award for government service given by the NFU. 
   In a letter received before the ceremony, Johnson was commended for his work. "Specifically, we wish to recognize your support of mandatory country-of-origin labeling, a Renewable Fuels Standard and enacting fairer trade policies." The letter continues, "You are truly a champion for rural America." 
   "I am honored to receive this award and to work on issues so important to the people of my state," said Johnson. "Agricultural issues are not exclusive to producers. Labeling meat by country-of-origin provides honest information to American consumers. Seeing that family farmers and ranchers can compete is fundamental to representing South Dakota in the U.S. Senate. Addressing the needs of the agricultural community equates to doing my best for working families." 
   This is the tenth year Johnson has received the NFU's Golden Triangle award over his Congressional career. He also received it in 1988, 1991, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004. 
   The Golden Triangle Award is based on NFU's symbol-a triangle with "legislation" and "cooperation" forming the sides and "education" the base. The Golden Triangle Award is awarded annually and was first established in 1988. NFU's board of directors presented honorees with their awards at a special Capitol Hill event.
