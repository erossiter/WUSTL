SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY TO RECEIVE $214,500 TO STUDY PRION DISEASES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota State University (SDSU) will receive a $214,500 grant to study Germinal Center Function in Prion diseases with the hope of developing new therapeutic strategies.  
   In the past, Johnson has said "This type of funding demonstrates South Dakota's position on the forefront of medical research. This research has the potential to result in a new treatment that could benefit not only many South Dakotans but also many Americans. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   The funding for this two-year grant comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation Research Program. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
