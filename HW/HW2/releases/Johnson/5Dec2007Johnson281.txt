SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $120,320 IN FUNDING FOR OGLALA SIOUX PARKS AND RECREATION AUTHORITY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the Oglala Sioux Parks and Recreation Authority will receive a $120,320 federal grant to establish a Tribal Scenic Byway program. The funding is provided through the United States Department of Transportation.  
  "The Tribal Scenic Byway will not only provide a glimpse of the sort of beautiful scenery and wildlife that South Dakota has to offer, but also give residents and visitors an opportunity to educate themselves on the contributions Indian Country has made throughout history," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment"
  This funding will provide the Oglala Sioux Tribe with the resources necessary to plan, provide, and develop a Tribal Scenic Byways Program. The program will provide travelers with access to historical locations and allow them to learn more about events in United States history. 
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
