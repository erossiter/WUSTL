SALES TAX DEDUCTION FOR SOUTH DAKOTA SIGNED INTO LAW
  Sen. Tim Johnson and Sen. Tom Daschle today hailed a victory for South Dakota taxpayers as the President signed the FSC bill into law.  
 The bill includes a provision that allows South Dakotans and residents of other states with no income tax to deduct state sales taxes on their federal income tax returns.
   The provision that would allow such a deduction as part of the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) bill. With the support of Senator Johnson, Senator Daschle worked to include this provision in the final version of the bill crafted by conferees from the House and Senate. South Dakota is one of seven states that do not have an income tax. The provision is extended for two years. 
   "I have long supported deduction of sales tax for states without an income tax," said Johnson. "This is an issue of tax fairness. I am pleased that we were able to include this valuable provision."
   "The sales tax deductibility is a longstanding priority, and I'm glad we were able to get it into law," Daschle said. "As I've said, this is a matter of basic tax fairness. South Dakotans should be able to deduct the tax they pay on their federal returns, just as other Americans do." 
   The FSC bill, which the Senate passed in May, encourages American manufacturers to keep their jobs in the United States rather than ship them overseas. The FSC bill would relieve tariffs imposed on American manufacturers by the World Trade Organization. Senator Daschle is a cosponsor of the legislation and was a member of the conference committee resolving the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
