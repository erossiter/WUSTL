SEN. JOHNSON JOINS NEW DISASTER ASSISTANCE BILL TO COVER 2005-2006
  As Congress comes back into session with 11 legislative days left on the calendar, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) immediately went to work with colleagues to introduce Emergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2006 this afternoon. Senator Conrad (D-ND) was the original sponsor of the legislation. 
   "I went home and toured South Dakota. There are huge swatches of our state that could face depopulation because of a drought that is one of the worst since the Dust Bowl. The Administration offered up a plan that offers too little too late," Johnson said. "This plan would offer real relief to producers in desperate need. To pass it, the President would just have to say he wouldn't veto it. And then we could make sure that drought was treated like any other disaster and bring the necessary help home."
