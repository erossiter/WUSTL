SEN. JOHNSON RECOGNIZES FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPT. 11
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement on the upcoming four-year anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks:  
   "As the fourth anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks approaches, I am reminded of the tragic sight of smoke rising from the Pentagon as I drove home from my office that day. Though the dust that hung in the air has long since settled, Americans will not forget the tragic deaths of so many fellow citizens that day or the bravery shown by emergency responders. 
   "Four years after the September 11th attacks, our nation remains united and focused on the elimination of terror worldwide. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with those who lost family or friends on that horrible day and also with those brave soldiers serving in the global War on Terror."
