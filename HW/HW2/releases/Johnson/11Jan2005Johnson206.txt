SEN. JOHNSON RESPONDS TO 2ND CANADIAN CASE OF MAD COW IN 2 WEEKS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today responded to news accounts of the second case of Mad Cow disease in Canada in as many weeks, calling for common-sense border restrictions and speedy implementation of mandatory country-of-origin labeling to protect consumer confidence in beef.  
   "Close the doors until we put COOL in place," said Johnson. "Quite simply, the U.S. cannot allow the integrity of our food supply to be compromised, including consumer confidence. The second Canadian case of Mad Cow in as many weeks is all the proof we need to keep live cattle out until mandatory country-of-origin labeling is implemented."
   Johnson, the author of the country-of-origin labeling provision included in the 2002 Farm Bill, expressed concerns to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the White House in letters dated January 3, following confirmation of the last case of Mad Cow. Johnson requested that USDA reconsider the March timeline for opening the U.S.-Canadian border to live cattle.
   Johnson is working on legislation to require COOL's implementation before Canadian live cattle can be allowed into the U.S. 
   This is the third case of confirmed BSE in Canada, dating back to May 2003, when the first case was confirmed. The second case was just confirmed Jan. 2.
   The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said as part of its surveillance program, no part of the animal entered the human food or animal feed systems.
   The case of Mad Cow announced by Canadian authorities today, is the fourth case in a Canadian animal. The U.S.-Canadian border was initially closed to imports of live cattle from Canada following a case of BSE in May 2003. Another Canadian cow, diagnosed with Mad Cow disease in December of 2003, was found in Washington State.
