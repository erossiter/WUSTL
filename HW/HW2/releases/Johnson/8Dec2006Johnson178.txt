SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES EQUITABLE COMPENSATION MEASURE PASSES SENATE
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) announced the Senate has passed S. 1535, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2005. Johnson is the original sponsor of this bill in the Senate.  
 This bill would accelerate access to the funds intended for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for damage resulting from the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, and will simplify technical aspects of the trust fund so that the tribe can more easily access interest accrued on existing federal compensation funds in their account. 
 "This bill goes a long way to reducing the red tape that binds the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's compensation account," said Senator Johnson, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "Now the tribe can more simply access existing compensation funds and the interest those funds accrue." 
 The bill now moves to the House of Representatives for consideration.
