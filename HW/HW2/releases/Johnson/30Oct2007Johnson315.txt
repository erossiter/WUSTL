SEN. JOHNSON INTRODUCES TAX CREDIT FOR STUDENT EXCHANGE HOST FAMILIES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN) introduced legislation to help make the process of hosting foreign exchange students more affordable. The Youth Exchange Support Act would increase the tax deduction from $50 to $200 a month for families that host exchange students and would index the deduction to inflation thereafter.  
  During the 2006-2007 academic year, South Dakota families hosted 259 exchange students. South Dakota has the nation's second strongest ratio of exchange students to their state population.
   "South Dakotans who open their homes to exchange students show the best of America to people who otherwise wouldn't get to see our country first hand," said Johnson. "This legislation will help make the process more affordable for those willing to show such hospitality, instead of financially strapping families for being so generous." 
  "Study abroad programs allow students to understand foreign cultures much better than they ever could out of a text book," said Coleman. "Exchange students enrich families, schools, communities and our international relations by introducing American students to their peers from all over the world. The tax credit this bill provides will help American host families, as well as encourage more families to consider hosting foreign students."
  The Alliance for International Education supports this bill, which is similar to a measure Johnson and Coleman introduced last Congress.
