SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT
  Senator Johnson (D-SD) applauded the Senate Finance Committee's action this morning to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). This legislation passed the Senate Indian Affairs Committee earlier this summer and will now be considered by the full Senate.  
  "It has been too long since this legislation was reauthorized. We must fulfill our responsibility to American Indians to reauthorize this legislation," Johnson said. "Health care for Native Americans is among the worst in our nation. Reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is a necessary step to help improve the health care services throughout Indian Country." 
  Johnson has consistently co-sponsored and supported IHCIA legislation in previous Congresses. In 2005, Johnson joined his colleagues on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to pass a version of IHCIA, though the bill did not become law.
  The IHCIA was first enacted in 1976, is the basis for health care delivery to Native Americans in fulfillment of the federal government's treaty and trust responsibility to provide health care. The IHCIA authorizes funds to be used to eliminate deficiencies in health status and resources of tribes, and improve the ability of the Indian Health Service (IHS) to meet its various responsibilities. The bill also addresses issues including health care facilities and access to care.
