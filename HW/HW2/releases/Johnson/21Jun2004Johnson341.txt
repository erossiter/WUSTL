SENS. DASCHLE, JOHNSON RESPOND TO FEDERAL COURT RULING ON MISSOURI RIVER
  Sen. Tom Daschle and Senator Tim Johnson issued statements in response to a federal district court's ruling that sided with the Army Corps of Engineers.  
 The judge said the Corps and the Fish and Wildlife Service did not violate any laws in formulating the Master Manual and biological opinions, and that the differences are a policy matter that the courts are leaving up to the agencies. 
   "Today's decision by the federal district court in Minnesota regarding the Corps of Engineers and the Missouri River is disappointing for South Dakota and other upstream states," Senator Daschle said. "The Army Corps of Engineers consistently sides with downstream navigation interests at the expense of fish, wildlife, and recreation in upstream states. Time and again, the Corps has chosen crass politics over sound management of the river, and that's simply unacceptable. Today's decision gives the Army Corps of Engineers license to move forward on a scientifically unsound management plan that defies common sense."
   "Science and not politics should determine how best to manage the Missouri River. Today's decision by the district court affirmed the controversial and unwarranted set of actions by the Corps of Engineers and U.S. Fish and Wildlife political appointees," Senator Johnson said.
