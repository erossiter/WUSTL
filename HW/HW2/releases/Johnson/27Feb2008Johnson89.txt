SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $103,675 FOR FAITH FIRE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Faith Fire Department will receive a $103,675 federal grant from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants program. The funding will be used to increase preparedness and ability to respond to fire and fire related hazards. 
  "In rural counties in South Dakota, fire departments like the Faith Fire Department play a crucial role in keeping residents safe," Johnson said. "It is essential that personnel have the equipment and training needed to respond safety and effectively to an emergency. My Hometown Prosperity Plan calls for increased investments in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  President Bush has proposed deep cuts to the Assistance to Firefighters Grants program. In fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated $745 million. But for fiscal year 2009, the President proposed a funding level of only $300 million. Senator Johnson understands the importance of properly equipping those who voluntarily risk their lives to protect the public. That is why he has repeatedly used his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to oppose these cuts.
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
