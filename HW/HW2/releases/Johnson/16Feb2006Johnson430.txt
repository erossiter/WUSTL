SEN. JOHNSON: CONTRACTORS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined colleagues in introducing legislation that would hold government contractors accountable for the work that they do for the U.S. government. The Accountability in Contracting Act of 2006 would improve current federal contracting and procurement by eliminating fraud and abuse and improving competition for contracts. 
   "Some of the funding that is supposed to go to help rebuilding efforts in Iraq and in the Gulf Coast Region has simply disappeared into thin air at the same time the federal budget deficit continues to rise at an alarming rate," said Johnson. "One way of controlling spending is to be sure that contractors for the U.S. government act responsibly and are held accountable for their actions if they don't. Values teach us all that stealing is wrong, but the law should hold those who steal accountable. This law would crack down on those who steal from American taxpayers' pockets."
   According to sponsors, provisions in the bill would hold contractors responsible by doing the following:
   * Punish War Profiteers by establishing penalties of up to 20 years in prison and at least $1 million in fines for war profiteering.
   * Crack Down on Big Corporate Cheaters by restoring a Clinton Administration rule on suspension and debarment, which prohibited awarding federal contracts to companies that exhibited a pattern of failing to comply with the law. The Bush Administration repealed this rule as soon as it took office.
   * Require Full Disclosure of Contract Abuses by establishing a "Truth in Contracting" public website identifying overcharges by major contractors.
   * Force Real Contract Competition by prohibiting the awarding of huge monopoly contracts, and allowing multiple companies to make bids for work so as to ensure price competition.
   * Ban Corporate Cronyism in Contracting by requiring that federal agencies conduct contract oversight, rather than paying contractors with conflicts of interest to oversee one another.
   * Eliminate Conflicts of Interest for Federal Contracting Employees by closing the perverse loophole that allows federal contracting officials to take jobs as lobbyists for companies to whom they awarded contracts.
   * End Cronyism in Key Government Positions by stopping unqualified political appointees from holding key jobs relating to federal contracting or public safety.
   * Strengthen Whistleblower Protections by making it more difficult for federal agencies to retaliate against whistleblowers and giving courts wider discretion to consider cases of retaliation.
