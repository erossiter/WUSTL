SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR LUTHERAN SOCIAL SERVICES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota's Stepping Stones Transitional Living Program will receive a $149,050 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services' Family and Youth Services Bureau. Funding will be used to support and teach independent living skills to 16-21 year olds who are expected to "age out" of the foster care program. 
  "Institutions like Lutheran Social Services are invaluable in helping youth make the transition to life outside of foster care," said Johnson. "The transitional living program gives opportunity and tools to youth that have often been deprived of both."
  Earlier this year, Senator Johnson wrote to the Family and Youth Services Bureau in support of programs that provide support and resources to youth who do not have a safe place to live.
  Senator Johnson is a member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees and continues to stress the importance of funding youth programs that help our state's and nation's most vulnerable youth. 
  Johnson has long been an advocate of adoption and is a founding member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. In South Dakota, nearly 1,600 children are in the foster care system. The average age of a child in foster care is nine years old. At the same time, in South Dakota, 100 children on average "age out" of the foster care system each year before they are adopted.
