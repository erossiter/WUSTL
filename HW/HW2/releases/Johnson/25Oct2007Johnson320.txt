SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON PASSING OF FORMER LT. GOV. HILLARD
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson commented on death of former Lt. Governor Carole Hillard: 
  Carole Hillard was a public servant who saw no borders to her work. She faithfully served South Dakota and worked hard to better the lives of not only the people of our state but all around the world.
  Our state today lost a pioneer, our state's first female Lt. Governor who made her mark through her dedication to her work and her family.
  Barbara and I send our prayers to her family and many friends in this time of mourning.
