SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $583,446 FOR SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the South Dakota State University (SDSU) in Brookings has received a $583,446 discretionary federal grant to explore using remote imagery to monitor rural road conditions. The funding is administered by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration through the Department of Transportation.  
  The funding will allow SDSU to work with local and state agencies, industry partners, and service providers to improve transportation system performance and reduce construction and maintenance costs of rural roads through remote sensing and spatial information technologies.
  "This funding for South Dakota State University will help to ensure that transportation conditions in rural areas of the state are safe and maintained for all South Dakotans," Johnson said. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
