SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $2.68 MILLION TO LOCALITIES IN SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that localities across South Dakota will receive $2,684,423 in funding through the federal Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program. PILT Payments are federal payments to local governments to offset losses in property taxes due to non-taxable federal lands within their boundaries. This funding is especially important in South Dakota because the state includes over 4,600 square miles of public federal land. 
  "PILT funding is a huge boost to local governments' budgets, and I am glad to see the funds I supported as an appropriator will go toward funding for vital services in the cities, counties and towns back in South Dakota," Johnson said. "I will continue to work to make sure the federal government meets its responsibility by reimbursing communities for lost revenue so that they can continue to provide essential public services."
  The President proposes a cut to the PILT program for Fiscal Year 2008, requesting only $190 million for the program, that is $42.5 million less than the previous year's allocation of $232.5 million. Johnson supports fully-funding PILT at the authorized level of $359 million. The PILT program is especially beneficial to counties that include large tracts of federal property not subject to local property tax valuations.
