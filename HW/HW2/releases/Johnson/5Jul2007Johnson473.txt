SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS IN RAPID CITY, PINE RIDGE AREAS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that four organizations in South Dakota will receive Community Development Financial Institutions Program (CDFI) economic development grant awards through the U.S. Treasury Department's Native American CDFI NACA program. These funds, which will be announced at an official ceremony tomorrow, help serve Native American communities with planning, lending programs and building assistance.  
  Johnson's Economic Development Director, Matt Varilek, will be on hand for the 9:00 am MT ceremony at the Crazy Horse Memorial's Avenue of the Chiefs Outdoor Stage.
  The four organizations in Rapid City and on the Pine Ridge Reservation that were granted funds are: 
   * First Nations Oweesta Corporation in Rapid City will receive $149,912 to develop a new training program for its clients; upgrade its loan policies, procedures and computer systems; and fund staff and consultants to develop and provide the training program. 
   * Mazaska Owecaso Otipi Financial on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation will receive $129,150 for training for staff, developing staff to help homebuyers complete lending training, pay for consulting for organizational management and lending, develop an approach to marketing and purchase material, accounting services and hardware. 
   * Teton Coalition, Inc. in Rapid City will receive $148,500 grant to hire and train staff, as well as purchase materials and supplies to better serve borrowers. 
   * The Lakota Fund on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation will receive $135,256 for developming financial products and marketing materials, acquiring new hardware and a computer system, and training for staff and the Fund's board. 
  "Tribal organizations can better serve the needs of Indian Country with targeted banking services, so that they can find funds to start businesses and buy homes that meet their needs," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good and emphasizing entrepreneurship through programs such as CDFI. The funds and services that these grants help provide are an example of that kind of investment that will help all aspects of the community."
  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are financial institutions that specialize in underserved markets. In its first 10 years, the CDFI Fund, located within the Department of the Treasury, has successfully invested in urban, rural and reservation-based markets in all 50 states to create jobs; quality, affordable housing; and facilities for vital social services. The Treasury Department reports that every federal dollar invested in a CDFI, leverages $21 of private investment. 
  Johnson has continually emphasized the importance of the CDFI program in his Hometown Prosperity Plan and Tribal Economic Development listening sessions, specifically working to boast CDFI activity in Indian Country. Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level.
