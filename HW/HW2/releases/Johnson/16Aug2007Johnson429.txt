SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $300,000 IN FUNDING TO REDUCE CAMPUS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the University of Sioux Falls will receive a $300,000 federal grant to develop their "Safe Campus Project," a comprehensive violence prevention program to reduce violence against women on campus. The funding comes through the Department of Justice's Reduce Violence Against Women on Campus Grant Program. 
   "This funding will create more resources for women in at the University of Sioux Falls to reduce and prevent violent crime," Johnson said. "I am encouraged that this funding will go to such an expansive effort with law enforcement and non profit groups in Sioux Falls. "I will continue to work as an appropriator to defend funding for effective programs to reduce violence against women." 
   The University of Sioux Falls will use the funding to develop the "Safe Campus Project" in collaborative partnership with the Sioux Falls Rape and Domestic Abuse Center, as well as the Sioux Falls Police Department and the Minnehaha County Attorney's Office. The goals of the program are to prevent incidences of dating and domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, to expand services on campus and in the community to respond to violence and to update campus education programs about violence against women.
