SEN. JOHNSON SEEKS TO END FOREIGN OIL DEPENDENCE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) continued his work to stop fuel prices from climbing to new heights by moving to bring independence from foreign oil in part by increasing domestic biodiesel and ethanol production. Johnson joined a group of bipartisan colleagues in introducing the Biofuels Security Act of 2006. This bill is a comprehensive ethanol and biodiesel package of incentives and requirements to boost renewable fuels and increase the production of flexible fuel vehicles and installation of E85 pumps at gas stations. 
   "We need to do more than put a finger in the dam on our oil dependence," said Johnson. "This is the time to get a more comprehensive renewable energy law passed. In our state, people often drive long distances from place to place. We need to continue to move away from dependence on foreign oil, and this bill continues in that direction." Johnson has been a long-time advocate of an increased Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS).
   Some of the provisions in the Biofuels Security Act of 2006 include:
   * A more aggressive RFS requirement: As domestic renewable fuel production continues to grow, the bill would allow for a 10 billion gallon RFS in 2010, 30 billion gallons in 2020, and 60 billion gallons by 2030.
   * E85 retail gasoline pump and tank requirement: Retail gasoline stations directly-owned by the nine largest Big Oil companies would be required to install E85 tanks and refueling hoses at 5 percent of retail stations annually through 2016.
   * A 100 percent Flexible Fuel Vehicle Fleet (FFV) compatible vehicle fleet by 2016: 10 percent FFV requirement for all auto manufacturers beginning in model year 2007 and ramping up an additional 10 percent annually to 100 percent penetration by 2016. Dual Fuel Vehicles can be fueled by E85 or lower ethanol blends, but can also take unleaded gasoline.
   * E85 retail gasoline pump and tank incentives including 1) a 75 percent tax incentive would be offered to install E85 pumps for the costs incurred by an independent retail gasoline distributor owning five or fewer retail gasoline stations and 2) A 50 percent tax incentive would be offered to install E85 pumps for the costs incurred by an independent retail gasoline distributor owning more than five retail gasoline stations.
   Additionally, Johnson today joined colleagues in introducing the Clean Energy Development for a Growing Economy (Clean EDGE) Initiative Act. The Clean EDGE Act has five goals which are: 1) reducing our addiction to oil, 2) ensuring near-term energy affordability and empowering American families, 3) accelerating clean fuels and electricity, real government leadership for clean and secure energy, and 5) securing a reliable, affordable and sustainable energy future.
   "The Clean EDGE Act is a sustained commitment toward reducing America's reliance on imported oil by 2020 through an aggressive plan to launch renewable fuels and technology as the solution to America's painful battle at the gasoline pump," Johnson said. "The Democratic plan treats energy independence seriously and doesn't pretend that the solution is a one-time cash rebate or other gimmick."
