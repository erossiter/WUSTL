SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S PICK FOR VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement upon receiving news that President George W. Bush has selected Jim Nicholson as his choice to replace outgoing Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi: 
   I was saddened to hear Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi resigned. Secretary Principi had spent much of his career working on behalf of veterans and I wish him good luck in the future.
   President Bush has recently announced the nomination of Jim Nicholson to become the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Ambassador Nicholson served our nation honorably as an Army Ranger and in the Army Reserves. He is a decorated combat veteran, and I look forward to working with him to address the needs of the veterans of South Dakota and our nation. I am particularly concerned about the future of veterans health care, and hope Ambassador Nicholson will join with all the major veterans organizations in endorsing my legislation to provide mandatory VA health care funding.
