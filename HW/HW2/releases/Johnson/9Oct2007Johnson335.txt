SEN. JOHNSON MEETS WITH OFFICIALS FROM LEWIS & CLARK REGIONAL WATER SYSTEM IN SIOUX FALLS OCT. 11
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson's (D-SD) district work period schedule will include a trip to South Dakota for a meeting to discuss the Lewis & Clark Regional Water Project on Thursday, October 11, 2007. Johnson will offer information on the work he has done in Washington in support of the project, and will get reports on Thursday from several individuals on the project. 
  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson helped secure $28 million for the project in the Senate Energy and Water funding bill and he is working to preserve as much of that funding as possible. The bill must still be reconciled with the House spending measure as it moves closer to becoming law. 
  "In Congress, I was able to secure $28 million for the project in the Senate 2008 Energy & Water bill. However, we still have to work with the House for a final budget this fall. If we can retain $28 million in this budget and future budgets, it will be possible to get water to Sioux Falls by 2012," Johnson said. 
  Troy Larson, Executive Director; Red Arndt, Chairman of Lewis & Clark in Luverne, Minnesota; Kevin Smith, Sioux Falls Assistant Public Works Director; Roger Lamp, Chairman of Lincoln County Rural Water System; and Dan Cotton, City Councilman, Beresford have been invited to brief Johnson.
