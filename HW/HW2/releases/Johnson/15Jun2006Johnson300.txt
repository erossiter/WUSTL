EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL PASSES CONGRESS; SEN. JOHNSON SUPPORTS PACKAGE WHILE REMAINING CRITICAL OF CUTS IN AGRICULTURE DISASTER FUNDING
  Sen. Tim Johnson released the following statement on Senate passage of the $94.5 billion emergency supplemental funding bill: 
   "Back room deals slashed ag disaster funding to be cut from this bill. The President threatened to veto the bill, and they cut and ran on farmers across the country. I understand the losses experienced by farmers in the Gulf region, but they weren't the only area of the country that suffered a disaster."
   "Overall, this emergency package predominantly included funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to make sure they have the necessary resources to do a dangerous job, and that is why I supported it."
   The bill included $409 million in agriculture disaster assistance targeted to the hurricane affected region of the Gulf Coast for fiscal year 2006. The Senate passed version included $3.9 billion for agriculture disasters nationwide - aid for agriculture producers who have suffered losses due to natural disasters such as disease, drought, flood, hurricanes, and other weather-related causes. In South Dakota, sixty counties were included in emergency declarations as either primary or contiguous disaster counties in 2005. 
   The Bush Administration opposed the agriculture assistance and threatened to veto the bill if it remained in the final package. The Senate and House leadership caved and pulled out all agriculture disaster assistance, except what would benefit the hurricane affected region, because of the veto threat.
   In addition to funding to help the Gulf Coast recover from the 2005 hurricane season, the bill also included $65.8 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, $2.3 billion for pandemic flu preparations, and $1.9 billion for border security.
