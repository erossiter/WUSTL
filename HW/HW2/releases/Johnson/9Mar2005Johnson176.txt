SEN. JOHNSON TO HOST SOCIAL SECURITY TOWN HALL MEETINGS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) will host a series of six town hall meetings across South Dakota this month to discuss Social Security, how best to protect the guaranteed benefit, and how to make sure Social Security continues to be the cornerstone of retirement planning for future generations. 
   "I want to hear from people across this state on what they value most in Social Security and provide them with information on the risks associated with privatization," said Johnson. "I am committed to improving the long-term outlook of the Social Security program. My fear is that if we start to divert payroll taxes away from the Trust Fund for private accounts, we do nothing to improve solvency, and start to chip away at that guarantee that every South Dakotan should be able to count on."
   Johnson will hold six town hall meetings across South Dakota between March 29th-April 1st. Johnson will hold meetings in Aberdeen, Mitchell, Rapid City, Sioux Falls, Watertown, and Yankton.
   "Nearly one out of every five South Dakotans receives Social Security benefits. This is more than just a statistic. These people are our mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, our family and friends. Every one of us knows someone who relies on this program as the cornerstone of their retirement," Johnson said.
   More-specific times, dates, locations for each town hall meeting are forthcoming.
