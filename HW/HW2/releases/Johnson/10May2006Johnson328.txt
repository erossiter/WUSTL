SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES EUREKA COMMUNITY BENEVOLENT HOSPITAL TO RECEIVE $45,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Eureka Community Benevolent Hospital will receive an $18,375 grant and a $26,625 loan to purchase medical equipment. 
   "Eureka Community Benevolent Hospital is a vital resource for many residents and this funding will help them to better care for their patients," Johnson said. "It's important that people in rural areas have access to high-quality health care. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   This funding will be used to buy diagnostic equipment for the hospital. The funding is provided by the Community Facility Loan and Grant program, operated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development. The program provides affordable financial assistance for promoting rural development.
   President Bush has proposed to cut USDA Rural Development programs by $420 million for next year. Senator Johnson recognizes how important rural development is for South Dakota and will use his seats on both the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees to oppose the proposed cuts.
   The loan is for 40 years at a 4.375 percent interest rate. Additionally, the hospital has received federal funding through this program in each of the last two years.
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
