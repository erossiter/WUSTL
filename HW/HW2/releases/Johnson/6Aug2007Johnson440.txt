SEN. JOHNSONS ANNOUNCE NEW ADDITIONS TO FAMILY
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) and his wife Barbara are proud to announce today the addition of two new grandchildren to the Johnson family. Johnson's second eldest son, Brendan, and Brendan's wife, Jana, traveled to Ethiopia late last month to adopt Trualem, age 10, and Peneal, age 8. The newest members of the Johnson family arrived in South Dakota last week. Trualem and Peneal were introduced to their brothers, Sutton and Cooper, and are enjoying time together with them and their new parents.  
   "I'm now a proud grandfather of five. Brendan and Jana have opened their home and hearts to Tru and Peneal. Our family is larger and richer with them in it. Adoption is truly a miracle for all involved," Senator Johnson said. "The only thing better would be to welcome them back to South Dakota in person. This is just another reason Barbara and I look forward to getting home to South Dakota as soon as we can."
  Senator Johnson has long been a champion of adoption, and has carried the lesson over to his personal life. The Johnsons now have a total of five grandchildren, including Ari, Sutton and Cooper. Ari is the son of Brooks and Naida Johnson.
