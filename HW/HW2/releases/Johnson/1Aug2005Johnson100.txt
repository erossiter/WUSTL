SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF ANTI-METH BILL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) applauded the approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee of a bill to combat the production, use, and distribution of methamphetamines.  
 The endorsement sends the bill forward to the full Senate for its consideration. The comprehensive bipartisan bill, S. 103, sponsored by Sen. Jim Talent (R-MO) and cosponsored by Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) would limit access to a major component of methamphetamines. 
   "The use of meth has increasingly become a serious problem in rural areas," said Johnson. "In many rural communities, authorities have not previously had to deal with the severe societal and health impacts of meth. We must move swiftly and firmly to combat the use and distribution of meth. One of the best ways to do that is to make the production more difficult, and that is exactly what this bill does. 
   Methamphetamine, or meth, is a highly addictive, powerful, and toxic drug that can be made in many variations using materials that are often readily available and completely legal to purchase. It has been linked to many serious mental and physical health conditions, including memory loss, psychotic behavior, and heart and brain damage. It also creates aggressive behavior and can lead to increased risk-taking. 
   "We must find every available avenue to stop this from becoming an epidemic," said Johnson. "Meth is causing many rural law enforcement agencies to spend extra money that they simply don't have. Local law enforcement officials are spending money, not only to apprehend and incarcerate meth users and dealers, but also to clean up toxic, hazardous meth sites where costs can range anywhere from $3,000 to $100,000."
