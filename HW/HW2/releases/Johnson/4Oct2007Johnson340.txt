SEN. JOHNSON CALLS FOR REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANIES
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today took part in a Banking Committee Hearing that examined the regulation and supervision of industrial loan companies (ILC). Johnson has been a leading advocate of maintaining the separation of banking and commerce and protecting local community banks in South Dakota. 
  "I don't think that Congress could have predicted the level of growth that ILC's have experienced," Johnson said in a statement entered in the committee record. "Even though we created exceptions for ILCs in 1987, we have a responsibility to review the current situation and respond thoughtfully and carefully. This hearing will help us begin this process."
  The hearing examined whether the scope and purpose ILCs have expanded beyond their original purpose to serve the needs of industrial workers, including whether Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) supervision and regulation of ILCs needs to be strengthened; ILCs should be subject to the consolidated supervision framework established in Gramm-Leach-Bliley; and whether the ILC loophole should be closed. 
  In January, the FDIC Board voted unanimously to extend the moratorium on commercial ILC applications for 12 additional months. It also gives Congress the opportunity to address the issue. 
  Previously, Johnson raised questions about Wal-Mart's application for an ILC due to concerns that it would mix banking and commerce, causing potential risks to the deposit insurance fund, and possibly threatening the nation's payments system. Wal-Mart withdrew its application in March.
