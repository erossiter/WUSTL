SEN. JOHNSON APPLAUDS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR MAINTAINING OGLALA SIOUX TRIBAL POLICE FORCE
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) applauds the U.S. Department of Justice for supporting the law enforcement needs of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST). OST law enforcement, which receives monies from a variety of sources, is largely funded through the Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) within the DOJ's office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). 
   OST's COPS grant expires at the end of March and the COPS program has suffered continual funding cuts under this administration. This year, the program as a whole was cut to $31.1 million down from $46.5 in FY 2006, a 33% overall funding cut. Accordingly, OST was facing a crisis-level situation of losing 2/3 of their police force.
   A TRGP grant requires a 25% match from the tribe. OST was unable to fund the match requirement and thankfully was granted a waiver of the match requirement by the Department of Justice. Senator Johnson, along with Rep. Herseth, recently contacted COPS Director Carl Peed in support of the tribe. The waiver of the match requirement should allow the tribe to maintain law enforcement levels while a long term solution is sought to combat the lack of funding available to tribal law enforcement.
   "Reservation communities have unique law enforcement needs, but face chronic under-funding," Johnson said. "The violent crime rate in Indian country is 50% higher than the national average. Yet, Indian country has far fewer police officers per capita then the national average."
