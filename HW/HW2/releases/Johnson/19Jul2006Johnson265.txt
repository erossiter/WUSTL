SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES MILITARY CONSTRUCTION FUNDING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced funding for South Dakota projects as part of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill. As a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Johnson helped secure over $23 million for projects in South Dakota.  
   The bill, which provides federal funding for military construction, military family housing, and veterans' affairs programs, is expected to pass the Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday. 
   "These construction projects will help Ellsworth maintain its reputation as a top-notch, modern facility," Johnson said. "Ellsworth Air Force Base and the South Dakota National Guard play an invaluable role in our national defense. Upgrading facilities and investing in our military bases ensures that our military is equipped to best defend the nation and enhances the quality of life for the brave men and women who serve."
   The bill includes $23.4 million for three military construction projects in South Dakota, including: 
   - Base Civil Engineer Maintenance Complex (South Dakota National Guard) receives $7.5 million - This project will construct a new 30,200 square foot facility to meet mission requirements at Joe Foss Field. The new facility will meet operational and training standards required to maintain a combat-ready force of civil engineers. The complex will include cold weather storage for supplies and vehicles, as well as offices, shop training areas, tool storage and assembly/educational areas. 
   - Base Water Well (Ellsworth Air Force Base, EAFB) receives $3 million - Currently, the only source of potable water for Ellsworth Air Force Base comes from water treated by the Rapid City Water Division. This project will install a water well at EAFB, build a treatment facility for the well, and construct a new 3,600 foot waterline to the base's water storage system.
   - Armed Forces Reserve Center (South Dakota Army Reserve) receives $12.9 million - This project will construct a new Armed Forces Reserve Center for both the Army Reserve and Navy Reserve in Sioux Falls. Currently, both operations are housed in leased facilities that are over 40 years old. The new center will consolidate all operations into a 400 member facility and will be built on 12 acres of land. 
   Prior to the funding above, Johnson has used his position on the Military Construction Appropriations subcommittee to help direct nearly $100 million to improve Ellsworth over the last several years, including funding for a new base operations building, B-1 training facility, and military housing.
