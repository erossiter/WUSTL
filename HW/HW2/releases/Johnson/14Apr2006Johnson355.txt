SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $396,800 IN FUNDING FOR SIOUX FALLS FAMILY YMCA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced the approval of a $396,800 grant to fund a new building for the Sioux Falls Family YMCA. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Johnson was able to help secure this funding in a FY 2005 appropriations bill. 
   "I am very happy to see a grant go toward such a worthy cause," Johnson said. "The YMCA provides a vital function for the community. Its programs enrich the lives of so many in the Sioux Falls area."
   The YMCA has taken important steps to improve the health and wellness of the young people in the region. The YMCA reaches over 4,000 young people in South Dakota through after-school programs, mentoring programs, athletic leagues, civic education programs, and leadership clubs.
   "Just as we can engage young people at school and at church, community centers like the YMCA are a tremendous resource for children and families," said Johnson. "This is a great example of positive steps we can take to reach youth who may be at risk."
   Earmarks, like this one, are grants secured by members of Congress, enabling them to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member of Congress' ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, Senator Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
