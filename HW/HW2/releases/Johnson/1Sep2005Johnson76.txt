SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $73,655 TO FAULK COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Faulk County Memorial Hospital will receive $73,655 to purchase a new x-ray machine for the radiology department. Johnson, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was able to secure this funding in the 2005 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Bill.  
   "I was proud to work with hospital officials to secure funding for a new x-ray machine," Johnson said. "The people in Faulk County depend on their hospital to provide them with high-quality medical services. This new X-ray machine will update current technology and enhance the ability of doctors to treat illnesses and injuries." 
   Faulk County Memorial Hospital is a Critical Access Hospital with an attached provider-based Rural Health Clinic. Increased budget constraints for the hospital and community locally create a great challenge in purchasing new equipment and technology. 
   "Purchasing new equipment and technology can be extremely difficult for rural hospitals. The quality of equipment at a hospital should not be dependent on the ability of a hospital to make a profit on patient care - that simply would not work in rural areas. I will continue to work with our rural hospitals to ensure that they are able to overcome funding difficulties and remain viable as essential health service providers," Johnson continued. 
   Earmarks, like this one, are secured by members of Congress, enabling them to support high-priority projects in their home states. Each member of Congress' ability to deliver earmarks for their state varies depending on their seniority, committee assignments, and other factors. As South Dakota's Senior Senator with seats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and Budget Committee, Johnson is exceptionally well-placed to deliver federal funding for South Dakota's priorities.
