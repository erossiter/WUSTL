SENATE PASSES BIPARTISAN, COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION BILL
  Today, the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill, S.2611. Sen. Tim Johnson, who voted for the compromise legislation, released the following statement on the realistic approach to protecting our borders: 
   I think we have a strong bipartisan bill on the Senate side. It is supported by President Bush, John McCain and the leaderships of both political parties. I think it is a step in the right direction as we go to conference with the House.
   The problem in the House is going to be that they have a very punitive bill that attempts to turn everyone into felons, attempts to turn nuns and soup kitchen workers into felons, and unrealistically expects to deport 12 million people. That's not going to work.
   We need a more bipartisan, thoughtful, middle of the road approach. I think the Senate has taken that road. It is my hope that, in conference with the House, we can emerge with the kind of legislation that both parties can support and will actually move this country forward on this difficult issue.
   Highlights of the legislation include that the bill would:
   * Authorize temporary National Guard assistance to help secure the Southern Border;
   * Add 370 miles of border fence and 500 miles of strategic vehicle barriers in high traffic areas;
   * Institute an employment verification system to ensure accuracy and privacy protections for employment records;
   * Create additional requirements on the steps businesses must take to ensure there are no available American workers before a job can go to a guest worker;
   * Bar felons, individuals with three misdemeanors, and those who have ignored an order of removal from taking advantage of the path to citizenship program;
   * Impose fees for those seeking to enter the guest worker and path to citizenship programs;
   * Reimburse states for expenditures on health care and the education of immigrant children;
   * Declare English the "national language."
