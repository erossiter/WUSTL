SEN. JOHNSON: INDIAN COUNTRY NEGLECTED IN PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today expressed his disappointment in the President's budget request, which underfunds or eliminates funding for vital programs in Indian Country. Numerous programs were zeroed out in the President's proposal, which would eliminate funding for health care, education and several law enforcement programs.
  "The President's budget request grossly neglects construction funding of Native American health care facilities and education, and ignores the treaty and trust responsibility of the federal government," Johnson said. "Last year, my colleagues and I worked to revive programs important to Indian Country that were targeted for elimination by the President, and I will use my seat on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee to work to restore these programs this year." 
  Within the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) there was a slight increase for Public Safety and Justice but a massive decrease to Education Construction. 
  - Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) - Operation of Indian Programs, which Congress funded at $2.409 billion for FY 2008, would see a decrease of $60 million under the President's proposal to $2.349 billion for FY 2009. Within the BIA Construction, the President is proposing a significant decrease for Education Construction, $177 million less than Congress appropriated this year to $140 million for FY2009 as suggested by the President. 
  - Indian Health Service (IHS) - The IHS serves American Indians to provide them with medical care and public health services. The President requested $4.084 billion overall budget authority for the IHS, which is no change from the funding level Congress set for FY2008 in the Omnibus spending bill passed last December.
   * The Urban Indian Health program was not funded in the President's request. Congress $35allocated million for the program in FY2008, which provides resources in urban areas of South Dakota, including Sioux Falls, Pierre and Aberdeen. 
   * The President's request for IHS Clinical Services is $2.476 billion, an increase of $42 million from FY2008 Congressionally enacted funding levels.
   * IHS Contract support costs saw an increase of $5 million in the President's budget request, from $267 million Congress appropriated in the Omnibus bill for FY2008 to $272 million for FY2009.
   * For Indian Health Facilities, the President requested a $22 million decrease from the funding level Congress appropriated for FY 2008 to $362 million for FY2009. This account supports construction, repair and improvement, equipment, and environmental health and facilities support for the Indian health services. 
   - Department of Justice (DoJ) - The President has requested that three programs be zeroed out for Indian Country, including incarceration on tribal lands, tribal courts and grants for Indian Country. In FY2008, Congress funded all the three programs for a total of $33 million.
  - Department of Education - Within the Department of Education, the Office of Indian Education funding request from the President is the same amount Congress appropriated for FY2008, $120 million for education grants for local education agencies that educate American Indian children. In particular, the President's request did not include funding for the Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Program or the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions, which Congress funded at a level of $23 million and $7.5 million in FY2008 respectively.
  - Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - The President requested $627 million for Native American Housing Block Grants in FY2009, or $54 million less than the Congressionally funded level of $681 million for FY 2008.
