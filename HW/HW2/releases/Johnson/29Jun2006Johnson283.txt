SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY CONSERVATION FUNDING
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will begin allocating $11.8 million in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funding for eighteen states to help farmers and ranchers rehabilitate land damaged by natural disasters. Twenty counties in South Dakota will receive $1.963 million from the released ECP funds. 
   "This Emergency Conservation Program money is a step in the right direction," said Johnson. It pales, however, in comparison to the $100 million South Dakota producers would've received for last year's disasters had the President not opposed it. I will continue to fight for meaningful dollars for our producers, but it will be difficult given White House opposition."
   The counties where producers are eligible for funding are Campbell, Corson, Dewey, Edmunds, Faulk, Haakon, Hand, Hughes, Hyde, McPherson, Meade, Pennington, Potter, Sanborn, Stanley, Sully, Walworth, and Ziebach. Producers should check with their local FSA offices to find out their ECP sign-up period and to help determine whether they will be eligible for funds.
