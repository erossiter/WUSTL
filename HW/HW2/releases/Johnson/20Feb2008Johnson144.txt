  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today the induction of two Mellette County students to the National Honor Roll. The National Honor Roll program recognizes students for superior academic achievement.  
  Inductees are Clinton Osterbur of Wood and Jessica Ludvik of White River.
  "National Honor Roll inductees have demonstrated exceptional academic achievement and are considered to be among the top students in the state," said Johnson. "I am proud that so many of South Dakota's students are being nationally recognized for their academic excellence."
  Each year the National Honor Roll program honors exemplary students from across the country. To qualify, middle or high school students must earn a B or higher average. Extra curricular activities are also considered. This year, 547 South Dakota students were honored with induction.
