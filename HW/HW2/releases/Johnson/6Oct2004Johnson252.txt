SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT ON INTELLIGENCE REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today released the following statement upon Senate passage of the National Intelligence Reform Bill, S. 2845.  
 The legislation contains the intelligence gathering recommendations put forth by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission:
   "I am pleased that the Senate has worked quickly to address these reforms, as recommended by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission," said Johnson. "I am concerned, however, that the House Republican leadership may be playing politics with national security, attempting to tuck controversial provisions into their bill. It is my hope that Senate-House negotiations will produce a final version of the bill that closely reflects the 9/11 Commission's recommendations."
   The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 96-2. It must next be reconciled with the House version before it can be sent to the President.
