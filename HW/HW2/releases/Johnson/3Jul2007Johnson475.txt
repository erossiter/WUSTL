SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CUSTER COUNTY AMBULANCE SERVICES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Custer County Ambulance Services, Inc. will receive a $600,000 low-interest federal loan for the construction of a new facility that will house ambulances and serve as an administration area for training medical volunteers. The loan is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development. 
   "It is critical that emergency responders have the resources they need to serve the people of Custer County," Johnson said. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is 'investing in the public good,' and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will keep our communities safe."
  Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
