SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE TO RECEIVE $200,000
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Oglala Sioux Tribe Parks and Recreation Authority will receive $200,000 to be used for improving the law enforcement infrastructures of the tribe. This funding is given by the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Tribal Resource Grant Program (TRGP), a program designed to meet the law enforcement needs of tribal communities.  
   "Law enforcement is vital to our tribal communities," said Johnson. "This grant helps to make sure our police forces have the funding they need to do their jobs properly. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment."
   TRGP grants fund such items as basic equipment, crime fighting technology systems, and training. TRGP is intended to enhance the law enforcement infrastructure and community policing practices in Native American communities. 
   As an appropriator, Johnson has defended repeated cuts to the COPS grants programs. The COPS program, administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, began operations in October 1994 after Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Crime Act) in the fall of 1994. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
