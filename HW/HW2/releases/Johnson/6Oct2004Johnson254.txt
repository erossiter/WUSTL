SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $46,784 IN FUNDING TO MITCHELL POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Mitchell police department will receive $46,784 in funds for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) from the U.S. Department of Justice.  
 It comes as part of the COPS committed to school safety program (CIS).
   "I was extremely pleased to hear that the Mitchell police department was awarded these funds," Johnson said. "It allows law enforcement officials to teach classes on crime prevention, and serve as community liaisons. This program truly makes a difference in a local community and with students." 
   The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services has awarded almost $715 million to more than 2,900 law enforcement agencies to fund over 3,600 school resource officers (SROs) through the COPS in schools program. In addition, COPS has dedicated approximately $21 million to training COPS-funded SROs and the school administrator in the partnering schools or school districts to work more collaboratively through the CIS program. 
   The CIS grant program provides a maximum federal contribution of up to $125,000 per officer position over a three year period, with any remaining costs to be paid with local funds. To find more information of CIS or COPS please visit the Department of Justice website at www.cops.usdoj.gov.
