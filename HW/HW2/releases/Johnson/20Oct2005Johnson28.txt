SEN. JOHNSON JOINS SENATE ANTI-METH CAUCUS
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that he has joined the newly formed Senate Anti-Meth Caucus to reduce the use of methamphetamine (meth) and draw attention to this important issue.  
   "The goal of the caucus is to fight the manufacture, use and distribution of meth," Johnson said. "Meth use has devastating effects on individuals, families and entire communities. I will continue working with Congress and community groups to ensure that the problem of meth is adequately addressed, especially in rural areas." 
   The caucus will address three issues: needs of law enforcement, opportunities for treatment and prevention. 
   Johnson has introduced legislation in the Senate that would mandate that a portion of the Forfeiture Fund, administered by the Department of Treasury, be made available distinctly for methamphetamine lab clean-up. As well, Johnson has cosponsored comprehensive anti-meth legislation with Senator Jim Talent (R-MO), which has broad bipartisan support. The legislation would limit access to excessive amounts of cold medicines that contain pseudophedrine, a major component of methamphetamines. The bill continues to allow states to set penalties for violations of the law. 
   Meth is a highly addictive, powerful, and toxic drug that can be made in many variations using materials that are often readily available and completely legal to purchase. It has been linked to many serious mental and physical health conditions, including memory loss, psychotic behavior, and heart and brain damage. It also creates aggressive behavior and can lead to increased risk-taking.
