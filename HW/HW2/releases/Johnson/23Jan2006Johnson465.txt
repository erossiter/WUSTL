SEN. JOHNSON CONGRATULATES RAPID CITY NATIVE ON FULBRIGHT SCHOLARSHIP
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) congratulated Kristin White of Rapid City on her selection as a recipient of the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship for the 2005-2006 academic year.  
 Kristin is currently studying political science and culture in Osaka, Japan.
   "All South Dakotans can be proud of this extraordinary accomplishment. Kristin's selection from hundreds of scholars nationwide is a reflection of her outstanding professional and academic achievement. I am pleased that she is continuing her academic pursuits while representing the United States abroad," Johnson said.
   Kristin is the daughter of Jim and Kathy White of Rapid City and attended Stevens High School. She graduated from St. Olaf College in Minnesota in 2005 and has been studying in Japan since the beginning of this academic year.
   "Kristin's participation in the Fulbright program will help to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of Japan, through the exchange of culture, knowledge, and skills. Upon returning to the U.S., Kristin's experiences will be a valuable resource for years to come," Johnson continued.
   The Fulbright Program was established by Congress in 1946 in order to cultivate mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people around the world. Through the Fulbright Program, more than a quarter of a million people have participated in exchanges in over 150 countries worldwide. Selection for a Fulbright award is based on academic or professional achievement, as well as a demonstrated potential for leadership in a particular field of study.
