SEN. JOHNSON RECEIVES 'A' GRADE FROM NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
  The National Education Association (NEA) recently gave Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) an 'A' on its Congressional Report Card for his efforts on education-related issues in the first session of the 109th Congress. 
   "Senator Johnson has demonstrated a strong commitment to education throughout his service in Congress," said Donna DeKraai, President of the South Dakota Education Association, which is affiliated with the national organization. "The SDEA greatly appreciates the open lines of communication we have with Senator Johnson and his staff on education issues."
   "Our children deserve quality public education and access to affordable and quality post-secondary education," Johnson said. "I have been a strong supporter of initiatives to reduce classroom size, fully fund the federal obligation to special education, repair our crumbling schools, and give our teachers the tools they need to help children succeed. I am truly honored to receive such a high mark for my commitment to continually improving our children's education."
   The NEA Congressional Report Card measures support for public education and educators from Members of Congress. The NEA bases its grade on the Senator's or Representative's votes on education-related legislation in Congress. It also incorporates several other criteria into the overall evaluation, including cosponsorship of bills, work in committees, accessibility, and education advocacy both in Congress and in their home states.
