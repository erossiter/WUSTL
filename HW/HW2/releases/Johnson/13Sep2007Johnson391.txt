SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES PENNINGTON COUNTY WILL RECEIVE $898,752 TO HELP DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that Pennington County will receive two grants totaling $898,752 to help advance programs to protect domestic violence victims. The federal grants are from the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women (OVW).  
   Both grants will help advance the mission of the Domestic Violence Coordinated Action Response Enforcement Team (DV C.A.R.E. Team) to provide more protection and services to victims.
   "It is my hope this funding for Pennington County will expand the resources available to victims of domestic violence and allow authorities to prosecute acts of domestic violence more efficiently," Johnson said. "This kind of grant enables communities and law enforcement to increase prevention programs and provide victims with resources they might otherwise not have access to due to lack of funding." 
   Pennington County Commission will receive a $399,278 grant to enhance victim safety and offender accountability. The funding will be used to partner with Working Against Violence, Inc. to implement the DV C.A.R.E. Team, train specialized officers to deal with domestic violence cases and help monitor victims protected by court order. 
   The Sheriff's Office in Pennington County will use the other grant, $499,474 to enhance victim safety and encourage communities to develop education and prevention strategies in rural areas. The Sheriff's Department will use this grant to improve agency and community response to domestic violence, plan with community partners to make the DV C.A.R.E. Team a sustainable project and improve victim protection while holding domestic violence offenders accountable.
