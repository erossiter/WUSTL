SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES $42,353 TO LAKOTA FUND
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the Lakota Fund on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation will receive $42,353 to fund the Assets for Independence Demonstration Program (IDA Program).  
   "I am pleased that the Lakota Fund will receive this assistance to promote consumer awareness," Johnson said. "This program is extremely helpful for people as they establish their first homes or businesses or pursue higher education." 
   The Lakota Fund community development organization assists Oglala Lakota Oyate (people) on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. It is the first and only financial development institution on the reservation. 
   The IDA Program teaches project participants about economic and consumer issues and enables them to establish matching savings accounts called Individual Development Accounts (IDA) in order to save for a first home, a business or higher education. This funding will be provided by United States Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Office of Community Services.
