SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON USDA SCRAPPING PLANS TO CLOSE FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICES
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today applauded the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for halting their ill-conceived Farm Service Agency (FSA) consolidation plan.  
   "The USDA has made the right choice on halting these closures. Face-to-face communication between service center employees and producers encourages proper Farm Bill implementation and ensures that our farmers and ranchers have access to important USDA program information and assistance," said Johnson. 
   "I'm pleased that the USDA came to their senses on this issue. I found it troublesome that the USDA even initiated the process of FSA service center consolidation without public notice or comment," continued Johnson. 
   The USDA's closure plan, "FSA Tomorrow," would have closed more than 700 FSA offices nationally and 14 service centers in South Dakota. Johnson requested a hearing in late September which was to be held on October 20. In May of this year, Johnson sent a letter to Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns expressing concern about the initial stages of the consolidation plans and urged the department to incorporate producers in the process. 
   The plan would have potentially closed or consolidated more than 700 FSA offices throughout the country. The USDA was considering 14 office sites in South Dakota for closure, which represents 24% of the service centers in the state.
