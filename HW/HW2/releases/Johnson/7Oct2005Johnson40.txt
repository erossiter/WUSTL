SEN. JOHNSON DEFENDS AMERICAN BEEF INDUSTRY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today joined with a bipartisan group of colleagues in calling for retaliatory economic measures against Japan in response to the continued impasse in negotiations to resume the exportation of U.S. beef to that nation.  
   "It is now clear that Japan is simply using this issue to maintain an unwarranted and unjustified trade barrier," the Senators wrote to the U.S. Trade Representative. "On behalf of the farmers, ranchers, and communities that comprise the American beef industry, we respectfully ask you to employ economic sanctions on the import of Japanese goods into the U.S. at a level comparable to the losses incurred by the beef industry." 
   Johnson joined with nineteen other Senators in writing a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman requesting that he employ economic measures against Japan as efforts to resume regular beef trade with that nation have stalled. The Senators cited the repeated demands for excessive documentation and paperwork by the Japanese Food Safety Commission (FSC) and others within the Japanese government - none of which reflect the internationally accepted guidelines on BSE. 
   "U.S. producers are responsible for the safest beef supply in the world, and they deserve to have fair trade policies in place to reflect that," Johnson said. "In the face of opening the border to Canada and the continued controversy over Japanese trade policies, it is as important as ever that we publicize the origins of beef products. At the very least, by implementing Country-of-Origin Labeling consumers at home and abroad can know that beef from the U.S. is U.S. beef." 
   The beef industry loses $100 million each month that the Japanese market remains closed. Japan banned importation of U.S. beef in December 2003.
