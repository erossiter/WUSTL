SEN. JOHNSON HOSTS ROUNDTABLE ON METH IN ABERDEEN
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today hosted a Roundtable on Meth to discuss awareness and prevention with law enforcement and local citizens who are working to stop the spread of meth throughout the Aberdeen area. 
   "Meth is one of the most dangerous problems facing rural America today, and we must do everything we can to stop the toll it is taking on South Dakota's communities," said Johnson. "The valuable work done by those involved in the fight against meth to raise awareness of this epidemic can be seen from the community level on up to Congress."
   Johnson updated the group, including Monica Hale, Aberdeen Meth Prevention Coordinator; Don Lanpher, Jr., Aberdeen Chief of Police; Stacey Nelson, South Dakota Social Service's Child Protection Services Director, and others on recent meth legislation and thanked them for the excellent service they are providing to their community. 
   The PATRIOT Act reauthorization, which was signed into law by the President on March 9, 2006, includes anti-meth legislation based on the Combat Meth Act of 2005. The Combat Meth Act of 2005, which Johnson cosponsored, contains provisions that would limit access to large quantities of cold medicines that contain pseudophedrine, a major component of methamphetamines. 
   Additionally, Johnson's bipartisan Federal Emergency Meth Lab Cleanup Funding Act would make funding available from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund for state, local or tribal law enforcement agencies for the clean up expenses of meth labs. This would allow the funds seized from meth manufacturers to be used for the costly cleanup of their labs.
