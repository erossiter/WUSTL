SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VA APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced his support today for the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill currently being considered by the full Senate, which may pass the Senate today or tomorrow. The bill contains more than $29 million for South Dakota projects including the Ellsworth Air Force Base Civil Engineer Administrative Facility, the South Dakota Air National Guard Base Civil Engineer Maintenance Complex, and increases to medical services and care for veterans. 
  "I am pleased to be back in the United States Senate to vote for this bill, which is a major step forward for veterans and soldiers in South Dakota and across the county. I want to thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Reed for their assistance in getting this vital legislation before the full Senate," said Johnson, Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. "Our service members deserve access to top notch, quality care and this funding will ensure veterans and those returning home get the assistance they need."
  The Senate bill totals $109.2 billion in funding for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies. Of that amount, $64.7 billion is in discretionary funding, which is $4 billion above the President's budget request. $3.6 billion of the $4 billion increase is for the Veterans Affairs Department (VA), primarily for health care.
