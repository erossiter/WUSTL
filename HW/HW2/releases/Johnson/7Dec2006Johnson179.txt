SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES LAND-BUYBACK MEASURE PASSES SENATE
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced that the Senate passed S. 2205, the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act of 2006, to allow landowners in central South Dakota to repurchase property in what would have been the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Irrigation Project. Johnson is a cosponsor of the bill, and has introduced similar legislation in the past. 
 "This will give people a fair shake at buying back their land since the irrigation project never became a reality. The Bureau of Reclamation, the state, and local residents have grappled with a fair solution for nearly 40 years, it is long past time a sensible solution like this is put into place," Johnson said. 
 The bill allows landowners in Hughes and Stanley County the option of purchasing back their lands acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation for the now-defunct construction of the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal projects. Envisioned in Hughes, Stanley, and Sully counties, the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal were designed to provide a 190,000 acre irrigation project surrounding portions of Lake Oahe but the project never came to fruition.
 This legislation would allow preferential leaseholders - original landowners or their descendents, or operators of the land at the time of purchase - to repurchase their property. Additionally, lands not leased by preferential leaseholders or unleased lands will be transferred to the state to help alleviate damage to fish and wildlife habitats. 
 The bill will now move to the House of Representatives for consideration.
