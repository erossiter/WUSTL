  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that the City of Sisseton will receive a $135,960 federal grant from the Department of Justice to reduce gang violence through education and training.

"This funding is a step in the right direction, and will provide the City of Sisseton with the resources necessary to provide education and training opportunities and curb gang violence."
   Incidences of gang violence in rural communities continue to rise. 
  The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. Funding will be used to continue the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program, designed to provide students with the skills necessary to avoid gang pressure and youth violence. The program will be implemented by the Sisseton Police Department with cooperation from local schools and agencies.
