SEN. JOHNSON ANNOUNCES NEW VA CLINICS IN WATERTOWN & WAGNER
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD), as Chairman of the Senate Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will open two new community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in Watertown, SD and Wagner, SD within the next year. The clinic were among 38 approved in 22 states by VA Secretary James Nicholson.  
   At an April 12 hearing before Johnson's MilCon/VA Subcommittee, Johnson submitted a question for Secretary Nicholson asking for an update on these two facilities as the VA had already submitted business plans for these facilities in this fiscal year. Johnson has been a long-time advocate of fully funding the VA and bringing services to our veterans. 
   "Our veterans face long drives to get to the VA in Sioux Falls. These two new CBOCs in Wagner and Watertown will certainly help bring health care closer to home for many of our veterans. As the Chairman of the MilCon/VA Appropriations Subcommittee, I knew that the business plans had been submitted for the facilities and that they were in the works. After pushing for years, it's good to see that they will now become a reality," Johnson said. 
   Services will include comprehensive primary care, health promotion, maintenance, routine/urgent care procedures and education. The CBOC is established to improve access to veterans in rural areas to primary and specialty care. The CBOC will be located in an area that will greatly reduce the veteran's drive time.
