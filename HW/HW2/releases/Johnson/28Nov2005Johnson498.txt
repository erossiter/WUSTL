SEN. JOHNSON ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO WINTER STORM CURRENTLY HITTING SOUTH DAKOTA
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) releases the following statement in response to the winter storm currently hitting South Dakota:
   "It is clear that this storm has already disrupted the lives of many South Dakotans. My staff and I continue to monitor the situation and have been in touch with the South Dakota Department of Public Safety, several of the state's public utility companies, as well as the appropriate federal agencies. Dealing with winter storms is certainly not new to South Dakotans. However, it is important to be prepared for when the skies clear and the wind stops."
