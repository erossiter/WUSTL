COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS FUNDING PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, announced funding levels expected to be approved today by the Senate in the Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill. The bill includes $3.75 million in projects Johnson requested for Indian Country, and now must be reconciled with the House passed Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill.  
   "Crime on South Dakota's Indian reservations is statistically higher than non-native communities," Johnson said. "This bill will help alleviate that situation by providing funding directly to tribal law enforcement to increase safety for our tribal members and our Indian communities, and combat meth."
