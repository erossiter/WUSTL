SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON DEDICATION OF MCGOVERN LIBRARY
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) today commented on the dedication of the McGovern Library and Center for Leadership and Public Service on the campus of Dakota Wesleyan University. About honoring Sen. George McGovern, Johnson remarked: 
   These days, we hear a lot of discussion about the role of values in the public sphere. I think we can all learn a lot from the example set over the years by outstanding public servants like George and Eleanor McGovern. 
   For children growing up today, it might seem far-fetched to think that they could one-day have a major role in world affairs. Senator McGovern showed us not only that it is possible to reach to such heights, but that you can get there while staying true to your values. 
   These lessons are truly an inspiration to me, and I am deeply heartened to know that the institution we dedicate today will help to preserve and share these lessons with future generations.
   I find it immensely satisfying to know that countless students will have the opportunity to learn more about this amazing leader and his legacy of service to our nation here at the McGovern Library and Center for Public Service.
