SENATE PASSES NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES PRESERVATION ACT
Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced that the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act of 2006 (H.R.4766) unanimously passed in the Senate, with his support. This bill includes grant programs for the restoration of Native American Languages in schools and communities.  
 "Native Languages continue to diminish with each generation and the programs authorized by this bill will go a long way to restore this important piece of Native culture and bridge the gap between the old and young generations," said Johnson. "After countless efforts on this bill, I'm happy to see it passed by the full Senate."
 Johnson has been a long time supporter of programs that recognize the importance of Native Languages and the efforts that need to be made to preserve them. Johnson is an original co-sponsor to similar legislation, the Native American Languages Act Amendments Act of 2006.
 This bill will now be sent to the President and he is expected to sign it into law.
