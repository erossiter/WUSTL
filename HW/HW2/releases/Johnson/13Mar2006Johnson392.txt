SEN. JOHNSON COMMENTS ON POSSIBLE CASE OF BSE IN U.S.
  Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in response to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcing an inconclusive result in the testing of an animal through USDA's mad cow surveillance program. USDA will be conducting additional tests on this inconclusive result. At this time, USDA has released no information on the animal, including the animal's country of origin.  
   "Much like in past instances of inconclusive tests, we need to take a deep breath and wait for the final results. The U.S. has the safest food supply in the world, and I have the greatest confidence in the food our farmers and ranchers produce. 
   "That said, we must take steps to maintain consumer confidence in American beef for our domestic market and trading partners. The best way to do that is by implementing mandatory country-of-origin-labeling (COOL)."
