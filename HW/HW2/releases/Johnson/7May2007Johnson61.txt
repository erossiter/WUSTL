SEN. JOHNSON: FUNDING MEANS OPPORTUNITY, JOB GROWTH FOR TRIPP COUNTY
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the Tripp County Water Users District will receive a $2.4 million low-interest federal loan and a $908,000 grant that will be used to expand its water infrastructure. The loan is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   "It is critical that our communities get the proper infrastructure they need to grow and this funding is an important investment that will improve water systems in Tripp County," said Johnson. "A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding for water infrastructure expansion is a wonderful example of that kind of investment." 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
