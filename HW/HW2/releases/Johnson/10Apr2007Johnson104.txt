SEN. JOHNSON OFFICE ANNOUNCES $108,000 LOAN FOR TRENT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT
  Sen. Tim Johnson's (D-SD) office announced today that the City of Trent will receive a $108,000 loan to improve its water infrastructure. The low-interest federal loan is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development.  
   The funds will be used to connect the Town of Trent to the Big Sioux Rural Water System, because the current well water has nitrate contamination. The improvements will provide safe and dependable water to 254 residents in Trent. 
   As part of his Hometown Prosperity Plan, a four-pillar agenda for promoting economic development in South Dakota, Senator Johnson has pledged to defend USDA Rural Development infrastructure programs against proposed budget cuts. Johnson refers to these programs as an example of his strategy of "Investing in the Public Good," which means directing federal funds to initiatives that pay themselves back in the form of job creation and higher quality of life for South Dakotans. 
   Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks." The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
