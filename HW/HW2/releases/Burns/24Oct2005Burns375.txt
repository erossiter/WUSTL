SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES TELEHEALTH BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today introduced the "Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act of 2005," a bill that would improve the provisions of telehealth services under the Medicare Program and provide grants for the development of telehealth networks. Burns' comments regarding this bill will be made available via satellite feed today at 1:45pm MT.  
   "We have been seeing shortages of nurses, radiologists, mental health providers, and other health professionals for quite some time," said Burns. "Telehealth has been a proven solution to this mounting crisis, and I have long supported efforts in technology to improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare, and make it easier for folks in rural areas to get the health services they need. Telehealth is one answer to the access and affordability issues in health care, and this bill would increase the ease with which folks get critical health services." 
   Thelma McClosky Armstrong, Director, Eastern Montana Telemedicine Network, and President, American Telemedicine Association said: "As President of the American Telemedicine Association and Director of the Eastern Montana Telemedicine Network, I am pleased to express our 
  full support for the significant and wide-reaching efforts of Senator Burns to advance the efficient delivery of high-quality health care services through telehealth. This bill offers a tremendous opportunity to expand Medicare coverage for telehealth, and will improve the access to quality health care services delivered to the citizens of Montana as well as our nation?s rural residents." 
   Burns added: "Telehealth applications have a proven record of cutting costs, increasing choice and reducing medical errors in facilities across the country. As the Medicare population continues to increase, this is an important issue we need to focus on," According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our fastest growing population is people 85 years of age and older, and it is estimated that by 2050, there will be two billion older persons in the world, compared to 600 million today. 
   He continued: "The demographics in Montana have been changing over the past few years, and our health care providers continue to see more patients over the age of 65. We now have more elderly per capita than most states in the union, and by 2025, the State of Montana is predicted to rank third in the nation in the number of people over the age of 65. My bill will expand services to this population." 
   Burns' Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act of 2005 would: 
   * Facilitate the provision of telehealth services across state lines and call for Medicare reimbursement for remote medical and health services for all remaining institutions eligible to participate in Medicare, but not currently eligible to be reimbursed for telemedicine/telehealth services; 
   * Include an expansion of Medicare-covered originating telehealth sites, prioritizing eligibility for nursing homes, dialysis centers, and community-based mental health centers; 
   * Revise 'originating site' language to ensure telehealth service providers are reimbursement-eligible when patients are located at sites with telehealth capabilities, regardless of originating site designation; 
   * Expand Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services to all geographical areas, recognizing eligibility for telehealth sites among urban populations as well as rural and underserved populations; 
   * Allow for 'eligible practitioners' furnishing telehealth services to include physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and other certified providers, as well as any others the Secretary of Health and Human Services approves; 
   * Amend Medicare coverage to all remaining medical services currently covered under the CPT procedure codes, but not eligible to be reimbursed when provided via telemedicine/telehealth, and medical services that are provided using store-and-forward technology; 
   * Authorize a grant program through the Office for the Advancement of telehealth of Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the development of telehealth networks and defines nonprofit and for-profit alliances as grant-eligible, provided the grant recipient is a nonprofit; 
   * Reauthorizes the Telehealth Network and Telehealth Resource Centers grant programs through 2012.
