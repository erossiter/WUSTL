SEN. BURNS LISTENS TO LIBBY RESIDENTS ON ASBESTOS ISSUE
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today met with 30 Libby residents by videoconference to listen to their expectations on asbestos reform, which will be debated in the Senate the week of February 6. Sen.  
 Burns has been instrumental in achieving assistance for Libby residents in the bill, but concedes more must be done. 
   Senator Burns heard from different residents their stories of early deaths, family members with serious diseases, and deep concerns about asbestos exposure to children. 
   Les Skramstad, a Libby resident, today said, "Libby's the eye of the storm" for asbestos exposure. He also said, for any legislative remedy, "time is of the essence." 
   Senator Burns has been pushing for inclusion of a so-called DLCO provision, the lung diffusion capacity test, which would include 40% more Libby residents than the current language would. 
   Attending today's meeting were Libby Mayor Tony Berget, Lincoln County Commissioner Rita Windom, and KLCB radio's Duane Williams. 
   Gayla Benefield, a Libby resident, today thanked Senator Burns for hosting the videoconference, and for his work representing Libby residents on asbestos reform Benefield also indicated that any payment, "should include pain and suffering" for Libby residents. 
   Senator Burns said, "It was very useful to hear from Libby residents today. We need to keep these lines of communication open, and I'll make sure my office and Libby residents are talking everyday. This will be a pivotal week for asbestos reform, and I look forward to making sure that any solution meets Libby residents' expectations."
