SEN. BURNS: SMALL BUSINESSES NEED HEALTH CARE RELIEF
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, testified today regarding Association Health Plans (AHPs) and their potential to increase opportunities for small businesses to provide health care coverage for employees.  
   "We need to increase access and affordability, and take action that reduces the cost of health care to employers and employees," said Burns. "We must also ensure any solution is not designed as a 'one-size-fits-all' because what works in Manhattan, New York is not likely to work in Manhattan, Montana. Small businesses in Montana, and across the nation are asking for us to take action. As we find the solution we must make sure that it enhances competition in the market place both for the insurers as well as small businesses competing for employees. But we cannot create a system that only changes the cost burden from premiums to increased taxes for 'government funded premiums.' Montanans know that anything the 'government pays for' comes out of their pocket." 
   Burns expressed concern over States Rights issues that may be raised over a national plan. He also said the spiraling health care costs must be addressed, and that AHPs may be the right way to go to provide an affordable alternative for small businesses in Montana to provide health care coverage for their employees. 
   Senator Burns reiterated the need to find a workable solution for the small businesses that have low margins and few employees, and identified S.406 as a step in the right direction. S.406, introduced by Sen. Snowe (R-Maine) would allow employers to join together to purchase health care coverage. He said that while some states have had varied experiences with AHPs, something needs to be done to address the needs of uninsured Montanans.
