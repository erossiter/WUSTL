SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $2.6 MILLION TO REDUCE MONTANA HOME ENERGY COSTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released the weatherization figures for fiscal year (FY) 2006, totaling $243 million nationally. The first installment of this plan will be a $140.3 million grant to more than 30 states, including Montana. 
  Montana's statewide weatherization program will directly receive $2.6 million. Weatherization renovations help reduce energy costs by increasing energy efficiency. These renovations include reducing air infiltration, increasing insulation, servicing the heating and cooling systems, and providing health and safety diagnostics. This grant is expected to reduce an average home's energy costs by up to $358 per year. The Energy Department's plan of weatherization returns $1.53 for every dollar spent. 
  Thirty-one states are receiving grant money and improvements now with the remaining 19 states receiving funds later this year. Weatherization renovations have already had numerous benefits in addition to energy efficiency by increasing job creation, property value, housing affordability, and household safety across the country. 
  Senator Burns said today, "I'm pleased to announce that DOE will be helping deliver lower energy bills for hard working Montanans. Weatherization can really increase the quality of living for many low-income Montanans. Weatherization is a form of conservation, and that is another important step toward solving our growing domestic energy needs."
  U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said, "Weatherizing your home is a valuable way to save energy and money. The Department of Energy's weatherization program will help nearly 97,000 families make their homes more energy efficient."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Energy and Appropriations Committees.
