SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR TWO MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that Anaconda and Power Fire Departments will receive funding through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 Anaconda Fire Department will receive $52,714 to go towards operations and fire safety, and Power Volunteer Fire Department will receive $85,500 to go towards a new firefighting vehicle.
   "Blazing fires can be a challenge to battle out in the field, and it takes not only adequate training, but also up-to-date equipment to get the job done," said Burns. "When our men and women are working to put fires out, they deserve the best gear and training out there, and this funding will go a long way in prepping two of our fire departments for the tough jobs they face everyday."
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of all current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
