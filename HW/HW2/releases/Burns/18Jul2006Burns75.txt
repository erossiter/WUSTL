SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES GREAT FALLS PROJECTS ADVANCE TOWARD FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that at least four major defense and military construction appropriation projects for Great Falls have been included in an Appropriations bill that is expected to be approved by their respective subcommittees today and the full Senate Appropriation Committee Thursday. 
   The following projects are advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Defense and Military Construction Appropriations bills:
   * Montana Air National Guard: Air Combat Training Range - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for MANG to develop an Air Combat Training Range to help increase effectiveness and entice other units to come train in Montana. This will also support the 120th Fighter Wing transition from F-16's to F-15's.
   * Precision Lift: Army Aircraft Maintenance Platform Fall Protection System - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to Monarch and all of Cascade County for these platforms which allow aircraft mechanics to work on helicopter engines and rotors without the risk of falling 10 to 15 feet. These platforms are now an Occupation and Safety Health Administration (OSHA) standard and will increase maintenance efficiency while improving safety for maintenance personnel.
   * Malmstrom / Great Falls: Family Housing - Senator Burns expects to deliver federal funding for 493 units of family housing on Malmstrom AFB and in the surrounding Great Falls community. This level of funding is equal to the President's fiscal year 2007 budget and the House bill.
   * Air National Guard: Operations and Training Facility - Senator Burns expects to deliver federal funding for this facility for the 120th Fighter Wing Headquarters and flight preparation to replace this 1950's building.
   * Air National Guard: Deployment Processing Facility - Senator Burns expects to deliver federal funding for this facility which will facilitate large units deploying from Great Falls International Airport. This will save troops from having to wait for their airlift in the hangar. 
   "These Great Falls area projects are critical to maintaining our state's key role in our national defense," said Senator Burns. "I have worked with my colleagues and local folks to make sure these projects are a high priority."
   "I am pleased that these projects moved through the subcommittee and hope they make it through the whole process for federal funding," said Colonel Mark Meyer, Commander of the Montana Air National Guard. "They certainly add value to our nations military and will strengthen MANG"S capability to defend our country."
   "Outstanding, thank you Senator Burns," said Greg Schwandt, Chairman of the Committee of 80. "To those who think we don't need Conrad Burns in the United States Senate or that seniority doesn't help Conrad Burns deliver for Montana and our veterans, all I can say is 'Nuts'. Keep up the great work, we appreciate it and so do our military families on duty everyday."
   Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees.
