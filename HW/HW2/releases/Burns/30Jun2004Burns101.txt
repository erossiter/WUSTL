SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON U.S. ? MEXICO TELECOMMUNICATION AGREEMENTS
  "I am pleased that the State Department and the FCC were able to reach an agreement with the Government of Mexico to resolve the problem of AM radio interference across the border between our two countries," said Burns.  
 "In particular, three AM stations located in Mexico will be required to bring their operations into compliance with bilateral agreements along the border as they had recently been causing interference with U.S. AM stations in California and other states. I salute the parties for their work to eliminate interference in public-safety communications along the border. I look forward to supporting continued cooperative relations between telecommunications authorities in the U.S. and Mexico in the future."
