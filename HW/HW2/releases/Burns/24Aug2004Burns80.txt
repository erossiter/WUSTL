SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON KOOTENAI NATIONAL FOREST RULING
 "I am happy that today's ruling will start moving timber harvest again on the Kootenai National Forest," said Burns.  
 "I am pleased that my Flathead and Kootenai National Forest Rehabilitation Act aided in making today's decision possible, which frees up 20 million board of timber for five timber sales on the forest. Today's decision will help improve forest health by thinning overstocked timber stands and removing trees susceptible to insects and disease. It will also reverse some of the uncertainty that has put too many loggers and mill workers out of business in recent years. After years of fires and destruction I'm glad I was able to be a part of this commonsense solution."
