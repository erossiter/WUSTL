SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $1.6 MILLION VOCA GRANT FOR MONTANA VICTIMS OF CRIME
  Sen. Burns (R-Mont.) today announced the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) at the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the Montana Board of Crime Control a $1,647,000 grant to fund crime victim services in Montana. This was awarded by the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) under the Victims of Crime Act 1984 (VOCA), which are competitively distributed by the state to local community-based organizations to provide their services for victims of crime. 
  Senator Burns said, "I support the use of heavy fines and penalties for criminals convicted of federal crimes to support our crime victims in Montana."
  Each year funding for VOCA grants are obtained through forfeitures and fine collections. The 50 states, the District of Columbia, and numerous U.S. territories are eligible for and receive VOCA assistance grants starting with a base amount of $500,000. States and territories are distributed additional funds based on population.
  CVF funds raise millions of dollars each year from criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments from offenders convicted of federal crimes. Collections come from U.S. Attorneys' Offices, federal U.S. courts, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, not from taxpayers.
  The VOCA assistance grant will help Montana Board of Crime Control services in crisis intervention, emergency shelter, emergency transportation, counseling, and criminal justice advocacy. The Board of Crime Control is the state's designated planning and program development agency for the criminal justice system. The Board provides funding to local, regional, and statewide projects with the central goal of making Montana a safer state.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and three-term U.S. Senator.
