SEN. BURNS, LABOR SECRETARY CHAO ANNOUNCE $5 MILLION WIRED INITIATIVE FOR CENTRAL, EASTERN MONTANA
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) and U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao today announced Montana has been granted a $5 million annual award for the Workforce Innovation in Rural Economic Development (WIRED) Initiative, intended to provide workforce innovation in regional and rural economic development to communities across the country.  
   The award is $5 million per year for up to three years, and was announced by Burns and Chao on a conference call with Montana reporters. The WIRED Initiative is focusing on labor market areas affected by global trade, natural disasters, or reliant on a single industry. The funding will be used to support innovative approaches to education and workforce development beyond traditional strategies to prepare workers to compete and succeed locally and globally. 
   Senator Burns said, "I am pleased the administration is supporting central and eastern Montana with the WIRED Initiative. We need rural economic development in Montana, to create highly skilled workers in a global economy. This important announcement will help 32 countries across Montana and six Indian reservations, helping communities hit hard by extreme drought over the past seven years. I'll continue to support providing career training to maintain our competitiveness in Montana." 
   The WIRED Initiative will foster the creation of innovative biolubricants and bioproduct manufacturing embryonic clusters in central and eastern Montana.
