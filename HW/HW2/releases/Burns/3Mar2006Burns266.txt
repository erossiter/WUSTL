SEN. BURNS JOINS NATIONAL GUARD, 'APPRENTICE' WINNER PERDEW, PRO WRESTLING SUPERSTAR IN HONORING MONTANA YOUTHS
  Sen. Conrad Burns today met with 2 young Montanans who are enrolled in the Montana Youth ChalleNGe Program, a program through the National Guard that intervenes in the lives of at-risk teenagers.  
   The Youth ChalleNGe Program targets 16-18 year olds who have dropped out of school, are drug-free and not in trouble with the law. The program offers a 17 month that offers mentoring and character building activities to at-risk youth to help them "develop the life skills, educational levels, and employment potential" to succeed in life. 
   The Montana Cadets received the 2005 USO award for health and hygiene. The Cadets, Merrybeth James, 16 from Missoula, and Raquel Correa, 17 from Billings, attended the awards ceremony with Major General Randy Mosely of the Montana National Guard. 
   Also honoring the award recipients from around the country at the ceremony were Kelly Perdew, winner of the hit TV show "The Apprentice," World Wresting Entertainment Commentator Chris Nowinski, and Josh Gracin, recording artist, one of the runners-up on American Idol and Corporal in the U.S. Marines. 
   Senator Burns said, "This is a great program and these are great kids. Merrybeth and Raquel are exceptionally nice, polite, and very bright young women. I know they're going to have brilliant futures ahead of them. I'm proud of them and the more than 900 other Montanans who have graduated from the Montana Youth ChalleNGe Program. I encourage anyone who knows an at-risk teen to consider this program to help turn a life around."
