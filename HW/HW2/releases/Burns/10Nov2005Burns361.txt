SEN. BURNS HOLDS HEARING ON WRIGHT AMENDMENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, held a hearing today in order to help mitigate a long-standing conflict between Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and the Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport.  
 Burns' status as Chairman puts him squarely in charge of monitoring the aviation industry, and providing congressional oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Airports Improvement Program. Burns' comments during the hearing will be made available today via satellite feed at 1:45 pm MT.
   The Wright Amendment, enacted in 1979, was intended as a compromise between Dallas - Fort Worth Airport and Southwest Airlines by limiting flights from Dallas' Love Field in Texas to Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and later to Kansas, Mississippi and Alabama. 
   "I believe this issue should be looked at in a larger, more comprehensive context," said Burns. "While much of the controversy surrounding the possible repeal of the Wright Amendment is local and regional, make no mistake, it will certainly affect our entire aviation system." 
   Witnesses at today's hearing include: Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson, Kay Granger and Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Chairman and CEO of American Airlines Gerard Arpey, Chairman of the Board of Southwest Airlines Kerb Kelleher, and COO and Senior Executive Vice President of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport Kevin Cox.
