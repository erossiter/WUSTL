SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S NEW OVERTIME REGULATIONS
  "I am pleased to see the Department of Labor's final regulations on the exemptions from overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) move forward this week," said Burns.  
 "Now, workers earning less than $23,660 per year - or $455 per week - are guaranteed overtime protection. Hardworking Montanans deserve to be compensated for what they do, and this new law will allow many more workers to qualify for overtime pay that they did not qualify for under previous regulations. In fact, these new regulations will strengthen overtime rights for 6.7 million American workers, including 1.3 million low-wage workers, and I am happy to see such a big step in the effort to safeguard the rights of hardworking men and women across the country."
