SEN. BURNS: WE SUPPORT STATE OF ISRAEL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) released the following statement expressing his continued support for the state of Israel and sincere condolences to those who have lost their lives in terrorist attacks: 
   "There can be no safe haven for terrorists. Hamas has refused to recognize Israel and disavow violence, and has continued to use every means at their disposal to attack Israel. Now Hezbollah has attacked Israel from Lebanon. The government of Lebanon has had plenty of time to bring Hezbollah under control. We continue to support the democracy in Lebanon, but democracy is not a free ticket to harbor terrorist organizations. Hezbollah is an international terrorist organization that is well known to be controlled and supported by Iran. They have had a free hand in southern Lebanon for far too long. This is just one more case of Iran using terrorist organizations and intelligence operatives to undermine democracies throughout the Middle East."
   Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Subcommittees.
