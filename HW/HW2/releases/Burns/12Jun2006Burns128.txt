We look forward to working with Senator Burns on future projects that benefit everyone."

"Our friends on the Fort Peck Reservation are an important piece of the energy independence solution, and I've been happy to work with them these past years on initiatives like this that contribute to economic development and strengthen communities. This is one more step in the right direction, creating tribal jobs and new opportunities for the Tribes."
