SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH ENERGY SECRETARY ON PROPOSED HIGHER BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION RATES FOR MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement after a bi-partisan meeting this afternoon with U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman regarding proposed rate increases to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in the president's 2007 budget:  
   "I was pleased with Sec. Bodman's willingness to meet with us and engage in open discussion about the administration's BPA proposal. Senators Craig, Cantwell, Smith, Wyden and I shared our honest opinions and provided historical perspective about Northwest power issues and how they affect our home states. Since I joined the Energy Committee in 1989 we have fought these Northwest energy battles many, many times, and I'll continue to defend the power supply that over 100,000 Montana families and business depend on to power their homes. The tone of today's meeting was respectful and we all agreed to keep working together on improving the flexibility and accountability of the Northwest's main energy supplier. It was a good first step forward, and we'll keep working together to address this challenge." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a three term U.S. senator.
