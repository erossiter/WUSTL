SEN. BURNS WELCOMES RENEWED CHANCE TO DELIVER ASBESTOS BILL FOR LIBBY VICTIMS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement regarding the introduction of a revised version of the asbestos bill: 
  "I applaud Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter for introducing a revised version of the asbestos bill. I just held a conference call with a group of Libby residents to make sure they knew the Libby provisions have not changed, but only general improvements were made to win additional Senate support. Back on February 14, we were merely one vote shy of the 60 vote threshold to move the bill forward. I am pleased to see that we may have another shot at working on the asbestos bill. We are reviewing the bill right now and I am certain improvements will need to be made for Libby, including my lung diffusion capacity amendment to broaden coverage for Libby claimants. I look forward to speedy consideration of this measure and a vote on my amendment to improve the Libby provisions."
