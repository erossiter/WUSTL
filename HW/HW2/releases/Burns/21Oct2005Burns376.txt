SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF TRANSPORTATION, TREASURY, THE JUDICIARY, HUD, RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The full Senate voted last night 93-1 to approve the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. This bill funds the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Federal Judiciary and Supreme Court, Amtrak and the Federal Election Commission.  
   Included in the bill is $1.45 billion for Amtrak, $250 million above last year's appropriation. Amtrak, which operates over 22,000 route miles and serves over 24 million passengers a year is one of the nation's most relied upon transportation systems. In Montana, Amtrak serves over 140,000 passengers per year, and brings more than $13 million in annual economic benefit. "I'm happy to see the Senate designate more to Amtrak than we did last year," said Burns. "As this process moves along I'll be working hand in hand with my colleagues in both houses of Congress to make sure Amtrak has the resources it needs to continue servicing the American people in a self-sufficient and effective manner." 
   The Federal Aviation Administration's operation is funded at $8.176 billion, $463 million more than the fiscal year 2005 level. From that funding, $3.5 billion will go into the nation's Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which funds runway improvements, terminal modifications and other important capacity and safety projects at airports. "Funding like this is critical to a state as vast as Montana," said Burns. "We'd be lost without a well-functioning transportation system, so I am committed to making sure our airports are able to operate at peak performance." 
   The Essential Air Service Program (EAS), which is funded through the Airport and Airway trust fund, is funded at a level of $110 million. The EAS program subsidizes freight and passenger flights to eight cities in Montana including Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Lewistown, Miles City, Sidney, West Yellowstone and Wolf Point. Burns is a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation. The Subcommittee on Aviation maintains jurisdiction over the Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, Aviation Industry, Aviation Safety, Aviation Trust Fund, and Airport Improvement Program. 
   Burns also included an amendment that extends a program put into place following September 11, 2001, that states air carriers must honor the tickets of bankrupt air carriers that are no longer providing service and in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. "It's a common sense provision," said Burns. "If you buy a ticket on Northwest Airlines to Disneyland from Billings, and Northwest Airlines liquidates and cancels all service while you're enjoying your vacation, you could be stuck in Los Angeles. With my amendment in place, instead of buying a last minute air line ticket on another air carrier, you can fly stand-by on any air-carrier that serves that route for $50 dollars each way."

   Billings Public Bus Transit & Parking Facility $2,500,000 
  Billings Logan Airport - Air Traffic Control Tower $1,800,000
