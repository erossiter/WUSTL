SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that four Montana counties will receive $180,000 in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds through the USDA Farm Service Agency.  
 Cascade and Liberty counties will receive funding for flood-related projects, and McCone and Hill counties will receive funding for drought-related projects. ECP provides producers with cost-share assistance to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters and for carrying out emergency water conservation measures in periods of severe drought. 
   "Our great state is seeing the pains of both drought and flooding at the same time, and there are a lot of producers out there suffering from these situations that need assistance," said Burns. "These funds are an important boost for those folks. In Montana, we have seen multiple years of drought, and while the recent moisture is certainly helpful, it also presents problems in some areas that have to deal with unexpected flooding. I know today's announcement will be a real help for these counties that are facing some big challenges right now." 
   Emergency practices include pipelines, tanks, troughs, constructing or deepening wells and spring developments, and in certain counties, water hauling and silt removal. Cost-share levels and eligibility requirements are determined in approved counties by the local Farm Service Agency county committee. Cost-share may be limited based on acres served. Permanent practices must be maintained for 10 years.
