SEN. BURNS HOLDS NIELSEN HEARING
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), Chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, held a hearing today to look into Nielsen's new rating system.  
 Questions have been raised about the accuracy and fairness of Local People Meter (LPM) system and there are opinions on both sides. The major concern has been that this system may not accurately record the viewing preferences of all viewers regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or age. 
   The following people were present to answer questions and shed light on the new LPM system: Tom Herwitz, President of Stations Operations at Fox Television Stations; George Ivie, Executive Director of Media Rating Council (MRC); Tom Arnost, President of Univision Television; Bob Barocci of The Advertising Research Forum; and Susan Whiting, President and CEO of Nielsen Media Research. 
   "As a former broadcaster, I know how important these ratings are for broadcasters and their audiences alike," said Burns. "They must be fair and accurate, but it is clear that the current audit process lacks a certain amount of openness and transparency. This continues to be my concern. At the end of the day, we all share a common goal of providing American viewers with the most accurate, fair, and reliable ratings possible. I am confident today's hearing, and continued work and dialogue from all ends, will help start the ball rolling in the right direction." 
   Burns Continued: "I was pleased with the information we gathered today, and I will continue working to make sure the issues surrounding the LPM system continue to be examined and get resolved. With all the interests at stake and the qualified people involved, I have no doubt we can reach that end."
