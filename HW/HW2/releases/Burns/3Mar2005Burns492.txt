SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS PASSAGE OF DISAPPROVAL RESOLUTION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today aided the passage of a resolution disapproving of the Department of Agriculture's rule that would re-open the border to Canadian cattle and beef imports. Citing a risk of decreased consumer confidence and limited marketability, Burns has called for postponement of the March 7 re-opening until sound science verifies that Canadian feed practices would not expose the U.S. cattle industry to the threat of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The disapproval resolution passed on a vote of 52-46 today, and now goes to the House of Representatives for consideration.  
   "I'm happy that the majority of my Senate colleagues recognize the critical nature of this decision and the impacts it could have on my Montana producers. As I've said all along, we cannot rush into this decision," Burns said. "Consumer confidence in the American cattle industry is at an all-time high because we've taken the necessary steps to make sure our feed quality is at its utmost. Before we open the border to Canadian beef imports we have to give ourselves the time to make the right decisions for our cattlemen and the people of our country." 
   Burns has been an outspoken critic of USDA's actions relating to the border, and successfully persuaded USDA to restrict eligible beef to cattle under 30 months. He has also called on the Administration to work aggressively to open foreign markets to US beef exports.
