SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH GEN. CARTWRIGHT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) today met with General James E. Cartwright, Commander, United States Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska to discuss the future of nuclear policy and maintaining the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) at Malmstrom Air Force Base.  
 The meeting focused largely on nuclear policy as the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) process moves forward. General Cartwright is leading the QDR process, and is responsible for the global command and control of U.S. strategic forces. The QDR is slated to be complete sometime at the beginning of 2006. 
   "We need to maintain the force at 500 warheads," said Burns. "I reiterated that to him, and we had a very good discussion on Malmstrom, and our nuclear posture in general. The Minuteman III force in Montana is a critical part of the triad, and I believe General Cartwright agrees with me on the importance of maintaining our strategic rocket forces at current levels through the QDR." 
   In September, Burns signed a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld, urging him to continue support for the Nuclear Posture Review's conclusion that 500 nuclear-armed Minutemen III missiles will be necessary through at least 2020. Burns then co-sponsored a provision that formalized that policy and was included in the FY06 Defense Authorization bill. That bill passed through the Senate yesterday. 
   "I'd like to commend General Cartwright for requesting today's get together," said Burns. "He's got an enormously important and difficult job, and I appreciate him going out of his way to meet with me and keep me informed of their progress." 
   Burns is a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and a member of the Subcommittees on Defense Appropriations and Military Construction, which fund the armed services.
