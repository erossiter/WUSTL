  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced another round of this year's Assistance to Firefighter Grant awards.  
 Included in this week's round of grants is a total of $282,501 for four fire departments in Montana. 
   "In Montana, we know the devastation that fire can cause, particularly through the dry summer months," said Burns.
