SEN. BURNS CALLS ON USDA TO IMPLEMENT DISASTER PAYMENTS QUICKLY, FAIRLY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) sent a letter this week to J.B. Penn, Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agriculture Services at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), requesting disaster payments be implemented quickly and fairly.  
   The letter recommends that States have the option to use local prices that more fairly reflect the high value of Montana crops, and urges the USDA to use simple and clear methods for calculating Livestock Assistance Program (LAP) payments in order to avoid a delay in critical assistance. 
   "In Montana, we produce high quality wheat and barley, and our crop values just aren't reflected in national average prices," said Burns. "I would have liked to see Congress pass a disaster package that didn't have a cap on payments, but if we are going to say that farmers can only get assistance for 95 percent of their crop value, then let's make sure we are fairly calculating the value of that crop." 
   Senators Craig (R-ID), Crapo (R-ID), and Hagel (R-NE) joined Senator Burns in signing this letter to the USDA which states the need for rapid movement in regards to disaster payments: "We would like to stress the need to deliver, as soon as possible, this critical aid to America's farmers and ranchers. We urge the USDA to move forward expediently in administering and delivering disaster funds." 
   Burns added: "Getting this disaster package through Congress was a huge win, but we can't stop there. We must keep working to make sure the folks that need this help get it in a timely manner."
