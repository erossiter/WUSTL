SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS ETHANOL, BIODIESEL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that the Senate Energy Committee has adopted an amendment to the Energy Bill requiring eight billion gallons of renewable fuels be added annually to the nation's supply by 2012.  
   "Affordable, reliable sources of energy are absolutely key to growing American jobs, and the inclusion of ethanol and biodiesel provisions in this bill is great news for Montana," said Burns. "This Energy bill takes a very balanced approach. It encourages domestic energy production, and authorizes research and development on new technologies. We owe it to America to develop a strong, stable energy policy and I am confident this bill will go a long way toward that goal." 
   The Energy Committee also approved a hydropower relicensing provision to tighten the existing process, and grant states, tribes and environmental groups the ability to participate. "We are in a good position to use more of our water and our dams to produce electricity, and I am glad to see this provision adopted today," said Burns.
