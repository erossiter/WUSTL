SEN. BURNS 'DISGUSTED' WITH ANTI-COOL TACTICS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) today blasted opponents of Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for including a two-year delay of the law in the conference report on Agriculture Appropriations. Sen.  
 Burns, in a bipartisan effort with his Democratic colleagues in both chambers, fought to the bitter end to maintain the 2006 date for mandatory COOL implementation. 
   "I'm furious," said Burns. "Congress passed a law and this President signed it in 2002. Now there are a few hand-wringers in Congress who are bowing to special interests and using backhanded maneuvers to block mandatory COOL. The members who inserted this delay should be ashamed of themselves, and because of this I refused to sign the conference report and I will not vote to pass Agriculture Appropriations. 
   "It is the will of Congress, and the will of the cattle producers in this country, to implement mandatory labeling. We passed a labeling bill and it was signed into law by this President. The opponents of COOL do not have the votes to repeal it in the light of day, so they keep using backhanded maneuvers to delay and delay this law. This is a terrible way to do business.
