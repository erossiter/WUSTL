SEN. BURNS SPEAKS IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE GONZALES' NOMINATION
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) spoke on the Senate floor today in support of Judge Alberto Gonzales as the next Attorney General of the United States.  
   "We are at a critical time in our nations' history," said Burns. "We are quickly learning how to adapt to the threat of terrorism, and we have changed policy and government structure dramatically in an attempt to make all American's safe. The groundwork we have laid and will continue to build upon is what makes us a great nation. The United States is a world model for picking up the pieces and adapting to new challenges. I am hopeful and quite confident Judge Gonzales will continue that legacy at the Attorney General post. Judge Gonzales is a man of great integrity and I encourage my colleagues to entrust him with the responsibility of being our next United States Attorney General. 
   Burns continued: "Judge Gonzales truly has a great American story. He is a man of great integrity and I am confident in his abilities to serve our country in the post as Attorney General."
