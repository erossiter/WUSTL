SEN. BURNS TO HOST TOWNHALL IN BILLINGS ON MEDICARE PART D WITH SEN. ENZI, CMS DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR NORWALK
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) will host a Townhall meeting on the new Medicare Part D drug benefit at 2:00 pm, Saturday, March 25th, at the Billings Clinic. The event will be the first stop on a seven city statewide Medicare bus tour Sen. Burns requested from Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt at the beginning of the year.  
   The Townhall and the tour will feature several CMS staffers who will be on site to answer seniors' questions and help them sign up for the drug plan of their choosing. All seniors should bring with them the following in order to aid the CMS officials in helping them choose the best plan for their individual needs:
   * Their red, white and blue Medicare card; 
   * A list of their prescription medications; 
   * The frequency and dosage of each of their medications; and 
   * Their pharmacy's name and location, or a list of pharmacies in their area. 
   Senator Burns will be on hand at the event to make sure everyone is getting the answers they need and to listen to any and all concerns regarding the new program. Also on hand will be U.S. Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Deputy CMS Administrator Leslie Norwalk. 
   The Billings Townhall is the first in a series of seven stops in Montana for Senator Burns' Medicare Part D bus tour. Other cities on the tour are Bozeman, Helena, Kalispell, Missoula, Great Falls, and Butte . Due to the Senate schedule Senator Burns will only be able to attend the Billings and Bozeman events, however members of his staff will be on hand at all events to answer questions and address concerns. 
   Senator Burns said, "Prescription drugs are an integral part of any health care plan, and they are now included in Medicare. I know there have been some issues about the Medicare Part D plan being confusing, and there have been even more naysayers who have put partisan politics ahead of what is in the best interest of seniors. I prefer solutions to complaining, so I've organized this statewide bus tour to give Montana 's seniors the change to get their questions answered directly from Medicare officials. I invite and encourage all seniors with questions about the new benefit to attend, and look forward to meeting and talking with all who attend."
