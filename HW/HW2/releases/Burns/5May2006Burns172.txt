SEN. BURNS HIGHLIGHTS STRONG ECONOMY, TO PUSH FOR MEDICAL LIABILITY, SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLAN BILLS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) issued the following statement on today's employment report, released this morning by the U.S. Department of Labor: 
  "Today we received more news of a strong economy getting stronger. We created 138,000 new payroll jobs in April, which means we have now created 5.3 million new jobs since August 2003. National unemployment is steady at 4.7% and in Montana it's even better at 3.4%. The national economy grew at 4.8% in the first quarter of this year. All of the economic indicators are very positive. We can continue enacting pro-growth policies by passing both Medical Liability and Small Business Health Plan legislation next week, which I strongly support. I will also keep pushing to make the tax cuts permanent, because our economy is strong and growing and raising taxes is not the right thing to do. I've never voted for a tax increase in my life and I won't start now."
  Senator Burns is senior member of the Senate Commerce and Small Business Committees and three-term U.S. Senator.
