SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES USDA FARM BILL FORUM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced that Deputy Secretary Chuck Conner of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be conducting a Farm Bill Forum in Bozeman on November 4, from 2-4 p.m. This event will take place as a part of Ag Appreciation Days at Montana State University.  
   "This will be a great way for the USDA to hear directly from Montanans about their ideas and concerns," said Burns. "I know Chuck will be able to offer a lot of information to our folks as well, so mark your calendar." 
   USDA has been conducting Farm Bill Forums throughout the country to give producers a chance to shape the 2007 Farm Bill. Participants have the opportunity to respond to six questions that USDA has put out for public comment. The forums address issues such as commodity programs, conservation programs, international trade, rural development, and agricultural research.
