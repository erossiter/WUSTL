SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH AIR FORCE SECRETARY WYNNE TO DISCUSS MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today met with U.S. Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne and senior Defense Department (DOD) officials to discuss bringing additional missions to Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls. Sen.  
 Burns also specifically brought up re-opening the runway at Malmstrom, which was closed by the Base Realignment and Closure Committee in 1995.
   Senator Burns said, "I had a very productive meeting with Secretary Wynne and I'm certain we'll make some progress in the near term." 
   Senator Burns emphasized the unique attributes of Malmstrom AFB and the community of Great Falls. Sen. Burns said, "Malmstrom AFB is a tremendous national asset. We have appropriated well over $100 million in the past two years alone to build family housing, a daycare center, a fitness center, and a number of other buildings. We've worked hard to ensure that the facilities at Malmstrom are top of the line. But it's the runway and the airspace that truly set Malmstrom apart. This base is the only place left in the country with no air traffic or land encroachment issues. We need to bring in folks who are looking for this type of asset. The Secretary has assured me that the Air Force is willing to work with other federal agencies interested in Malmstrom." 
   The Quadrennial Defense Review will be released by the DOD Feb. 6, and Senator Burns has states his support for re-structuring the military to meet emerging threats. 
   Senator Burns is the Senior member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
