SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES ROAD RECONSTRUCTION GRANTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today two Montana grants for road reconstruction. Six County Fort Peck Road Access project will receive $525,547 to rehabilitate access roads to the Fort Peck Reservoir and CM Russell National Wildlife refuge in Phillips, Fergus, Garfield, McCone and Valley Counties. Taylor Hill Road will receive $497,517 to reconstruct the roadway to an all-weather gravel surface. 
   "All Montanans know that our roadways need to remain in good condition to allow safe transportation throughout the year, especially during our long winter season," said Burns. "We all log quite a few hours in the car getting where we need to go, and roads in good condition are the key to getting where we need to go in a timely and safe manner. It is no surprise that this takes effort and funding-money that is well spent in order to keep our transportation systems up to par so they are functioning day in and day out."
   Carl Seilstad, Fergus County Commissioner said: "This funding will do a great deal to help improve the access roads to Fort Peck Lake, and the public is going to see a great deal of improvement when everything is completed. Despite our low water levels, we must continue upgrading these roads to keep them in good condition for the future, and we're grateful for Senator Burn's efforts in securing the funds to make this possible."
   This grant is awarded through the Department of Transportation, made available by funding that Senator Burns included in the Transportation and Treasury Appropriations for FY04. Burns is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.
