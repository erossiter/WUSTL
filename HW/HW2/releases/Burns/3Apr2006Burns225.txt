SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS LEGISLATION TO REDUCE COST OF HEALTH CARE, EXPAND COVERAGE TO MILLIONS
  Working with Senate leadership, Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) introduced a bill to use Health Savings Accounts (HAS) to decrease the rising cost of health care for millions of Americans and expand access to health care coverage for Montana's small businesses and low income citizens. 
  Senator Burns' legislation will allow an income tax deduction in the amount of the premium paid when an individual purchases a high-deductible health plan in conjunction with a qualifying HSA. The need for HSAs is clear:
  * The tax code treats the self-employed, unemployed, and workers at companies that do not offer health insurance (most of which are small businesses) less generously than it treats workers at companies that do offer health insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance receives a tax subsidy that individually-purchased insurance does not, and as a result two-thirds of non-elderly Americans receive health insurance through their own or a family member's employer.
   * The bill that Senator Burns is introducing would help create tax parity between employer-sponsored insurance and insurance purchased in the individual market. The bill allows all individuals who purchase a high-deductible plan in conjunction with an HSA to deduct the amount of the health plan's premium from their income taxes.
   * In a survey by America's Health Insurance Plans, it was shown that fifty percent of all people covered by HSA plans in the individual market are 40 years of age or older.
   * That same survey showed 31 percent of new enrollees in HSA plans were previously uninsured. 
   * There is a provision that allows an individual's HSA and premiums paid to high-deductible health plans to be tax exempt from payroll taxes (not just income taxes).
   * Low income folks do not get any benefit from an income tax deduction, but the payroll tax exclusion reduces the cost of insurance and out-of-pocket expenses by 15%.
   * Payroll tax relief especially helps lower income workers because:
   * Lower income workers are more likely to work for firms that don't offer health insurance.
   * Some workers may have low enough incomes that they are paying no income taxes but still must pay payroll taxes.
  Senator Burns said, "This is common sense legislation that will save Montanans money in health care, especially middle and low income families. For a Montana family in the 15% income tax bracket, they would receive a tax subsidy of over $1,500 towards the purchase of a $5,000 family insurance HSA-qualified policy. I'll continue working with the White House and Congressional leadership to reduce the cost of health care and expand coverage opportunities through free market principles."
