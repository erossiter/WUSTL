SEN. BURNS PUSHES FOR BETTER GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today his support for the Teaching Geography is Fundamental Act, a bill that would expand geographic literacy among K-12 students through grants for geography teacher training.  
   "As our world continues to grow, we need to make sure our youngsters have the education to prepare them for this world, and understanding geography is certainly a big part of that," said Burns. "Without exposure to what exists beyond a child's hometown, state, or country, they will lack an important understanding of the world around them. And this is the trend we're seeing-American young adults continually rank toward the bottom in surveys comparing the geographic literacy among countries. That's not a good sign, but this legislation would go a long way in bringing a focus back to the importance of geography for our youth." 
   This bill would authorize federal funding to improve student achievement, increase teacher training, encourage education research, and develop effective instructional materials and strategies in the field of geographical education. Specifically, it would authorize $15 million in federal grant funding per year for five years to a nonprofit educational organization to improve the quality of student understanding of geography through effective teaching in classrooms. 
   Twenty-five percent of grant funding would be made available to support national non-profit efforts to strengthen geography education through training, research and outreach activities. Seventy-five percent of funds would be made available for sub-grants to higher education institutions associated with state geographic alliances, state and local education agencies and other nonprofit educational organizations for these same purposes. Sub-grantees would be required to provide a 20 percent match.
