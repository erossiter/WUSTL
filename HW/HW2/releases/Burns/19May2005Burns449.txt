SEN. BURNS INVITES BRAC CHAIRMAN TO MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) sent a formal invitation to the Chairman of the Base Realignment And Closure Commission (BRAC), Mr.  
 Anthony Principi. Burns invited the former Secretary of Veterans Affairs to come back to Montana to review in person the facilities and infrastructure available to military personnel, and to urge him to consider keeping the F-16 flying mission with the Montana Air National Guard. 
   "Since the news broke, I've said the Department of Defense's logic was flawed in this decision," said Burns. "Now that the Pentagon has made its recommendations, our only recourse is to convince the members of the BRAC Commission that our birds are better left right here in Montana, and that our training and flying capabilities should be expanded, not gutted. Secretary Principi visited Helena, and the Fort Harrison facilities in October, 2002 and saw first-hand the exceptional quality of our National Guard installation there. He needs to see our Air Guard, and our Malmstrom [Air Force Base] facilities as well so he can make an educated decision on this very important issue." 
   With the Department of Defense (DoD) releasing their recommendations, the decision to close or realign rests next with the BRAC Commission, as the DoD has completed their portion of the process. The BRAC Committee must send their final list to the President by September 8, where he may either accept or reject it in its entirety, then Congress has 45 days to reject it before it becomes binding on the DoD. Senator Conrad Burns is a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and a past Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations, which funds construction projects for the Armed Forces.
