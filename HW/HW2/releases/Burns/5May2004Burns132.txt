FEMA FUNDS ASSIST MISSOULA, RAVALLI COUNTIES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced a Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency grant of $1,567,573.  
 This funding will go to the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to help reimburse the high costs incurred while fighting fire last summer in the Cooney Ridge Fire Complex, part of the Missoula/Mineral Fire Zone.
   "The Cooney Ridge Fire Complex was one of the worst fires we suffered through in Montana last year," said Burns. "It burned nearly 25,000 acres and required just under 800 emergency personnel to come to Missoula and Ravalli counties," he continued. "With the money being dispersed by FEMA, those fire stations that battled last year's devastating blaze will be able to replenish their stock, and be better prepared for the fire season the lay ahead."
   Eligible wildland firefighting costs covered by FEMA under its Fire Management Assistance Grant Program may include expenses for field camps, equipment repair and replacement, materials and supplies, and mobilization and demobilization activities. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program is provided under the President's Disaster Relief Fund and made available by FEMA to assist in fighting wildland fires that threaten to cause major disaster. The assistance enables FEMA to provide 75 percent of a state's eligible wildland firefighting costs.
