SEN. BURNS URGES GSA TO CONSIDER MONTANA FIRMS FOR NEW GREAT FALLS COURTHOUSE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Montana) urged the General Services Administration (GSA) to use Montana firms in the building of a new District Courthouse for Great Falls as the process moves forward. Today Sen. Burns sent a letter to Shelley Smith, a Denver-based Contracting Officer at GSA. 
  In the letter, Senator Burns said, "Montana possesses many well qualified developers, contractors and design professions that work together on a regular basis. With our vast distances and low population, companies have used technology and reputations to build teams and work together, regardless of location. They are unique in their thought processes and would perform with the due diligence to complete this worthwhile project. I believe that the qualifications of our Montana firms speak for themselves. This project is very exciting for North Central Montana and I look forward to following the process, from the site selection to the ribbon cutting."
  The District Courthouse in Great Falls will be built for the 9th Circuit Court, as well as house the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Probation and Parole.
  GSA held an open house in Great Falls with local residents February 9. Senator Burns has kept close tabs on the progress of this project and has urged GSA to keep the community informed. The open house was primarily intended to detail the acquisition procedures, detail an approximate time line and answer questions regarding the proposed facility. 
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and three-term U.S. Senator from Montana.
