SEN. BURNS VOTES AGAINST SEN. BYRD'S TAX INCREASE: AMTRAK WILL BE PROTECTED, BUT NOT BY RAISING TAXES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) voted against an amendment by Sen.  
 Robert Byrd (D-WV) that would have raised the spending cap on the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget and raised taxes on Americans in the amount of $1.04 Billion. 
   "I agree that AMTRAK must be adequately funded," said Burns. "Raising taxes is not the way to accomplish it, and anyone who says this was a vote against AMTRAK is pandering. I sent a letter to Senator Gregg (R-NH), the Budget Committee Chairman, and made sure he knew how important AMTRAK is to Montana's transportation infrastructure. We have the flexibility in the appropriations process to make sure the funds are there to keep the Empire Builder rolling, and I will be in that fight to get the funds for AMTRAK. I'm just not going to do it by increasing the tax burden on Montanans." 
   Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Subcommittee on Transportation, which is directly responsible for funding AMTRAK.
