SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF BEARTOOTH FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is directing $15,000,000 in emergency funding to reimburse the state of Montana for reconstruction of the Beartooth Highway. Portions of the highway were destroyed by mudslides in 2005, but were quickly rebuilt by road crews working overtime to restore one of America's most scenic highways.  
  "Our local folks worked so hard to rebuild that historic highway and lessen the economic impact on the surrounding communities," said Senator Burns. "They did an amazing job. The Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) had to front this funding, and I repeatedly pushed the federal government to expedite the reimbursement, to reduce the burden on MDT. I am so proud of the job that was done on that road - it is a model of cooperation, from the ground up."
  Senator Burns supported the funding for the Beartooth mudslides as a part of an emergency transportation funding amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill earlier this year and has urged DOT to recognize the immediate need for disaster funding to help rebuild the Highway. This funding is allocated to Montana as a reimbursement for expenses associated with disaster and emergency damage cleanup.
  "These funds are crucial to restoring communities and getting local economies back on track," said Acting DOT Secretary Maria Cino.
  Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Transportation (TTHUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the U.S. Department of Transportation.
