SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES BILL TO WAIVE LATE MEDICARE ENROLLMENT PENALTY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) today introduced the Medicare Late Enrollment Assistance Act that would allow for a one time waiving of the late enrollment penalty for seniors without drug coverage who have not enrolled in the Medicare Part D drug program.  
  The penalty, a one percent per month addition to the cost of monthly premiums, is to be waived for 2006 only. The late enrollment penalty will be reinstated in 2007. 
  The legislation also includes funding for outreach by state and local agencies that focus on the issues facing seniors, to aid them in educating seniors on why it is important for those without prescription drug coverage to enroll in Part D, even if they take few or no prescription drugs. 
  The bill will not extend the deadline for enrollment, it will simply waive the late enrollment penalty for this year only. Seniors not enrolled by the deadline of May 15, 2006, won't be able to sign up again until November. Thus far, 65 percent of Montana's seniors have enrolled in the Medicare Part D program. Final enrollment numbers are expected by the end of next week.
  Senator Burns said, "This is a one time waiver of the late enrollment penalty that all of Montana's seniors who have yet to enroll should take full advantage of. They now have until the end of the year to educate themselves, watch how well the program works, and choose the plan that is best for them."
