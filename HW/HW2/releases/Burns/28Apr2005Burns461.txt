SEN. BURNS DISAPPOINTED BY AGRICULTURE FUNDING LEVELS
  Sen. Conrad Burns today announced that a final budget conference report has been filed today and is en route to the Senate floor. Sen.  
 Burns is a stalwart supporter of the Agricultural community and has been working closely throughout the budget process to protect it from unfair cuts. 
   This year's report includes a $3 billion cut to Agriculture funding, down from an initial proposal by the Administration of $7 billion and a House proposal of $5 billion. 
   "I worked with my colleagues in the Senate to keep the funding cuts as low as possible," said Burns. "I would prefer there had been no cuts, but I appreciate Chairman Gregg's work. The House was insisting on $5 billion or more, and that number was unacceptable to me. I'm pleased that the House finally relented to the call from our agricultural community." 
   He continued, discussing the importance of being able to operate within a budget. 
   "Even though I'm not pleased with everything that was included in today's report, the country as a whole will benefit because we've finally developed a budget in a timely fashion," said Burns. "It sets our spending levels, which allows your appropriators to get money to the states in an effective manner," he added. "It's vital to the smooth operation of the country." 
   Burns is an influential member of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies.
