SEN. BURNS AMENDMENT TO RESTORE $823 MILLION IN VETS FUNDING PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Conrad Burns won a big bi-partisan victory today on behalf of our nation's veterans. The Burns amendment to the Congressional Budget Resolution, S. Con. Res. 83, overwhelmingly passed the Senate 100-0.  
   Senator Burns introduced the amendment Monday and fought hard to win passage. The amendment increases federal spending for veterans' health care by $823 million for fiscal year 2007. Senator Burns filed the amendment to restore the funding and reject two provisions in the president's budget that would have been expensive for our veterans. 
   The budget proposed that prescription drug co-payments for certain veterans increase from $7 to $15 and also imposed an annual $250 enrollment fee for certain categories of veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. The amendment also includes $27 million increase in medical research and prosthetics for veterans who have experienced traumatic amputation or serious injury. 
   Senator Burns said, "Our veterans deserve the best we can give them. I am pleased this amendment overwhelmingly passed the Senate today, restoring the funding for veterans we need, and rejecting the proposed health care cost increases on veterans. I'll continue to fight for veterans in Montana and across the country to make sure they get the funding they need and the treatment and respect they deserve." 
   The amendment was co-sponsored by Senators Lincoln Chafee (R - RI), Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R - TX), David Vitter (R - LA), Jeff Sessions (R - AL), and Chuck Hagel (R-NE). 
   Senator Burns will also be introducing legislation soon to expand the education programs eligible for accelerated GI Bill benefits. 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee and a three-term U.S. Senator from Montana.
