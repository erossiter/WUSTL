SEN. BURNS SPEAKS ON ANNIVERSARY OF PEARL HARBOR
  "December 7, 1941 will always be a date which lives in infamy, experienced by a group of people who showed a great deal of courage and bravery.  
 We will always remember those soldiers whose lives marked the time in history when America showed its true character: an unwavering patriotism that cannot be compromised. 
   "As we remember today as Pearl Harbor Day, and thank those who gave their lives in the name of freedom, we must also remember the men and women fighting in the War on Terror today. 
   "Today, our brave military men and women, just as those who have gone before them, stand on alert, securing freedom at home and guarding the innocent abroad. I salute their bravery and sacrifice and ask my colleagues to do the same."
