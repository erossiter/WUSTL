SEN. BURNS'S GREAT FALLS FIELD REPRESENTATIVE TO HOLD HOURS IN FORT BENTON
  Montana Sen. Conrad Burns today announced that his Great Falls Field Representative, Sarah Converse, will hold community outreach hours in Fort Benton on Tuesday, February 21.  
   Converse will be available from 11:30 am to 1:00 pm at Sunrise Bluffs, 711 21st St. in Fort Benton. She will be available to meet with anyone who has a problem with a federal agency or questions or concerns regarding issues before Congress. 
   Burns said "Montana's a big state, as you know. I realize it's sometimes inconvenient to make the trip to our Great Falls office, so I wanted Sarah to visit Chouteau County personally to ensure Montanans can address their questions and concerns in person with my office. Please let Sarah know if there's anything you think we can be of assistance with, or if you're having difficulty with a federal agency and we will do what we can to help." 
   If you have any questions, please feel free to call Sarah Converse at (406) 452-9585 or (800) 344-1513.
