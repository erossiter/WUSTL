MORE THAN $90 MILLION FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), former Chairman of the Senate Military Construction (MILCON) Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Military Construction conference report received final approval by the Senate. The bill includes $90,177,000 in construction projects for Montana's military, and nearly $83 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Burns, who served as conferee for the bill as it progressed through a joint House-Senate conference committee, played a vital role in securing this funding.  
   "The funding included in this bill will go a long way in updating and improving Montana's facilities that house our men and women in uniform," said Burns. "Malmstrom Air Force base and Montana's Air National Guard facilities are crucial to America's national security, and the people that serve in them deserve the very best when it comes to their preparation and training." 
   Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and was able to ensure the Montana-related Presidential budget requests that were included. He was also able to include two other projects to the final list, the Physical Fitness Center at Malmstrom AFB and the construction of the Miles City Readiness Center for the Montana Army National Guard. 
   Military Construction Appropriations for Montana: 
   * Malmstrom AFB Replace Family Housing (296 Units) $68,971,000 
   * Malmstrom AFB Construction - Physical Fitness Center $13,500,000 
   * MTARNG Helena - Army Aviation Support Facility $5,942,000 
   * MTARNG Helena - Readiness Center Addition $1,324,000 
   * MTARNG Miles City - Construction of Readiness Center $440,000 
   Burns, a former Marine, fought for increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). "As a veteran, I understand how important it is for the Veterans Administration to receive increases in funding. I will continue to lead the fight for veterans in Montana and across the nation," said Burns. This year's bill includes an overall $70 billion for the VA. "I'm particularly pleased that Veterans Medical Services are funded at $22.5 billion this year," said Burns, "and that for the first time ever, $2.2 billion has been allocated for specialty mental health care and mental health research. The sacrifices that these men and women have made for us know no end. They deserve nothing less than the best in care and treatment after serving their country so well." 
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill will now go on to the President for his signature.
