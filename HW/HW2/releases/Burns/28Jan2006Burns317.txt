SEN. BURNS: AIR FORCE TO CONSIDER NEW MISSIONS AT MALMSTROM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced he secured a firm commitment from U.S. Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (Installation, Environment and Logistics) Maureen Koetz that an Air Force team will visit Malmstrom AFB in March to perform an "Attributes Study" to determine how the Air Force can leverage the unique capabilities of the base and its location.  
   Assistant Secretary Koetz said, "By better analyzing the strengths of the base and community, we can capture all of the potential capabilities and pair those with emerging missions." 
   Secretary Wynne stated that the Air Force is interested in developing efficient integration of active duty and Air National Guard personnel and units wherever possible. 
   Senator Burns said, "I'm pleased we can announce this commitment today. It's a first step to gaining new missions at Malmstrom, but I've now had five meetings on this subject in two weeks, and we're making progress. Malmstrom is a first-class facility, and in March the USAF team will agree." 
   At the request of Senator Burns, the Air Force team plans to meet with Great Falls local leaders and elected officials to discuss the community's desires for the future of the base. 
   Senator Burns is the Senior member of the Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees.
