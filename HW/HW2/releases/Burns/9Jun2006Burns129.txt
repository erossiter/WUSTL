SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPPLEMENTAL CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued a statement regarding the conference report on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill: 
  "I'll vote for the conference report because we need to fund the urgent national priorities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the Gulf Coast reconstruction, without delay, but I there are still critical issues that need to be addressed. I fought hard for the urgently needed agriculture energy assistance for my producers in Montana, but the House just would not budge. I will continue looking for ways to help farmers and ranchers who are battling unprecedented spikes in fuel and fertilizer costs. The fight on this issue does not end here.
  "We successfully secured $2.5 million for a Military Voting Initiative that will help all our soldiers have better access to voting. For our bravest, we must do everything we can to ensure they have the ability to vote given difficult logistical circumstances, and this funding will be wisely used to make voting more reasonably accessible for our soldiers.
  "Unfortunately, Senator Baucus' amendment related to funding for Going to the Sun road did not make it through the conference, but I am hopeful that we can continue working, as a delegation, to find funding for that road. I have supported funding for Going to the Sun road for years, and I am committed to seeing the improvements to the road continue."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
