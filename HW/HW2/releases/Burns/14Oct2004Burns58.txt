SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH PRODUCERS: 'LET'S FIX COOL'
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) was joined today by representatives of four Montana Livestock organizations to discuss options for improving and speeding up the implementation of Country Of Origin Labeling (COOL).  
   "There's a rumor out there that I voted against COOL," said Burns. "I was one of the first to bring COOL to the U.S. Senate back in 1999, and I've supported it ever since. What we accomplished today, was to bring together the folks that are here raising the animals and get their thoughts on what we can do to make the bill better. I think we took great steps toward that goal. We're going to keep a dialogue open with these groups to get their thoughts as we move forward, but right now it appears we're going to move up the mandatory implementation to sometime between June of next year and mid-fall. We're also going to expand the coverage of COOL to include processed and prepared meats, and that will make for a fairer playing field for our producers. I feel good that we'll be able to get the rules written in a timely fashion to meet this new implementation date, and will work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to let them know what's going to work best for Montana producers." 
   Joining Burns in the meeting today were representatives from the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, R-CALF, Montana Cattlemen's Association, and the Montana Stockgrowers Association. During the session, the four groups found common ground with Senator Burns and all agreed to move forward together to make this legislation better for Montana. "It just makes sense for all of us to be pulling in the same direction, and I'm glad to have their input, and the input of the livestock producers they represent." 
   Burns is optimistic he will be able to introduce a bill when the Senate reconvenes in November.
