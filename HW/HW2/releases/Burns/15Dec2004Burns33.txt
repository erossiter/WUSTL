WISE RIVER VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that Wise River Volunteer Fire Department will receive $116,100 through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards program to go towards a new firefighting vehicle.  
   "Fighting fires is not an easy task-our firefighters often put themselves in harms way to battle these blazes, and it's important they have the equipment they need to get the job done," said Burns. "These vital resources directly impact our communities by helping firefighters respond safely and effectively to all emergencies, and I'm glad to see Wise River receive funding for a new vehicle this week." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of all current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
