SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES HELENA DEFENSE PROJECTS ADVANCE TOWARD FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that at least two major defense and military construction appropriation projects for Helena have been included in an Appropriations bill that is expected to be approved by their respective subcommittees today and the full Senate Appropriation Committee Thursday. 
   The following projects are advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Defense and Military Construction Appropriations bills:
   * National Guard: Aviation Readiness Training Center - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for the planning and design of this facility, which will be a complete alteration of the Army Aviation facility to ensure adequate facilities for Army National Guard aviation units.
   * Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad: Western Computer Services (WESCO) - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for WESCO to build computer infrastructure for a Marine simulation center which will help develop weapon system integration for ground troops. The Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad program is designed to integrate the weapons and sensors that Marines need to carry in combat to help lighten their battle load which is often over 100lbs.
   "These Helena area projects are critical to maintaining our state's key role in our national defense," said Senator Burns. "I have worked with my colleagues and local folks to make sure these projects are a high priority."
   Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees.
