SEN. BURNS WEIGHS IN ON ALTERNATIVE FUELS, DIESEL PRICES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), at a Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing today, challenged the private sector to embrace alternative auto fuel technologies, particularly the development of biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. Burns comments will be made available via satellite today at 1:45 pm MT.  
   "Necessity is the mother of invention. So when we start looking at where we want to be in 25 years, it makes sense that we'd want to utilize the knowledge and expertise of the folks in the private sector. With all the information that they're providing us with today, it's time we set the goals and develop the policies that will truly provide us with progress in this arena," said Burns. "And it makes more sense that we start making our renewable fuels from bio-waste than it does to use the kernel, because pretty soon we're going to get into competition with the food chain." 
   Burns noted that diesel prices remain high, and urged industry to expand investment into biodiesel. Refining capacity for diesel is particularly constrained by the current focus on producing home heating oil, resulting in continued high diesel prices. Fuel prices have fallen recently, and Montana gas prices are $2.28, but diesel is still $2.81 (though lower than $3.01 a month ago). 
   "We need to consider the way we move great masses of our products and commodities, because we really haven't found anything that replaces diesel yet. Gas prices are declining. Diesel is not, and it's time we do something about that," said Burns.
