SEN. BURNS REACTS TO FALSE POSITIVE ON MAD COW DISEASE
  On the heels of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) announcement today the suspected Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) case was indeed a false positive, and no BSE was detected, Sen.  
 Conrad Burns (R-Mont) expressed concern over USDA testing methods and the impact on the domestic beef market.
   "They come out with indications of BSE and the whole market goes into a frenzy," said Burns. "While I am relieved it was not BSE, I call upon the USDA to revisit their testing process to reduce the chances of these false positives, and be aware of the impact their actions have on producers and the market in general. The process we have in place is a good one, but it can be strengthened to limit the chances of these faulty test results that put our cow/calf producers on pins and needles and our futures market into full panic mode."
