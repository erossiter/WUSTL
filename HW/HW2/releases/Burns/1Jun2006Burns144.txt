SEN. BURNS RESPONDS TO BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION ELECTRICITY CONTRACT WITH CFAC
  Sen. Conrad Burns issued the following statement regarding an announcement that the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) today finalized a new policy for electricity sales to Direct Service Industry (DSI) customers, including the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC) in northwest Montana: 
  "We've been working for many months on this issue and have supported CFAC in their negotiations with BPA," said Senator Burns. "I have spoken with CFAC employees and management regularly and met BPA Administrator Steve Wright many times, and as recently as May 16. I am pleased that BPA has offered an acceptable contract to CFAC, a plant which has purchased power from BPA for over 50 years. This is welcome news for the more than 150 employees at CFAC and I'm happy to be able to report that this agreement for five more years has been reached."
  "Conrad Burns and the rest of the Montana congressional delegation have been extremely helpful and persistent in their efforts to secure an agreement with Bonneville that gives CFAC a chance to continue operating," said Haley Beaudry, Manager of External Affairs at CFAC.
  According to a news release from BPA:
   * BPA will provide the equivalent of up to 560 average megawatts of electricity to the aluminum companies that it has traditionally served directly
   *BPA will provide monetary benefits to the aluminum companies in lieu of power, and they will use the money to purchase power in the market - those benefits are capped at $59 million a year.
   BPA also confirmed two earlier stipulations:
   * They will first commit to provide up to $59 million annually for the five years to bring aluminum company power costs down closer to the rates BPA's public agency customers pay
   - Depending on world aluminum markets and electric power market prices, and their use of the lock-in provision, the companies might not use the full $59 million a year
   - This decision balances the view that, while BPA does not have a statutory obligation to sell power to the DSIs past 2001, BPA does acknowledge that the DSIs have been long-term customers of BPA. Provide the equivalent of up to 560 average megawatts of electricity to the aluminum companies that it has traditionally served directly
   * Second, under no conditions, will the aluminum companies receive benefits enabling them to pay less than BPA's preference rate for power over the term of the contract, which is the rate paid by public utilities and cooperatives
  Summary:
   * If the aluminum companies take their full allocation of 560 average megawatts of benefits, BPA's public utility customers will see about one-tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour increase over what their costs would have been absent the benefit
   * The current BPA wholesale rate for utilities is approximately $30 per megawatt-hour. If the companies use less, BPA's rate exposure will be less
   * The decision calls for CFAC to receive the value of up to 140 average megawatts
  The next step is for BPA to complete negotiation of the contracts with the aluminum companies that fall within the provisions of the new policy. BPA expects to offer these contracts in the very near future. The companies can begin receiving benefits Oct. 1, 2006.
