SEN. BURNS TO HOST 23RD MONTANA WOMEN'S CONFERENCE AUG. 7 IN BILLINGS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) will host the 23rd Montana Women's Conference 2006 on Monday, August 7 in Billings at the Holiday Inn Grand Montana Hotel and Convention Center. Registration is $20 per person, which includes the morning session, continental breakfast, all workshop sessions, conference materials, lunch and the keynote address.  
   This day-long workshop explores issues Montana women face in the 21st century. "I really enjoy hosting the Women's Conference, because spending a day with Phyllis and hundreds of bright Montana women will bring me enough good ideas for an entire year," said Senator Burns. "This conference will provide experts and inspirational speakers in one place at one time and will provide outstanding resources for Montana women."
   Christine Clifford, whose triumph over breast cancer inspired many, will be this year's keynote speaker. Celebrating her 40th birthday, and approaching her 20th wedding anniversary, Christine Clifford was unprepared to be diagnosed with breast cancer, the disease that killed her mother at the age of 42. Christine turned the diagnosis into a positive life changing experience by creating the "Cancer Club" and writing several best selling books including Not Now?I Am Having a No Hair Day, and Cancer has its Privileges. Along with Christine Clifford, the Conference will feature a variety of well-known speakers to address all aspects of women's lives. There will also be local doctors from St. Vincent Healthcare and Billings Clinic to address health issues important to women, as well as a resource area where local businesses will have informational booths.
   Montanans with questions about the conference are encouraged to call Senator Burns' office in Billings at (406) 252-0550 or 1 (800) 344-1513. Registration is open through the day of the event.
