SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $360,000 FOR AIR SERVICE IMPROVEMENT IN BUTTE
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced today that the Department of Transportation has just awarded $360,000 to Butte, MT under the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP).  
 The SCASDP helps small communities address air service problems associated with insufficient service and high airfares. 
   "These funds will work to provide new air service across Montana, as well as to improve the air service that already exists," said Burns. "In a state like Montana with so many communities so widely spread apart, this funding is critical to the upkeep of our economy. I'm pleased to see this money helping the Montana people, and I will continue working to make sure more like it continues to come our way." 
   The Small Community Air Service Development Program is a federal program that helps smaller communities attract new air service. Under the program, the Department of Transportation awards grants to up to 40 applicants a year. Program funds may be used to subsidize an air carrier for up to three years.
