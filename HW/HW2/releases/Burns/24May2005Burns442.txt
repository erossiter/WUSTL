SEN. BURNS IMPROVES AMERICAN INDIAN LIVESTOCK FEED PROGRAM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that USDA will publish a final rule that attempts to fix a technical flaw found within the American Indian Livestock Feed Program (AILFP), part of the drought disaster package passed by Congress in 2004.  
   AILFP is designed to provide financial assistance to livestock producers who purchased feed for livestock that occupied tribal-governed land during a natural disaster occurring in 2003 or 2004. But when sign-up for the assistance began, producers discovered that the calendar year requirements frequently didn't coordinate with their livestock feeding periods, disqualifying them from the program. The new regulation will allow tribal governments to request an initial 90-day feeding period and up to three 90-day extensions that extend from the beginning of a livestock feed crop year, to the end of that same livestock feed crop year. A "livestock feed crop year" is defined as the period of time beginning on the date grazing first becomes available in each county and ending one year later. 
   "Producers all across Montana have faced nearly a decade of drought, so when some folks attempted to sign-up for AILFP and found themselves ineligible, it was clear to me that something was wrong," said Burns. "I went to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to address the issue, and I'm happy to say they'll be adding a regulation that provides local Farm Service Agencies with the flexibility they need to ensure that this program is administered as it should be, and that assistance gets to all of our producers who are eligible." 
   Further information on the American Indian Livestock Feed Program is available at USDA Service Centers, usually listed in telephone books under "United States Government, U.S. Department of Agriculture." You can also find more on FSA's webpage by going to: http://disaster.fsa.usda.gov.
