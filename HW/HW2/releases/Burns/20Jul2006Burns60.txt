SEN. BURNS' INTERNET SAFETY ACT TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ON-LINE SEXUAL PREDATORS PASSES SENATE
  Significant portions of the Internet Stop Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Youth (SAFETY) Act, introduced by Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) and Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), passed the Senate today by a voice vote. Originally introduced June 13, the legislation was included in a substitute amendment, also cosponsored by Senator Burns, to H.R. 4472, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.  
   The bill was "hotlined" last night, putting the legislation on a fast track to passage by restricting debate and amendments. When legislation reaches this point, it has little or no opposition and is near passage.
   This package will federalize offenses relating to child pornography, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse and increases penalties for offenders. Specifically, the bill:
   * Imposes Criminal Penalties for Financial Facilitation of Child Pornography: A maximum 10 year penalty for banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions that knowingly facilitate access to child pornography websites. 
   * Imposes Criminal Penalties for Internet Facilitation of Child Pornography: A maximum 10 year penalty for internet hosting companies or email providers that knowingly facilitate access to child pornography. 
   * Prohibits Child Pornography Enterprises: A maximum 10 year penalty for operating a child pornography enterprise. 
   * Increases Punishment for Registered Sex Offenders: A consecutive 10 year sentence for any registered sex offender who commits any child pornography or exploitation offense. 
   * Expands the Federal Private Right of Action: Allows civil remedies to be sought by victims, including the parents of a victimized minor. Victims can also seek civil penalties as an adult. 
   * Adds Child Sex Offenses to RICO and Wiretap Statutes. 
   * Creates the Office of Sexual Violence and Crimes against Children at the U.S. Department of Justice, to coordinate efforts with state and local officials in registering and tracking sexual offenders. 
   Furthermore, a provision originally introduced as stand-alone legislation by Senator Hatch and cosponsored by Senator Burns, S. 1086, the "Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act", was also included in the package. This provision would make it a federal crime and a felony for an offender failing to notify authorities of their whereabouts. Additionally, the legislation would require offenders to register their whereabouts in person every month, a change from the current system, which is state-by-state, and in which offenders may register by mail once a year.
   Senator Burns said, "Child sexual predators and their enablers have long used the internet to exploit children and this bill will go a long way toward shutting that down. This common-sense legislation provides our law enforcement with more tools to catch and track these offenders, and stiffens penalties for first time and repeat offenders."
   The substitute amendment is named in honor of the memory of Adam Walsh, the son of John and Revé Walsh, who was kidnapped and murdered 25 years ago at the age of six years old.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
