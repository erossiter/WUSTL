SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON APPROPRIATIONS RIDER TO ALLOW TAX RETURN REVIEW BY APPROPRIATIONS STAFF
  "I am very concerned this was included in our bill," said Burns.  
 "Luckily, we were able to find it and remove it before the bill was finalized. I join my colleagues in calling for an investigation of how this came about, and would hope that those responsible would be held accountable for their actions. This is what happens when you put off finishing legislation and end up cramming weeks of work into mere days. The review process is hindered and the possibility of questionable legislation increases. It is imperative we work to accomplish these bills in a timely manner instead of waiting until the end of the session, forcing an omnibus."
