SEN. BURNS CO-SPONSORS AMATEUR RADIO SPECTRUM PROTECTION ACT
  U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) recently signed on as a co-sponsor to the Amateur Radio Spectrum Protection Act of 2005.  
   "We have seen these folks greatly help out in times of emergency," said Burns. "There is great value in this mode of communication, and I am glad to be a co-sponsor of this important legislation." 
   This bill would require the FCC to provide "equivalent replacement spectrum" to the Amateur Radio and Amateur-Satellite services in the event of reallocation to other services of primary amateur spectrum or the diminution of secondary amateur spectrum. The bill also would cover additional allocations within Amateur Radio bands that "would substantially reduce" their utility to Amateur Service licensees. 
   The legislation references Amateur Radio's role in providing "voluntary, noncommercial radio service, particularly emergency communications," and it points out that hams have "consistently and reliably" provided communication support in the event of emergencies and disasters including tornadoes and hurricanes, chemical spills, forest fires and rail accidents. As the measure notes, FCC actions already have led to the loss of at least 107 MHz of spectrum to radio amateurs. 
   In Montana, since 9-11, the role of amateur radio in emergency communication support has greatly increased. It is called upon for various activities, including working with EMT's, the National Weather Service, and fire officials. Recently, Montana Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) supported a Malmstrom Air force base emergency exercise, and during the 2004-2005 fire season, Montana ARES helped provide control communications for CERT road blocks on WildLand fire access points. Burns added: "These are just a few examples of the great work these folks do, and I am proud to be a part of this legislation."
