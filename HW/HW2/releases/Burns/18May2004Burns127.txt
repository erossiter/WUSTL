SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO PROTECT WHEAT INDUSTRY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today $419,743.00 in grant funding that will go towards a MSU project focusing on the development of pest control techniques and tools.  
 The project, entitled "Novel Semiochemical- and Pathogen-Based Management Strategies for Wheat Stem Sawfly" and directed by MSU's Dr. David Weaver of the Department of Entomology, aims to bring the most economically damaging pest of Montana's wheat industry, the wheat stem sawfly, under control. The insect causes annual losses of more than $20 million to the state.
   "Montana's wheat production is a vital contributor to our economy," said Burns. "We grow it all across the state and we serve as one of our country's largest producers of the crop. I'm happy to see this funding going into Weaver's project, as it will help Montana overcome the challenges we face as we work to feed our state, our country, and the world."
   "This money is critical in our effort to develop new strategies that will effectively manage the wheat stem sawfly," Weaver said. "We'll put it to good use as we work to create techniques that lessen the insect's impact, because typical options like insecticides just aren't viable control methods for this pest."
   These funds were designated for fiscal year 2004 in the last appropriations cycle for fiscal year 2004 by Burns, who is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee on Agriculture.
