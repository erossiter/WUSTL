USDA MAKES CORRECT DECISION
  Sen. Conrad Burns spent several hours on the phone Tuesday and Wednesday with representatives of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to find a solution to the closure of a meat processing facility in Butte that was closed following a plant inspection by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). Due to the closure, 170 carcasses from a 4H youth livestock auction were left in limbo after slaughter and prior to processing. The 4H youth were at risk of losing their ability to proceed with the carcass evaluation, an integral part of the 4H livestock program.  
   "These kids were in a tight spot," said Burns. "They've played by the rules and worked their hearts out for a year raising these animals as some of the finest slaughter animals in the nation. Now, in the middle of the process, FSIS came in and yanked the rug out from underneath them. While I agree that food safety is a critical issue, the consequences of the USDA action could have been very damaging to these kids. I spent several hours on the phone with the 4H leaders as well as officials in the FSIS and Secretary Johanns' office to find a rapid solution to this mess. I'm happy to see these hard-working young folks will be able to complete their projects and get these carcasses processed." 
   In order to comply with USDA food safety regulations, the carcasses have been rinsed with a diluted bleach solution, and the facility is working with the USDA to maintain compliance with food safety regulations. 
   Curt Dallas is the 4H Livestock Coordinator for the Lewis and Clark program. "We really appreciate that Senator Burns took the time to meet with us Monday night about this. He made numerous calls on our behalf and helped find a solution to this problem. His work is so important to our program and our community, and I think he not only helped out our 4H youth, he saved some jobs in Butte."
