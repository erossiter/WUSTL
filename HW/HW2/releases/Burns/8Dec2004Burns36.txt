SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE REORGANIZATION BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today voiced his cautious support for the National Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004, which passed through the Senate late this afternoon. After more than four months of consideration, the bill will now move to the desk of the President for his signature into law.  
   "It's been a long time coming," said Burns. "The tragic events of September 11th revealed the vulnerabilities of a segmented intelligence community, and it has taken careful consideration to reorganize and seal those gaps. We're safer today than we were before that day, and I think we'll be safer tomorrow once these changes take place," he said. "But the American people shouldn't be lulled into the sense that we're immune from terrorism's threat or that these changes will occur overnight." 
   The act, based primarily on the recommendations made by the 9-11 Commission, will restructure the intelligence community of the United States by creating a single Director of National Intelligence (DNI) charged with coordinating its various agencies. The length of debate, combined with the scope of this reorganization and some of the changes taking place leave Sen. Burns with lingering concern. 
   "Do I think the bill's perfect? No. This product is a compromise, and the nature of compromise is that you don't get everything you want. It's the largest intelligence overhaul in history and I, like all of my colleagues, want to make sure that by passing a piece of legislation, we do no harm," said Burns. "That said, the total package here is a good one. Much like was seen in 1986 when the congressionally mandated union of our armed forces helped to strengthen the most powerful military force in the world, this bill will move us toward a seamless intelligence community that's better suited to fight our enemies of today and tomorrow."
