  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that Thompson Falls Rural Fire District will receive $57,141 in funding through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program to go towards operations and firefighter safety.  
   "The Firefighters Grant Program helps our fire departments and districts fight fires in a safe and timely manner," said Burns. "This is not an easy job, and our men and women out there in the field need to be prepared for the job at hand. I am glad to see this round of funding headed to Thompson Falls, and I will continue working to make sure every firefighter has the tools and training they need to battle these blazes properly." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
