$53 MILLION IN ENERGY, WATER PROJECTS ANNOUNCED FOR MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns, senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, announced the list of Montana projects included in the FY 2006 spending bill that passed through the Senate late last night. Specific Montana projects totaled over $53 million.  
   "From the funding for Dry Prairie, Rocky Boy, and St. Mary's canal projects, there's a lot tied into this bill that'll do a world of good for Montana," said Burns. "I'm also particularly proud of the funding I worked to include that will provide further research in technologies to take our coal and turn into clean-burning diesel fuel. Across the country we've started to see our gasoline prices fall now that there's a little distance between us and devastation caused by Katrina, but we're still dealing with high, unmoving diesel prices. It's my hope that some of this funding will go to alleviate that." 
   Burns was able to include several Montana-specific projects in this year's bill. Montana will also be receiving a portion of funds for nation-wide programs detailed separately below.
