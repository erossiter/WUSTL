SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON FOREST SERVICE LAND SALE PROPOSAL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement today regarding the Interior Department's budget proposal to sell up to 14,000 acres in Montana:  
   "The President's Budget proposes to fund a 5-year reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools Act using receipts from sales of designated Forest Service lands. I am a strong supporter of the Secure Rural Schools Act (SRSA), though I am concerned over the proposed funding stream. I cosponsored both the original SRSA legislation in 2000 and the pending reauthorization bill. As a member of the Energy Committee and Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I will have an opportunity to address this issue this year. 
   "Since public lands are so important to Montanans, I wanted to better understand how the land sale proposal would impact Montanans. Today, representatives from Montana Wilderness Association, MT representatives from National Wildlife Federation, and key county decision-makers shared their thoughts and community concerns over the funding proposal. 
   "From what I've learned this week, I have no interest in including the Administration's proposal in my Interior bill. It's dead in the water. The right place to make these decisions is in the Energy Committee, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee reauthorize this legislation. We'll find a way to get this done without shortchanging Montanans' access to public lands. Montanans are a common-sense bunch, and I appreciate the help of everyone who sat down with my staff and me this week and shared their thoughts.
