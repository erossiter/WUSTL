LIHEAP GETS FUNDING BOOST
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the joint House-Senate Conference Committee on Defense Appropriations had included an additional $2 Billion for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
 Burns, a member of the conference committee, supported the inclusion. 
   "With the increase in fuel costs, we have to prepare for the worst should the winter season be as severe as predicted," said Burns. "I supported the authorized funding level increase to over $5 Billion earlier this year, and now we've been able to get it fully funded. It is critical that those who need the help the most know the support is there to ensure their heat stays on this winter." 
   The $2 Billion addition to LIHEAP will be combined with the $2.18 Billion pending approval in the 2006 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill and $1 Billion in the Budget Reconciliation Act to bring the total funds available to the authorized level of approximately $5.1 Billion approved earlier this year. In addition, there is language that will take 5% of all royalties and bid fees for the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to additionally fund the LIHEAP program over the next 30 years. 
   The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Bill containing the LIHEAP language is expected to be voted on shortly in Congress. Upon approval by both houses, it will go to the President for his signature.
