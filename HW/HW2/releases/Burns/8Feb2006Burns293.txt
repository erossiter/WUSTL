SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES OPEN HOUSE FOR NEW 9TH CIRCUIT DISTRICT COURTHOUSE IN GREAT FALLS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that the General Services Administration (GSA) will host an open house from 4-7pm tomorrow for Great Falls residents to ask questions and express comments on the building of a new District Courthouse to be built for the 9th Circuit Court, also intended to house the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Probation.  
   In a letter received today by Senator Burns' office, the GSA said they would be available for residents at 4pm at the Great Falls Public Library at 301 2nd Avenue for three hours beginning at 4pm. GSA will have personnel from the National Environmental Policy Act, Urban Development and Historic Preservation to discuss acquisition procedures as the building process goes forward. 
   Senator Burns said, "This open house will be a good way for Great Falls folks to see how the process will work, give input, and ask questions. We're glad the courthouse is being built, it'll be a great building for Great Falls." 
   Senator Burns and his staff have been working to build a new courthouse in Great Falls for many years and encourage Great Falls residents to attend the open house if they can to learn more and give their opinion.
