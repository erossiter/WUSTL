SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF FAIRNESS, ACCURACY IN RATINGS ACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns today introduced the Fairness, Accuracy, Inclusivity, and Responsiveness in Ratings (FAIR Ratings) Act.  
 The legislation is designed to strengthen private-sector oversight of America's television ratings system. 
   Forty years ago, Congressional investigations into the accuracy of television ratings resulted in the creation of the Media Rating Council (MRC), an industry organization that established minimum standards for ratings accuracy and accredits ratings services. But that system is today being frustrated by the dominant provider of television ratings, Nielsen Media Research, and Nielsen's reluctance to submit to the authority of the MRC. 
   "This legislative remedy will reaffirm the same standard that was intended by Congress and the television industry over forty years ago when the Media Rating Council was first established," said Burns. "It has become clear that the MRC lacks the authority to enforce its standards. This has frustrated the MRC's role in ensuring ratings accuracy and has obstructed Congressional intent." 
   Burns' legislation affirms the basic concept that Nielsen, and any other future competitor who might come to equal acceptance by the industry, must receive accreditation for its ratings services from an independent source before they become the standard of trade. 
   "Since Nielsen will not agree to the private industry process voluntarily, we have no choice but to step in with this simple, direct, and minimally intrusive legislation, said Burns. "This bill is not about Nielsen Media Research. It is not about the Local People Meter ("LPM") system. It does not create government standards, regulation or any government role. This bill is about restoring the authority that the Congress clearly intended the industry to have to ensure minimum standards for ratings accuracy."
