SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE ACTION GOING TO SUN ROAD
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement on House action advancing the Highway bill Technical Corrections package, which will remedy a drafting error which has not allowed release of the $50 million in federal funding for Going-to-the-Sun Road: 
  "I applaud the House for addressing the drafting error for Going-to-the-Sun Road in the appropriate legislative vehicle. I wish the language had been drafted correctly when it passed in the Highway bill in 2005. House passage will allow the Senate to take up a Technical Corrections package, through the committee process initially, to deliver the delayed funding for this critical transportation infrastructure project for Montana. I am committed to fixing this problem once and for all, and am pleased Going-to-the-Sun Road is included in this package." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the U. S. Department of Transportation, the federal agency which controls funding for Going-to-the-Sun Road.
