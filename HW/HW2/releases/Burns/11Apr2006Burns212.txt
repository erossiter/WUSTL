SEN. BURNS THANKS AIR FORCE FOR ALLOWING GREAT FALLS COMMUNITY LEADERS TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) thanked the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for completing the second round of their three-part Attributes Study at Malmstrom Air Force base today. USAF Colonel Joseph Morganti, project officer of USAF Installations and Environment, met with Great Falls community leaders to discuss the future of Malmstrom Air Force base and potential new missions. 
  Col. Morganti, who was making his first visit to Montana, confirmed that USAF civil engineers will be following up this round of the review with a visit in May.
  Senator Burns said, "I requested that the leaders of Great Falls were given an opportunity to be heard by the Air Force. I am happy that the Air Force has included the local perspective in the decision making process."
  Greg Schwandt, Chairman of the Committee of 80, "I appreciate the sustained, positive, and significant contributions that Senator Burns has made protecting the mission, defending the country, and watching out for Great Falls. Securing additional missions in support of our strategic nuclear deterrence will ensure the safety and security of all our citizens. Conrad and Denny's efforts to improve the Malmstrom infrastructure over the years makes us ready to receive additional missions."
  Senator Burns served in the U.S. Marine Corps and is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations and Military Construction Subcommittees.
