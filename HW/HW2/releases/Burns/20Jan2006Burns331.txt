SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ENGLAND ON MONTANA'S MILITARY FORCE, QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) met Friday afternoon with Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, the #2 at the Pentagon, and Gen.  
 James Cartwright, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, to discuss the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) which will restructure the military and will be released Feb. 1. Sen. Burns also had breakfast with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld Thursday morning to discuss the QDR. Burns applauds the Defense Department for assurances he received today that the Montana National Guard will not be cut. 
   Senator Burns said, "I understand that the military must change in order to effectively meet future threats. I support the QDR process; it's something we've got to do." The Senator will be meeting with Gen. Cartwright and the Secretary of the Air Force next week to discuss projected impacts to Montana. 
   Sen. Burns also said, "Montana has some of the best facilities in the country and we have the elbow room for our forces to operate. Our tremendous amount of airspace is a valuable national asset. We need to work with the military to help them utilize that asset more effectively. I'll continue to work on this issue and I expect progress next week." 
   Last week, Sen. Burns responded to rumors of Montana National Guard cuts with strong opposition. Sen. Burns is working closely with the military to ensure that the force level in Montana is maintained, and that Malmstrom AFB remains a critical part of our national defense. 
   Senator Burns is a senior Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommitee.
