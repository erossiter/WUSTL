SEN. BURNS CONCERNED WITH HAMAS GAINS IN PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) expressed concern today with the news that Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian elections.  
 In the wake of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's massive stroke, the progress for peace in the Middle East is now in the hands of the Palestinian government. 
   Senator Burns said, "If the Palestinian government believes Hamas best represents them, that's their choice. And now Hamas will be held accountable as all foreign governments are. But our government cannot accept the beliefs Hamas has long held, chiefly that Israel must be destroyed completely. That is totally unacceptable and the U.S. government has, is, and will defend Israel's right to exist in freedom." 
   Senator Burns believes we cannot begin diplomatic relations with the new government unless they recognize Israel and end all support for terrorism. In December 2005, Senator Burns sent a letter to the President expressing serious problems with Hamas participating in the Palestinian elections. 
   Today, in a press conference, the President said, "Peace is never dead, because people want peace." President Bush cited his policy of a two-state solution in the region, but also said that "a party that wants the destruction of Israel is not a partner for peace." 
   Senator Burns is a Senior Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and a three-term member of the U.S. Senate.
