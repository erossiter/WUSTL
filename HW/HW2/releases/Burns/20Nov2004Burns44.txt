MANDATORY COOL SURVIVES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that Omnibus negotiators for the House and Senate had dropped a provision proposed by the House of Representatives to make Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) voluntary.  
   "This is a huge victory for producers," said Burns. "Folks in the House had been drinking the giant meat packers kool-aid, and were trying to repeal mandatory COOL. It took some arm-twisting, and a huge groundswell of comments from cow/calf producers in Montana and elsewhere, but we were able to strip that provision from the final conference version. We successfully defended mandatory COOL from a backroom maneuver, and now we need to hurry up the implementation of mandatory COOL, and expand the scope of the meat it covers." 
   Burns, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked with his colleagues on the conference committee to keep the voluntary provision out of the omnibus bill. This past Monday (November 15) Senator Burns introduced legislation that would speed up the implementation of mandatory COOL by a full year to September, 2005 and expand it to include packaged and prepared meat products such as jerky, sausages, and more. 
   Senator Burns intends to re-introduce his legislation at the beginning of the next session in January.
