MSE CONTRACT EXTENSION FINALIZED
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that the Department of Energy has approved MSE-Technology Applications (MSETA)'s contract extension that will allow them to continue working on projects for several federal agencies including the Energy Department. Under contract with the DOE since 1996, the current agreement was set to expire this year, but the extension will allow MSE to continue through 2005, with annual renewals that can extend through 2009.  
   Senator Burns, after speaking with representatives of MSE and touring their facilities earlier this year, met with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and urged him to consider the extension. "MSE provides good jobs for the community," said Burns. "I wanted Secretary Abraham to understand just how important this facility is not only to Butte, but to our state. The folks at MSE have done great work for our nation, and they should be allowed to continue that work. I'm pleased to see the department take this action." 
   Don Peoples, President of MSE, Inc. commented on the continuation of the contract: "Once again, Senator Burns has gone to bat for Montana, and we at MSE appreciate his work on this issue. Senator Burns' direct intervention with the Secretary of Energy has resulted in the continuation of a key contract with the Department of Energy. This contract is the cornerstone of MSE's economic viability and it insures the continuation of a number of well-paying technical jobs. There are 180 employees here at MSE who can be thankful that Senator Burns is as invested in their jobs as they are, and we are all grateful for his work and that of his staff." 
   MSE, located in Butte, conducts research for several federal agencies including the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
