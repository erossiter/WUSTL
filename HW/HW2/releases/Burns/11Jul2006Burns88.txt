SEN. BURNS: MISSOURI RIVER DRUG TASK FORCE FUNDING CRITICALLY NEEDED
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced that a provision he authored to provide resources for the Missouri River Drug Task Force is included in legislation to fund the Departments of Commerce and Justice. This legislation will be considered in the Senate Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee today and by the full Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday. 
   The Missouri River Drug Task Force, the state's largest drug task force, covers 17,984 square miles in Montana, including seven counties. These specific resources were requested by the Missouri Drug Task Force to provide much-needed support in their drug interdiction efforts.
   "I've been out with the agents on the Missouri River Drug Task Force and have seen firsthand how difficult their job is and what they need," said Senator Burns. "When they detailed to me their funding needs, I ensured them I would fight to make sure they get the resources they require. Today, I am declaring this language as the appropriate and best vehicle to ensure the funding for these efforts. I welcome my Senate colleagues, including Senator Baucus, to join me in this fight."
   As founder of the Senate's Anti-Meth Caucus, Senator Burns has been a leader in developing meth policies directed at prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. Earlier this year, Senator Burns asked Senator Shelby, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Commerce and Justice, to fully-fund the Meth Hot Spots program authorized by the Combat Meth Act. The Hot Spots program helps catch and prosecute meth cooks and provides clean up of meth-contaminated areas.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the U.S. Departments of Justice and Commerce, and has jurisdiction over Missouri River Drug Task Force funding.
