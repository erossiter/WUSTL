SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH USDA SECRETARY JOHANNS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) met with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Johanns this morning to discuss the USDA rule that will open the border to Canadian beef on March 7 of this year.  
   "I have had ongoing concerns about this rule," said Burns. "This morning I had the opportunity to sit down with Secretary Johanns and discuss exactly why I've been gun shy about going ahead with this rule on March 7. When we saw the first case of BSE in Canadian cattle, it seemed to be an isolated case, but now after four incidents it is clear we need to reexamine the situation up there, and move forward in a cautious fashion. 
   "The flaws in this rule could harm not only our Montana producers, but also consumer confidence and our international markets, and I do not feel that moving forward with the rule on March 7 is in our best interest. We need to make sure Canada is enforcing its feed ban, and the rule needs to limit eligible beef and beef products to cattle slaughtered at under 30 months. Secretary Johanns was responsive to the concerns that I expressed this morning, and I am optimistic that we may begin to see a change in the mindset over at the USDA about implementing this rule. 
   "I plan to continue discussions with Secretary Johanns, as well as other members of the Senate regarding this rule implementation in the coming weeks. This is a huge issue, and we cannot afford to move hastily with this rule that could have an incredibly negative impact on our country." 
   Secretary Johanns will testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee in a hearing regarding border security on February 3, 2005 at 11am EST, which is being held at the request of Senator Burns.
