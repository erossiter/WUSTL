SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $250 MILLION READY FOR RED LODGE USE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today the remaining obstacle to a $250,000 award to the city of Red Lodge has been removed and the funding will be received this week.  
   The effort to secure funds included the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Big Sky Economic Development Authority, the city of Red Lodge, and Senator Burns working together. The award is intended to spur economic development and recovery in the wake of the Beartooth mudslides that occurred last year and devastated many businesses in the along the frequently used road leading to Yellowstone Park. 
   Senator Burns said, "I'm pleased the final bureaucratic hurdle has been removed and the $250,000 award I secured can go to the citizens and business owners of Red Lodge. Working together with local officials and BSEDA has helped us identify an important Montana priority, and this money will give help where it's needed." 
   Rod Profitt, City Manager of Red Lodge, said, "Red Lodge needed all the help we could get, and Senator Burns really came through for us."
