SEN. BURNS SECURES IMPORTANT NASA PROJECTS FOR BOZEMAN
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced he has secured federal funding for three important NASA programs in the Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill, which passed subcommittee and full committee last week. 
   The following Bozeman-area projects were inserted in the bill at Senator Burns' request:
   * Montana Space Grant Consortium's Robotics and Lego League Promotion - Senator Burns has secured funding for the Montana Space Grant Consortium to expand their involvement in Montana schools for robotics and engineering programs, such as high school robotics competitions and Lego League events for middle school students.
   * Montana State University: Spaceflight Health Monitoring Technology - Senator Burns has secured funding for Montana State University's Spaceflight Health Monitoring Technology program, a research program aimed at measuring the impact zero gravity has on the human body, providing research opportunities for students.
   * Montana State University: Compact Laser Sensors - Senator Burns has secured funding for Montana State University's Compact Laser Sensors program, which has historically received federal support to study compact lasers and devices and applications in everyday life.
   "I will continue supporting these NASA programs," said Senator Burns. "These programs offer outstanding research opportunities to our students and help attract first-rate professors. The strong partnership between private industry and public researchers is creating high-tech jobs in Bozeman. MSU has become a top tier research institution and we will help in any way we can."
   "MSU appreciates Senator Burns support for these NASA projects," said Tom McCoy, Vice President for Research at MSU. "Research to be conducted will contribute to critical issues impacting future space exploration. Importantly, this funding will also provide students with hands on learning experiences that enhance employment opportunities when they graduate."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds NASA.
