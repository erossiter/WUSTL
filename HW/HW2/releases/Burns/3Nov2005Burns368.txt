SEN. BURNS SCOLDS CONGRESS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today voted against the Agriculture Appropriations bill for FY06 in protest of the process in which the conference report was resolved and filed. Audio of Burns comments regarding COOL and his vote are available on the web at: http://src.senate.gov/burns/radio/. 
   "We got down to the country of origin labeling that was put into law and signed by the President of the United States in the 2002 farm bill," said Burns. "It is the law of the land, and an overwhelming majority of both this body and the House of Representatives voted to put it there. Yet we are denied the money to write the rules and regulations and implement the law and put it into effect." 
   "What is even worse, there was no debate and no vote in the conference committee while the conference was going on. Just like I said, I have chaired conference committees on appropriations, and we did not leave that room until all of the issues that were still on the table were dealt with, folks got to debate them, we listened to them, and we got an up-or-down vote." 
   "So I am disappointed, but yet we move along and there will be another day when again we will saddle up and try to get this legislation implemented, which basically is the law of the land. Make no mistake about it, this hurts our credibility. I will cast a vote against the conference report when it comes up tomorrow. This is a terrible way to do business in the Senate. We can do better in this body. We can respect everyone's opinion and everybody's amendment and everybody's bill, but give them a vote."
