SEN. BURNS CUTTING COSTS FOR VETERANS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the introduction of the "Veterans Road to Health Care Act of 2005," legislation designed to raise the travel reimbursement rate for veterans who must travel to Veterans Administration (VA) facilities for treatment.  
   "Veterans in rural states like Montana are most affected by the low travel reimbursement rate they currently receive," said Burns. "These folks often drive long distances for health care because they have no other option, and this legislation would be a big help, especially in a time when we are faced with unusually high gas prices. We cannot ask our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation to choose between health care and other necessities." 
   The current reimbursement for veterans' travel expenses is 11 cents per mile. The Veterans Road to Health Care Act would raise veterans' reimbursement rate to 40.5 cents per mile to match the federal employee travel reimbursement rate. It would also allow reimbursement under the Travel Beneficiary Program to veterans who cannot receive adequate care at their VA facility and have been referred to a special care center by their VA physician.
