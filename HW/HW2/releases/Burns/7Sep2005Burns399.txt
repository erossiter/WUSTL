BILLINGS BUS DEPOT FUNDS RELEASED
  The U.S. Department of Transportation announced today it is releasing $3,707,861 to the City of Billings to fund the construction of a new Met Transit Bus Facility in downtown Billings.  
   U.S. Senator Conrad Burns (R-Mont), a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, requested the funding in last year's Transportation Appropriations Bill. Burns is also a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has oversight of the Department of Transportation. 
   "The check's been cut," said Burns. "I'm glad we were able to get these funds for my home town. I've been told the City has worked out a good location for the new transfer facility, and I think it will be a great addition to the public transportation infrastructure in Billings. MET Transit has done a good job improving the bus lines around town, and this is yet another step forward." 
   Bruce Putnam, Director of Aviation and Transit for the City of Billings said "This is a much needed improvement for the City of Billings. It's going to make our mass transit program better in so many ways. Senator Burns has been a guardian angel for us on this project from the beginning. He realized the value of this program, and has stuck with us. We are deeply in his debt for this assistance." 
   MET Transit provides approximately 750,000 rides every year, predominantly for the elderly, handicapped, and school-age children. The service runs fourteen hours a day, six days a week. Putnam added "As Billings grows, so does our ridership. This facility will provide an out-of-the-weather sheltered transferring environment and improve our service for Billings riders."
