SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDING FOR BOZEMAN, DUTTON
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced funding for two Montana Fire Departments through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
 Sourdough Rural Fire District in Bozeman will receive $167,628 and Dutton Volunteer Fire Department will receive $78,660, both for operations and safety. 
   "Firefighting in Montana is a dangerous business," said Burns. "As our hearts go out to the people of Louisiana and Mississippi after the terrible destruction caused by Katrina, we are reminded how important this type of funding is to make sure our first responders have the training and equipment they need to save lives. The bravery displayed by the men and women out in the field battling blazes is a remarkable thing, and I am happy to see these funds go out to Bozeman and Dutton today." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
