SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDING FOR BUTTE, GREAT FALLS, LIBBY, ST. REGIS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced fire department funding for Montana through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
 The following four recipients will receive funding for operations and safety: Gore Hill Volunteer Fire Department in Great Falls, $55,813; Lincoln County Rural Fire District #1, $210,330; St. Regis Volunteer Fire Department, $104,500; and Butte Silver Bow Fire Department, $36,941. 
   "The folks who work to combat fires in our state do a tremendous job," said Burns. "As we find ourselves in the middle of hurricane season, with so many communities feeling the pain of the destruction they cause, it becomes increasingly clear how important it is for our first responders to have the tools and training they need during an emergency. These funds are a real boost to the men and women who are out in the fields responding to emergencies in Montana, and I am glad to see these funds heading to four of our communities today." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
