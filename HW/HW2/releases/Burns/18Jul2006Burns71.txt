SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES BOZEMAN DEFENSE PROJECTS ADVANCE TOWARD FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that at least seven major defense projects for Bozeman have been included in an Appropriations bill that is expected to be approved by their respective subcommittees today and the full Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday. 
   The following projects are advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill:
   * Advanced Acoustic Concepts: High Data Rate Networks - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for a contract to develop data networks that will link Navy sonar sensors, aircraft and ships to command centers.
   * Expeditionary Air Field Matting Replacement - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for the Federal Technology Group to develop new, lightweight aluminum matting for temporary runways and taxiways. This technology has a huge commercial application with aluminum mats for oil rigs. This is the first step in putting that manufacturing base in Montana.
   * Montana State University, Bozeman: Bio-Inspired Materials - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for MSU to continue its valuable research into biological research and technology efforts for various defense applications. 
   * Montana State University, Bozeman: Mil Tech - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for MSU to develop Mil Tech Extension's transitioning innovative technology to the U.S. military more rapidly and cost-effectively. The Mil Tech program helps small businesses deliver new technology to the Department of Defense, and assists these businesses in their efforts to work with the Department of Defense on future projects. 
   * Montana State University, Bozeman: Advanced Energy Technology for Munitions - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for MSU to develop fuel cell technology for military applications. 
   * Montana State University, Bozeman: Ground Based Studies of Rocket Plume Chemistry - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding for MSU to develop new scientific approaches to missile defense. 
   * Montana State University, Bozeman: Biological Detection of Land Mines - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to further research detection of land mines using honey bees. This is an ongoing effort with the University of Montana in Missoula to better detect these mines, so they may be safely and efficiently removed.
   "These Bozeman area projects are critical to maintaining our state's key role in our national defense," said Senator Burns. "I have worked with my colleagues and local folks to make sure these projects are a high priority."
   "This will have a tremendous economic impact for the state of Montana," said Todd Johnson, Executive Director of the Federal Technology Group. "If this project is ultimately successful, it could lead to hundreds of manufacturing jobs within the state of Montana to produce an estimated 24 million square feet of a replacement AM2 matting system."
   Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
