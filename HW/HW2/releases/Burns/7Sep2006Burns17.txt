SEN. BURNS SUCCESSFULLY ADDS $275 MILLION FOR FIRES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today hailed the addition of $275 million in funding for fire fighting, supplementing existing accounts so the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service will not have to borrow from other critical, non-fire accounts. The funding is divided into $100 million for DOI and $175 million for the Forest Service. 
  "Through my work with the Budget Committee, I was able to secure an additional $1 billion for these efforts since 2004, which prevented the need of our firefighting agencies to borrow from non-fire programs," said Senator Burns. "However, that funding has run out. This new funding will continue my efforts to ensure that important programs like grazing, timber, and recreation are not adversely affected by the cost of fighting fires."
  Senator Burns was a key player in assuring this amendment (#4915) to the Senate Defense Appropriations Bill passed the Senate today by voice vote. The overall bill passed the Senate 98-0 and now proceeds to a conference with the House.
  "My goal is to deliver this funding as soon as possible," said Senator Burns. "That is why I filed an amendment to the next Appropriations bill, which may be signed in to law before the Defense bill."
  Tonight Senator Burns filed an amendment to the Senate fiscal year 2007 Military Quality of Life, Military Construction, and Veteran's Affairs Appropriations bill to deliver $300 million for this funding, $125 million for DOI and $175 million to the Forest Service.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which authors the Defense Appropriations bill, and was an original cosponsor of the amendment.
