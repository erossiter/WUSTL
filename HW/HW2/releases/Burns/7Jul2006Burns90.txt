SEN. BURNS HIGHLIGHTS STRONG ECONOMY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) issued the following statement on today's employment report, released this morning by the U.S. Department of Labor: 
   "Today we received more news of a strong economy getting stronger. We created 121,000 new payroll jobs in June, which means we have now created over 5.4 million new jobs since August 2003. National unemployment is steady at 4.6% and in Montana it's even better at 3.8%. The national economy grew at 4.8% in the first quarter of this year. Wages rose sharply, up 3.9% over the past year. All of the economic indicators are very positive. We can continue enacting pro-growth policies by killing the death tax and including other important tax provisions in legislation this year. Our economy is strong and raising taxes is not the right thing to do."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce and Small Business Committees and three-term U.S. Senator.
