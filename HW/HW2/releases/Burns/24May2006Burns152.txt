SEN. BURNS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT VA DATA BREACH
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today expressed serious concern about the reported theft of identity information from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This week, a VA employee violated department policy by taking electronic data home, which included the name, date of birth and social security number of up to 26.5 million veterans and spouses. The employee's home was burglarized and the breached data was stolen. This data did not include veterans' health records or financial information. 
   "We need to get to the bottom of this and hold accountable those who allowed this to happen," said Senator Burns. "I am also concerned about reports that it took two weeks for this breach to be disclosed. We need to investigate this theft aggressively, find the thieves, and recover the information. Attorney General Gonzalez needs to stand by his word that 'there will be zero tolerance' for anyone who attempts to use veterans' personal information to commit identity theft. We must ensure that our veterans are protected."
  Currently, law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Inspector General of the VA have launched full-scale investigations. The VA employee, a data analyst, has been placed on administrative leave pending result of the investigation. VA is cooperating with Congress, the news media, veteran's service organizations and other government agencies to help ensure that veterans and their families are aware of the situation and of steps they may take to protect themselves from misuse of their personal information. 
  MONTANA VETERANS WHO ARE CONCERNED CAN DO THE FOLLOWING:
   * Call VA call center for information 1-800-FED INFO (1-800-333-4636). They are open 8am to 9pm (EDT), Monday-Saturday as long as necessary
   * Monitor bank and credit card statements (include any financial transaction statements)
   * If suspicious or unusual activity is detected, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends contacting the three major credit bureaus. Close any accounts that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently, and file a police report with your local police or the police in the community where the identity theft took place. Victims should also file a complaint with the FTC by calling 1-877-438-4338
