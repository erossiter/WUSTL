SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY TRAINING GRANTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today two separate grants from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) totaling $846,744 in emergency grant funds for workers laid off from Talk America, Bresnan Communication, and Stream International.  
 The funding will aid approximately 465 workers in counties across the state including Silver Bow, Missoula, Cascade, Flathead, Lake, Dawson, and Lewis and Clark. 
   "Anytime you're dealing with layoffs, it's difficult," said Burns. "These funds will provide necessary job retraining and give a leg up to folks who were impacted by the layoffs and closures in these areas. I'm pleased to see these funds come available and stand ready to offer any additional help that may be needed as we get these Montanans back to work." 
   Montana Job Service and the Montana Job Training Partnership will apply the funding to provide retraining in needed skills, as well as support through the job search process and relocation assistance if necessary. The funding was awarded in two separate grants of $393,824 for workers from Talk America and Bresnan Communications, and $452,920 for several companies in Northwestern Montana including Stream International.
