SEN. BURNS, STAFF PARTICIPATE IN CAPITAL CHALLENGE THREE MILE CHARITY RUN
  This morning at the Anacostia Park in southeast Washington, D.C., Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) participated in the annual ACLI Capital Challenge, a three-mile charity run to benefit the D.C. Special Olympics. 
  Senator Burns, along with ten members of his staff, finished the three-mile, flat, out-and-back course along the Anacostia River which separates Washington, D.C. and Virginia.
  Senator Burns said, "This is my fifth or sixth time participating in the Capital Challenge. I had ten members of my staff with me, and we were all pleased to support the Special Olympics by getting good exercise on a beautiful morning. My daughter Keely made me promise I'd walk, so I did. It was good fun."
  According to the ACLI website, there were 14 Senators and 27 Congressmen registered to compete, along with members of the Executive branch, Judicial branch, media professionals, and Capitol Hill staff.
  All participants received a t-shirt, refreshments, and a one-year subscription to Running Times. According to the ACLI, the event's main sponsor, over $16,000 was raised for the D.C. Special Olympics.
