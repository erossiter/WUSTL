SEN. BURNS: WE'LL GET BUDGET RIGHT FOR MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement regarding the president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2007:  
   "Now that we've received the Administration's request, it's time to get to work on setting the budget. The president's budget increases defense spending and homeland security spending, while keeping discretionary spending below inflation, reining in the out-of-control growth in entitlement programs, and cutting the deficit in half by 2009. Budgets are about priorities. The President is proposing new initiatives for meth lab cleanup and biodiesel development, which are beneficial to Montana. However, I have some serious concerns about proposed cuts to agriculture, education and rural health care, as well as reductions in funding for Amtrak, Essential Air Service, and Airport Improvement Grants. We're early in the process and there's time to get this ship-shape and working well for Montana and the country."
