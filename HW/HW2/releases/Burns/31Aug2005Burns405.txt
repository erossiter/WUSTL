SEN. BURNS REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO OPEN STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today applauded the move by President Bush to open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPRO) to help refiners affected by the hurricane.  
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by the catastrophic events of Hurricane Katrina," said Burns. "Folks in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama have been hit extremely hard by this storm, and first responders and citizens alike are working tirelessly to rescue victims and bring food and water to areas where it's needed, and I applaud their efforts." 
   "I am glad to see President Bush take the necessary steps to open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve today, which was set up for situations just like the one our nation is experiencing right now. Burns added that the Energy Committee months ago scheduled a hearing for September 8, focusing on the world's supply and demand for oil in order to ascertain the impact of increased gas prices on the American economy. "This hearing has become even more timely as folks in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama feel the ripples of Katrina, and I look forward to hearing testimony from our witnesses which will surely shed some light on this important topic." 
   The Energy Committee hearing will discuss whether we have reached our limits of refining capacity, and whether this nation has concentrated our refining and distribution system too much in the Gulf region. It is scheduled for 10am on Thursday, September 8, in room 106 of the Senate Dirksen Office Building. Witnesses will be announced September 2 and will subsequently be posted on the committee website: http://energy.senate.gov/public//http://energy.senate.gov/public/.
