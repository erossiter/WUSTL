SEN. BURNS CELEBRATES NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today celebrated the start of National Small Business Week by reaffirming his pledge to support small businesses in Montana through pro-growth policies. 
  Senator Burns is currently advancing his small business legislative agenda on behalf of Montanans in a wide range of areas:
   * Co-introduced Small Business Health Plan (SBHP) legislation with Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R - Wyo.) which would expand coverage opportunities to small business employees and reduce health insurance costs for businesses
   - Held SBHP roundtable with Chairman Enzi in Billings in April
   - Will fight for passage of the bill on the Senate floor in May
   * Co-sponsored the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act in the Senate which will spur federal investment and private innovation in the math, science, and engineering fields
   * Co-sponsored National Small Business Week resolution in the Senate, which was proclaimed by the President to begin April 9 and last for one week
   * Will host a softwood lumber roundtable on April 28 in Missoula to investigate the effects of the dispute on small businesses and identify potential solutions
   * Congratulated Montana Small Business Person of the Year, Andrew Field of Livingston, from www.printingforless.com
   * Requested additional funding for Small Business Administration (SBA) programs in a letter to the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee last week
   - Included specific funding increase for Small Business Innovative Research under the Federal and State Technology Partnership program
   * Secured appropriations for business incubators around Montana, including TechRanch in Bozeman, MonTEC in Missoula, and the Montana Technology and Innovation Partnership in Billings
  Senator Burns said, "Our small businesses in Montana are the engine that fuels our state's strong economy. Government doesn't create wealth or jobs, we create a positive climate for investment and job creation and the ingenuity, hard work and drive of our workforce does the rest. We currently have 96.3% employment in Montana and I vow to continue my efforts to support small businesses whenever possible, in health care, agriculture, competitiveness in education, and research funding."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Small Business and Commerce Committees and is a three term U.S. Senator.
