SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMISSIONER JOHN KEYS RETIREMENT AT BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
  Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement today regarding the retirement of John Keys as Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation (BoR) at the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). 
   "I've known John for many, many years. He's a trusted friend and an accomplished public servant who's dedicated 40 years of his life to the Bureau of Reclamation and the important water issues they're charged with. I've worked closely with John during the many droughts we've faced in Montana , and most recently on the urgent need for major rehabilitation for the St. Mary Facilities that serve the hi-line.
   "As the President and the Department of the Interior consider nominees to be John's successor, I urge them to seek a Westerner, and I'll offer the names of a few qualified Montanans. What I want to see is a nominee that shares John's commitment to the water issues we face in Montana and understands that the St. Mary Facilities require rehabilitation and seeing that happen is important to Montana and to me personally. St. Mary's is the most important water issue facing BoR and I want to see a nominee that will work closely with us to deliver a solution as we move forward.
   "Again, I appreciate the good work and solid friendship of John Keys. I wish him and his family well as he gets back home."
