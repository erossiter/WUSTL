SEN. BURNS CALLS FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE OPTION TO FRONT LEASES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) met today with representatives of 'Save The Front', a group of citizens who oppose development of the Rocky Mountain Front.  
 In a previous meeting in Washington, the members had asked him to review the legislation sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) which would offer to give leaseholders an option in a different part of the nation in exchange for their Front lease. During that meeting, Burns agreed to look over the proposed bill and respond to them. 
   "First let me start by saying I don't like the idea of taking these lands out of production," said Burns. "Second, the leaseholders are the ones who own the rights to these plots. Now, bearing that in mind, I was asked to look at lease swaps and buyouts by the federal government. I don't think this is a burden the taxpayers need to bear. 
   "There is precedent for private groups purchasing land that is important to them from a conservation perspective. I think it would be worthwhile for groups such as 'Save the Front', and the Montana Wilderness Association to explore these options. The leaseholders are business people, and they are capable of making rational business decisions, and I leave it to them to decide, but I think this is a discussion that is long overdue."
