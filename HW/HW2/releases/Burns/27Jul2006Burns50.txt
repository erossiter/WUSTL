SEN. BURNS ENDORSES GOAL OF 25 PERCENT RENEWABLE FUEL USE BY 2025
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement today of the future of renewable fuels in the United States: 
   "There has been a lot of excitement recently over the potential for renewable energy - everything from cellulose ethanol to wind energy. I believe that Montana can benefit from increased investment in these new technologies, and I think it could open up new opportunities for our farmers and ranchers.
   "Today I signed onto a resolution - a federal commitment to use 25 percent renewable energy by 2025. This initiative, known as '25x25', is led by a diverse coalition, and Montana Farmers Union has been at the forefront. Working with them, I am pleased to support this effort to grow our way to energy independence.
   "We've spurred tremendous federal investment in alternative fuel technologies with the 2005 Energy Bill, but we can do more and this commitment is part of that process."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Energy Committee and the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
