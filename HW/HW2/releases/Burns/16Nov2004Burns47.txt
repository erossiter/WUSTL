SEN. BURNS TO INTRODUCE NEW COOL LEGISLATION ON NOV. 16
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) will introduce a bill to modify Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) legislation today. Sens.  
 Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Craig Thomas (R-WY) are co-sponsors of this bill which would move the mandatory COOL implementation date up one year to September 2005, and would remove the processed foods exemption. 
   "During the past several weeks I have been traveling throughout the state of Montana, and there wasn't one stop where the issue of COOL didn't come up," said Burns. "Our producers work hard and deliver some of the highest quality beef in the world, and I am confident in their ability to uphold the integrity of this industry. They take a lot of pride in the their products, and they want their products to carry a 'Made in the USA' label, but right now their voices are not being heard." 
   "I have supported COOL for many years, but at this point, the voluntary program we have put in place has not been used-it is not working and it is not benefiting producers or consumers. We need to put mandatory COOL in place, and we need to do it right. The legislation I will introduce today will do just that. We're going to fight the good fight on the Senate side, but in order for this to succeed, it will need support from the House, and I call on my colleagues across the hill to step up and do what's right for producers."
