SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORDABILITY, ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY ACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns joined the bipartisan fight to ensure America's long-term competitiveness in the global economy by cosponsoring the Higher Education Affordability, Access and Opportunity Act of 2004, a bill introduced in the Senate today.  
   Recent estimates by the Department of Labor suggest that approximately 80 percent of all new job opportunities in the next 10 years will require some level of postsecondary education or training. To help meet this demand, this act will help higher education institutions develop curriculums that are more closely linked to the workforce in demand, improve the self-sufficiency of that workforce and provide parents and students with greater access to educational opportunities. 
   Burns said, "Even though Montana has an exceptional education system, we need to be constantly aware of the tools necessary for our students to become more productive members of the workforce. I'm happy to offer this bill my support, as it will offer our students and educational institutions a better ability to tailor themselves to the world we'll be facing tomorrow." 
   Specifically, this bill will: 
   * Provide grant funding to institutions to ensure they're providing students with the education they'll need upon entering the workforce 
   * Provide assistance to small business owners and operators who wish to receive short-term, postsecondary training 
   * Offer an additional $2,000 in subsidized loans to first and second year college students in pursuit of the skills needed in high-wage and high-growth occupations 
   * Include the input of state workforce agencies to help institutions of higher education identify growing workforce areas 
   * Help students enter college at any time throughout their lives by offering greater support to nontraditional students (those older the age of 24, and often supporting families) 
   * Simplify credit transfer issues 
   * Provide easier access to Department of Education data on all institutions of higher education.
