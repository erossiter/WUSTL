SEN. BURNS URGES GOVERNOR TO OPEN OTTER CREEK COAL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today urged Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D - Mont.) to offer the state-owned Otter Creek Coal tracts for lease, allowing the coal mined at Otter Creek to play a valuable role in Montana's energy future. The two met this afternoon in the Senator's Washington office to discuss issues facing Montanans.  
   Senator Burns said, "We need the state to open Otter Creek up. It will send the best signal to the people who want to begin development in Eastern Montana's vast coal reserves, but the state is dragging its heels. Otter Creek is an excellent coal resource, but it's being held back today. I urge the Governor to remove the obstacles to private investment and let Otter Creek provide the economic benefit to Montana that it surely will offer." 
   One potential use of the Otter Creek coal is coal gasification, an emerging technology Senator Burns has long supported. In the last two years alone, Senator Burns secured $3 million for coal to liquid research programs targeted to Montana. 
   Senator Burns and Governor Schweitzer agreed that the full renovation of the St. Mary's Irrigation system is a legislative priority. The St. Mary's canal serves many hi-line irrigation districts and communities dependent on the Milk River, but has been in a state of disrepair for many years. 
   Senator Burns said, "We've secured over $100 million in water project improvements for Montana in my years in the Senate. I am working closely with the St. Mary's Working Group and this is a priority for me this year. I'm pleased the Governor has agreed to help; we need to ensure the stability of the water system at St. Mary's for the long term. I'm committed to this project, and my seniority in the Senate will be very valuable as we seek to restore St. Mary's capabilities." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and three-term U.S. Senator.
