SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON KEMPTHORNE'S NOMINATION TO BE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR
  Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement today regarding the nomination of Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to be the new Secretary of the Interior:  
   "I've known Dirk Kempthorne a long time, since we were colleagues in the Senate. He's a good man, an accomplished public servant and a close friend. I can think of no better person to follow Secretary Gale Norton at the Department of Interior. As a former Senator and now the Governor of Idaho, he fully understands the important public land, natural resource and Native American issues that affect our country and my state of Montana . I know he'll be a strong advocate for land conservation and management and sensible federal policy, and I look forward to strongly supporting his nomination in the Energy Committee and working closely with him as the Secretary of the Interior."
