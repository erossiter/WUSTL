SEN. BURNS PRAISES HHS ON NEW $700,000 FOR LOW INCOME MONTANA HEATING BILLS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) was pleased today upon hearing the news that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released additional funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
   Montana will receive over $700,000 of those funds, which will be made available immediately in time to help the neediest Montana families during the coldest winter months. LIHEAP started in 1982 and each year supports over 5 million households annually during the coldest winter and warmest summer months. This federal program's appropriations for the winter season are approximately $3.1 billion nationwide. 
   Burns has been a strong supporter of LIHEAP, and before the end of year adjournment, voted in favor of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which contained an additional $1 billion in LIHEAP funding. That bill passed with a tie-breaking vote cast by Vice President Dick Cheney. Burns also cast a number of procedural votes to protect the new LIHEAP funding for Montanans. 
   Senator Burns said, "I applaud the federal government for this new funding for a critical program for my state. In the cold winter, we need to make sure we help in any way we can, and heating bills are increasing with rising energy prices, so as the need is there, so is the federal government to help". 
   LIHEAP currently aids over 12,000 households statewide, which is 10% higher than at this time last year. LIHEAP is Montana will likely support nearly 23,000 by the end of April when applications for funding must be received. 
   Burns cited the need for increased LIHEAP funding early in 2006 with the Senate leadership.
