SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF AL ZARQAWI
  Sen. Conrad Burns released the following statement regarding the death of the al Qaeda terrorist leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al Zarqawi: 
  "The news that the number one terrorist in Iraq has been killed is a tribute to the skill and determination of U.S. and Iraqi forces. This is a double victory for Iraqi folks. After all, they found him with information that came from Iraqi folks. And it was there and they were taking the lead so we took him out. He's a very, very brutal man. He beheaded people; I mean this guy was really bad.
  "But more than that, I think in the victory of the government of Iraqi people, their government announced today that their minister of the defense and minister on the interior is in place and their government is getting a little more stable and confident everyday to represent the Iraqi people.
  "Now I think the Iraqi people have made the determination that were tired of this nonsense of terrorism in their country and now the government is standing up, gaining confidence. I think it's a great day for all of us here in this country and so just put a check mark in the win column."
