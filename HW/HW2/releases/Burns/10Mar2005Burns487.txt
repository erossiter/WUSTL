SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS BANKRUPTCY REFORM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today voted in favor of S. 256, "The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005," a bill to prevent abuses of the consumer bankruptcy system.  
 This bill passed the Senate in a vote of 74-25. 
   "We have seen the number of bankruptcies filed increase enormously over the past several years, and this is a tool that will help slow this trend," said Burns. "By putting methods in place to determine when folks fit into bankruptcy categories we'll be better able to make sure those people who really need the assistance from this system can get it." 
   The ability of consumers to file Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies is refined through the application of a means test to determine whether or not an individual filing for bankruptcy would be able to repay a portion of their debt (and thus file for Chapter 13) or whether the debts will be forgiven under Chapter 7. If it is evident to a bankruptcy judge that an individual has abused the system, such as running up credit card debt immediately before filing Chapter 7, the court could mandate that the individual repay a portion of their overall debt under a Chapter 13 repayment plan as an alternative to Chapter 7, which offers a fresh start. 
   The bill also includes provisions to improve consumer protection and discourage abuse of the bankruptcy system. The legislation also includes significant reforms for small businesses subject to bankruptcy proceedings, including the protection of family farmers through the permanent reenactment of Chapter 12 to address difficulties faced by family farms.
