FUNDS TO SUPPORT PLENTYWOOD RURAL FIRE DISTRICT
 Sen. Conrad Burns announced today the dispersal of $16,650 to the Plentywood Rural Fire District through the Department of Homeland Security's 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 These funds will be put to use to improve the city's firefighting operations and firefighter safety programs. 
   "This funding will give our local firefighters a boost, and I think everyone in Montana will agree that they deserve it," Burns said. "Grants like these allow communities to improve their fire stations, buy new fire trucks, or even hire additional personnel. This is a great big 'thank you' to the men and women who protect our homes and lands, but it is also a necessary step toward making us safer from fires in the future." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
