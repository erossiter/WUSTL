SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE APPROVES BIPARTISAN ANTI-SPYWARE LEGISLATION
  The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee today unanimously approved the SPY BLOCK (Software Principles Yielding Better Levels of Consumer Knowledge) Act sponsored by Sens. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). SPY BLOCK prohibits a variety of surreptitious practices that result in unwanted software being placed on consumers' computers. Spyware, adware and other hidden programs often secretly piggyback on downloaded Internet software without the user's knowledge, transmitting information about their computer usage and generating pop-up advertisements. Amended SPY BLOCK legislation aimed at fighting secret installation of such programs was approved in the form of a substitute offered by Burns, Wyden and Boxer at the Committee's markup today. 
   "When I purchase a computer and install it in my home, I expect to be the only one who has access to it," said Burns. "But it has become common practice for online spies to bury themselves in computer systems and watch every move computer users make. This legislation gives control back to those who should have it-it protects computer users from those potentially devastating spies and the surreptitious programs they want to install."
   "Too many American computer users are getting hit with secret, 'drive-by' downloads that invade their privacy and usurp control of their computer systems," said Wyden. "SPY BLOCK tells software peddlers that these high-tech hijackings aren't acceptable any more."
   Boxer said, "This important legislation will give consumers control over the programs that are downloaded onto their computers and ensure that people are protected from hazardous software. As more and more people use the Internet, privacy violations become a greater threat, and we want to make sure that our constituents are not unknowingly being taken advantage of and spied on by hackers."
   SPY BLOCK starts from the premise that each computer user should have knowledge and control over what software is resident on his or her machine. Thus, the bill's prohibitions generally focus on the installation of software. Specifically, the bill would prohibit:
   * Surreptitious installation of software, where the user never intended to trigger the installation of any software and may not even be aware that any installation is occurring.
   * Misleading inducements to install software, where a user is tricked into installing software by misrepresentations concerning who is providing the software or what it does.
   * Installing software that, once installed, prevents reasonable efforts by the user to uninstall or disable it.
   * Installing software that automatically collects and transmits information about the user, for purposes that aren't functionally related to the user's voluntary use of the software, unless the user was provided with notice.
   The notice requirement would only apply to information collection for essentially extraneous purposes. For example, where a user's email or instant messaging software needs to collect and transmit information such as I.P. address or online status to make the email and I.M. functions work properly, that information collection would be "functionally related" and no notice would be required. Where notice is required, it would have to be reasonably calculated to actually reach the user, and to occur at a time when the user can still choose not to permit the information collection.
   The legislation also prohibits:
   * Installing software that causes ads to appear without identifying itself as the source of the ads.
   * Knowingly engaging in any of a variety of other practices that thwart a user's control over his or her computer.
   The bill approved by the Committee includes an amendment offered by Senator Allen to add criminal penalties for certain particularly egregious and intentional acts.
   The Federal Trade Commission would be charged with enforcing SPY BLOCK, with violations treated as unfair or deceptive trade practices. In addition, state Attorneys General would be authorized to bring actions as well. The bill would preempt state spyware statutes, except to the extent such statutes prohibit deception.
   The bill is now referred to the full Senate for consideration.
