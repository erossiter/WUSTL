SEN. BURNS DISAPPOINTED OVER U.S. FOREST SERVICE ? NEPTUNE DECISION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) expressed his disappointment today that a final decision on the reinstatement of Neptune Aviation's P-2 Tanker Fleet would take up to three months.  
 Burns was notified today by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) they would contract with Lockheed Martin, the original manufacturer of the P-2, to research and test the worthiness of the aircraft. During this testing period, the USFS would contract one Neptune aircraft for firefighting purposes. 
   "I'd like to see a faster resolution to this," said Burns. "There are a lot of factors in play here, but the bottom line is we have a great company in Missoula that is essentially idle while they wait for an answer from the government, and an answer that could have dire implications for the future of their business. Our office has been in contact with the folks at Neptune Aviation, Mark Rey with the Forest Service, and officials with Lockheed Martin to ensure we're keeping this situation moving forward. I'd like to see these aircraft certified flight-ready, and get them back in the air as soon as possible." 
   Burns is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the USFS, and also sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the FAA.
