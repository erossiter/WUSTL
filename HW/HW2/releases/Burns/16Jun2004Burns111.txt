SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES PILT MONEY RELEASED TO MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced today that $16,681,936 million in funding authorized by the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) act will be released tomorrow to Montana counties by the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management.  
   "I'm pleased to see this money coming to Montana, as it will help us to improve our community services and infrastructure," said Burns. "PILT funds go into the enhancement and expansion of our firefighting and law enforcement programs, roads, water and wastewater facilities, and many other vital services to our state. I've worked hard in Congress to see this money make its way through the Appropriations process, so I'm glad to know that every county in Montana will be able to use it in the development of the systems they individually need most. Even better, through Secretary Norton's use of the accelerated payment program, Montana's counties will getting these funds early enough to help as they construct a budget for the upcoming fiscal year." 
   Montana's PILT funding comes from the national total of $224.3 million, the largest amount ever appropriated by Congress for this program. The PILT program provides repayment to counties based on the amount of tax-exempt federal lands within their borders. For more specific information on the funding for each county, contact Sen. Burns' press office at (202) 224-2644. 
   Burns has been supportive of increases in PILT funding for the past six years and was able to influence this year's allocation through his position as Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Department of Interior and the Bureau of Land Management.
