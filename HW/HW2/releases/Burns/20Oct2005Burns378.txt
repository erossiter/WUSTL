SEN. BURNS PASSES AMENDMENT TO FUND ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE
  In a Senate Commerce Committee hearing today, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) included an amendment that will make $75 million in funding available over the next five years for the Essential Air Service (EAS).  
   "I'm pleased to see the Committee side with our nation's small airports by including my amendment in their bill," said Burns. "In an environment of skyrocketing jet fuel costs, this amendment ultimately provides the EAS program with the funding it needs to be effective. It gives us the opportunity to assist our rural communities through a well supported program, and I look forward to seeing it become law." 
   Under the Burns Amendment, the money would be provided from the auction of spectrum as television public broadcasting moves to the digital format. In each of the five years of the budgetary window the amendment would make $15 million per year available to the Secretary of Transportation for carrying out the EAS program only if two conditions have been met. First, the funds must be in addition to the current over flight fees collected that help pay for the program. And second, the additional yearly funds of $15 million would only be made available once the Appropriations Committee funded the program at $110 million. 
   The EAS program subsidizes freight and passenger flights to eight cities in Montana including Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Lewistown, Miles City, Sidney, West Yellowstone and Wolf Point. Burns is a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation. The Subcommittee on Aviation maintains jurisdiction over the Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, Aviation Industry, Aviation Safety, Aviation Trust Fund, and Airport Improvement Program.
