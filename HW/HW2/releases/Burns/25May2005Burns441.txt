SEN. BURNS ALERTS CABINET TO BEARTOOTH MESS
  In the wake of the massive mudslide that has closed the Beartooth Pass, Sen.  
 Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez today, showing him pictures of the mudslide from the Billings Gazette and requesting information as to what the Department of Commerce might do to help the local businesses impacted by the mudslide. Burns will be meeting with U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta tomorrow and will address emergency highway funding options. 
   "I can't think of a better use of emergency funding," said Burns. "That road is vital not only to both Red Lodge and Cooke City but to the region as a whole. A delay in its opening could have a devastating effect on the local economies, and we might need some help keeping tourism going through the summer. Secretary Gutierrez said he would look into it right away. Tomorrow I will make sure Secretary Mineta is clear on the importance of reopening the pass, and see what options we have for getting some federal help to speed the process along." 
   Burns is a senior member of both the Senate Commerce Committee, which handles transportation, economic assistance, and tourism issues, and the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the Department of Transportation and Department of Commerce. The meeting with Secretary Mineta will be held in Burns' Washington office tomorrow afternoon.
