SEN. BURNS HELPS GET FUNDING FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS
  Sen. Conrad Burns participated in a press conference today in support of the Special Olympics Sports and Empowerment Act of 2004.  
 Burns is an original cosponsor of bipartisan legislation which would allow more children and adults with disabilities to participate in the Special Olympics by creating a $75 million dollar authorization over five-years for the Special Olympics, with $15 million authorized for fiscal year 2005. 
   "During 2003 alone, over two-thousand Special Olympics athletes participated in activities in Montana, choosing from as many as fourteen Olympic-style sports. It is important to me that Montanans with developmental and intellectual disabilities have access to recreational opportunities that will not only improve their health and well-being, but also promote mental and emotional strength, and that's exactly what this extraordinary organization allows. I am happy to be a cosponsor of this bill which will help expand the scope of the Special Olympics by offering more children and adults with disabilities the opportunity to join in the life-changing events of the Special Olympics program." 
   Special Olympics was founded in Chicago in 1968, where more than 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada participated in the First International Special Olympics Summer Games. Currently, more than 1.5 million children and adults from more than 150 countries around the world are directly benefiting from this life-changing idea.
