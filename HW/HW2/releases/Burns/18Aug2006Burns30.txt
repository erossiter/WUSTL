SEN. BURNS: MONTANA'S ECONOMY HAS CREATED 5,500 NEW JOBS SINCE JUNE
  Sen. Conrad Burns today announced today the release of new employment numbers from the White House that show Montana's economy keeps growing and creating new jobs. Since June 1st Montana's economy has created 5,500 new jobs. 
  On top of the 5,500 new jobs created since June, Montana is enjoying historically low unemployment rates. Throughout the 1980's Montana's average unemployment rate was 7.3 percent. In the 1990's that average dropped to 5.7 percent. Currently, Montana is enjoying one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at just 3.8 percent. 
  Senator Burns said, "This is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of Montanans whose hard work and spirit have helped make our economy one of the fastest growing in the nation. In my 18 years in the Senate I've worked hard to ensure our economy kept growing, and there was a good job available for everyone who wanted one. While we're not there yet, we're getting closer than we've ever been. I will continue to fight for the policies that will keep our economy growing, keep creating jobs, and increase opportunities for every Montanan."
