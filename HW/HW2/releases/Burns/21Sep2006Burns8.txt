SEN. BURNS SECURES $200 MILLION FOR WILDFIRES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced he successfully protected $200 million in federal funding for fire fighting, supplementing existing accounts so the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service will not have to borrow from other critical, non-fire accounts. 
  Originally, an amendment offered by Senator Burns and Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) passed on the floor of the Senate during consideration of the Senate Defense Appropriations bill for funding at the $275 million level. That amendment was not included in the House version.
  The Conference agreement provides for $100 million for the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and $100 million for the Forest Service. Since the time the amendment passed September 7, the Forest Service determined their need was less than the original $175 million. The amount included in the conference agreement matches the Forest Service need.
  The bill now moves to the House for final passage of the Conference report, then to the Senate, and would then require the President's signature for enactment.
  "This has been the worst fire season on record, in terms of the number of acres burned," said Senator Burns. "In Montana, we had one of the largest fires in the country for several weeks of the fire season. I think it's critical that we fully support the needs of our firefighters as they battle these devastating wildfires."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which authors the Defense Appropriations bill, and was an original cosponsor of the amendment.
