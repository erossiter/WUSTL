SEN. BURNS VOWS TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR LIBBY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) released the following statement following tonight's vote to temporarily setback the asbestos reform bill:  
   "I went to the Senate floor today to fight for the good people of Libby, and called attention to their pain and suffering. I am disappointed this bill is not going forward tonight. We were within one vote of proceeding, and Chairman Specter is hopeful we will be able to reconsider. We will continue to make efforts on this bill and my goal is for another vote to occur. I spoke with Senator Baucus on the floor tonight during the vote, and we're unified in our continued fight for Libby."
