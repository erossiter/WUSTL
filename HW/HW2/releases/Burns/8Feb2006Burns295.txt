SEN. BURNS PLEDGES TO PROTECT CONSUMER PHONE RECORDS PRIVACY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) held a hearing today on the growing problem of internet companies selling private cell phone records to anyone willing to pay their fee. Sen. Burns shares the concerns all Americans have about the sale of personal, private property without the "knowledge or consent" of the consumer.  
   Last month Senator Burns introduced Senate Bill 2178, the Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 that would criminalize this activity, therefore putting an end to this legal invasion of privacy. The act would impose significant penalties on those convicted of illegally selling the private phone records of any American without their consent. For each occurrence, anyone convicted would face fines of up to $250,000 and/or up to 5 years in prison. 
   Senator Burns said, "When I first heard that someone could buy the cell phone records of any American for about $100 on the internet I couldn't believe it. Then I looked into it and discovered it was true. As it often does, technology had outpaced the law and there was a shady element of our society right there to exploit that fact. I've proposed a bill that will put an end to that by bringing our telecom laws into the 21st century. It will make this harvesting of private information illegal, and impose jail time and serious fines on those who sell this private information." 
   Senator Burns continued, "We here in the Senate are moving quickly to plug this loophole in the law some people are jumping through to invade everyone's privacy for profit. Once we do I'm sure we'll catch a few rats in our net, and when we catch them they'll pay a hefty price. Your cell phone records are your own private property, not something to be bought and sold without your knowledge or consent."
