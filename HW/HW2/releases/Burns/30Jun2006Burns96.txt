SEN. BURNS SECURES MAJOR ENERGY, WATER PROJECTS FOR MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced a large number of important Montana projects are funded through the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday. Senator Burns is a member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "These projects are important for clean drinking water and reliable irrigation for our producers across Montana," said Senator Burns. "Today we are announcing that these projects have passed the first hurdle, and now we must do what we can to see them through." 
  The critically important Montana projects, which are expected to be funded, are:
  * St. Mary Rehabilitation / Milk River Project (St. Mary, Great Falls, Havre) - This grant is expected to complete the feasibility and environmental studies and address environmental/regulatory permitting issues. Project rehabilitation is crucial to irrigated agriculture along the Hi-Line because the current infrastructure is failing. Rehabilitation will impact over 110,000 acres of irrigated agriculture on approximately 660 farms and provides municipal water to approximately 14,000 people. ($5,000,000)
   * Fort Peck / Dry Prairie Rural Water Systems (Hi-Line) - Continuation of the construction of a water treatment plant and water pipelines on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and construction of branch lines in the Dry Prairie Project. High concentrations of sulfates, nitrates, iron, manganese, and total dissolved solids exceed EPA safe drinking water guidelines. The project will provide clean water to 30,000 residents of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and the surrounding Northeastern Montana communities. ($10,000,000)
   * High Temperature Electrochemistry Center (Bozeman) - Research and education programs in fuel cell related science and engineering. Addresses issues with widespread market penetration for fuel cells. The increased use of fuel cells will provide for economic growth in rural Montana. ($4,000,000)
  * Centers for Zero Emissions Research and Technology (Bozeman) - Will promote development and validation of zero emission technologies for energy production from fossil fuels. This research benefits coal and power producing states like Montana. ($6,000,000)
   * Rocky Boy's / North Central Montana Regional Water System (Great Falls, Havre) - Begin construction on the raw water intake and pump portion of project. Area is plagued with water quality and supply issues. Project will provide clean water to residents of the Rocky Boy Reservation and surrounding North Central Montana communities. This project impacts 30,000 Montanans. ($6,000,000)
   * Yellowstone River Cumulative Effects Study (Statewide) - Study will determine the hydrologic, biological, and socioeconomic cumulative impacts on the Yellowstone River. The development of effective resource management practices will benefit the river and the users. One product of the study will be flood plain mapping that can predict where money is most effectively spent on river bank control, and can prevent loss of property and life through proper planning.
   * Montana Tech - Load Control System Reliability (Butte) - Research to provide better reliability and efficiency of the nation's electric power grids. An efficient, reliable electric-power grid is critical to Montana's energy future. ($1,000,000)
   * National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition: E-85 Fueling Infrastructure in Montana (Statewide) - Increases availability of fueling infrastructure for E-85 to meet the needs of existing and planned Flexible Fuel Vehicles. At least 50 new E-85 fueling sites will be established in Montana. This will create new markets for Montana's farmers and ethanol producers. ($250,000)
   * Western Environmental Technology Office (Butte) - Provide support to the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup, site transfer, and legacy management problems. This will sustain between 90-100 jobs in Montana. ($5,000,000)
   * Engine Turbocharger Research (Heron) - Evaluate and develop an electrically assisted turbocharger for a 4 to 5 liter diesel engine for SUV's. With this technology, SUV's will achieve greater fuel economy and reduced emissions. Honeywell subcontracts turbocharger components to IDA Inc., a machining and tool-making company with 30 employees in Heron, MT. ($1,000,000)
   * Contribution of the Petroleum Industry to the Montana Economy (Billings) - This will provide an estimate, with a high degree of accuracy, the contribution of the petroleum industry to the state of Montana. ($150,000)
   * Billings Clinic Cancer Research Institute (Billings) - This will equip the Cancer Research Institute with the best possible resources to provide Montanans with the best care as well as the opportunity to participate in novel therapeutic studies. ($1,300,000)
   * Hardin Generating Station Coal-Fired Power Plant Mercury Emission Control Demonstration Project (Billings) - The Hardin Generating Station will be used as a test facility for a variety of mercury controls during a three-year demonstration period as soon as the plant begins commercial operations in the first quarter of 2006 to determine what technology or combination of technologies will provide the greatest mercury emission reductions at the lowest cost. ($1,000,000)
  Senator Burns expects he will be able to secure a project requested by U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.), as Senator Baucus does not sit on this committee. The program, requested by Senator Baucus and supported by Senator Burns is:
  * Rural Montana Water Program (towns listed) - Towns able to compete for the $4.2 million for Rural Montana include: Crow Tribe, Cabinet Heights, Helena, Ranch Water District, Big Fork, Froid, Medicine Lake, County Water District of Billings Heights, Power, Seeley Lake, and Greater Woods Bay
  Once passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is expected this week, the bill will advance to the full Senate for consideration. Once passed it would then go to a joint House-Senate conference committee to resolve differences in the two versions, the reconciled versions then going back to the respective chambers for final passage, then on to the President for his signature.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
