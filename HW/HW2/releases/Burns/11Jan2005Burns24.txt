SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON TODAY'S MAD COW DISEASE DISCOVERY
  "Today's discovery is a real signal that we need to pull the new rule that is set to open the border to Canadian beef in March," said Burns.  
 "Until we move forward with the pending hearings in the Ag Committee, and until we do some more investigation into this situation, I do not feel that going ahead with this rule is a smart move. As I expressed last week, the flaws in this rule could harm not only our Montana producers, but also consumer confidence and our international markets. This is a huge issue, and we cannot afford to move hastily when moving forward may have an incredibly negative impact on our country."
