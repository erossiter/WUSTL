SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
 As we come together to recognize and thank the defenders of our freedom on this Veterans Day 2004, we should take time to reflect. Through their sacrifice, our Nation's veterans have defended the rights granted us in our constitution for over two centuries. I want to take this time to personally offer my gratitude for all of those who have worn the uniform over these many years and do so today.  
   Let's talk about sacrifice. The men and women who have served, and are serving in our armed forces do so out of a sense of duty, a love of country and of freedom. It's a life of hard training, terrible hours, and time away from loved ones combined with an often great risk of life and limb. From the beginnings of the Continental Army, to today's men and women both overseas and at home, our veterans have placed their life on the line so we could raise our families the way we want to, educate, pray, and work as we choose, even print and read what we choose in this very paper. 
   Not only as a Senator, but as a fellow veteran, I have a responsibility to ensure the sacrifices they have made are never forgotten, and that a grateful nation continues to be there for them in their time of need. We must continue to provide quality medical care and education opportunities, and we must remember that without our veterans, we wouldn't be here today. 
   On this Veterans Day, I ask each of you to take a moment and think about what your life would be like without the service of these fine Americans. We must honor and remember both the lives saved, and the lives cut short. For as long as I draw a breath, this Marine will continue to fight for the rights and recognition of the men and women who have served our great nation. Our veterans were there for us, we should do no less for them. 
   God Bless, and Semper Fi, 
   Conrad Burns.
