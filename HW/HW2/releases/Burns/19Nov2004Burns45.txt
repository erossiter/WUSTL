SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON FCC 'A LA CARTE' PRICING STUDY
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today commented on a study released by the FCC regarding governmentally mandated per-channel pricing for both cable and satellite television viewers. 
   "The report issued by the FCC today confirms the information we've received in Senate Commerce Committee testimonies as well as in independent studies performed by the private sector. An a la carte system where viewers are charged for individual cable or satellite channels of their choosing sounds like a good idea, but if imposed, would only result in limiting choices and driving up costs for all consumers. The United States has the most robust and diversified programming anywhere in the world and there's a good reason for that - our government does not mandate programming choice. It's a bad idea and would be harmful to the American consumer."
