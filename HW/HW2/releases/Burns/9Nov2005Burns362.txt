SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced funding for Montana from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards program.  
 In this round of funding, the Rae Fire Service Area in Bozeman will receive $90,820 and Lockwood Rural Fire District #8 in Billings will receive $184,086, both for firefighting operations and safety programs. 
   "Our firefighters are some of Montana's finest first responders," said Burns. "They are on the ground day in and day out battling these blazes, and they deserve the best training and equipment available to get their job done. These folks put their safety on the line for the safety of others, and I am glad to see this money headed to Billings and Bozeman today."
