SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES BILL TO PROTECT PHONE RECORD PRIVACY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the introduction of Senate Bill 2178, the Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006.  
 The bill will address recent, disturbing news reports of on-line companies selling an individual's private cell phone records without the person's consent. Consumer Telephone Records Protection will protect consumers' cell phone records from companies and individuals who seek to invade their privacy by accessing those records for profit or any reason. 
   Senator Burns said, "In the information age, unseemly characters are constantly seeking ways to navigate the gray areas of our laws in the hope of finding anything they can use to their advantage. This bill will shine a bright light on this particular gray area, wiping it out, and protect Americans from individuals with less than honorable intentions. I am proud to be an original sponsor of this important, bipartisan legislation." 
   This bill will impose significant penalties on anyone convicted of violating the privacy of others by accessing their private phone records. For each occurrence, anyone convicted would face fines of up to $250,000 and/or up to 5 years in prison. These penalties can be doubled in aggravated cases. "We aren't playing around on this. If you access someone's private records without their permission, you're going to pay a hefty price in both money and jail time," Senator Burns said. 
   The bill is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators. In addition to Senator Burns, other original sponsors are Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).
