SEN. BURNS WELCOMES END TO JAPANESE BEEF EMBARGO
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement Thursday, following an announcement by the Japanese government that they will end their embargo on U.S. beef for cattle 20 months and younger: 
   "We have got some good news today for the cattle industry. Japan is finally re-opening its market to U.S. beef for cattle 20 months of age and younger. This announcement is long past due, but we welcome it. 
   "Japan's beef embargo has cost producers billions, and I am glad to see that we are making some progress in restoring our markets. I am disappointed that shipments are being limited to 20 months and under, because I don't think science supports that decision.
   "We know we have the safest beef in the world, and we know that Japanese consumers want that beef. I will keep pushing to see that market expanded - our producers need access to international markets. I am hopeful that our other trade partners will follow suit soon, and that we can continue to normalize our trade relations." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee and former agricultural broadcaster.
