SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE FUNDS FOR MILES CITY, EKALAKA, DARBY, BAKER
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced two fire fighting grants for Montana through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
 The Miles City Fire Department will receive $86,064, the Ekalaka Volunteer Fire Department will receive $92,103, the West Fork Volunteer Fire District will receive $18,539, and the Baker Volunteer Fire District will receive $71,250, all for Firefighter Operations and Safety. 
   "This funding will give our local firefighters a big boost, and I think everyone in Montana will agree that they deserve it after all the work they did this summer," Burns said. "These grants will allow communities to improve their fire stations, buy new fire trucks, or even hire additional personnel. This is a great big 'thank you' to the men and women who protected our homes, but it is also a necessary step toward making us safer from fires in the future." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
