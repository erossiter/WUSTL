SEN. BURNS CO-SPONSORS POSTAL ACCOUNTABILITY ENHANCEMENT ACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that he has cosponsored S.662, the Postal Accountability Enhancement Act of 2005.  
 The Postal Accountability Enhancement Act of 2005 is the first major overhaul of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) since 1970 and will reform the postal laws of the United States to ensure its success into the 21st century. 
   Burns said, "As different ways of communicating continue to develop, the Postal Service faces a growing struggle to preserve its status as a universal server in the United States. For many of us in Montana, the Postal Service is the only service provider, and it allows us to stay in contact with the rest of the world. I'm happy to co-sponsor this valuable piece of legislation, and look forward to shepherding it through Congress on its way to becoming law." 
   Senator Burns is sponsoring changes that will: 
   * Give the Postal Regulatory Commission the power to institute emergency price changes due to unexpected circumstances 
   * Preserve delivery to every address in the country 
   * Allow USPS greater flexibility to react more quickly to changes in relation to inflation 
   * Give the USPS Board of Governors the authority to set rates for competitive products 
   * Repeal the Civil Service Retirement Service (CSRS) escrow fund provision and transfer the military retiree pension obligation back to the Department of Treasury
