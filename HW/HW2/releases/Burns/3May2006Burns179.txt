SEN. BURNS CO-SPONSORS TWO BILLS TO BRING ABOUT NEEDED MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORMS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) joined an effort today demanding that needed reforms be enacted to address the growing crisis being inflicted on America's health care providers by trial lawyers. Specifically, he joined Sen. John Ensign (R-NV) in introducing S. 22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006 (MCAP), and Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) in introducing S.23, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. These two bills are intended to bring urgent relief to health care providers who are struggling under the rising costs of medical liability insurance premiums. 
  Medical liability is in dire need of reform throughout the country. According to the American Medical Association: 
  * One in seven obstetricians no longer deliver babies due to rising liability insurance costs.
   * There are currently more than 125,000 lawsuits pending against physicians each day. Statistics show that in 86% of these cases doctors will be found not liable.
   * It costs a doctor on average $90,000 to defend a non-meritorious lawsuit.
   * 30%-50% of high-risk specialists are sued each year. This includes neurosurgeons, trauma surgeons, and orthopedic surgeons.
   * Fear of being sued causes 79% of physicians to order hundreds of unnecessary tests. This practice of "defensive medicine" unnecessarily drives up the cost of care.
  The impact on Montana has been just as detrimental. Over the past decade, medical liability premiums paid by many of Montana's hospitals have increased upwards of 1000%. For instance, the premiums paid by St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings increased from $300K per year to $3 million per year in three years without any unusual occurrences or problems. Meanwhile, the number of practicing obstetricians continues to decline.
  Senator Burns said, "This situation is simply unacceptable! Good, hard working doctors are being driven out of business by the costs of protecting themselves from lawsuits. This is something we in Montana simply cannot afford given the extreme scarcity of physicians, particularly specialists, in many rural areas of the state. This legislation will rescue our doctors, hospitals and other providers from the unfair consequences caused by the thousands of frivolous lawsuits filed each year by obstructionist trial lawyers who have exploited the justice system in order to enrich themselves at the expense of America's health care system. We must enact this legislation now in order to lower costs and ensure access to affordable care." 
  S. 22 is a comprehensive bill that applies to all providers, and S. 23 seeks to address the crisis facing obstetricians. Each is based on the highly successful "stacked cap" system recently enacted in Texas. Under this approach, a health care provider's civil liability for non-economic damages is capped at $250,000, a health care institution's (e.g. hospital, nursing home) civil liability for non-economic damages is capped at $250,000, and where a final judgment is rendered against more than one health care institution, the limit of civil liability for non-economic damages is limited to $250,000 for each institution or $500,000 for all institutions. 
  This approach has proven tremendously beneficial to providers in Texas. Since enactment in that state, the largest liability carrier has dropped its premiums by 22%, competition in the health care liability market is increasing, premiums are stable or down, and access to health care is up. "Clearly this approach is working and is one that we should adopt nationally," said Sen. Burns.
  Additionally, the bills will:
  * Preserve states' rights by keeping medical liability statutes in place and also allowing future state laws to supersede federal limits on damages;
   * Permit punitive damages to be the greater of twice the amount of economic damages awarded or $250,000;
   * Raise the burden of proof for the award of punitive damages;
   * Protect providers who prescribe an FDA approved product for an indicated use; 
   * Establish standards for who may qualify as an expert witness; and 
   * Limit the amount an attorney may collect under a contingent fee arrangement.
