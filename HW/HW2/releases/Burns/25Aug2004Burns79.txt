SEN. BURNS: 'MALMSTROM'S FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT'
  Sen. Conrad Burns today commended the results of the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) study which were announced this week. Burns' staff attended meetings in both Montana and Washington, D.C. to discuss the study results.  
   "Malmstrom Air Force Base (MAFB) has a lot of potential, and is looking very good as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process moves forward" said Burns. "Our runway is in great shape, we have an incredibly supportive community out there, our missiles are the most modern in the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) inventory, and our airspace is unbeatable-I don't see us losing our core mission anytime soon, and I plan to fight to make sure we gain rather than lose as we move forward. I look forward to holding some high-level meetings over the next few months to discuss ideas I have, as well as the positive recommendations that have come out of this study. I look forward to doing what I can to make these recommendations work." 
   "It has become clear that efforts must be made everyday to better protect our homeland and make it safer for all Americans," said Burns. "Our world is a different place since 9/11, and during the three years since that awful day, Montana has been playing an integral role in our national security. Across the state, Montanans have stepped up to the plate to work toward the goal of a safer America, and Malmstrom plays a huge role in that effort. I believe Malmstrom can continue to play a role, across the board, in joint operations and various agency missions." 
   Burns is a senior member of the Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees, and recently brought over $66 million in defense appropriations funding to Montana.
