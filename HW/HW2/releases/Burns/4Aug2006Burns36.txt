SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES WHITE HOUSE FELLOWS PROGRAM OPEN TO MONTANANS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced the details for candidates interested in applying for the White House Fellows program, a non-partisan program created by President Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1964 to offer exceptional young leaders first-hand federal government experience serving as full-time, paid staff for high ranking government officials. 
   Each class of White House Fellows has between 11 and 19 members, typically in their early thirties, who have been competitively selected based on four criteria:
   * A record of remarkable professional achievement early in one's career
   * Evidence of strong leadership skills
   * Demonstrated commitment to public service
   * Knowledge and skills necessary to contribute successfully at the highest levels of government
   Applications for the 2007-2008 class are due by February 1, 2007. For additional information, candidates may call the President's Commission on White House Fellows at (202) 395-4522. Applications may be downloaded by visiting http://www.whitehouse.gov/fellows.
   "I encourage Montanans searching for an outstanding and unique opportunity for experience at the top levels of government to apply for this program," said Senator Burns.
   Former White House Fellows include former Secretary of State Colin Powell, U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R - KS), General Wesley Clark, and Congressman Joe Barton (R - TX).
