MONTANA GETS MORE LOW INCOME HEATING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM DOLLARS
  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced today it was releasing $1 billion in additional federal funding for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP), bringing the total funds for this winter season to $3.1 billion. Montana will receive $7,736,793, bringing our state's total LIHEAP funding to $22,789,220. The additional LIHEAP funding comes from an amendment to the Deficit Reduction Act, which Sen. Burns supported. 
  Senator Burns said, "While we need to maintain fiscal discipline, we must also prioritize our spending to where it's needed the most," said Burns. "Helping our low-income folks pay the bills during a period of elevated energy prices is a priority. While we continue to work toward reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources and increasing our domestic production, we also have to help the folks that need the help the most. That's what this funding does."
  President Bush signed the LIHEAP amendment into law on Monday, March 20 and HHS is expected to immediately release the additional funding for the heating assistance program.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds programs like LIHEAP.
