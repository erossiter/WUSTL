SEN. BURNS CONGRATULATES INCOMING CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER HARPER
  U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement this morning following the results of last night's Canadian parliamentary elections:  
   "I congratulate the Conservative Party and incoming Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Our two nations have an important strategic relationship as neighbors and trading partners, and I look forward to strengthening that bond. We have important bilateral discussions ahead on many issues, including agriculture, trade, and security. I understand border security is an important issue in Montana, and was a key issue in the Conservative party's victory last night. I look forward to working with the new leadership on our important bilateral issues - especially strengthening the border."
