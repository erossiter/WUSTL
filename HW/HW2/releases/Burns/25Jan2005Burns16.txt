SENS. BURNS, THUNE CALL FOR MEETING WITH BUSH ON BORDER
  Sens. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and John Thune (R-SD) sent a letter today to President George W. Bush requesting a meeting to discuss the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) final rule that would re-open the Canadian border to beef imports.  
   In the letter, the Senators wrote "We would like to discuss with you our concerns about Canada's feed ban, the decision to allow imports of beef and beef products from cattle of any age, and the potential impact this may have on reopening U.S. export markets in the Pacific Rim. Trade with Canada will need to resume at some point, but USDA's regulations are not the right way to open the border, nor is it the right time to move forward." 
   Burns and Thune requested to meet with the President as soon as possible to express their concerns over the issue. The Senate Agriculture Committee will hold hearings on February 3 regarding the USDA's final rule at the request of Senator Burns.
