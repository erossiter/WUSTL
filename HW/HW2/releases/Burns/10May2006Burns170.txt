Kempthorne was reported out of the Energy Committee today by voice vote. Following the vote, Sen. Burns made the following statement: 
  "I've known Dirk for many years and we have an excellent working relationship and a close personal friendship. I am strongly supporting his nomination for Interior Secretary and I urge the full Senate to take up his nomination very soon. We have important issues to address at the Interior Department and Gov. Kempthorne will be a steadfast leader. I am pleased we agree that the land sale proposal is dead. I look forward to working with him on rehabilitating the St. Mary's diversion facilities, addressing important Bureau of Land Management issues, and improving the quality of life for Montana's Tribal members."
