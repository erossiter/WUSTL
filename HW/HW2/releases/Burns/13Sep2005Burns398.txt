SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES FOR U.S. LUMBER INTERESTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced his support for the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports in its effort to help remedy ongoing timber trade disputes with Canada.  
 The Coalition filed a constitutional challenge to Chapter 19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), relating to dispute settlement. 
   Montanans have felt the negative impacts of ongoing softwood lumber disputes and NAFTA. Layoffs and mill closures around the state have caused concern for Burns, who is working to make sure federal assistance can be provided. 
   Burns, who voted against NAFTA, maintains that the impact of trade agreements on U.S. markets must be known before the adoption of such an extraordinary challenge procedure. U.S. softwood lumber interests have been severely disadvantaged since the passage of NAFTA. "It's always dangerous when the U.S. delegates away its authority," said Burns. "For softwood lumber interests in the United States, the decision has been especially harmful. This ruling did not come from any U.S. entity--instead, we are bound by NAFTA to accept their extra-governmental authority." 
   The dispute resolution procedures established under the NAFTA implemented through Chapter 19 allows an extra-governmental organization to rule on matters of U.S. law without oversight from U.S. courts. This suit comes on the heels of a finding by NAFTA's Extraordinary Challenge Committee almost one month ago, which refused to agree with findings by the U.S. Commerce Department's International Trade Commission that Canadian softwood lumber products were subsidized by the Canadian government, then dumped into U.S. markets, injuring U.S. softwood lumber mills and producers.
