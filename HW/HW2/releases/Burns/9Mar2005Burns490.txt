SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDING FOR BOZEMAN, HAVRE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced funding for two Montana Fire Departments from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
 Rae Fire Service Area in Bozeman will receive $48,600 for Operations and Firefighter Safety, and Havre Fire Dept will receive $9,939 for Fire Prevention. 
   "Firefighting in Montana is a dangerous business," said Burns. "The bravery displayed by these men and women each and every day is a remarkable thing, so I feel it's my job to do all I can to make sure they go out there with the best equipment, the best training, and the best support staff behind them." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
