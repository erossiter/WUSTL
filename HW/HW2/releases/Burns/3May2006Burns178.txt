SEN. BURNS CO-HOSTS E-911 CAUCUS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) hosted a meeting of the Enhanced 911 (E-911) Caucus to discuss the deployment and funding of the next generation of emergency call technology. Today, the 9-1-1 system is a voice centric communications medium. The next generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) will provide a multi-media and multi-application system that could greatly enhance emergency communications. Text, data, images, and video are increasingly common in personal communications and are critical to future transportation safety and mobility advances. Sen. Burns co-founded the E-911 Caucus in 2003 with Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) to elevate issues surrounding E911 services and strengthens our country's ability to better respond and communicate in times of local and national emergencies. 
  E-911 allows emergency phone operators to know the caller's phone number and address of someone calling 911 in an emergency so that help can get to them faster and be more effective. Wireless E911 rules require that 95% of all subscriber handsets must be capable of delivering location information by December 31, 2005, so cell phone users can be found by emergency workers no matter where they are, in a city or in rural areas. 
  Senator Burns said, "Thanks to new cell phone technology and E-911, someone in car wreck won't have to try and figure out where they are to get help. This technology will lead emergency workers to the person in need, which is an amazing advancement in public safety and will continue to save lives."
