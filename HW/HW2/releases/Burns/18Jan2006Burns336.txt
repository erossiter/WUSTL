SEN. BURNS OPPOSES ASBESTOS REFORM BILL IN CURRENT FORM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) notified Sen. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that he would not support the "Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005" unless the bill is changed from its current language, which excludes many Libby residents.  
   In a letter dated December 15, 2005, attorney Roger Sullivan, whose Kalispell firm McGarvey, Heberling, Sullivan and McGarvey represents approximately 800 Libby victims, requested that Senator Burns oppose the bill in its current form because it does not contain the diffusion capacity test (DLCO) commonly associated with many Libby residents exposed to tremolite asbestos. In his letter, Sullivan indicated that the lack of this standard "disqualifies 40% of the Libby victims who would otherwise qualify for immediate compensation." 
   Sen. Burns said, "Many Libby residents have been under the impression that legislation specific to Libby meets their needs, but that simply isn't true." 
   The legislation, as introduced, contained the DLCO standard was subsequently removed during a Judiciary Committee markup of the legislation. Senator Burns said he will not support the legislation in any form unless the DLCO provision is restored. The asbestos bill is expected to be considered by the U.S. Senate in February 2006. Today, Sen. Burns provided language to Sen. Specter's office which would include the DLCO standard and will continue to fight for its inclusion on the Senate floor.
