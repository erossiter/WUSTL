SHOULD WE CHANGE SOCIAL SECURITY? SEN. BURNS, DELEGATION TO HOLD LISTENING SESSIONS ACROSS MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) has approached Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.) about joining him in listening sessions across Montana regarding the future of Social Security.  
   "The President is coming forth with some changes to the system, and I'm looking at it with an open mind," said Burns. "I think there's opportunity to modernize the way we go about Social Security, but I want to ensure Montanans are protected across the board, and the program is solvent well into the future. Max and Denny are just as interested as I am to hear from Montanans, and that's why I invited them to join me in these listening sessions. Dates and locations will be forthcoming, and I hope for participation from both young and old on this as it affects everyone." 
   Senator Baucus is the ranking member of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, and has a strong voice in any restructuring of Social Security, and Congressman Rehberg, as Montana's lone member of the House of Representatives, plays a key role from the Congressional chambers. Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Aging Committee, dealing with seniors issues. 
   Burns continued, "We need to take what we learn from Montanans, and apply that to the legislative agenda forthcoming from the administration. Some will suggest radical changes, and some will say leave it alone. Max, Denny, and I will take those suggestions and work to make this the best possible legislation for Montanans, from seniors, to the baby boomers, to the younger generation." 
   Locations and dates of the listening sessions will be made available as they are scheduled based on availability of the members over the coming weeks.
