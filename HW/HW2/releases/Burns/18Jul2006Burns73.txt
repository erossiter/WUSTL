SEN. BURNS SECURES FUNDING FOR BUTTE AIRPORT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today he included an important project for Butte in an Appropriations bill that will move through Committee this week. The Bert Mooney Airport in Butte was seeking federal funding to install approach lighting. 
   This project is advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations bill.
   The Butte Airport will use the federal funds to secure approach lighting for the airport. This funding is intended to make the airport more competitive in the marketplace and offer improved safety and service. Currently, the Butte Airport is the only commercial service in Montana without approach lighting. The project is expected to provide up to 15 construction jobs in Butte.
   "We wanted to make sure the Butte airport can continue to improve their operation," said Senator Burns. "Approach lighting will help the airport reduce the number of missed flights, improving service for business and personal travel customers coming in and out of Butte."
   "This couldn't be at a better time to get the funding for the approach lighting," said Rick Griffith, Airport Manager, Bert Mooney Airport. "The approach to the airport has been worked on over the last year and this is the icing on the cake for the airport. We really appreciate Senator Burns' efforts, not only for this project, but for getting a fix to the approach for us."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, House and Urban Development or TTHUD, which funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
