SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDING FOR MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that four Montana fire departments will receive funding through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 In this round of grants, the following fire departments will receive a total of $76, 032 for operations and firefighter safety: 
   * Peerless Fire District, $6,158; 
  * Inverness Rural Fire District, $12,315; 
  * Whitehall Volunteer Fire Department, $46,822; 
  * Otter Creek Volunteer Fire Department in Geyser, $10,737 
   "As we head into fire season we are all preparing for another year where Montanans may once again see the front lines of these dangerous blazes," said Burns. "With too many years of drought under our belt, it is especially important we make sure all our fire departments, and the men and women who stand on the front lines, have the tools and abilities to combat these fires safely and effectively. I am glad to see this funding will go towards the effort of keeping all Montanans a little bit safer during this coming fire season." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. 
   Sen. Burns is a senior member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
