SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS LONG AWAITED PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today applauded the long awaited passage of H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005. "Today is the culmination of years of work, and I am proud of our results," said Sen. Burns. "This is a jobs bill plain and simple. Without affordable energy we cannot create good jobs in the fields of agriculture, trade, transportation, energy, and manufacturing-that is absolutely essential for Montana and for America."  
   The following provisions are included in the Energy Bill: 
   * Requirement that 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel be added annually to the nation's supply by 2012. 
   * A hydropower relicensing provision to improve the existing process, and grant states, tribes and environmental groups the ability to participate. 
   * Research and incentives for clean coal technology for electricity production and coal-to-liquids technology to turn coal into transportation fuels. 
   Burns noted that the bill includes provisions to increase production, increase conservation, diversify fuel supply and employ new technologies. "This bill will help us meet the growing needs of today while preparing us for the challenges of tomorrow," said Burns. "It will help us use Montana's vast natural resources, while at the same time encourages greater conservation and efficiency. This bill succeeded because it recognizes that our future depends on a ready supply of affordable energy coming from coal, wind, natural gas, hydrogen fuel cells, and nuclear, to name a few. I am proud to be a member of the committee that wrote and debated this balanced piece of legislation. From day one it was a bipartisan bill, and we debated the issues fairly in the committee and on the Senate floor, then into the conference. We didn't agree on every issue, but we kept working and now we have a bill Montanans can be proud of." 
   Energy savings from the Senate bill also increased significantly as a result of the tax incentives sections for the bill: 
   Electricity Infrastructure: 
   * Extending the Sec. 45 production tax credit for wind, biomass, geothermal, trash combustion and small irrigation hydro through 2007. 
   * Clean Energy Bonds that will provide tax credit bond authority for electric cooperatives, tribes and municipal utilities to finance renewable energy facilities. 
   * A credit for the production of electricity from nuclear facilities. 
   * Tax incentives for clean coal facilities. 
   * 15-year depreciation for electricity transmission lines 
   Domestic Fossil Fuel Security: 
   * Credit for investment in coke manufacturing facilities. 
   * Expensing for refinery capacity investments. 
   * 2-year amortization for oil and gas exploration costs 
   * Reduce depreciation period for natural gas distribution pipelines from 20 years to 15 years. 
   Conservation and Energy Efficiency: 
   * Tax credit up to $2000 for the builder of an energy efficient home. 
   * Tax credit up to $500 for homeowners making significant efficiency improvements to existing homes. 
   * 30% investment tax credits for fuel cell and solar equipment. 
   * Various tax credits for energy efficient appliances. 
   Alternative Vehicles and Alternative Fuels Incentives: 
   * Variable tax credits for purchasers of alternative fuel vehicles. Credit adjusted depending on the fuel economy and incremental cost of the vehicle. 
   * $1000 tax credit for residential alternative fuel refueling stations; $30,000 tax credit for commercial refueling stations. 
   * Extension of the biodiesel credit.
