SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS NSA TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM, DECRIES LEAK
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today re-iterated his support for the NSA Terrorist Surveillance program. Today the President made a speech to the National Security Agency and its employees, which was closed to the press.  
   Following the speech, the President said, "We've seen that part of the terrorists' strategy is to place operatives inside of our country. They blend in with civilian population. They get their orders from overseas, and then they emerge to strike from within. We must be able to quickly detect when someone linked to al Qaeda is communicating with someone inside of America. That's one of the challenges of protecting the American people, and it's one of the lessons of September the 11th." 
   Sen. Burns said, "We are at war. We need to do what it takes to protect America within the law. If a suspected terrorist is making calls to contacts inside the United States our intelligence agencies should be able to monitor those calls. That's just common sense. I look forward to the hearings; I want to find out who leaked this program because they've threatened our national security. We are weaker now that this information has been made public. I support the efforts of our president to combat international terrorism. This program is a strong weapon at our disposal, we should not lay it down." 
   The Attorney General, in a speech yesterday on the NSA program at Georgetown University Law Center, said, "We cannot build walls thick enough, fences high enough, or systems strong enough to keep our enemies out of our open and welcoming country. We cannot forget that the 9/11 hijackers were in our country, living in our communities". 
   Sen. Burns supports the Patriot Act, and urges its reauthorization. Sen. Burns is a Senior Member of the Appropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
