SEN. BURNS BACKS PROGRAM TO AID RANCHERS, PRESERVE ARCTIC GRAYLING
  Sen. Conrad Burns today expressed his strong approval of a program initiated by the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) that will offer assistance to ranchers along the Big Hole River and help to preserve the habitat of an Endangered Species candidate, the arctic grayling. In all, the NRCS has set aside $1 Million for the endeavor.  
   The Upper Big Hole is the last native habitat for the arctic grayling in the continental United States. This program will offer technical and financial assistance to producers in critical areas within the watershed who agree to shorten their irrigation season this summer and keep the river running at no less than 20 cubic feet per second, the least amount of water required for the survival of the species. 
   The NRCS will accept applications for funding from June 7 through June 16, 2004 for implementation of the following conservation practices by landowners along the Big Hole River. 
   * Irrigation Water Management 
   - $60 per acre to not irrigate hayland and/or pastureland after June 21, 2004 
  - $50 per acre to not irrigate hayland and/or pastureland after June 28, 2004 
  - $40 per acre to not irrigate pastureland after July 5, 2004 
   * $2.50 per foot of riparian fencing 
   * $5,000 for each off-site watering facility that provides an alternative water source to the Big Hole River (including pump, pipeline and tank) 
   "The program the NRCS has put into play here is a win-win situation for Montana," said Burns. "It will help to maintain our local ranchers economic viability while ensuring the survival of the arctic grayling, and after six long years of drought, that's not an easy task to accomplish." 
   Interested producers can sign-up for this offer in Wisdom at the Sandman Motel on Old Highway 278 or at the Dillon NRCS field office at 420 Barrett Street. For more information, contact Kris Berg, the NRCS district conservationist in Dillon, at (406) 683-3803, or go to the NRCS website at http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/. 
   Burns contributed to this effort initially in 2002 by working to procure $500,000 for the Big Hole Watershed Committee's (BHWC) effort to study and implement long-term management options on the river. Consisting of local ranchers, representatives of Trout Unlimited and various federal land management agencies, the BHWC was established in 1995 to develop a coordinated effort to address the resource issues of the Big Hole River.
