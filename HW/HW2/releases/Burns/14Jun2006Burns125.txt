SEN. BURNS PLEASED CFAC, BPA SIGN CONTRACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today expressed satisfaction that a contract has been signed between the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC), Flathead Electric Cooperative and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). 
  "This is positive news for Flathead Valley energy consumers and for CFAC's good employees," said Senator Burns. "CFAC has purchased power from BPA for over 30 years and I am pleased that will continue for at least five more years. Now the employees and consumers can rest easier knowing this deal is done and service will be uninterrupted.
  "We at CFAC are extremely pleased to reach this successful conclusion to this long and arduous process," said Haley Beaudry, Manager of External Affairs at CFAC. "The contract is now signed by all parties. All of the employees and their families at CFAC are breathing a sign of relief. We are all very grateful to the Montana delegation for its unwavering support and each individual member's persistent efforts on our behalf. This contract negotiation was complicated because after 50 years of selling physical power to CFAC, BPA chose to switch to a financial benefits arrangement. BPA received a lot of pressure over the two year period from Washington and Oregon public power interests to omit the aluminum plants from its portfolio completely. Our Senators and Congressman brought their considerable strengths and seniority to the table to aid this important Montana company. Thanks to Senator Burns, Baucus, and Congressman Rehberg, these family-wage jobs will remain in Montana."
  Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees the BPA.
