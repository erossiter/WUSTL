SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today reiterated his support for Judge Samuel Alito, the president's nominee for the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  
   Senator Burns said, "Judge Alito has performed very well during his confirmation hearings, and I am even more certain of my support for his nomination and that he shares Montana values. He is a strict constructionist and deeply reveres the Constitution, and the Supreme Court will be well served by his membership. During his long and sometimes contentious confirmation hearing, Judge Alito has demonstrated not only the temperament required of an impartial jurist, but the knowledge of and respect for the Constitution necessary to sit on the highest court in the land. I have no doubt Judge Alito will adhere to the Constitution in his rulings and not impose his personal views on law, as too many judges do today. That, in my opinion, is what is constitutionally required of a Supreme Court Justice and is consistent with Montana values. I will proudly and whole-heartedly vote to confirm Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court." 
   Judge Alito was nominated to the Supreme Court by the president on October 31, 2005. He has served for 15 years on the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and has previously served as a United State attorney in New Jersey, as well as Assistant Solicitor General, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General. 
   Alito has a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Yale University. He has been unanimously rated "well qualified" by the American Bar Association. 
   Senator Burns met with Judge Alito in his Washington office November 16, 2005.
