SEN. BURNS SAYS MONTANA 'OPEN FOR BUSINESS'
  Sen. Conrad Burns met with Mark Miller, the Vice President of Engineering of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation to discuss their Low Cost Domestic Sourcing Initiative.  
 Sikorsky, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, is a world leader in the design and manufacture of advanced helicopters for commercial, industrial and military uses, and they're looking to expand their presence throughout the country. 
   "I was very happy to have this meeting today and inform Sikorsky that Montana is open for business," said Burns. "Montana plays an important role in the defense of our nation-regarding both research and development, and for that reason I think Montana is a perfect fit for Sikorsky as it moves to expand their operations. They would bring an increase in jobs, and with the work that they do, our talented engineers at MSU-Bozeman and Montana Tech in Butte would offer a pool of qualified candidates to add to the mix. I look forward to continued discussions as this process moves forward, as I believe Montana is a perfect spot for this company." 
   Montana is currently one of 10 states being considered as Sikorsky looks to expand, and Sikorsky officials will visit Montana from August 2-4. Burns will continue discussions with these officials as this process moves forward.
