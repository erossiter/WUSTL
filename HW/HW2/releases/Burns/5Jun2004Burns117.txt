REP. BURNS COMMENTS ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Burns Comments on Death of President Ronald Reagan
   "He's one of the greatest men in our nation's history," said Burns. "He was the eternal optimist, and was a man of sunrises, not sunsets. His leadership brought and held our nation together during some very difficult times, and it was his inspiration that brought many of us, including myself, into public service. Through his steadfast determination as Commander-in-Chief, he led us to victory in the cold war and helped us survive and overcome great obstacles of the late 20th Century. He will be missed."
