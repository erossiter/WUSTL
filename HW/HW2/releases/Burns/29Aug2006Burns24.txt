SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MONTANA FOOD BANK RECEIVES USDA FUNDING
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will award the Montana Food Bank Network, based in Missoula, $69,000 for food stamp outreach. The Montana Food Bank is one of 15 faith and community-based facilities receiving a total of $1.05 million in fiscal year 2006 awards to "improve access to and awareness of USDA's Food Stamp Program." 
  "This federal funding for the Montana Food Bank is welcome after all the work we have done together to expand the facility in Missoula," said Senator Burns.
  Since 2004 Senator Burns has secured almost $1 million in federal assistance for the Food Bank, used for expansion and to improve operations.
  Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said, "Ensuring that all eligible low-income Americans have access to nutrition assistance provided by the Food Stamp Program remains a top priority for us."
  According to their website, the Montana Food Bank Network was founded in 1983 as a private, nonprofit organization to "solicit, glean, sort, repackage, warehouse, and transport donated food and distribute it to charitable programs that directly serve needy families, children, and seniors." The Montana Food Bank Network has its main warehouse in Missoula, a branch warehouse in Miles City, and a cannery located at Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge, and is able to distribute food through all 56 counties in Montana.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds USDA.
