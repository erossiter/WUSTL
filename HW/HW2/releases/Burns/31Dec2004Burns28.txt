SEN. BURNS SPEAKS WITH SECRETARY VENEMAN REGARDING OPENING BORDER
  Sen. Burns spoke to Secretary Ann Veneman yesterday to share his concerns regarding the recent announcement that Canadian beef exports to the U.S. will resume in the spring. Sen.  
 Burns focused on the USDA's decision to allow imports of beef products from cattle of any age, as well as the potential impact on U.S. export markets. 
   "I am deeply troubled by the removal of the 30-month limitation for beef products, and I do not believe that USDA should move forward will a rule that allows these products into the U.S.," Burns said. "In addition, U.S. cattle producers must have export markets available to them if we are going to increase imports. I don't want to see this rule harm the talks underway right now with Japan and Korea." 
   USDA announced on Dec. 29 that it will publish a final rule on January 4, 2005, designating Canada as a "minimal-risk region," which will allow Canada to expand its beef exports to the U.S. Under the rule, which takes effect on March 7, 2005, live cattle under 30 months of age, beef, and certain beef products will be allowed into the U.S. Three Montana cities: Sweetgrass, Opheim, and Raymond, are among the 20 designated ports of entry for the exports. 
   "Montana's ranchers are troubled by this rule, and rightly so," said Burns. "There are some serious concerns that need to be addressed, and I urged the Secretary to take these issues to heart."
