SEN. BURNS CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE END TO JAPANESE DELAYS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement upon the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) final report on the trade violation in January that triggered a halt to Japan importing beef from the U.S.: 
   "This report proves this incident never posed a food safety threat to anyone, anywhere. American beef products are the safest in the world, and the USDA has taken comprehensive steps to ensure it remains that way. I am concerned that Japan is now using this incident for political purposes. Japan must re-open the market immediately, or Congress will have no choice but to take action. I will not stand by while Montana ranchers are hurt by unnecessary delays and scare tactics in Japan."
