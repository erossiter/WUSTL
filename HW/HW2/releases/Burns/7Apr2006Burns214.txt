SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF AVIATION CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) joined by Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today introduced a bill that would extend a consumer protection provision for airline passengers that was first passed in 2001, set to expire in November of this year. Sen. Burns wished to extend the program that was put into place following the attacks of September 11, 2001.  
  This act is designed to make sure airline passengers have a reasonably affordable alternative for travel in the unfortunate case an airline discontinues service because of a bankruptcy liquidation.
  The airline industry has experienced tumultuous and uncertain times since 9/11, however those consumers with tickets purchased prior to a possible airline liquidation deserve an alternate carriage option and reasonably priced ticket option. The bill entitles ticket holders to a stand-by space available seat on an alternative airline with the same route as long as arrangements are made within 60 days.
  Under current regulatory directives the maximum amount that an assisting airline can charge for this service is $50 each way. 
  Senator Burns said today, "It's only right, if an airline declares bankruptcies between the time you buy your tickets and the day of your flight, another airline honor that ticket on a stand-by basis. In Montana, like everywhere else in the country, we can't have our people stranded or forced to pay exorbitant, last minute airfares to get home if they are on a trip or family vacation and the airline they are flying on goes bankrupt and ceases flight operations. This will protect the Montana flying public and the extension is merited by the current airline environment."
  Senator Burns is a Senior Senator of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation.
