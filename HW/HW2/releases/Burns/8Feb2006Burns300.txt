SEN. BURNS'S MISSOULA FIELD REPRESENTATIVE TO HOLD HOURS IN SUPERIOR
  Montana Sen. Conrad Burns today announced that his Missoula Field Representative, Erin Ballas, will hold community outreach hours in Superior on Tuesday, February 28.  
   Ballas will be available from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm in the Mineral County Library, 301 2nd Ave E. She will be available to meet with anyone who has a problem with a federal agency or questions or concerns regarding issues before Congress. 
   Burns said "Montana's a big state, as you know. I realize it's sometimes inconvenient to make the trip to our Missoula office, so I wanted Erin to visit Mineral County personally to ensure Montanans can address their questions and concerns in person with my office. Please let Erin know if there's anything you think we can be of assistance with, or if you're having difficulty with a federal agency and we will do what we can to help." 
   If you have any questions, please feel free to call Erin Ballas at (406) 728-3003 or (800) 344-1513.
