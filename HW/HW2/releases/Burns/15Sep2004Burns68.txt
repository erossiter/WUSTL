SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR WHITETAIL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that Whitetail Volunteer Fire Department will receive $58,500 in funding from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program to go towards a firefighting vehicle. 
   "Blazing fires can be a challenge to battle out in the field, and it takes not only adequate training, but also up-to-date equipment to get the job done," said Burns. "When our men and women are working to put fires out, they deserve the best gear and training out there, and this funding will go a long way in prepping Whitetail Fire Department for the tough job they face everyday."
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of all current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
