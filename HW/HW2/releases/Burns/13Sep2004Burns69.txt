SEN. BURNS HELPS SECURE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA GRANT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the University of Montana will receive a Department of Education grant of $217,927 for a Preparation of Special Education, Related Services, and Early Intervention Personnel to Serve Infants, Toddlers, and Children with Low-Incidence Disabilities grant.  
 This grant will enhance the Masters Degree in Early Childhood Special Education program at the University of Montana.
   Burns sent a letter of support to the Department of Education to help secure this funding: "This program would specifically enhance individual skills and expand participants' abilities to promote the successful education for children with disabilities in childcare settings at the local community level. There is a critical need for inclusion support and education for Preschool teachers and special education professionals. We need to ensure the advanced training so these professionals can provide successful and effective care and education for all children under their supervision." 
   After learning the grant had been approved, Burns went on to say: "This is just what we need to make sure none of our children slip through the cracks," said Burns. "We all know every child's learning style is different, and children with disabilities have special needs that we must recognize. This type of programming is exactly what we need to make sure our educators are trained to meet the needs of our students."
