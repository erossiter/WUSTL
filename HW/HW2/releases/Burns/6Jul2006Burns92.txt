SEN. BURNS TO ATTEND HATCHERY DEDICATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) will be on hand tomorrow (Thursday, July 6) for the dedication of the Fort Peck Multi-Species Warm Water Fish Hatchery. Sen. Burns has been a leader of this cooperative effort for the past seven years, and will join Federal, State, and Local officials as well as community groups who made this important facility a reality. 
   "It's been a long time coming," said Burns. "From the first exploratory development in 1999, through authorization and hearings, appropriating of federal construction dollars, and the construction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, this will be a proud day as we dedicate the warm water hatchery. There are a lot of folks who put in countless hours to make this happen and they all should be applauded."
   Senator Burns' ongoing involvement began in earnest in 1999 when he secured the initial funding for a feasibility study on the hatchery. He then introduced the authorization language for the project, held a field hearing, and got it included in a water projects bill in 2000. Over the following four fiscal years, Senator Burns, as a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, was able to secure the necessary funding for completion of the project.
   The dedication ceremony on July 6, 2006, is exactly fours year to the day after the groundbreaking for the hatchery, which Senator Burns also attended. The completion of this project is the culmination of years of efforts on the part of numerous groups.
