SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH AGRICULTURE SECRETARY VENEMAN
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today met with Ann Veneman, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Dr.  
 Ron DeHaven, Administrator of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to discuss the beef importation situation in this country. Burns sent a letter to Secretary Veneman last week expressing concerns about recent reports showing importation of Canadian beef to the United States despite the ban on Canadian beef importation that is currently in place. 
   "I was glad to sit down with Secretary Veneman today and discuss some of my concerns about the current beef importation climate in this country," said Burns. We had an extremely candid exchange, and she assured me that the public health of this country has not at any point been put at risk. I understand the integrity of the livestock industry in Montana - our guys work hard to uphold that, and we must work to make sure it is not contaminated by outside entities. This is an extremely important issue and something I have been following closely. I want to assure all Montanans that I will continue to monitor this situation as things progress to make sure the safety and security of this critically important industry is maintained." 
   Burns is a member of the Senate Appropriations' Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies.
