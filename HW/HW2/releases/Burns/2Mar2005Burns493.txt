SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced funding to three Montana Fire Districts from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
   In this round of funding the Gallatin Canyon Consolidated Rural Fire District in Big Sky and the Medicine Lake Rural Fire District will receive $49,140 and $21,825 respectively. This funding will go towards their operations and firefighter safety programs, which include training, equipment, personal protective gear, wellness and fitness, as well as modifications to their fire stations and facilities. 
   Also receiving funds this week is the Floral Park Volunteer Fire Department in Butte. The Floral Park F.D. has been awarded $189,000 to go towards their firefighting vehicles acquisition program, including pumpers, brush trucks, tankers and tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, quints, aerials, foam units and fireboats. 
   "Firefighting in Montana is a dangerous business," said Burns. "The bravery displayed by these men and women each and every day is a remarkable thing, so I feel it's my job to do all I can to make sure they go out there with the best equipment, the best training, and the best support staff behind them." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
