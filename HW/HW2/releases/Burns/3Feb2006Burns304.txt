SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON STATE OF MONTANA ECONOMY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement regarding newly released national economic figures numbers and trends in Montana:  
   "The news on the economy and job growth just keeps getting better for Montana and the nation. Today the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the national unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest rate since July 2001, to 4.7 percent. This is great news for all Americans. It shows the strength of the U.S. Economy which our tax cuts have fueled. It also shows the perseverance of the American people to bounce back after terrorist attacks, accounting scandals and natural disasters. 
   "The economic news is even better for Montana. The unemployment rate for Montana is now 3.7 percent, one full point lower than the national average. At the same time wages are increasing. Montana has been experiencing nearly 5 percent annual growth in wages since 2000. 
   "Our economic policies are working and I will continue my work in Washington to ensure we keep our economy rolling and keep Montana working."
