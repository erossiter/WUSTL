SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS CREATION OF MEDICAID COMMISSION
  Sen. Conrad Burns today applauded the creation of a commission designed to identify the reforms necessary to ensure the future of America's Medicaid program.  
 The Commission will serve Health and Human Services Secretary Leavitt by advising ways to modernize Medicaid so that it can provide high-quality health care to its beneficiaries in a financially sustainable manner. 
   Burns said, "The Medicaid program was established to provide our most vulnerable citizens to health care services they may not otherwise have been able to afford. I'm glad to see Secretary Leavitt acting on the issue, and I'd like to offer him my full support in finding ways to ensure this program's security into the future." 
   The Medicaid commission must submit two reports to Secretary Leavitt. The first, due Sept. 1, will outline recommendations for Medicaid to achieve $10 billion in savings during the next five years as well as ways to begin meaningful long-term enhancements that can better serve beneficiaries. The commission, for its first report, also will consider potential performance goals for Medicaid. 
   The second report, due Dec. 31, 2006, will provide recommendations to help ensure the long-term sustainability of Medicaid. The proposals will address key issues such as: 
   * How to expand coverage to more Americans while still being fiscally responsible; 
   * Ways to provide long-term care to those who need it; 
   * A review of eligibility, benefits design, and delivery; and 
   * Improved quality of care, choice and beneficiary satisfaction.
