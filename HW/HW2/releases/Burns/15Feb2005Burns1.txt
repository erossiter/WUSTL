SEN. BURNS 'SERIOUSLY TROUBLED' BY PACE, SCALE OF PROPOSED TELECOMMUNICATIONS MEGA-MERGERS
  I am seriously troubled by the proposed rapid consolidation in the telecommunications marketplace.  
 In the coming days, I will be meeting with the Attorney General and the head of the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, as well as FCC Commissioners, to make sure that proper attention and analysis is given to the potential anticompetitive effects of these massive mergers. I am most concerned with the impact of these proposed mergers on rural consumers. 
   Technological change in the telecommunications marketplace has been overwhelming since the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, largely as a result of the Internet revolution. The digital era has resulted in new services and competitors, particularly in the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and wireless sectors. Much of this change has been positive for consumers and these mergers must be considered in this light. However, many rural areas remain without digital mobile wireless coverage and are short on broadband services. The elimination of these gaps should be considered an important element in evaluating these mergers. 
   Congress has an obligation to give intense scrutiny to these proposed mergers to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected. The twin goals of the 1996 Telecommunications Act were to increase choice in the local and long distance markets and to ensure comparable services at affordable rates to all Americans. I will insist that these goals are not harmed in any way as I examine these proposed mergers.
