SEN. BURNS CONTINUES FIGHTING FOR AMTRAK
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today signed on as a co-sponsor of S. 1516, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005. The Amtrak reauthorization bill centers around three themes: reform and accountability, adequate funding for intercity passenger rail, and passenger rail service improvement. The full Commerce Committee marked up the bill this morning, where Burns was able to include two amendments. Burns' comments regarding Amtrak reauthorization will be made available via satellite feed today.  
   "Earlier this month, the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill included $1.45 billion for Amtrak in fiscal year 2006," said Burns. "I worked aggressively to secure that funding, and I was pleased to see it included in the bill. Today we have continued the fight for Amtrak, and for the Empire Builder. A lot of people in Washington think that long-distance trains are the problem and should be shut down, but I know how much the folks along the Hi-Line rely on the Empire Builder, and I intend to make sure the Amtrak reform bill keeps that train running in Montana." 
   The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act is a six-year reauthorization bill (FY 2006-2011), which provides for Amtrak's capital and operating needs to maintain current operations, upgrade equipment, and return the Northeast Corridor (NEC) to a state of good repair. Over the life of the bill, Amtrak's operating subsidy is reduced by 40 percent through cost cutting, restructuring, and reform while capital funding is increased. The bill creates an intercity passenger rail capital grant program for the States. 
   Burns' first amendment would ensure that the public need served by Amtrak, particularly the long-distance trains, is a part of performance evaluations. In the bill, FRA and Amtrak establish metrics to measure trains against, and a number of minimum criteria that must be addressed are set forth. The Burns amendment would add to these minimums an evaluation of the transportation needs of communities not well-served by other forms of public transportation. 
   "I believe that there is a public good served by Amtrak that isn't fully captured just by looking at the financials," said Burns. "This amendment would ensure that the needs of rural communities are also taken into account." 
   Burns' second amendment addresses the expectations of service should a freight railroad opt to participate in providing passenger rail service. S. 1516 includes a provision that would allow a freight railroad to bid to take over certain routes, and it clearly states that the railroad can not bid for the line and then shut it down. The Burns amendment clarifies that language to ensure that the alternative service would not be less frequent or over a shorter route service it replaces. "My amendment would clarify the language to ensure that, at a minimum, the same route is served and that the trains run at the same frequency," said Burns. "The current service should be considered a floor, from which the routes can grow." 
   The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005 includes the following provisions: 
   * Requires a financial accounting system for Amtrak operations and a five-year financial plan. The system is monitored by the Department of Transportation Inspector General. 
   * Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and Amtrak, to negotiate the restructuring of Amtrak's debt within one year. If a restructuring results in significant savings, the Secretary of the Treasury may assume the restructured debt, with the full faith and credit backing of the Treasury. If no restructuring is possible, Amtrak must pay the debt. Such debt is then solely the responsibility of Amtrak, without any implied federal guarantee. 
   * Requires the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Amtrak, in consultation with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) and the operating freight railroads, to develop metrics and standards for measuring the performance and service quality of intercity train operations. Such metrics and standards shall include cost-recovery, on-time performance, ridership per train-mile, on-board and station services, and the connectivity of routes. The FRA will publish a quarterly report on train performance and service quality. 
   * Provides authorization of tax-credit bonding authority for the states and Amtrak for capital projects to improve intercity passenger rail service. This funding would be in addition to the amount authorized and provides a multi-year, dedicated source of funds for rail capital projects. 
   * Requires Amtrak to develop a capital spending plan to return the NEC to a state of good repair by 2011. A newly established advisory commission made up of representatives of Amtrak, the FRA, and each state in the NEC will develop recommendations for the NEC's operation and future infrastructure needs. Amtrak and the states must develop a uniform cost allocation methodology to assign costs and determine compensation for use of NEC facilities. 
   * Requires FRA to retain a consultant to develop and recommend objective methodologies for route and service decisions. The methodologies shall give consideration to cost recovery and on-time performance of existing routes, connections with other routes, transportation needs of communities not served by other public transportation, and the methodologies used by rail service providers in other countries. Amtrak shall consider adoption of the methodologies recommended by the consultant. 
   * Requires Amtrak to develop, after consulting the States and the FRA, a methodology to assign costs and determine compensation for State-supported services. If Amtrak and the States don't implement the proposal developed by the commission, the STB is authorized to impose restructured compensation rates. 
   * Directs the FRA, in consultation with Amtrak, to develop system-wide performance metrics for all Amtrak services in 2006 to evaluate financial and on-time performance, and customer satisfaction of each train. In 2007, Amtrak is required to establish performance improvement plans for five worst-performing long-distance routes (a third of the 15 intercity passenger trains). As Amtrak develops these plans, it must consider restructuring the route, improving on-board service, changing amenities such as sleeper car service and food service, and changing the frequency of the trains. In 2008, Amtrak must implement the plans. By 2011, Amtrak is required to implement improvement plans for all long-distance routes. 
   * Establishes a competitive bid program allowing freight railroads to bid to operate select long-distance and state-supported routes. 
   * Creates a new State Capital Grant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects. The program makes grants to a State, or a group of States, to pay for the capital costs of facilities and equipment necessary to provide new or improved intercity passenger rail. The federal match is 80 percent. Projects are selected by the Secretary of Transportation based on economic feasibility, expected ridership and other factors. 
   * Includes the Amtrak and passenger rail security and tunnel life/safety provisions from the Rail Security Act of 2004, which passed the Senate last year.
