SEN. BURNS OFFERS ASSISTANCE TO OWENS & HURST
  In the wake of the announcement of the planned shutdown of Owens & Hurst sawmill in Eureka, Sen.  
 Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) expressed his disappointment with the news, and offered his assistance navigating the waters of getting federal assistance for the workers who are facing unemployment. 
   "It's always difficult to find words in a situation like this. Bottom line is, I'm very disappointed to see this turn of events. Jim [Hurst] is a good man, and has run his operation to the best of his ability, and has made a business decision that he feels is the proper one. Now, as always, I will do what I can from the federal end to provide whatever assistance is possible for his employees facing layoffs in May." 
   Burns' office has been in contact with State and Federal agencies today in response to the announcement by Owens & Hurst. He will continue to monitor the situation and stay in contact with both the agencies and the company as they move forward in applying for retraining and re-employment assistance.
