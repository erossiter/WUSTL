HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM SEN. BURNS FAMILY TO YOURS
  As we gather this holiday season, there are many blessings we can count. The important ones at the Burns' table this year are, living in this great land; especially Montana, and the freedoms we enjoy that we did not earn, but inherited. Young Americans are serving in harm's way this season and our thoughts and prayers are with them all. Our prayers go out to those families that have lost love ones, and to those who are coming home, carrying the scars of freedom. Their sacrifices will be forever remembered. 
   God Bless and Happy Holidays. 
   Conrad and Phyllis.
