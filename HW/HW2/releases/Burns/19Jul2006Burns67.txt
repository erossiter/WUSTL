SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES USDA GRANT TO LINCOLN ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that the Lincoln Electric Cooperative has been approved by U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development for a $300,000 grant. This funding will, in turn, be provided to rural utilities program borrowers to establish a revolving loan fund to leverage resources to implement rural local economic development plans. 
   The initial capitalizing zero interest loan will be to the Eureka Public School System for a biomass project to replace an out-dated and insufficient petroleum-based heating system. The project includes a broad partnership with the Eureka Public Schools System providing $620,000, Fuels for Schools offering $400,000, and both the Lincoln Electric Cooperative and the InterBel Telephone Cooperative pitching in $30,000 each.
   "I am pleased to be announcing this news, which will generate an exciting project for the Eureka School System that is needed to improve their heating system," said Senator Burns. "I am constantly working with Rural Development to support directing federal funding to important Montana projects."
   "The funding has two main goals in mind," said Tracy McIntrye, Program Administrator for Eureka Rural Development Partners. "The first is that the Lincoln Electric Cooperative will receive the funds and they will loan it to the small at zero percent interest so they can put in their biomass heating system, which is expected to save them over $5,000,000 over a 30 year period. As the school pays that loan back, the Lincoln Electric Cooperative will have developed a local revolving loan program."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
