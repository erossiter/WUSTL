SEN. BURNS HAILS COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF COMMUNICATIONS REFORM BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) praised passage of S. 2686, the Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act today by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The bill passed by a bi-partisan majority of Members in a vote of 15-7 Wednesday night.
  The communications reform bill, as it is called, represents the most sweeping overhaul of national telecommunications laws in more than a decade, and contains several key provisions Senator Burns introduced and championed which will benefit Montanan's in several significant ways.  
  * THE CALL HOME ACT: This section will remove all federal fees and assessments for international phone calls made from overseas military bases to the United States. The Call Home Act will enable military personnel overseas to maintain close, personal bonds with family members while bravely serving our country while saving them money. The bill has the support of The Military Coalition which represents 36 organizations and 5.5 million members of the military, both past and present, and their families. The Military Coalition members include the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Marine Corps League and the Naval Reserve Association. The American Legion has also sent a letter in support of the bill. 
  * TELEHEALTH: The bill also expands the entities available for federal funding for Telehealth, which is important to rural states like Montana, where the population is spread out over a large area and significant portions of the state are not served by health care professionals. Telehealth lets patients seek health advice, diagnoses, and treatment options from their home without having to travel long distances or otherwise go without important services common to people living in urban and suburban areas. The newly eligible entities in this bill include: non-profit nursing homes, hospice providers, tribal health clinics, school health clinics, and emergency medical services facilities. 
  * PROTECTING CHILDREN: Senator Burns inserted an amendment into the bill protect children from internet pornography. The Amendment requires operators of pornographic websites to have a homepage that contains no pornographic images or material. This will prevent children from stumbling across obscene pictures without restricting access by adults. Many times pornographic websites use web addresses which are very similar to other, non-pornographic websites. When a child, for example, accidentally types in a .com instead of .gov or .org, sexually explicit photos would appear on the screen. This amendment will prevent that from happening. 
  * CABLE COMPETITION: Promotes new entrants into cable television markets, to bring competition for customers, which will lower costs, while maintaining local control over those markets. 
  * UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND: The USF section of the communications reform bill is largely based on the NetUSA bill Senator Burns introduced earlier this year. This part of the bill will ensure USF will be fully funded, which will mean the continuation of benefits for rural Montanans such as lower phone bills. According to a study by the Coalition to Keep America Connected, without the USF some Montanans would see their annual phone bills increase by as much as $300. 
  * MAKES INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM PERMANENT: The sun setting aspect of the moratorium on taxing Internet access was replaced with a permanent ban on taxing access. 
  Senator Burns said, "This communications reform bill will do many great things for Montanans. The technology and communications industry is where the economy of the 21st century is going to be grounded, and this ensures access to that economy for Montanans. Broadband expansion and the USF are the most important tools Montanans have to ensure the continued growth of our economy into the next century and beyond. With any new technology there are dangers, which is why I've added protections for children in this new world. The peddlers of pornography prey on unsuspecting children on the Internet. This bill, along with the Internet SAFETY bill I recently introduced, will go a long way toward protecting children from predators and pornographers."
