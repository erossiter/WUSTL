SEN. BURNS RE-INTRODUCES COOL LEGISLATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) re-introduced legislation today that would move up implementation of mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) by a full year to September 1, 2005.  
 The bill would also broaden the coverage of the law to include processed and pre-packaged meats. 
   "This has been put off, and put off, and we need to get it implemented," said Burns. "I've been a supporter of mandatory COOL for many years, and Montana producers continue to remind me how important it is to get that 'Product of the U.S.' on the label. My bill has bipartisan support, and will help even the playing field for cow/calf producers so consumers know where any meat they're buying is coming from." 
   Burns' legislation is being co-sponsored by Senators Tim Johnson (D-SD), Craig Thomas (R-Wyo), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), John Thune (R-SD), and Byron Dorgan (D-ND).
