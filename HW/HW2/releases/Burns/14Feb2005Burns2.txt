SENS. BURNS, BAUCUS ASK FOR AMTRAK SUPPORT
  In a letter today to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, Sen.  
 Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) was joined by Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and 29 other Senators in calling for sufficient funding in Fiscal Year 2006 to maintain national passenger rail service through Amtrak. 
   In the letter to Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Kent Conrad (D-ND), the members wrote "At a time when Amtrak is setting ridership records and congestion at our airports and on the highways continues to increase, we believe it would be a grave mistake to cut the essential federal funds that keep Amtrak operating. Without such funds or other intervening action, Amtrak would quickly enter bankruptcy and shutdown of all Amtrak services, leaving millions of riders and thousands of communities without access to the essential and convenient transportation that Amtrak provides." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees transportation and interstate commerce issues, including Amtrak. Burns also sits on Senate Appropriations, which funds Amtrak. Senator Baucus is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and a key player in shaping transportation legislation in Congress. 
   Both Burns and Baucus have stated they will fight to ensure adequate funding to maintain the services provided by Amtrak's 'Empire Builder' route that transverses the northern half of Montana along the Hi-line.
