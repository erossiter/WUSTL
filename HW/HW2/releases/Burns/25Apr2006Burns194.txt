SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FOUR AWARDS FROM HUD TOTALING $1.2 MILLION
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced four Economic Development Initiative (EDI) awards from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for institutions and businesses in Montana. As part of fiscal year 2005 awards, Montana State University-Northern, the City of Bozeman, the Montana Technology Enterprise Center (MonTEC) in Missoula, and the Center for Healthy Aging at St. Vincent's in Billings will receive funding to continue their important local initiatives.  
  Here are the organizations, what they received, and what the grants will be used for:
  * Montana State University-Northern in Havre received $198,400 for facilities equipment and technology upgrades
   * The City of Bozeman received $298,600 to continue renovation and restoration of the Story Mansion
   * MonTEC, in Missoula, received $248,000 for economic development initiatives and business incubation
   * The Center for Healthy Aging received $496,000 to complete building construction and procurement of specialized equipment for healthcare needs in Billings
  Senator Burns said, "I will continue supporting the important research and business development work at our Universities and companies across Montana. Cutting-edge research is being done in Montana in part because of the investment we've secured at the federal level and it's driving the strong Montana economy."
  Alex Capdeville, Chancellor of MSU-Northern, said, "We sincerely appreciate the support from Senator Burns in securing this EDI funding. This funding will enable us to purchase high tech equipment that is essential for completing the Applied Technology Center, and this will increase interest in using this center and will also help MSU-N attract additional businesses to the Havre area."
  Dr. Tom McCoy, Vice President for Research at MSU-Bozeman said, "Montana State University is grateful to Senator Burns for his support for the Story Mansion. It is hoped that MSU will be able to work with the city to eventually acquire the Story Mansion to house the MSU Humanities Institute. Having the Humanities Institute housed in the Story Mansion will ensure the Mansions long-term preservation and contribute to the economic vitality of the area. This project would not be possible without the vision of Senator Burns and his strong commitment to economic development across Montana."
  Dave Irion, Director of the St. Vincent Healthcare Foundation, which oversees the construction of the Center for Healthy Aging, said the funding "will connect patients in rural Montana and allow them to use telemedicine applications to monitor their healthcare."
  Senator Burns is on the Senate Appropriations Committee and is serving his third term as a U.S. Senator.
