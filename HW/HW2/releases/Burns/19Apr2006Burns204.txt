SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $178,000 HHS GRANT FOR BOZEMAN CRITICAL ILLNESS AND TRAUMA FOUNDATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), awarded $178,000 to the Critical Illness & Trauma Foundation (CIT), based in Bozeman. CIT is a private, non-profit organization whose mission is improving the lives of suddenly ill and seriously injured patients. CIT researches the prevention of injury and illness and trains rural emergency medical care providers. 
  Senator Burns said, "Bozeman citizens and visitors will receive better day to day care because of this grant. The Critical Illness and Trauma Foundation in Bozeman provides excellent services to Montanans and it will only be better as a result of this federal funding."
  The CIT Foundation formed the Western Emergency Medical Services Network (WEMSN) to address the sustainability of emergency medical services in rural Montana. The WEMSN funding will provide rural and frontier EMS agencies with the purchasing power needed to keep facilities open. It will also make training less costly and address the recruitment and retention for an efficient workforce.
  Sustaining EMS agencies and the individual Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) who staff such services is one of rural Montana's greatest health challenges. In many parts of Montana, EMS systems are staffed by volunteer EMT's, and these systems are supported with little or no federal or state funding. These local EMS systems face many challenges: sustaining costly ambulances, purchasing insurance, accessing quality training, and maintaining an adequate work force.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and a three-term U.S. Senator.
