SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MAJOR HUD AWARDS FOR GREAT FALLS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced two major awards from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Great Falls. Two flagship programs within HUD have announced the following award, totaling more than $1.39 million. 
   Here is where the $1,390,963 is coming from:
  * The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program has notified Senator Burns that they have awarded $980,377 to provide Great Falls communities with resources to address a wide range of unique community development needs, from affordable housing to economic development projects.
   * HOME, a grant program for state and local governments to administer local housing initiatives, has awarded $410,586 to Great Falls to fund activities that build, buy, and rehabilitate affordable housing.
  Senator Burns said, "I will continue supporting affordable housing initiatives in Montana, which are becoming increasingly important due to the rising costs of housing in many areas in Montana. Unfortunately, each year more Montana families find themselves making tough financial choices and HUD's work to alleviate that concern for Montana has not gone unnoticed."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Transportation, Treasury, and Housing Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees funding for housing programs, and is serving his third term as a U.S. Senator.
