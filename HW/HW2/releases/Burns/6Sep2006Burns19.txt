SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL PARK SERVICE DIRECTOR NOMINATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement on Mary Bomar's nomination by the President to be Director of the National Park Service (NPS): 
  "As Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I look forward to working with the new nominee for the Director of the National Park Service, Mary Bomar, upon her confirmation by the Senate. The Nation's parks are enjoyed by millions of Americans every year.
  "I know that Ms. Bomar has worked for the past few years in the Eastern United States. I hope she has the opportunity to visit the many beautiful parks we have in Montana and elsewhere in the West so she may fully understand the many important challenges these parks face in terms of funding critical infrastructure and maintaining the quality of the visitor experience.
  "I will also work with her to make sure she understands the importance of snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park. I will continue fighting to ensure stability and certainty for the health of our small businesses in these local communities, to help them remain financially viable and active in job creation."
