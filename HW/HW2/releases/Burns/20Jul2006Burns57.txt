SEN. BURNS HAILS PASSAGE OF VETERANS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) hailed passage of the Veterans Appropriations bill today in the full Senate Appropriations Committee. The bill represents a $3 billion increase to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services over 2006 funding level, which will equal 3.5% of the total discretionary funding in the budget. 
   This bill rejects proposed fee and co-pay increases for Veterans. In February 2006, Senator Burns led the fight to reject these increases. His amendment to the budget bill added $795 million to the VA budget to reject these fees and also offered an increase of $27 million for funding for medical and prosthetic research.
   The VA Appropriations bill contains critical funding for our veterans returning from Iraq with afflictions such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury.
   In addition Senator Burns co-sponsored an amendment which supports blinded veteran rehabilitation, and supported an amendment which will direct the VA to study contracting medical services for rural veterans. VA healthcare has recently been rated the number 1 healthcare delivery provider in the United States.
   "As a veteran, I am very familiar with the issues our veterans face with the VA," said Senator Burns. "I am pleased with everything that this bill will bring to our Montana vets."
   Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
