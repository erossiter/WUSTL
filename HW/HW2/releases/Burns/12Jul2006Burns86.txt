SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FARM BILL FIELD HEARING IN GREAT FALLS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced Montana producers will have an opportunity to participate directly in creation of the 2007 Farm Bill at a Senate Agriculture Committee Field Hearing to be held August 17 in Great Falls. The hearing is being held at the request of Sen. Burns, and Senate Agriculture Chairman Saxby Chambliss (R - GA) will chair the hearing. 
   "I am glad I've been able to secure this field hearing for Montana," said Senator Burns. "The Farm Bill is critically important for my producers, as federal policy for commodities may change with this next piece of legislation. I want the Senate Agriculture Committee to fully understand where my producers are coming from, and we'll make sure our folks can detail the need for continued agricultural investment. This field hearing is a chance for the Committee to hear directly from Montana producers about how the Farm Bill affects them."
   Committee field hearings are intended to provide an opportunity for testimony on local issues as members of Congress develop federal policies. Over the past year, the Senate Agriculture Committee has hosted field hearings across the country to hear from producers about current agriculture policies as the next Farm Bill is drafted.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
