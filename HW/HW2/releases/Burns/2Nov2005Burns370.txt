SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR FRENCHTOWN RURAL FIRE DISTRICT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) today announced a fire grant of $34,200 for the Frenchtown Rural Fire District, through the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant program. 
   "These funds will be a great thing for the Frenchtown Rural Fire District," said Burns. "These folks are some of Montana's most dedicated and hard working first responders, and this funding will help them to continue to grow and respond to the needs of their department and our rural communities in the Missoula and Mineral County area. I am thrilled to see this money awarded to them today."
   SAFER grants are part of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program, and are meant to support the hiring of full time firefighters as well as the recruitment and retention of volunteer fire fighters. The Frenchtown Rural Fire District's award will help them to provide more support for operations and safety, training, fire fighter health, and vehicle acquisition. The district currently has eight fire stations, with seven full time staff and 65 volunteers.
