SEN. BURNS PUSHES FOR ECONOMIC MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
  Sen. Conrad Burns and twenty other members of the Senate yesterday signed onto a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman, calling for retaliatory economic action against Japan due to the continued impasse over resumption of U.S. beef exports.  
   "I've said before that I'm not a fan of sanctions, but enough is enough," said Burns. "The Japanese government must be made to understand that the American beef industry and government cannot continue to stand idly by while Montana producers are struggling to make ends meet. We produce the best beef in the world, and it's time that Japan gets serious about ending this embargo." 
   On October 4, Japan's Food Safety Commission concluded that risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from U.S. beef and beef products under 20 months of age is "very low." However, Japan gave no indication of when exports might resume. 
   "I welcome this week's announcement out of Japan, but am concerned that these unnecessary delay tactics will continue," said Burns. "This embargo is costing us American jobs, and denying Montana cattle producers access to a valuable export market. If Japan doesn't demonstrate actual commitment to resuming trade, then we will be left with no choice but to pursue economic sanctions. It is unfortunate that we are in this position." 
   Japan closed its borders to U.S. beef exports in 2003, following the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a Canadian-born cow in Washington State. Japan was the largest export market for U.S. beef prior to the embargo, at over $1.7 billion annually. The U.S. cattle industry estimates that it loses $60 million per week due to the border closure.
