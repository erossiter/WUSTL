SEN. BURNS CALLS ON SENATE TO KILL DEATH TAX ONCE AND FOR ALL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT), praising the passage of Tax Reconciliation Bill yesterday, joined twenty-six other members of the U.S. Senate in stressing that there's more to do, and the clock is ticking. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Burns and his colleagues wrote that it was time to repeal the death tax, and that they hoped for a vote before Memorial Day.  
   Although the Death Tax repeal was scheduled for consideration by the Senate in 2005, the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the necessary legislative activity that followed delayed floor action. Senator Burns has always been committed to the elimination of this tax on inherited wealth, which can be as high as 50 percent. "In Montana, this isn't about millionaires living in mansions," said Burns. "It's about Montana's small businesses and farmers passing the fruits of their hard work to their children. It's about families building wealth to make the American Dream a reality. Folks shouldn't have to sell the farm to save the farm." 
   "Eliminating the death tax will be a great step forward in keeping family businesses afloat," said Dave McClure, President of the Montana Farm Bureau. "One of the biggest problems facing our Montana ag producers is that our inheritance is tied up in property value; not operating value -- coming up with extra cash seems nearly impossible. This is probably the case for small businesses across the board. Montana Farm Bureau thanks Senator Burns for supporting this extremely important legislation." 
   The letter was sent to Majority Leader Frist on January 31, 2006. Senator Burns pledged to work with Senate Leadership, the President and Vice President, and organizations supporting repeal.
