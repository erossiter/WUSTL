SEN. BURNS LAUDS PASSAGE OF HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that H.R. 3, the Transportation Equity Act, passed the Senate in a vote of 89-11. This Highway bill includes a $295 billion, six-year surface transportation reauthorization bill for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs.  
   "The Highway Bill is a jobs bill, plain and simple," said Burns. "By authorizing critical funding for highway programs, we keep people working on our nation's infrastructure. We have a lot of territory to cover in my state, and this bill will do a great deal to maintain and improve the overall quality and safety of our highway systems in Montana. This highway bill is a priority for our country, and I am pleased to see its passage today. I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate and the House over the next few weeks to make sure that Montana's needs are met and that we get this bill to the president for his signature." Burns also thanked Senator Baucus for his work in crafting the Transportation Bill as Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee. 
   Included in the bill is a Burns-sponsored amendment authorizing $5 million to provide grants to commercial driver training schools and for financial assistance for entry-level drivers. Burns said, "Over the next ten years, the U.S. needs to increase the number of truck drivers by 539,000 per year to meet our projected economic growth and fill the shoes of drivers that retire. With entry level training courses running as much as $4,000, my amendment will make getting a good job easier by giving folks the resources they need to get trained and get trucking." 
   The Senate version of the Highway bill will now be reconciled with the House version before a final bill is passed by both chambers and sent to the president to be signed into law.
