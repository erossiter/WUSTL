SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMERCE COMMITTEE ON UAE PORT MANAGEMENT HEARING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement following today's full Commerce committee hearing on U.S. port security and the transaction between P&O Ports and DP World:  
   "We must be absolutely vigilant when it comes to foreign involvement with our ports. I know that Montana's businesses and consumers rely on secure ports to bring goods and materials in and out of this country. However, in a post 9/11 world we cannot afford to take any chances. Today's hearing shed light on a complicated industry and the process by which foreign investments such as this one are considered by our government. I am not satisfied with the way this decision was made, without adequate congressional involvement. This process needs to be clarified, and all parties involved--the administration, Congress and industry--need to work together each step of the way. This congressional review is just beginning and there is much more we must learn about how this proposed transaction might affect our national security." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Commerce committee and three-term U.S. Senator.
