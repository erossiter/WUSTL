SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF JOBS BILL
  Sen. Burns (R-Mont.) today announced last night's passage of S. 1637, the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) bill by a vote of 92-5. 
   This bill will cut taxes on U.S. based manufacturing income by 3 tax rate percentage points. It will also phase in an accelerated, 9% tax deduction for manufacturers over the next 5 years. This would be available to all businesses that manufactured in the U.S. regardless of size or type.
   Included in the bill is a provision from Sen. Burns which allows individuals and small businesses to expense the costs associated with broadband Internet access for one year.
   The energy bill's tax credits were also adopted as part of the JOBS bill. This portion of the bill includes tax provisions for: renewable energy, alternative vehicles and fuel incentives, conservation and energy efficiency, clean coal, oil and gas, electric industry restructuring, volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, fuel fraud prevention, and mobile machinery.
   Passage of this bill helps bring the United States back into compliance with the World Trade Organization (WTO). The European Union has been permitted by the WTO to levy targeted tariffs against American exports because of the noncompliant tax regime. "By passing this legislation tonight, we have averted the continually escalating sanctions, and provided real relief and job growth for America's manufacturers," said Burns.
   "Right now our economy is beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said Burns. "These excess tax rates on manufacturers are not doing anything to benefit that, and we must put an end to them to allow for some financial security in this field. Just as its name says, this bill will help create jobs and give a real boost to our economy, and I am glad to see its passage in the Senate."
   Also included in this bill are provisions for:
   * New Homestead Act to attract new residents and businesses to rural areas suffering from high out-migration. Specifically it would offer modern-day incentives to attract individuals back to rural America through three different elements: businesses, individuals, and the formation of capital for those rural small businesses.
   * Rail Infrastructure Tax Credits to provide $500 million over 3 years in federal tax credits (50%) to states to allocate for intercity passenger rail capital projects; and to provide $500 million in federal tax credits (50%) directly to shortline and regional railroads for qualified railroad rehabilitation costs.
   * Livestock Involuntary Conversion to allow taxpayers to replace livestock sold because of drought, flood, or other weather related conditions from two years to four years.
   * Tax Benefits for Reservist Employees to provide a 50% tax credit to employers for wages paid to reservists and National Guard members who have been called to active duty.
   * Tribal Bonds to provide the same rules to tribes issuing tax-exempt bonds to finance facilities on an Indian reservation that apply to tax-exempt bonds for state and local governments through 2005.
   * Broadband Modification to exempt entities from taking expensing deductions against Unrelated Business Income tax (UBIT).
