SEN. BURNS SIGNS DISAPPROVAL RESOLUTION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) joined several of his colleagues in signing a Senate Resolution expressing disapproval of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's plan to reopen the border to beef and beef product imports on March 7.  
   "I've said all along we needed to slow this process down," said Burns. "While I'm pleased we were able to strip the provision that included beef older than 30 months and I thank the Secretary for that, I still think they are rushing into this. I have given the administration every opportunity to listen to the concerns of Montana producers and take a step back, and they haven't budged. With the Senate going into recess, and coming out with only a week before the planned re-opening date, it's time to take this up another level. The USDA research team has only now returned from their investigation, and may not have a complete report until after the March 7 date. We must be responsible enough to look at the data before we make such an important decision such as opening the border to beef imports." 
   The Senate Agriculture Committee held hearings on this very issue at Burns' request on February 3, and Burns has been in regular contact with Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns about his concerns regarding the March 7 date. The disapproval resolution would nullify the implementation of the USDA's rule to open the border. Burns spoke on the floor of the Senate today on this issue. His comments will be made available via satellite.
