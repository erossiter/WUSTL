SEN. BURNS WORKS TO PROTECT MESOTHELIOMA VICTIMS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) introduced legislation today that would shorten the waiting period for social security disability benefits for individuals with mesothelioma.  
 The current waiting period for these victims is five months, and the Burns bill would speed that time up to 30 days. 
   "The numbers of folks who have been hit but this terrible disease continues to grow, and it's wrong to make them wait for their disability payments," said Burns. "They deserve these payments in a timely manner, and I look forward to getting this bill passed to make sure the suffering of these victims is not unnecessarily drawn out." 
   This rare form of cancer is found in the sac lining the chest, the lining of the abdominal cavity or the lining around the heart, and is often a result of exposure to asbestos. In Montana, many people in and around the Libby area were exposed to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite ore, and now suffer from mesothelioma. Burns added: "We are currently trying to revise a bill to compensate victims afflicted with asbestos-related diseases, and it is my hope that the bill I have introduced today will help alleviate some of the burdens faced by mesothelioma victims and their families. I plan to continue working with my colleagues to ensure that any legislation passed in the Senate remains sensitive to the particular needs of those exposed to asbestos and their families as they cope with its terrible effects."
