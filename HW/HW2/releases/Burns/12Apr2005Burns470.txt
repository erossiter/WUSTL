SEN. BURNS PLEASED BY MONTANA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) today announced a $750,000 loan to the Montana Community Development Corporation in Missoula County.  
 The funds are being distributed by the USDA Rural Development Intermediary Relending program and will be invested into business development and job creation across Montana. 
   "The money will go to support of business growth and encourage community development, both of which will mean new jobs for our state," said Burns. "Our local communities know best what we need to spur the economy, so I'm pleased to see this kind of funding work its way to Montana." 
   USDA Rural Development's mission is to deliver programs in a way that will support increasing economic opportunity and improve the quality of life of rural residents. As a venture capital entity, Rural Development has invested over $50 billion since the beginning of the Bush Administration to provide equity and technical assistance to finance and foster growth in homeownership, business development, and critical community and technology infrastructure. As a result, over 800,000 jobs have been created or saved through these investments. Further information on rural programs is available at a local USDA Rural Development office or by visiting USDA's web site at http://www.rurdev.usda.gov.
