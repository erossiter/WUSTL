SEN. BURNS HIGHLIGHTS INVESTMENTS IN MONTANA AGRICULTURE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today detailed progress in securing federal funding for a number of important agricultural projects for Montana, as the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Agriculture will meet tomorrow to consider the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill. Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and sits on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
  "These federal dollars are an investment in our communities, investments which help sustain our agriculture industry, which is so vital to Montana," said Senator Burns. "They provide much of the seed to get important projects off the ground, and keep them going. Federal investment into research not only brings us new procedures and technology to improve, in this case our Agricultural economy, it helps to create and strengthen jobs in our state. I'm proud of these projects, and I hope Senator Baucus will join me in supporting them when they reach the floor of the full Senate, since he doesn't sit on this particular committee." 
  Included in the initial mark for the appropriations bill is the Animal BioScience Facility at Montana State University (MSU), with funding to complete its construction. The facility will focus on cutting-edge education, genomics research and outreach. Research at this facility will help keep Montana's herd at the forefront of the livestock industry. In addition, the Ft. Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory in Miles City, Montana received funding to continue applied genomics research in support of the Animal BioScience Facility. 
  "This is great news for MSU and for agriculture in Montana," said Dr. Tom McCoy, Vice President for Research at MSU. "This new facility will enable us to better train our young people for careers in agriculture and related fields in animal science. It will allow us to pursue research that will help ensure a safe food supply and consumer satisfaction. It will enable us to help stockgrowers, ranchers and others to improve animal health, be more efficient in production, add value to their products and derive a better, more stable income."
  In addition, the bill includes the following important Montana projects:
  * ATTRA [APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FOR RURAL AREAS] (Butte) -This program, originally created by former Senator Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) will continue to provide information, education, and technical assistance to producers on a variety of issues, including renewable fuels, alternative energy, and new crop techniques. 
   * TRI-STATE PREDATOR (Statewide) -Continued funding for predator control in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, split based on predator issues and assists livestock predators in managing predation.
   * JOE SKEEN INSTITUTE FOR RANGELAND MANAGEMENT (Statewide) - The continuation of the Joe Skeen Institute will be used to develop and sustain livestock management technologies that restore, maintain and enhance rangeland ecosystems that benefit Montana producers. 
   * GREATER YELLOWSTONE INTERAGENCY BRUCELLOSIS COMMITTEE (Bozeman) - The Committee works to preserve Montana's brucellosis-free status and eradicate brucellosis through testing of bison and operation of a quarantine facility in Yellowstone National Park
   * MONTANA BEEF NETWORK (Statewide) - The MBN is a producer-driven partnership to help Montana producers market consistent, source- and process-verified feeder cattle and establish an information network to provide beef production feedback. Demand for source-verified beef is increasing, and the MBN is helping Montana cattle producers capture more value for their product and expand international market access. 
   * BARLEY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT/FEED BARLEY FOR RANGELAND CATTLE (Statewide) - This is a continuation of research funding to develop improved malt, feed and food barley varieties that can be grown by Montana producers in dry land areas. Goal of the project is to help producers make malt more often and improve value for the crop. 
   * MONTANA SHEEP INSTITUTE (Statewide) - The Sheep Institute funding helps land owners manage the spread of noxious weeds through grazing.
   * INSTITUTE FOR BIO-BASED PRODUCTS (Bozeman) - This will be an expansion of the Institute's program of research and development of bio-based products and technologies in order to develop additional uses for Montana crops, commercialize new products, and create new companies/jobs based on such products through technology transfer.
   * WHEAT SAWFLY RESEARCH (Bozeman) - Continued research used to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of Montana's wheat production by developing strategies that limit the destructiveness of the sawfly. Sawfly destruction causes millions of dollars of damage to Montana crops.
   * BRUCELLOSIS VACCINE FOR BISON (Bozeman) - Continuation of very encouraging research into a brucellosis vaccine and a focus on improvements such as improved delivery, efficacy in cattle, and reduction in components needed. 
   * VALUE ADDED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FROM AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES (Missoula) - The research from this project delves into value-added projects, especially bio-based chemicals and plastics, seeking new markets and uses for Montana crops, including waste material.
   * LOCAL EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM (Statewide) - The LEP has been a successful program that makes grants to local entities working on watershed and conservation projects. Previous funding was able to leverage $11 for every federal dollar.
   * TRIBAL COLLEGE LIBRARIANS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE (Bozeman) - This support from the National Agricultural Library would be used to strengthen tribal libraries across the state. 
   * NORTHERN PLAINS AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (Sidney) - Funding is included to continue operations at NPARL, which currently focuses on weed control and irrigated cropping systems for agriculture. In addition, continued support for biological weed control research is included. 
   * FORT KEOGH LIVESTOCK AND RANGE RESEARCH LABORATORY (Miles City) - As mentioned above, increased funding for applied genomics research at Ft. Keogh is included, along with base funding that will continue operations at this facility. Both NPARL and Ft. Keogh had been targeted for steep budget cuts. 
  Once passed by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and related agencies, the full Appropriations Committee is expected to approve the bill. Upon that time, it will go to the full Senate for consideration. Once passed it would then go to a joint House-Senate conference committee to resolve differences in the two versions, the reconciled versions then going back to the respective chambers for final passage, then on to the President for his signature.
  "This is a good first step for these important projects, but we realize we have a lot of work to do to ensure this funding comes through for Montana," said Senator Burns.
  Senator Burns is senior member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
