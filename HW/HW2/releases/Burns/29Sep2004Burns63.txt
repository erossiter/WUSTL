SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT GRANTS FOR MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that three fire departments in Montana will receive a total of $225,702 in funding through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 To go towards a new firefighting vehicle, Racetrack Volunteer Fire Department in Butte will receive $156,150 and Ismay Rural Fire Department will receive $27,000. Carter County Rural Fire Department in Ekalaka will receive $42,552 to go towards operations and fire safety. 
   "Blazing fires can be a challenge to battle out in the field, and it takes not only adequate training, but also up-to-date equipment to get the job done," said Burns. "When our men and women are working to put fires out, they deserve the best gear and training out there, and this funding will go a long way in prepping two of our fire departments for the tough jobs they face everyday." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of all current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
