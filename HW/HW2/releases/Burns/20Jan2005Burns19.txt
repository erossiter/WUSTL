SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) voiced his support for Montana Gov.  
 Brian Schweitzer's choice for Adjutant General of the Montana National Guard. In a press conference today, Gov. Schweitzer asked Major General Randall D. Mosley to continue in the position he was promoted to in the latter days of the Martz Administration. General Mosley succeeded former Adjutant General John Prendergast, who retired last fall. 
   "General Mosley is a fine soldier and a great leader," said Burns. "He knows Montana, and has a clear vision for the future of our National Guard. He served well under General Prendergast, and is the perfect man for this position. I thank Governor Schweitzer for his excellent choice, and stand ready to offer my assistance, and that of my staff to help General Mosley continue the path of excellence for our citizen soldiers here in Montana." 
   Burns, a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and a member of the subcommittees of both Defense and Military Construction, has worked closely with the staff of the Montana National Guard to secure funding for new facilities and training for Guard units across the State.
