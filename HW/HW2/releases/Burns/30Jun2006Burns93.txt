SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON LIMITED CHINESE RESUMPTION OF BEEF TRADE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued this statement following the announcement that China will resume beef trade with the United States: 
  "Today's news that China is re-opening their beef market to the United States is welcome news. The Chinese market is still an emerging market for the cattle industry, so there is good potential for growth in this area. The market opening is limited to U.S. boneless beef under 30 months of age. We hope this can be expanded in the near future as our factual and science-based safeguards ensure food safety.
  "China's announcement however underscores my disappointment in Japan continuing its unnecessary beef embargo. Japan has only hinted at the possibility of the embargo ending, but we are still mired in 'process'. Prime Minister Koizumi missed an opportunity this week to demonstrate Japan's commitment to our bilateral relationship during his state visit to the U.S. I won passage of my amendment expressing Senate support for economic sanctions against Japan and I will push hard for passage on the Senate floor in July. The Japanese know, as I do, that our beef is the safest in the world and their unending delay tactics are hurting America. They leave us no choice but to aggressively push for economic sanctions and I will lead that fight."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
