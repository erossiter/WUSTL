SEN. BURNS DELIVERS DEFENSE PROJECTS FOR BUTTE - OVER $49 MILLION FOR MONTANA
  As a member of the House-Senate conference, Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today hailed the Senate passage of the Conference report to H.R. 5631, the fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill. The Conference report passed the House Tuesday 394-22 and now, with Senate passage by a vote of 100-0 today, the bill proceeds to the president for his signature, which is expected this week.
  Included in the Defense Appropriations bill is an amendment Senator Burns kept in the Defense Conference to add $200 million in federal funding for fire fighting, supplementing existing accounts to cover the expected costs of this year's fire season. Specifically, the amendment provides for $100 million for the U.S. Department of the Interior and $100 million for the Forest Service. 
   "This has been the worst fire season on record, in terms of the number of acres burned," said Senator Burns. "In Montana, we had one of the largest fires in the country for several weeks of the fire season. I think it's critical that we fully support the needs of our firefighters as they battle these devastating wildfires."
  The original Defense Appropriations bill passed the Senate on September 7 by a vote of 98-0. The underlying bill includes 22 defense projects for Montana that Senator Burns secured, which received a one-third across-the-board cut in conference to supplement additional funding for military personnel accounts and armored vehicles to better protect our troops.
  "As a member of the House-Senate Conference, we were able to keep these critical Montana projects in the bill and are delivering this funding to Montana to strengthen our security," said Senator Burns.
