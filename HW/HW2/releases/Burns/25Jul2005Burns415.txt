SEN. BURNS LEGISLATION WOULD DESIGNATE LAND IN JEFFERSON COUNTY AS CEMETERY
  During a Public Lands and Resources hearing today, the committee discussed the Montana Cemetery Act of 2005, legislation introduced by Sen.  
 Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) in May. This legislation would convey 10 acres on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest to Jefferson County, Montana for continued use as a cemetery. 
   "This legislation is important to the people of Jefferson County," said Burns. "It's clear the cemetery was in use prior to the designation of the National Forest, and it's only right that families should have the ability to legally inter their family members there. The fact that the Forest Service opposed burials on National Forest lands puts both the families and the Forest Service in an awkward position, and I'd like to get this legislation through Congress to clear up this predicament." 
   The Elkhorn Cemetery has been used as a cemetery since the 1860's. Due to surveying errors and limited information when the National Forest boundaries were surveyed in the early 1900's, the cemetery was included as National Forest lands. The cemetery is still in use by local families who homesteaded and worked the mines in the area.
