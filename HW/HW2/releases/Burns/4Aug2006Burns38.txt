SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES METH TRAFFICKING PREVENTION BILL
  On Thursday, August 3, Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) introduced sweeping legislation to end the flow of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals from coming across the border of the United States. S. 3825, the Methamphetamine Trafficking Prevention Act of 2006, already has six Senate cosponsors and has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   According to the Administration's Synthetic Drug Control Strategy, border seizures of methamphetamine have almost doubled between 2000 and 2004 and as much as 75-85% of methamphetamine used in the United States is made from precursors from the international stream of commerce.
   "Our strong efforts to combat meth domestically have left dealers with trafficking across the border as their best option," said Senator Burns. "This legislation will make it tougher to bring meth or its ingredients across the border by massively improving interdiction, coordination, and investigating the unique meth problem, as well as on Indian Reservations."
   Specifically, the legislation will improve technology to interdict meth at the border, increase coordination of anti-meth activities with other countries, and require a report to Congress on meth efforts on Indian Reservations. Specifically, the bill will:
   * Make an additional $15 million available within the Department of Justice's Meth Hot Spots Program for the "Border Technology Grants" - successful applicants must demonstrate viable technology to detect methamphetamine and its precursors on the border or through aerial surveillance and consideration is also given to technologies that can detect active meth lab sites on or near the border through the use of hyperspectral sensors.
   * $5 million to deploy trace chemical detectors along the U.S. borders - the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) identifies ports of entry in need of trace chemical detectors, for use in detecting primarily narcotics, but also explosive devices.
   * Require the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to discuss methamphetamine with each trading partner in any multilateral or bilateral negotiations and encourages USTR to consider ways to curb illicit use and shipment of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar chemicals.
   * Require the DEA to train foreign law enforcement officers, police, prosecutors, or other law enforcement officers from countries that traffic methamphetamine or its precursors into the United States - these officers are selected by the DEA in order to maximize U.S. education and training efforts.
   * The Department of Justice is also required to issue a report to Congress on problems faced by Indian reservations located at or near U.S. borders with respect to methamphetamine trafficking and abuse.
   Signing on to the legislation as original cosponsors are Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Senators Wayne Allard (R-CO), George Allen (R-VA), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Mike DeWine (R-OH), and Gordon Smith (R-OR).
   According to the legislation, "Successful exchange programs between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and Mexican law enforcement officials have helped aid in meth lab seizures and production in Mexico. The goal of U.S. policy should be directed toward curbing the spread of methamphetamine abuse and manufacture."
   Senator Burns is the founder of the Senate Anti-Meth Caucus.
