SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TWO MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) today announced the allocation of funds to two local Montana fire departments by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 Plentywood City Fire Department will receive $42,075, and Fort Shaw Rural Volunteer Fire Department will receive $25,616. Both fire departments will use the funding for turnout gear, including coats, pants, boots, suspenders and helmets. 
   "This money could not go to a more deserving group of people," said Burns. "With six years of drought and another difficult year ahead, Montana firefighters have stuck their necks out for our safety and they need all the support we can give them. This money will help improve the success of firefighting operations, firefighter safety and health as they combat the blazing wildfire season in and outside of town." 
   The costs of the funded projects are shared at a percentage based on the population of their respective jurisdictions. Grantees that serve jurisdictions of 50,000 or fewer, as in both Plentywood and Fort Shaw, must provide a non-Federal cost-share of 10%. 
   Craig Askeland of Fort Shaw Rural Volunteer Fire Department said: "This is truly a godsend. This funding will be used for turnouts for protection of our volunteers. It will go a long way in helping us to complete our mission. We are all very grateful."
