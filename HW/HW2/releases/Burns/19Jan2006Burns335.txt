SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR MINE SAFETY GRANT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) grant for Mine Safety to Montana in the amount of $120,373 that was approved today.  
 The grant will go to provide federally-mandated training to miners in coal, metal, and nonmetal mines. 
   Senator Burns said, "This grant is needed in Montana to improve mine safety. We all were reminded of the risks miners take in the wake of the Sago Mine Tragedy. In Montana we will continue to work hard to make mines as safe as possible." 
   The grant will be administered by Montana's Department of Labor and Industry, based in Helena. DOL statistics show since 2001 that mine worker fatalities have fallen 33 percent in Montana, compared to only four percent nationwide. Since 2001, DOL's Mine Safety and Health Administration has awarded over $600,000 to Montana for safety training for miners across the state.
