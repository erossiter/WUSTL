SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES STAFF OUTREACH IN HAVRE
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced that his Great Falls Field Representative, Sarah Converse, will hold community outreach hours in Havre on Thursday, August 10 from 1 - 2pm at the Hill County Library at 402 3rd Street. She will be available to meet with anyone who has a problem with a federal agency or questions or comments regarding issues before Congress. 
   Senator Burns said, "With all the distances we have to travel in our state, I like to have my staff visit communities to save folks the trip to our Helena field office. Please take a moment to stop by and visit with Sharlene if you have comments or questions, and feel we might be able to assist you. Sharlene will let me know what's on your mind and we'll do what we can to help out."
   If you have any questions, please feel free to call Sarah Converse at (406) 452-9585 or (800) 344-1513.
