SEN. BURNS FOCUSES ON IMPACT OF ENERGY COSTS ON ELDERLY
  The Senate Special Committee on Aging will hold a hearing today focusing on the impact of soaring energy prices on the elderly. Sen.  
 Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), a member of the Aging Committee, today commented on the impact of these rising energy prices. 
   "I know we are all worried about escalating energy costs in this country, and we cannot forget its impact on our aging population," said Burns. "For those living on fixed incomes, the increasing costs of energy are increasingly difficult to keep up with. The Department of Energy has even indicated that as much as 35% of an elderly individual's annual income is spent on energy bills. In a world where healthcare costs are rising as well, that leaves little income, if any, left for seniors to enjoy their twilight years." 
   The Senate is currently debating the Energy Bill, and Burns continued: "With gas prices expected to remain above $2 through 2006, we should be examining a long-term solution rather than a short-term fix. It is my hope that the passage of an Energy Bill will help alleviate some of burden on high energy costs." 
   Burns' comments will be made available today via satellite feed at 1:45pm MT, 3:45 EST on:
