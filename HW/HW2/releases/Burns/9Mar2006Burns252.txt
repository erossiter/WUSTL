SEN. BURNS MARSHALS SENATE SUPPORT FOR METH BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today asked the Sen. Mike Enzi (R - Wyo.), the Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee to support and help pass S. 2315, the Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention Act of 2006, which Senator Burns introduced this year.  
   This bill has been referred to the HELP Committee and now moves forward to see if it can earn a hearing, then hopefully put on the schedule for a Committee mark-up, passage through Committee and passage on the Senate floor, a process which can take months or even years. 
   This legislation would create a $25 million competitive grant program for education campaigns directed toward methamphetamine. 
   In the letter, Senator Burns said, "Meth use among teens has ravaged our communities, putting a strain on public resources and burdening families with the emotional and physical costs of meth addiction. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." 
   Senator Burns is the founder of the Senate Anti-Meth Caucus with over 30 members and a Senior Member of the Appropriations Committee.
