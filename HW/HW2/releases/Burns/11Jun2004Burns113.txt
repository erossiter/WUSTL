SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON FUNERAL SERVICE FOR PRESIDENT REAGAN
 "Both my wife and I were able to attend today's service for President Reagan, and I can't imagine a more fitting tribute to such a great man," said Burns. "The grandeur of the National Cathedral, the patriotism in the service's music, the precision of his military escorts, even the insight offered by his eulogists all mirrored the qualities that President Reagan himself carried through his life and his presidency. I'm not sure words can do my feelings any justice, but it was my great honor to be there today with Nancy, their children, and the rest of America."
