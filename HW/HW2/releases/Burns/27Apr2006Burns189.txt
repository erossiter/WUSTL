SEN. BURNS FIGHTS TO LOWER GAS PRICES
  Today, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and members of the Senate Republican Leadership rolled out the Gas Price Relief and Rebate Act of 2006. This bill is a comprehensive strategy to provide relief and protection to consumers while encouraging energy conservation, development of alternative energy sources and increased domestic energy exploration. 
  * Gas Tax Holiday Rebate for Consumers - Gives $100 rebate check to taxpayers to help with the burden of high gasoline costs.
   * Consumer Anti-Price Gouging Protection - Gives the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the Justice Department and state attorneys general, the authority to bring enforcement actions against any supplier unlawfully inflating the price of gas in order to protect consumers from abuse.
   * Tax Incentives - Repeals tax incentives for oil companies while expanding tax incentives to promote the purchase of hybrid vehicles
   * Fuel Economy Standards - Gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to issue a rule to govern fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles.
   * Authorize Advanced Energy Initiative - Encourages research and development into alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles to diversify our domestic energy supply. 
   * Strategic Petroleum Reserve - Urges the Administration to suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for six months to make more oil available for consumer use.
   * Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - Opens a portion of the Coastal Plain of ANWR to environmentally sensitive oil exploration to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
   * Refinery Capacity - Includes incentives to encourage additional refinery capacity to enhance our energy infrastructure and lower prices at the pump.
  Senator Burns said, "In my state of Montana we are producing more oil than in any time in our history. We are finding oil better, we are lifting it better, but we simply cannot get it on the pipeline. Oil costs are around $71 a barrel - the spot price is between 54 and 56 dollars. So, I think that justifies taking a look at the companies to see what they are doing to ensure that Montanans are not being charged unfair prices.
  "We don't have enough pipeline capacity or refining capacity and this hurts our ability to explore and to lift. Our infrastructure across the country has not kept pace with the demand and it is terribly expensive to permit and to cite new refining facilities. We haven't built a new refinery in this country in 30 years. I've been listening to my folks at home and this bill will address their concerns by increasing our supply to the consumers."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
