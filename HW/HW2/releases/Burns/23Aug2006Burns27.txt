  On Saturday, August 26, Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) will chair a Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in Sidney to examine renewable energy issues, specifically cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel.The hearing will be held at the USDA ARS Northern Plains Agricultural Research Lab at 9:30am. 
  The Subcommittee is holding the hearing to discuss development of renewable fuels, especially in Montana.In addition to discussing biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol, the Subcommittee will investigate sources of funding for new projects and infrastructure needs to support development.
  "I am hosting this hearing in Sidney so our Committee may hear directly from producers across Eastern Montana," said Senator Burns."We want to call attention to the developing biofuels industry in Montana and better understand what obstacles we face.With the upcoming Farm Bill focusing so much on renewable fuels, there is a tremendous opportunity for Montana to see new investment and new opportunities for agriculture.The goal of the next Farm Bill has to be keeping more dollars on the farm and expanding opportunities for young farmers and ranchers.Renewable fuels are one way to accomplish that."
