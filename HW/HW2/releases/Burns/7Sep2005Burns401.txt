SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE FIGHTING GRANTS FOR CHESTER, HINGHAM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced two fire fighting grants for Montana through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
 The Town of Hingham will receive $299,915 and Chester Volunteer Fire Department will receive $24,966, both for operations and safety. 
   "As our hearts go out to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama after the terrible destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina, we are reminded how important it is to make sure our first responders have the training and equipment they need to save lives. This type of funding goes directly towards improving the capabilities of the brave men and women who risk their lives to fight fires on a daily basis, and I am happy to see Chester and Hingham receive grants today." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
