SEN. BURNS DETAILS NATIONAL ENERGY PROBLEM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) detailed the cause of and potential long-term solutions to our national energy problem today in a speech on the Senate floor. 
   In today's floor speech, Senator Burns said, "Americans get concerned whenever we see spikes in energy costs. No one is more concerned than we are in agriculture. We have a unique situation in agriculture. We sell wholesale, buy retail, and pay the freight both ways. Every one of those stages involves energy, (which) drives energy and drives prices."
   Senator Burns also said, "We are dealing with a worldwide commodity that is driven by emerging economies as well as our own demand for transportation fuels. The demand has outstripped our ability to move crude, natural gas or coal to the processing plants and refineries.
   "I tell my colleagues that in Montana we are producing more oil than in the history of our State. Yet we cannot get it on a pipeline because we have not built a pipeline for quite a while. We have also not built a new refinery in this country for over 30 years. There are a variety of reasons, the majority of which is the ability to permit and to site a plant. So we find ourselves not being able to produce enough for the market."
   Burns cited three forms of renewable and alternative energy that hold great potential for Montana including Biodiesel, Coal to Liquid, and Cellulosic Ethanol. On these forms of energy, Senator Burns said, "Now, if we can do that, and we can also increase farm income, and solve the problem of being dependent on foreign oil, who can oppose that?"
   Senator Burns is member of the Senate Energy Committee and three-term U.S. Senator.
