USDA RELEASES CANADIAN FEED REPORT; ?NOT ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW' SAYS SEN. BURNS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) reacted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) report today regarding the implementation of the Canadian feed ban.  
 A USDA investigative team visited Canada in late January to verify Canadian claims of compliance with the ruminant feed ban instituted in 1997. 
   "We'll have all of a week to review this report before the USDA intends to re-open the border to cattle and beef imports and that's just not enough time," said Burns. "This is a complicated issue that has an impact on both consumer confidence and our agricultural markets, and I repeat what I've been saying all along that we should slow this process down. We need time to take a hard look at the science behind this and the results of the investigation. Beyond that, I want to ensure the U.S. team wasn't led to cherry-picked sites and under constant supervision by Canadian officials, limiting their ability to do a truly independent investigation." 
   Burns has called for a postponement of the March 7 re-opening, and is a co-sponsor along with Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) of a Senate resolution of disapproval, which would throw out USDA's entire rule. In addition, Burns successfully persuaded USDA to limit the scope of the regulations to allow beef and beef products only from cattle under 30 months.
