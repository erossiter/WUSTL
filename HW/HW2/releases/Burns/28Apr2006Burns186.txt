SEN. BURNS EMPHASIZES STRONGEST GDP GROWTH IN TWO YEARS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today released the following statement regarding economic forecasts that show the U.S. economy's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.8% in the first quarter of this year: 
  "Our economy keeps getting stronger, now growing more quickly than at any time in over two years. We've created over 5 million new jobs since August 2003. The Montana economy is in excellent shape too - we have 3.4% unemployment statewide and a few counties with less than 2% unemployment. This news only strengthens my resolve to continue this period of strong growth by making the tax cuts permanent and passing the small business health plan legislation I've introduced. This economy is really growing - but it can be better and we'll keep working at it."
