SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES BILL TO INCREASE NUMBER OF DOCTORS IN RURAL MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) has introduced a bill to draw more doctors to medically underserved areas of Montana and the country. Sen. Burns introduced S. 2789, the Rural Physicians Relief Act of 2006, which would offer physicians locating their practices in counties deemed to be "Frontier Counties" by the U.S. Census Bureau, a $1,000 per month tax credit for every month they practice in such areas.  
   The tax credit will serve as an incentive to physicians to locate their practices in rural areas where few or no physicians currently practice. This will save lives by making access to care more local, alleviating the need for long drives for emergency or general care. One-third of Montana's population currently lives in an area that would qualify as a "frontier county," making physicians who locate their practices in any of the 46 of Montana's 56 qualifying counties eligible for the credit. Nine Montana Counties currently have no practicing doctors and ten others have fewer than three. 
   Senator Burns said, "Many times the difference between life and death is how quickly you can access care. With the severe shortage of doctors in rural Montana, something had to be done to protect the more than one-third of lives potentially at-risk. This tax credit will mean more doctors serving those Montanans, which will mean not only better access to care for them, but more lives saved by having medical professionals closer to home." 
   Senator Burns was joined by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) in introducing this legislation.
