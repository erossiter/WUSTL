SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES PUBLIC SAFETY GRANT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that the Montana Public Safety Services Office will receive $987,477 through the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance Awards Program.  
 This funding will go towards developing a statewide interoperability communications system for law enforcement in Montana. 
   "In a state like Montana with such vast distances, it is critical we have advanced communications systems to keep Montanans safe," said Burns. "This funding will help increase communication between the various public safety departments within our state and allow a clearer line of contact that will help not only in emergency situations, but in preventing those situations from happening in the first place. I'm happy to see this program get some valuable assistance." 
   Specifically, this grant will advance the Montana Public Safety Services Office development of a multi-jurisdictional radio system to provide enhanced interoperable capabilities, system redundancy, data convergence and connectivity in order to update Montana systems.
