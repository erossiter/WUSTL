MSE RECEIVES CONTRACT EXTENSION WITH ENERGY DEPARTMENT
  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced today MSE-Technology Applications (MSETA) of Butte has been awarded a contract extension that will allow them to continue working on projects for several federal agencies including the Energy Department. Under contract with the DOE since 1996, the current agreement is set to expire on September 30, 2004. The extension will allow MSE to continue through 2005, with annual renewals that can extend through 2009.  
   Senator Burns, after speaking with representatives of MSE and touring their facilities earlier this year, met with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and urged him to consider the extension. "MSE provides good jobs for the community," said Burns. "I wanted Secretary Abraham to understand just how important this facility is not only to Butte, but to our state. The folks at MSE have done great work for our nation, and they should be allowed to continue that work. I'm pleased to see the department take this action." 
   Don Peoples is President of MSE, Inc. "Without the direct intervention of Senator Burns, this wouldn't have happened. He listened to us, and put his staff to work communicating with the Energy Department and the Secretary's office, and once again he came through for us. There are 186 employees here at MSE who can be thankful that Senator Burns is as invested in their jobs as they are, and we are all grateful for his work and that of his staff." 
   The notification of the contract extension has been sent to Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). MSE conducts research for several federal agencies including the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
