SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO ALLOW MILITARY RECRUITING ON PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued this statement today following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on military recruiting on college campuses:  
   "I am very pleased that our military can continue recruiting on public campuses. Colleges and universities are a place for freedom of speech - we wouldn't have that freedom were it not for the sacrifices and valor of our armed services throughout U.S. history. Our public universities have a responsibility that comes with accepting federal funding. That responsibility cannot include the deliberate exclusion of our armed services from offering a military career to college and university students. I have never regretted my own service in the Marines, and in public spaces, especially public universities, our kids should be given all the opportunities possible and be allowed to make their own decisions." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee and three-term U.S. Senator.
