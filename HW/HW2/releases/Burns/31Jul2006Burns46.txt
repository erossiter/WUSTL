SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) expressed support for S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy bill after voting in favor of cloture (which passed 72-23), a procedural vote to continue debate and allow an up or down vote on legislation: 
  "I support this bi-partisan, practical legislation to relieve our short term energy supply problems here in this country. This bill will open 2.5 million acres to new oil and gas drilling within one year, and an additional 5.8 million acres as soon as possible. We expect this area to supply 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years.
  "Going forward, we will aggressively support the goal of 25% renewable energy usage domestically by 2025, but in the short term we need to support responsible energy exploration where it makes sense."
  Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy Committee, and has supported this legislation to open up this area, known as Lease Sale 181.
