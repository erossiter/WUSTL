SEN. BURNS PASSES BILL TO IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY
  Late Monday Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.), Chairman of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, successfully passed S. 3679, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Reauthorization Act of 2006. The bill provides $79.6 million for fiscal year 2007 and $84.4 million for fiscal year 2008 in federal funding for the NTSB.
  "Our subcommittee has taken a thorough look at aviation safety through this legislation, and we are confident we have produced major improvements in accident investigations, accident notifications, and efficiency," said Senator Burns. 
  Among the specific requirements in the legislation:
  * Requires the NTSB to develop a plan, to be implemented within two years of enactment, for the NTSB Academy to achieve self-sufficiency and fully utilize the Academy's resources and facilities
   * Requires the NTSB to annually submit to Congress a list of accidents the Board was required to investigate but did not, as well as a list of ongoing investigations exceeding the time allotted by NTSB order
   * Sets up an investigation tracking system to be available to all Board members and also requires the NTSB to establish a process for members to review and comment on documents submitted to the President, Office of Management and Budget, or Congress.
   * The bill allows the Board to enter into agreements or contracts for investigations conducted under the Board's general authority without regard to any provision of law requiring competition, only if necessary to expedite the investigation.
   * The NTSB is also permitted to use refunds and reimbursements that are received in a fiscal year subsequent to the year for which the funds were originally appropriated.
   * In order to promote economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and prevent fraud and abuse at the NTSB, the bill expands the authority of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Inspector General (IG). The IG's authority would exclude direct involvement or oversight in specific accident investigations, and the IG would also be required to consult closely with the Senate Commerce Committee, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the NTSB on its on-going investigations. The bill also removes a requirement established in 2000 that the NTSB reimburse the DOT IG for costs associated with the review authority of the DOT IG, with the understanding that the DOT IG would be funded directly.
   * The bill requires Amtrak to submit to the NTSB, DOT, and DHS a plan for providing the NTSB and DOT a list of the names of passengers involved in train accidents and notifying their families appropriately.
