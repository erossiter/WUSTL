SEN. BURNS TO UNVEIL ST. MARY'S LEGISLATION
  On Friday Sen. Burns will introduce major legislation to repair and rehabilitate the St. Mary Diversion Facilities and the Milk River Project, which provide water for Hi-Line communities from Glasgow to Glacier Park. 
  The authorizing legislation, which falls under the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, represents many months of coordination with the St. Mary's Working Group, an advisory council working to reconstruct the aging diversion facilities.
  The Milk River Project and the St. Mary Diversion Facilities have now been in operation for nearly 100 years with minimum repairs and improvements. Together, the St. Mary Diversion Facilities and the Milk River Project, known as the "lifeline of the Hi-Line," affect approximately 70,000 people directly or indirectly and supply municipal water to about 14,000 people. Senator Burns has called St. Mary's the "backbone of the region's agricultural economy providing water to irrigate over 110,000 acres on approximately 660 farms."
  "I am pleased to be introducing this legislation tomorrow and appreciate everyone's efforts," said Senator Burns. "Montanans, especially folks along the Hi-Line, know the St. Mary Diversion Facilities are facing catastrophic failure as maintenance costs have increased with the accelerating deterioration of the aging facilities. We are committed to fixing this problem. Over many months, my office has worked closely with the St. Mary Working Group to develop legislation to address this issue. This project is my number one priority for this year."
  Senator Burns is senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and Appropriations Committees, the committees which will handle both the authorizing and funding for this project.
