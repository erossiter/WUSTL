SEN. BURNS UPDATES LIBBY ON ASBESTOS LEGISLATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) updated a group of Libby residents on the state of asbestos reform this evening after spending the day on the floor of the Senate. Sen. Burns spent nearly the entire day marshalling support for an amendment that he introduced to extend coverage to a large number of Libby victims left out of the current legislation. He also worked to defeat a secondary amendment offered by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) that was preventing his amendment and others from being considered. That amendment was defeated on a roll call vote of 70-27 after a flurry of negotiating among Senators directly up to the vote.  
   Senator Burns said, "The vote occurring today was just one in a series of expected hurdles to the bill. Asbestos reform is the toughest, most complicated bill I've seen, and it's very difficult to predict. It cuts across party lines and we're seeing some strange bedfellows. I'm happy to be coming back to Montana this weekend, but next week we'll be working very hard to ensure the lung diffusion capacity (DLCO) test is added to the bill for Libby." 
   Senator Burns filed the first amendment to the asbestos reform bill Tuesday morning, which would add the DLCO provision specifically for Libby residents as additional criteria. If added, the DLCO provision would include 40% more Libby residents. Tuesday afternoon Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) agreed to co-sponsor the Burns amendment, and the two are working together to secure the votes needed. The amendment is expected to reach the floor early next week if a budget point of order is defeated.
