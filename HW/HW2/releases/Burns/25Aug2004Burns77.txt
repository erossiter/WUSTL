SEN. BURNS REQUESTS MEETING WITH HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY RIDGE TO DISCUSS BORDER SECURITY SITE IN MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced today that he has requested a meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge when the Senate returns to discuss the future of plans for a Montana location as a new Northern Boarder Air and Marine Branch (AMB). This initiative is working to increase the Department's border security capabilities with air and marine law enforcement, surveillance and airspace security authorities.  
   "We continue to see Montana's role in the national security of our country increasing, and that shows the important role our state is playing in this everyday mission," said Burns. "Montana has been chosen as a site for the AMB, and now it's just a matter of time, and I plan to work closely with Secretary Ridge to make sure we get things implemented in a timely manner." 
   This initiative is aimed as shutting down narcotics and human smuggling routes and networks that operate along the United States and Canadian border. A site in Washington has already been put in place and there are plans to move forward with three other facilities in addition to Montana: New York, North Dakota and Michigan. 
   "Not only will this effort help secure our borders, but it will bring a number of jobs to Montana-it's a win-win situation. I look forward to meeting with Secretary Ridge to discuss the future of this project." 
   This program is being run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), responsible for the enforcement of border, economic, infrastructure and transportation security laws. ICE seeks to prevent acts of terrorism by targeting the people, money and materials that support terrorism and criminal networks.
