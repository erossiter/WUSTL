SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS REALLOCATION OF SCHIP FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) applauded the announcement today from Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson regarding a redistribution of $643 million in unspent State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds to help states avoid funding shortfalls in 2005.  
   "This means kids will not lose their health insurance because states don't have funds to administer this program," said Burns. "Keeping our children healthy is critical, and there is no reason they should miss out on quality healthcare because of issues individual states are having. I am glad to see Secretary Thompson take this important step today." 
   States have three years to spend each year's SCHIP allotment. In previous years, Congress has allowed a portion of funds left unspent to be redistributed to states that have exhausted their money. This year, Secretary Thompson used his own authority to redistribute unspent 2002 funds to states that demonstrated the need for additional SCHIP funds. In total, 28 states, including Montana, will be getting supplemental funds under today's announcement. 
   SCHIP was enacted with bi-partisan support in 1997 as a state/federal partnership program. All states administer this program which is intended to provide health coverage to otherwise uninsured children whose families earn too much for traditional Medicaid, but not enough to afford employer-sponsored or private sector policies. Approximately 5.8 million children are currently enrolled in SCHIP. For more information on the SCHIP program, please visit the following website: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/schip/.
