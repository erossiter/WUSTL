SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON CABLE'S MOVE TO HELP PARENTS CONTROL FAMILY TV VIEWING
  "I applaud today's announcement by the cable industry to voluntarily provide parents with the necessary tools to make informed decisions about what their children watch on television.  
 I've worked closely with the industry to ensure that cable operators continue to educate parents so they are made aware of the options and technology currently available to block programming that may be unsuitable for younger viewers." 
   Cable operators will now air public service announcements in Montana, provide material about parental controls at retailers in the state, and improve customer notification about the availability of these tools in billing statements and during visits by cable service technicians to the home. 
   "It's a tough job being a parent today," said Burns. Moms and dads need to know they have the tools to protect their children from unwanted programming, and I believe this commitment by the cable industry is good for all Montanans."
