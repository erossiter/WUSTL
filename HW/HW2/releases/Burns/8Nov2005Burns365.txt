SEN. BURNS SECURES COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS FUNDING FOR FY 06
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations (CJS) bill has been filed, and will now go back to both the House of Representatives and the Senate for final passage before being signed into law by the President Bush. Burns, a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, helped include over $8 million in projects for Montana. Included is important funding for the Departments of Justice and Commerce, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and a number of independent agencies and commissions, including the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Small Business Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission.  
   "This bill contains funds to help keep our country's justice system and law enforcement effective, efficient and modern," Burns said. "Strong law enforcement makes for safer and better communities and that's always something I'll support, and I'm glad I was able to include so many important projects for our state." 
   Montana Specific Projects in this bill include: 
   * MSU Compact Laser Sensors $1,250,000

   Burns included language in this bill that would reduce costs for Montana schools and libraries. Because of new accounting rules imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2004, the Universal Service Administration Company (USAC) suspended new funding commitments in the E-Rate and Rural Health Care programs, leaving all eligible E-Rate recipients without necessary funds. The Burns provision will exempt the Universal Service Fund (USF) from the Anti-Deficiency Act through December 31, 2006, allowing the USAC to immediately act on all pending E-Rate and Rural Health Care applications. Without passage of this provision, the FCC would have been forced to increase contributions to USF to meet all of the fund's commitments. That would have meant an increase in telephone fees to all residential and business customers beginning in January 2006. "We have seen first hand the benefits of the E-Rate program in Montana, and across the nation," said Burns. "And the recent accounting changes that caused a disruption in funding came at us with absolutely no warning. More than 35 schools and libraries in Montana were impacted by this disruption of funding, and I was determined to put that to an end." He also worked to include the Primary Line Amendment, which precludes the FCC from collecting USF on more than one line in a household. This protects many Montanans, including those with faxes and Internet connections. 
   Burns also included an amendment that is part of the final conference report to prevent the Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) from using any appropriated funds from enforcing or registering the phrase, 'last best place.'
