SEN. BURNS PROTECTS 'LAST BEST PLACE' FROM COMMERCIAL USE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) has won Committee passage of a provision he authored to protect "The Last Best Place," the unofficial motto of Montana, from being trademarked by any private entity. The provision was inserted into the Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill, which funds the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Patent and Trademark Office. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved this legislation today. 
   The Burns provision extends protection of the phrase for the next fiscal year by forbidding any federal dollars to be used to trademark or enforce the trademark of the phrase. If the provision remains in the bill when it is signed in to law, any trademark application would be unable to advance.
   Senator Burns successfully inserted the same provision into the fiscal year 2006 CJS Appropriations bill, but without Senator Burns' provision this year, the phrase, which has become synonymous with Montana, could be trademarked.
   The Burns provision reads:
   "Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds appropriated under this act shall be used to register, issue, transfer or enforce any trademark of the phrase 'Last Best Place.' ''
   "I will not stand for this phrase being trademarked. The 'Last Best Place' motto belongs to Montana and I will always fight to make sure it remains that way," said Senator Burns.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the Departments of Justice and Commerce.
