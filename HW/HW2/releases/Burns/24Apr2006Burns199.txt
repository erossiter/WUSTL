SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $43,000 BYRNE JAG GRANT FOR MISSOULA
  Sen. Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that the City of Missoula will receive an Edward Byrne /JAG program grant from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance for $43,145. 
  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program will assist Missoula throughout a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime, based on Missoula's local needs and conditions. The resources that this grant supplies can be used for state or local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice precautions.
  The City of Missoula plans to use the JAG funds to pay for a civilian property clerk and also purchase Live Scan Fingerprinting equipment and supplies.
  Senator Burns said, "I am glad to see the funding coming through. It took a lot for us to get the $900 million for Byrne/JAG money added to the budget resolution for fiscal year 2007 and it's great to see these efforts pay off for Montanans. This funding is critical to the efforts of the Montana Department of Justice to reduce crime and effectively combat the meth epidemic."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and held a law enforcement round table meeting in Missoula February 4, 2006 to receive a firsthand update on local law enforcement efforts to combat meth, including the benefits of increased Byrne / JAG funding.
