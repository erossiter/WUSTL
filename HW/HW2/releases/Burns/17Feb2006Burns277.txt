SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH MARINES TO DISCUSS NEW BODY ARMOR
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) yesterday welcomed three Marines, Sgt. Shane Cooley, Lt. Col. Gregg Olson, and Major Pete McAleer, and to his office to demonstrate the quality of new body armor used by Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   According to the Marines, this cutting-edge body armor has been critical in preventing casualties. Lt. Col. Olson said that when his Marines were taking fire in Iraq, not a single high-powered rifle round penetrated their armor plates.
   Senator Burns said, "We don't care how much this costs - we will do whatever it takes to get the best gear to our soldiers and Marines. As a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee I'll make sure this happens."
   The average Marine goes on patrol with at least 85 pounds of gear, often in 120 degree heat in Iraq. New side plates have been rapidly fielded, but the added weight prevents the armor plates from covering more of a Marine's torso.
   Other military sources have told Senator Burns that recent false reporting of flawed body armor forced the Marines to pull good vests out of Iraq, only to have them replaced by identical vests. All the equipment in question has passed quality control testing.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, three term U.S. senator, and former Marine from 1955-1957.
