SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI ELECTIONS
 "Today is a happy day," said Burns. "They appear to have had a higher voter turnout in Iraq than we did in our recent federal elections, and we didn't have terrorists threatening to kill our families if we voted. This is a monumental day in history, and I send my heartfelt congratulations to the Iraqi people. Today also shows the effect of the steadfast policies of the United States, and that the fires of freedom still burn inside. Remember, our safety does depend on bringing freedoms to nations under the grips of terrorists."
