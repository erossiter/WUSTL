SEN. BURNS SECURES MAJOR FUNDING FOR KALISPELL BYPASS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today he included an important project for Kalispell in an Appropriations bill that will move through Committee this week. 
   The Kalispell Westside Bypass Project is advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations bill.
   Senator Burns has secured major funding for the Bypass, which will build a West Reserve Connector to bridge U.S. 93 and the Stillwater Road and Reserve to alleviate traffic congestion in the west side of Kalispell, known as the Westside Reserve Loop. The primary goals of the project are to provide a safe route for high school students after the Glacier High School opens in the fall of 2007 and cut down fire and ambulance response time from the new Kalispell Fire Hall, which is to be completed this year.
   "Kalispell has seen incredible growth on the west side and I know how badly needed this project is to improve traffic and ensure public safety," said Senator Burns. "I am pleased we were able to include this project in this appropriations bill and will be delivering this funding for the community."
   "This is excellent news" said County Commissioner Gary Hall. "We appreciate Senator Burns working so hard to assist in not only providing a safe route for the kids at the new high school and an additional route for the Kalispell Fire Department, but also for his commitment to the Bypass project has a whole."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, House and Urban Development or TTHUD, which funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
