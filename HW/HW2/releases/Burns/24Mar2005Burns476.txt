SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES NEARLY $4 MILLION IN FUNDS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the U.S. Department of Education had awarded fourteen Montana Colleges and Universities a total of $3,972,887 in funds for the TRIO program and its student support services. Sen.  
 Burns worked to secure these funds as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the Department of Education, and its grant programs. 
   "This is welcome news," said Senator Burns. "These funds provide an extra leg up for students in Montana who might need the extra help when they get into college. It is important we continue to provide that motivation and opportunity to everyone, especially lower income students and students challenged by disabilities." 
   According to the Department of Education website, the Federal TRIO Programs are educational opportunity outreach programs designed to motivate and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds. TRIO includes six outreach and support programs targeted to serve and assist low-income, first-generation college students, and students with disabilities to progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs. These funds are a four-year grant with the exception of Blackfeet Community College, which is a five-year grant.
