SEN. BURNS HIGHLIGHTS MONTANA'S 3.4 PERCENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) highlighted today's release of new labor statistics by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing Montana now has the lowest unemployment rate since state-specific data has been collected. 
   The new rate is 3.4 percent in March, down from 3.7 percent in February thanks to the creation of 3,200 new jobs in the month. Montana's unemployment rate has dropped from 4.1 percent in March of 2005 to 3.4 percent today, one of the strongest performances in job growth of any state.
  Senator Burns said, "This is good news for Montana. The unemployment rate is dropping and the job security of Montanans is increasing. This is the lowest Montana employment rate in recent history - that's something all Montanans can be proud of. Our state's economy is benefiting from the investment we've secured at the federal level in energy, agriculture, and infrastructure.
  "I'll continue to work to make sure Montana is a great place to do business and an important part of that effort is passing health care insurance relief for small business, in a bill I introduced with Senator Enzi. That bill will allow small businesses to band together and negotiate with insurance companies from a stronger position. It will lower health care costs on small businesses, including farmers, ranchers, realtors, and family businesses and also provide small business employees with health care coverage and lower the overall cost of doing business, which will enable even more job growth. Efforts like these will continue to make Montana a great place to work and a great place to find work."
