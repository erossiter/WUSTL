SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES 97,934 MONTANA SENIORS HAVE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) announced today the latest enrollment numbers for the Medicare Part D drug benefit for the state of Montana. As of May 7, 2006, fully 65 percent of seniors in Montana now have prescription drug coverage.  
   With the enrollment deadline of May 15th just around the corner, there is still time for any senior who has yet to investigate the program to call 1 800 MEDICARE or visit www.medicare.gov and see if it is something they would be interested in signing up for. 
  That 65 percent enrollment number is for a voluntary program. Not all seniors who investigate the program choose to sign up. Many have drug coverage through their former employer, or take few to no drugs and decide they do not need it. Senator Burns still urges every senior to investigate the program before the deadline, just to make sure they have all the information they need to make the choice that is right for them.
  Senator Burns said, "We've done a great job in Montana of getting the necessary information to our seniors about what this benefit is and how it will help them. They've sifted through it, called the 800 number, visited the website, or visited our bus tour to ask their questions. They've gotten the answers they needed to make the best choice for their individual needs and all surveys indicate they are happy and satisfied with their choices. If there are still any Montanans out there who haven't gotten the answers they need, I urge you to move quickly to get them. If you aren't finding what you need through Medicare, call one of my offices and my great staff will get on it and make sure you have what you need. Seniors who want to should take full advantage of this opportunity. It will save them money, and improve the quality of their lives."
