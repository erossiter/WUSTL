SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS CONDOLEEZZA RICE, ALBERTO GONZALES NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) voiced his unequivocal support today for President Bush's nominees to Secretary of State and Attorney General.  
 Current National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza Rice has been tapped to fill the position of Secretary of State being vacated by Colin Powell, and Judge Alberto Gonzales to take over as Attorney General following the resignation of John Ashcroft. 
   "President Bush has sent two fine candidates to us for confirmation," said Burns. "Dr. Rice has distinguished herself over many years of exemplary public service. She has the institutional knowledge needed to successfully carry this position forward, and work with foreign nations to make our world a better and safer place. 
   "Judge Gonzales is also a legal scholar who I feel will be able to lead our federal law enforcement agencies while keeping a keen eye on the protection of our civil liberties. He brings with him extensive experience from the bench, and solid constitutional knowledge." 
   "Both of these are excellent choices, and I thank the President for presenting the Senate with such qualified candidates. I also call on my colleagues to set aside any bitterness they may feel in the wake of the elections, or with the predecessors for these positions and look at the clear records of Dr. Rice and Judge Gonzales as we move forward with the confirmation hearings."
