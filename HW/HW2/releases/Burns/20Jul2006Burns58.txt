SENS. BURNS, HARKIN WIN PASSAGE OF AMENDMENT TO INCREASE BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FUNDING BY $150 MILLION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) won acceptance of an amendment he supported, with Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) to increase Breast Cancer research funding by more than $150 million for fiscal year 2007. 
   Medical research was not included in the Defense Appropriations bill, so including this language was a strong statement in support of the fight against breast cancer.
   Senator Burns worked behind the scenes with his colleagues to build support for this measure, which was instrumental in forcing the adoption of the amendment.
   "We wanted to ensure this critical research funding was included in this appropriations bill," said Senator Burns. "I am pleased my colleagues accepted this amendment and we will fight for this funding for breast cancer research on the Senate floor."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
