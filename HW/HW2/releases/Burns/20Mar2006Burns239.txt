INTERIOR DEPARTMENT CLARIFIES WOLF RULE
  The U.S. Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service sent a letter today to Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) in response to recent livestock depredations in McCone and Garfield Counties from wolves. In the letter, Acting Regional Director Casey Stemler clarified that FWP personnel or specialized volunteers had the authority to shoot the wolves, that shoot-on-site permits could be issued to affected ranchers, and that U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services (WS) personnel would be on hand to assist FWP in the predator search within the boundaries of the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge.  
   "Senator Burns wrote Secretary Norton asking for a solution to this problem. I believe we have found an avenue for Montana and the locals to work together to solve it. It took everyone working cooperatively to get the job done", said Matt Hogan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks in the Department of the Interior. 
   Senator Conrad Burns, Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee said "This was a cooperative effort on the part of ranchers and local officials in conjunction with State and Federal offices as well. I'm pleased to see everyone coming together to find a resolution to this problem and I especially thank Secretary Norton's office for quickly finding a method to resolve the problem the 10(j) rule created for McCone County."
   At Burns' request, the Secretary's office clarified that professional trappers employed by a county are permitted to fill the same role that trappers from Wildlife Services perform in Western Montana for predator control. This allows counties in Eastern Montana that are not normally part of the wolf management agreement between Counties, the State, and the Federal Government to have the ability to deal with wolf depredation.
