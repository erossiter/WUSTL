BRITISH CONSUL GENERAL UDEN TO VISIT MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the British Consul General, Martin Uden, has graciously accepted Burns' invitation to visit Montana to speak with small business owners and state officials.  
 Uden expressed interest in learning more about Montana's technology industry after conversations with Burns over the last year. Uden will arrive in Helena on March 24. 
   "I am pleased Mr. Uden will finally have a chance to begin learning what Montana has to offer firsthand," said Burns. "We've been in contact for some time now, and Martin wants to learn more about this ever-growing technology sector flourishing in our state. I believe there's real opportunity for some of our businesses to expand to European markets, and this is a great way to bring the innovators together with a key player in trade with the UK (United Kingdom), and see what we can make happen. I have encouraged him to speak with Governor Schweitzer and his staff so we can all be working together for Montana's small businesses." 
   Burns would like Mr. Uden to meet with representatives from Montana's Universities to look at technology transfer programs and agriculture, and speak with some of Montana's small business owners in the technology and light manufacturing industries to look at opportunities for European expansion. Burns said, "This could mean expansion for these businesses, and more jobs for Montanans." Uden is Consul General for Britain, based out of San Francisco, California, and represents the UK for seven western states including Montana. The Consulate-General, in addition to traditional diplomatic duties, is also a trade representative for Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.
