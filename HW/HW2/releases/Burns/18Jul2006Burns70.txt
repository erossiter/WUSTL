SEN. BURNS SAVES AMTRAK AGAIN
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont), a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD), announced today the Subcommittee had approved $1.4 Billion for Amtrak. Sen. Burns urged his colleagues on the subcommittee to support him in providing adequate funding for Amtrak, given how important the Empire Builder is to Montana's economy and our Nation. 
   "It seems a never-ending fight to protect Amtrak and this year was no different," said Burns. "Senator Bond, who chairs our subcommittee, took a ride with me last year on the Empire Builder from Whitefish to Cut Bank, and he got to see first-hand how important this line is to Montana. We've been able to secure a significant amount of funding for this important transportation line, and I'll keep working to ensure it makes it through the process."
   Senator Burns has continually been successful in protecting Amtrak from attempts to gut the funding by the administration. In addition to fighting for increased Amtrak funding, Senator Burns, as a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, is working with his colleagues to secure passage of S. 1516, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. The legislation will reauthorize Amtrak programs and provide guidance on important reforms that will help Amtrak improve its fiscal stability.
   The TTHUD bill also contains $117 Million for Essential Air Service (EAS), which allows smaller rural airports in Montana to maintain air cargo and passenger service. The EAS cities in Montana are Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Lewistown, Miles City, Sidney, West Yellowstone, and Wolf Point.
