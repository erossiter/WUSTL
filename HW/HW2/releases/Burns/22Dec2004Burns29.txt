SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE GRANTS FOR ROUNDUP, MOORE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that Roundup and Moore will both receive grants through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards program.  
 Roundup Volunteer Fire Department will receive $22,050 to go towards operations and firefighter safety, and Moore Rural Fire District will receive $85,500 to go towards a new firefighting vehicle. 
   "Fighting fires in not an easy job, and the men and women who are out there battling these blazes deserve the best training and equipment possible to make sure they can get the job done safely," said Burns. "This funding goes directly towards reaching that goal, and I'm glad to see this important funding go to Roundup and Moore this week." 
   Jerry Simpson, Secretary of the Treasury of the Fire Board in Moore said: "We're thrilled to get this funding. Without the help of FEMA, getting these rural fire districts up and running would be nearly impossible, and we can't thank them and the Federal government enough." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of all current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
