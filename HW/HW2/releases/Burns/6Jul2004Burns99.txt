SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT FUNDS COMING TO MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that five airports in Montana have been slated for airport improvement funding.  
 The grants, allocated by the Department of Transportation's Airport Improvement Program (AIP), will go to the development of a variety of aspects at each of the airports including terminals, runways, land acquisition, security enhancement, operational support, and the furthering of airport master plans. 
   Included in the AIP grant awards are funds for the following Montana cities and towns: 
   * Havre City-County, $160,978 
  * Circle in McCone County, $137,000 
  * Plains in Sanders County, $430,000 
  * Billings Logan International, $2,643,482 
  * Butte's Bert Mooney Airport Authority, $248,427 
   "By improving our transportation infrastructure, this funding brings Montanans closer together and provides additional security in the continued growth of our economy," said Burns. "I'm happy to see the money coming to our state and will continue my work in Washington to make sure all avenues of our transportation system remain in the best condition possible."
