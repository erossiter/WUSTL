SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEE MIERS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) this morning met with Supreme Court Nominee Harriet Miers in advance of her confirmation hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  
   "We had an extremely positive meeting this morning," said Burns. "Ms. Miers has a great sense of humor and a great understanding of the importance of the legal arena in our nation. I was happy to have the opportunity to sit down with her today and discuss many of the issues important to my state of Montana, especially with respect to private property rights and natural resources, and I believe she has a great understanding of western values which is a good thing in my book. I am confident we will learn a great deal more about Ms. Miers in the coming weeks as the Judiciary Committee holds confirmation hearings, and I look forward to this next step in the confirmation process."
