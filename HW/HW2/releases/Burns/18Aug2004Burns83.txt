SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR FORT PECK RESERVATION
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes have just been approved funding from the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA).  
 This EDA investment, which totals $1,097,612, will be used for the construction of a manufacturing facility and the purchase of technology-based manufacturing equipment. 
   "As a part of my work in Washington, I am committed to ensuring that no community in Montana is left unable to realize the American dream," said Burns. "This EDA investment will serve as a foundation for the future success of the Fort Peck Reservation's economy, and I'm pleased to see these funds going into the development needs of that community." 
   The EDA provides financial assistance to distressed communities throughout the United States to aid in their economic development. Their mission is to lead President Bush's federal economic agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy.
