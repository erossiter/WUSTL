SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF ENERGY SECURITY BILL
 Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement following the 71-25 Senate passage of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security bill: 
  "Today I voted in favor of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Bill which passed the Senate. This energy bill will open up more than 8.3 million acres on the outer continental shelf for oil and gas leasing. This is all deep water. This area is estimated to produce 1.26 billion barrels of oil, around 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
  "This really supplements the energy bill that we passed a year ago, covering renewables and a lot of alternative energy and also the new ones coming on board. And this one makes a complete package now
  "I expect these new technologies will develop and recoverable resources will only grow because we know they're there. The natural gas supply made available by this bill will heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years.
  "Additionally, an increased supply of natural gas will greatly benefit Montana's agriculture producers. We are particularly hard-hit with skyrocketing costs of our fuel and, of course, our fertilizer. In order to strengthen America's energy security - that's what it's all about - it's our obligation to use our domestic resources whenever we can, plus we gotta look at conservation and also alternative fuels.
  "Offshore drilling has proven to be safe and reliable and environmentally responsible for oil and gas production. We'll continue to support both short-term solutions to relieve our energy supply pressures and the long-term goal of 25% renewable fuel usage by 2025 to increase our energy security."
  Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
