HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDS HEADED TO PRESIDENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that $33.1 billion in Homeland Security funds passed the full Senate. The bill was approved by the House of Representatives on October 9, and will now go to the President for his signature.  
   Since 9/11 we have been working to make our nation as secure as possible," said Burns. "It takes effort and funding to put programs and security methods in place that get the job done to keep our nation safe, and I am glad to see Congress dedicate this funding to the ongoing effort of our country's security." 
   The following provisions are included in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for FY05: 
   * $5 billion for Customs and Border Security 
  * $3.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
  * $662 million for Federal Air Marshals 
  * $5.2 billion for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
  * $115 million for Air Cargo Security and enforcement and research and development 
  * $12 million for the nation's railway security measures 
  * $3 billion for state and local programs, including $715 million for Firefighter Assistance Grants 
  * $2.4 billion for the Department of Homeland Security's research and development, training, assessments and services 
  * $362 million to deter, detect, and mitigate acts of biological terrorism against the United States, and $122 million for nuclear and radiological countermeasures 
   While on the Senate floor, Burns worked with Senator Baucus (D-Mont.) to get a provision included in this bill that would have provided an additional $200 million to expedite five Air and Marine Operation bases across the northern border, including one in Great Falls. Burns wrote a letter to the members of the Conference Committee to emphasize the critical nature of this funding and request the funding remain in the final bill. He stated: "I am very concerned that without these additional funds, Montana's border will become a targeted filter for terrorist movement into the continental United States. We should not allow for gaps in our national security." 
   This provision was not included in the final bill, but Burns has vowed to continue working to speed up implementation in Great Falls and other Hi-line communities: "Montana lays claim to one of the longest stretches of the United States' northern border, and with much of it undeveloped I'd be remiss not to do everything possible to seal off that route to those wishing to do us harm. I will continue working to make sure Great Falls, and the Hi-line community in general, sees improved border security in the quickest manner possible."
