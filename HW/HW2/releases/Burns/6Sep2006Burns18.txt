SEN. BURNS, COALITION HIGHLIGHT NEED FOR VEHICLE SAFETY BILL THIS YEAR
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) joined a wide coalition in announcing nationwide support for S. 1948 (House companion HR 2230), the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act. The legislation, for which over 30,000 signatures have been collected in every state, will direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue safety standards to reduce rear blind zones, to ensure power windows and panels automatically reverse direction when they detect an obstruction to prevent children from being trapped, killed or injured and establish a child safety information program. 
  The legislation now has 20 Senate co-sponsors, as well as 20 House co-sponsors. Senator Burns was the fourth Senator to sign on as a cosponsor of the legislation on March 9, 2006, after meeting with KIDS and CARS, a national organization dedicated to improving the safety of children in and around parked vehicles. One of those who met with Senator Burns that day was Aaron Chatten, of Glasgow, whose 14 month old daughter, Madison, was killed when she was run over by an SUV at a daycare because the driver could not see her.
  "I believe this legislation will save the lives of our children," said Senator Burns. "These deaths are unnecessary, unintentional and preventable. These minor technological improvements must be made, and we need to pass this legislation this year."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over S. 1948.
