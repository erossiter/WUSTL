SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. STEVEN'S COMMUNICATIONS, CONSUMER'S CHOICE, AND BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT ACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today released a statement on Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK), praising the Chairman for his recently introduced "Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006." 
   Senator Burns said, "Chairman Stevens deserves a lot of credit for introducing such a thoughtful and far reaching telecommunications bill. I'm very pleased that most of the principles I set forth earlier this year are addressed and adhered to in this piece of legislation in regards to video franchising. And I'm also grateful to see that Senator Stevens incorporated my NetUSA bill, which will aid people living in rural areas of the country, like Montana, by keeping their phone bills low while expediting the spread of new technologies to those rural communities. I look forward to the hearings we will have on this bill, and working with the rest of the Committee to craft the best telecommunications bill possible."
   Senator Burns is a Member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and a three-term U.S. Senator.
