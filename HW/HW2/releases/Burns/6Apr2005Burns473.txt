SEN. BURNS TALKS TO AIR FORCE OFFICIALS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) met with senior Air Force officials this week to discuss Montana's military capacity and the idea of using Montana airspace for training.  
   This morning, Senator Burns met with Maj. Gen. Jumper, Air Force Chief of Staff, and Acting Secretary of the Air Force Michael Dominguez, to discuss bringing the new F/A-22 aircraft to Montana's wide open spaces. The F/A-22 will replace the F-15 and is an advanced, stealthy aircraft, which can fly at supersonic speeds. The Air Force has already delivered its F/A-22 aircraft to the first two bases slated for delivery: Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida and Langley AFB in Virginia. Elmendorf AFB in Alaska will also soon take on dozens of these jets. Burns invited Maj. Gen. Jumper to visit Montana's air space to fly their new F/A-22. 
   Burns would also like to see other aircraft use Montana for multi-service/joint forces training and looks forward to working with Montana's military community, state government and the citizens of Montana to this end. On Tuesday, Burns met with Maj. Gen. Ron Bath, Director, Air Force Strategic Planning, Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs, to discuss Montana's airspace. 
   "These days, because of encroachment issues, airspace is at a premium, and I think Montana could be a great site for future training. I think that Montana's size and geographical makeup could lend itself well to various joint training scenarios. We have land variations, weather fluctuations, and clear skies, not to mention the fact that Montana has the largest single Military Operating Area (MOA) in the lower 48 states-all of which add up to a great location for training."
