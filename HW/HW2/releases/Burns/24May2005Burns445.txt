SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns today announced that four Montana counties will receive $149,000 in Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds for drought through the USDA Farm Service Agency.  
 Jefferson, Madison, Silver Bow and Wibaux counties will receive funding through ECP to assist producers with cost-share assistance to provide emergency water in pastures where the previously adequate water source has failed. 
   "Many of our producers are suffering from lack of vegetation and diminishing livestock watering sources due to drought, and these funds are an important boost for those folks," said Burns. "In Montana we have seen multiple years of drought, and the recent moisture certainly can't change the tide of what has been such a long-term problem. I know this will be a real help for these counties that have been suffering from drought for so long, and I am glad to get this great news today." 
   Emergency practices include pipelines, tanks, troughs, constructing or deepening wells and spring developments, and in certain counties, water hauling and silt removal. Cost-share levels and eligibility requirements are determined in approved counties by the local Farm Service Agency county committee. Cost-share may be limited based on acres served. Permanent practices must be maintained for 10 years.
