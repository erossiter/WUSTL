SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES LIBRARY GRANT FOR PINE HILLS IN MILES CITY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that the Montana Department of Corrections Youth Services Division will receive a grant of $134,392 under the Literacy & School Libraries Program. The funding will be disbursed to the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility in Miles City over a one-year period beginning in September. This facility serves over 120 students in grades 6-12. 
   The Literacy & Schools Library Program is designed to improve reading skills among students through expansion and improvement of school libraries. The Pine Hills Facility's "Just Read It" program, which will receive funds from the grant, aims to improve students' reading and general academic achievement by replacing outdated library books and resources.
   The program places a strong emphasis on technology, and a portion of the grant will be dedicated to purchasing reading software, acquiring new computers, and creating an automated catalog system.
   The facility's library hours of operation will also be expanded to include weekend hours to allow students extended access to learning facilities.
   "I strongly support efforts to provide outstanding library facilities for our children and I know the children in Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility will benefit from this federal funding," said Senator Burns.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the U.S. Department of Education.
