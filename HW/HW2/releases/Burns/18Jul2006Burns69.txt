SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MISSOULA DEFENSE PROJECTS ADVANCE TOWARD FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that at least six major defense appropriation projects for Missoula have been included in an Appropriations bill that is expected to be approved by their respective subcommittees today and the full Senate Appropriation Committee Thursday. 
   The following projects are advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill:
   * GCS Research: Data Imagery - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to develop technology that will turn data into imagery for transmission from aircraft to intelligence collectors and commanders to provide them with precise locations, source, unit, and time of imagery of enemy positions or points of interest. This is a highly successful, classified program.
   * American Eagle Instruments: Prosthetics - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to develop metallic surface coatings for prosthetic devices like hip replacement and knee replacement parts. These improved prosthetics will last longer for our young soldiers who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and need replacement bones that will be with them for the next 50 or more years.
   * Arcomac: Erosion Resistant Helicopter Compressor Blades - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to develop erosion resistant surface engineering for advanced helicopter compressor blades. This metallic surface coating will increase the endurance and efficiency of military jet engines.
   * University of Montana: Biological Detection of Land Mines - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to further research ways to detect land mines using honey bees. This is an ongoing effort with Montana State University in Bozeman to better detect these mines, so they may be safely and efficiently removed. 
   * University of Montana: Warfighter Sustainability to Maximize Human Performance - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to maximize human performance in hostile environments by discovering new and innovative ways to counter fatigue and exhaustion that our soldiers often encounter in the field. 
   * University of Montana: Amelioration of Military Hearing Loss - Senator Burns expects to deliver funding to better treat and prevent hearing loss suffered by military personnel. This research could also lead to future innovations in treating and preventing hearing loss that millions suffer from today. 
   "These Missoula area projects are critical to maintaining our state's key role in our national defense," said Senator Burns. "I have worked with my colleagues and local folks to make sure these projects are a high priority."
   Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees.
