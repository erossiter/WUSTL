SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement on the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: 
  "Today we are reminded of the heroism, character and singular courage that was displayed on September 11, 2001. At a time when our country was met with unspeakable horror carried out by international terrorists, our country rallied together, showing the best of humanity in the face of the worst.
  "In five years, we have accomplished a lot, but for all of us we will never forget where we were when we heard the news of these attacks. I was on Capitol Hill, at a press conference for Emergency 911 funding. There was confusion and fear, and raw emotion as we thought of not just friends and family, but complete strangers as we looked toward Manhattan, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. It's a solemn day today as we think of the lives that were lost, the devastated families, and the bravery displayed by so many Americans.
  "We must never lose that resolve we felt in those initial days following the attacks. The long war against cowardly enemies not only willing but wanting to attack civilians, women and children, is one we must win for the sake of every freedom loving and freedom seeking person on earth. And it is one we will win. Freedom will never fall to fear, and cowards will never defeat the just. God Bless the United States of America."
