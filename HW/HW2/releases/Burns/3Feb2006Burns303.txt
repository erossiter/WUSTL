SEN. BURNS PREPARES FOR IMPORTANT TUESDAY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) yesterday met with Libby doctor Brad Black in Senator Burns' office near the Senate chamber with Sen.  
 Tom Coburn (R - Okla.), also a doctor. Sen. Coburn has been leading an effort against inclusion of an important improvement to the Libby provision. 
   Sen. Coburn had strongly opposed inclusion of the Lung Diffusion Capacity Test (DLCO), but after meeting with Dr. Black, Sen. Burns, and Senator Max Baucus (D - Mont.), Sen. Coburn has promised to Sen. Burns that he will make every effort to learn more about the extraordinary circumstances associated with Libby. 
   With Sen. Burns' help, Dr. Black will be in contact with another stakeholder in the asbestos debate, Dr. James Crapo, brother of Senator Mike Crapo (R - Idaho). Dr. Crapo has testified in front of the Senate numerous times on the various versions of the asbestos bill in the last several years, and is an expert on lung impairment related to asbestos exposure. 
   The dialogue is expected to take place on Monday, the same day debate begins on the Senate floor on the asbestos reform measure. The key vote in the asbestos reform effort will take place Tuesday evening, with the Senate considering a motion to proceed to the bill. 
   Once the vote occurs Tuesday night, Sen. Burns will lead the effort in the Senate to include the DLCO test which would include 40% more Libby residents than the current language. In the next few days, Sen. Burns will be in constant contact with Libby residents, city officials, and medical experts on the options available.
