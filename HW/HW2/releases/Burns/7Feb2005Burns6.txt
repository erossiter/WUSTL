SEN. BURNS REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S FY 2006 BUDGET
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced his reaction to the President's FY06 Budget, set at $2.57 trillion. 
   "As President Bush stated in his State of the Union Address, 'A taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely, or not at all,'" said Burns. "We need to move forward with a realistic outlook as to what's ahead, but we must do so in an economically sensitive manner as we endeavor to cut wasteful spending, lower taxes, and in turn, create more jobs. While we need to cut corners in some areas in order to decrease the deficit, we need to make sure critical programs are not damaged to a point of no return. There are areas where I think we need more attention, and I hope to point that out to President Bush and my colleagues in the Senate in the coming weeks."  
   Projects included in the President's budget: 
   * Permanent extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts at a cost of $1.1 trillion over 10 years 
   * Increased Homeland Security budget by 3 percent, totaling $32 billion 
   * Increased Defense budget by 4.8 percent totaling, $419 billion 
   * Anticipated revenue of nearly $3.2 billion from oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
   * Increase Pell Grant funding maximum award by $100 in 2006, and $500 over five years, lifting the maximum award to $4,550 
   * Commitment to expanding nuclear energy by funding Yucca Mountain at the level of $651 million 
   * Increased Hydrogen Fuel Initiative Funding at the level of $259.5 million 
   * Increased funding for the Veterans Affairs Department by 2.1 percent 
   "While I see some sound allocations included, there are some cuts I am extremely disappointed to see, including the farm programs within the Agriculture Department, as well as Amtrak and the Essential Air Service programs," said Burns. "It seems these are the programs we continually have to fight for, but they are well worth the battle, and I do not plan to sit silent as we move forward and hammer out a budget resolution." 
   The Agriculture Department is slated for a 9.6 percent cut, from current spending levels of $21.4 billion. Also included are mandatory spending cuts on farm programs by $658 million in fiscal 2006 and by $4.5 billion over five years. That includes a 5 percent cut in crop payments and $200 million in savings from tightening payment limits. 
   The FY06 Budget also proposes the termination of several education programs critical in Montana, including Even Start, Safe and Drug-Free Schools State Grants, Vocational Education, TRIO and Gear-up and Upward Bound. "I am extremely disappointed that the budget did not including funding certain effective education programs. These programs make a difference in the lives of Montana's young people and I will continue to work hard to ensure that these successful programs continue." 
   "I intend to work with Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-N.H) to emphasize some of the priorities I do not feel have been given full attention in the President's outline, and I will also work as a member of the Appropriations Committee to address funding shortfalls," said Burns. "I think this is a good foundation, and although I am not happy with every aspect of the President's budget, I am eager to work with my colleagues to craft, and pass, a fair but adequate budget resolution."
