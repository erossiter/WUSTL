SEN. BURNS CO-SPONSORS, PRAISES BUDGET AMENDMENT RESTORING $900 MILLION FOR BYRNE/JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) yesterday co-sponsored an amendment to the Budget Resolution to add $900 million to the U.S. Department of Justice for Byrne/Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funding. The amendment passed yesterday on the Senate floor.  
   The amendment was jointly offered by Senators Saxby Chambliss (R - GA) and Mark Dayton (D - MN). The funding was offset by an across the board cut to DOJ administrative expenses including travel and consulting services. The budget offered for 2007 by the White House sought to zero out the Byrne / JAG grant program. 
   Senator Burns said, "Restoring Byrne / JAG funding within the Department of Justice is a priority for me this year. I meet with local and state law enforcement officials across the state and they tell me this funding is critically important to combat violent crime and serious offenders. This funding is used for personnel, equipment, and training to ensure more successful apprehension, prosecution, and detention of criminals. Montana receives this funding, uses it wisely, and we need it in the fight against narco-trafficking and in our own Meth epidemic in Montana ." 
   Many national law enforcement organizations supported this amendment, including the National Sheriffs Association, the National Police and Peace Officers Association, and the National Narcotics Coalition. 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee and founder of the Senate Anti-Meth Caucus with over 30 members.
