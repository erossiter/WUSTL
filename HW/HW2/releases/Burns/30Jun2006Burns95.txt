SEN. BURNS SECURES MAJOR INTERIOR PROJECTS FOR MONTANA
  Sen., Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced a large number of important Montana projects are expected to be funded through his Senate Interior Appropriations bill, which was passed through the Senate Appropriations Committee today. Sen. Burns is Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
  "These projects represent investment in important Montana projects, vital to Montana and brought to me by Montanans," said Senator Burns. "We are working to secure continued funding for important conservation projects which span the state and will create jobs, fund clean water improvements, and protect our wildlife and habitat. I'm proud of these Montana projects."
  Included in the Interior Appropriations bill is a large federal grant for the Blackfoot Challenge, which will allow for the acquisition of approximately 3,754 acres of land within the Lolo National Forest, located in the Blackfoot River drainage. The Blackfoot Challenge will protect the integrity of the valley and is a home-grown project, with participants including more than 100 private landowners and representatives from 27 state, federal, and non-governmental organizations. 
   "This continued support for the Blackfoot Challenge project from Senator Burns is absolutely outstanding," said Jim Stone, Chairman of the Blackfoot Challenge Board of Directors. "This is a community-driven project and to have congressional support is a key to the success in this rural community."
  Other critically important Montana provisions included are:

  Chairman Burns expects to be able to include the two requests by U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont) into the legislation. "I've been able to ensure Montana is well represented in this bill, and I'm hopeful Senator Baucus will support all of the Montana projects as they progress through the Senate. Even though he's not on this committee, I'm sure I can count on his support once this reaches the full Senate." The two requests by Senator Baucus are: 
   - STAG - Crow Agency Water and Wastewater System Improvements (Billings) - The current Crow Agency wastewater and water systems failures include excessive leakage, inability to produce water fast enough to meet daily water consumption and the discharge of only partially treated wastewater in to the Little Bighorn River. The project will substantially address the wastewater system and begin to address the water system deficiencies. ($400,000)
   - STAG - City of Bozeman Wastewater Treatment Plant Reconstruction (Bozeman) - Phase I includes a reconstruction of the existing wastewater treatment plant. Significant treatment issues to be resolved include effective effluent dilution, and nitrogen and phosphorous discharge limitations. Additionally, chlorine residual limitations and year-round disinfection requirements will be addressed. ($400,000)
  Now passed by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, the Interior bill is ready to proceed to the full Senate for consideration. Once passed it would then go to a joint House-Senate conference committee to resolve differences in the two versions, the reconciled versions then going back to the respective chambers for final passage, then on to the President for his signature.
  Senator Burns is Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
