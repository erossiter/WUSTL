SEN. BURNS BRINGS RENEWABLE FUELS HEARING TO SIDNEY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced he will chair a Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Field Hearing in Sidney at the ARS Northern Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory in Sidney on Saturday, August 26 at 9:30am. 
  The Field Hearing will focus on the future of renewable fuels for Montana, with a special focus on cellulose ethanol and biodiesel. 
  "I'm excited about this opportunity to get more folks talking about renewable fuels development in Montana," said Senator Burns. "With gas prices as high as they are, we need to be looking now at alternative sources of energy. Agriculture is an important part of ending our dependence on foreign oil, and I want to be sure Montana is at the forefront of developments in cellulose ethanol and biodiesel. This hearing will give producers a unique opportunity to provide direct testimony that will help us as we determine USDA funding priorities and the shape of the 2007 Farm Bill."
  This Field Hearing is the third Congressional hearing Senator Burns has secured for Montana this summer. The Senate Agriculture Committee will host a Farm Bill Field Hearing on August 17 in Great Falls, with Chairman Saxby Chambliss (R - GA) leading the hearing. On September 1, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a Field Hearing in Havre on Senator Burns' legislation to rehabilitate the failing St. Mary Diversion Facilities.
  Committee field hearings are intended to provide an opportunity for testimony on local issues as members of Congress develop federal policies.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee and former Agriculture broadcaster.
