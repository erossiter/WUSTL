SEN. BURNS JOINS COLLEAGUES SPONSORING BILL TO FORM 12TH CIRCUIT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) joined several western Senators today introducing legislation to split the geographically large 9th Circuit Court of Appeals into two districts, creating the 12th Circuit Court of Appeals.  
 States covered under the jurisdiction of the proposed 12th Circuit would include Montana, Idaho, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona. The 9th Circuit would remain California, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. 
   The legislation would also provide for the new 12th Circuit to hold sessions in Portland, Oregon; Phoenix, Arizona; and at the request of Senator Burns, Missoula, Montana was added to the rotation. This would spread the geographic burden more equitably among the states. 
   "Regardless of my feelings about some of the questionable decisions rendered out of the ninth," said Burns, "This comes down to a basic constitutional question. The geographically massive 9th Circuit is backlogged with cases, even if you take out all the other states besides California. This backlog isn't just an inconvenience, it's an arguable violation of the Constitution and the right to due process. We, in Congress, have a duty to ensure the Judicial branch has the tools to perform their job. It is time to fix this problem." 
   Joining Burns in sponsoring the legislation are Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Ted Stevens (R-AK), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Larry Craig (R-ID).
