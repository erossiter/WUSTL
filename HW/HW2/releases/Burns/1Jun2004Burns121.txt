SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES TRANSPORTATION GRANT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that $25,000 from FY04 National Scenic Byway Discretionary Funds will go to Beartooth Highway in Carbon and Park Counties.  
   "Roads are the arteries that keep the blood flowing in Montana," said Burns. "They keep Montanans and tourists alike moving throughout the state, and keep the tourism industry in Montana flowing properly. Without proper management, these arteries could easily get clogged and cause disruption to the entire state. Every bit of funding to make sure our management has what they need to keep these corridors clear and the ability to organize investments and planning goals for the communities and partners supporting the byways is critical. I am glad to see this award go to Carbon and Park counties to help improve overall functionality of Montana's transportation system and keep all those moving through Montana's arteries up and running." 
   This project will fund the implementation of the Beartooth Highway Scenic Byway Corridor Management Plan in Montana and Wyoming. It will support the organization of a "Friends of Beartooth All-American Road" group that will carry out its organizational role in four ways: 
   * Building the administrative capacity of the byway; 
   * Facilitating byway project design and implementation;
  * Marketing the byway; 
   * Securing byway project funding and the means to maintain these projects into the future
