SEN. BURNS REJECTS CALL FOR TROOP PULLOUT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today rejected an effort by Sens. Bill Nelson (D - FL) and John Kerry (D - MA) to require the troops to be pulled out of Iraq by December 31, 2006. Sen. Burns voted to kill the pullout plan and it was overwhelmingly rejected, 93-6. 
  A legislative effort offered by Republican Whip Mitch McConnell (R - KY) and strongly supported by Senator Burns killed the pullout plan 93-6.
  "As a veteran, I will not accept cutting and running from Iraq before we complete the mission" said Senator Burns. "Our soldiers deserve our full commitment and the only place this war can be lost is in Washington, D.C. We will bring the troops home as quickly as possible, but setting an arbitrary time table does not secure the world and help us win the Global War on Terror."
  In other votes today on the Senate Defense Authorization bill, Senator Burns supported two amendments to get tough on Iran. The first, which failed, 45-54, would:
   * Require sanctions on Iran remain in place until the President certifies that Iran has verifiably dismantled its weapons of mass destruction programs 
   * Encourage a multilateral sanctions efforts against Iran 
   * Declare the policy of the United States be to support democracy proliferation efforts in Iran and providing financial and political assistance in that effort 
   * The supplemental bill, which passed 98-1 earlier Thursday, provides $66 million for democracy promotion programs and activities for Iran 
  The second amendment passed by voice vote, 99-0, and would:
   * Endorse the President's policy to achieve a successful diplomatic outcome with respect to the threat posed by the efforts of Iran to acquire a nuclear weapons capability
   * Call upon Iran to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities fully and verifiably, cooperate with the IAEA fully, and enter into negotiations pursuant to the diplomatic package recently presented to Iran by the EU
   * Urge the Administration to keep Congress fully and currently informed about the progress of this diplomatic initiative.
  "I do not believe we can sit back and let Iran get stronger, endangering the region, our allies, and the entire world," said Senator Burns. "We must take a tough stance and allowing Iran to acquire nuclear weapons is not acceptable."
  Senator Burns is senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees and served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955-1957.
