SENS. BURNS, BOXER TO EXAMINE NEW TV VIEWER RATING SYSTEM
  Sens. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced today that on July 15th, the Senate Communications Subcommittee will examine a new Nielsen Media research TV rating system.  
   Questions have been raised about the accuracy and fairness of Local People Meter (LPM) system and there are opinions on both sides. The major concern is that this system may not accurately record the viewing preferences of all viewers regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or age. Despite this, Nielsen is intending to move forward with its system. 
   Senator Burns stated: "Nielsen should cease the use of the new LPM system in New York and delay any further rollouts until they have committed to an independent review. The public has a right to know that the rating system which defines the public airwaves is accurate and fair for all viewers. I believe this hearing will serve as the beginning of a broader dialogue that can answer important concerns and generate productive ideas for meeting the public's need for a reliable television rating service." 
   Senator Boxer said: "California's diversity is a hallmark of my state. It is in the public interest that all Californians are fully counted in our entertainment marketplace - as viewers, producers, and entertainers. I want to work with all parties to ensure that any new system works for everybody." 
   The Senators promised that the hearing will present all views and its purpose is to ensure that accurate results will be the centerpiece of any ratings system.
