AMERICAN INDIAN HIGHER EDUCATION CONSORTIUM PRESENTS SEN. BURNS AIHEC ABOUREZK-SKEEN AWARD
  The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) honored Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) as one of the first recipients of the "AIHEC Abourezk-Skeen Award" today for his unflagging support of this nation's Tribal Colleges and Universities.  
 The award is named in honor of former Senator James G. Abourezk (D-SD) and the late Congressman Joseph R. Skeen (R-NM). 
   "I am honored to be put in the category of these two great men who worked diligently to improve the education opportunities for Native Americans across our country," said Burns. "I have worked in my role as United States Senator to further their efforts and advance the educational opportunities out there, and I will continue to do so, with the help of folks on the ground as well as my colleagues in the Senate, as Congress moves through the 109th session." 
   Senator Abourezk was one of the first Congressional supporters of the nation's tribal colleges introducing legislation that recognized the responsibility of the federal government to fund tribally-controlled post-secondary institutions. That legislation became known as the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978. 
   Congressman Skeen was Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee on Agriculture and later the Subcommittee on Interior. He ardently championed funding of the Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act of 1994 and the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Act. 
   This award will be presented once every four years to two individuals whose contributions exemplify the leadership and commitment that Senator Abourezk and Congressman Skeen demonstrated during their years in the United States Congress.
