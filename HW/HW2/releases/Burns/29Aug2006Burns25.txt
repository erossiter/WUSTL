USDA RELEASES EMERGENCY CONSERVATION DOLLARS
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was releasing $2,001,000 in Emergency Conservation Funding. The funds will be used to rehabilitate Montana lands destroyed by flood, drought, and fire. Funding can be used for removing debris, restoring fences and conservation structures, and providing water for livestock in drought situations. The USDA is also providing another $850,000 in Sec. 32 emergency grants to the State of Montana for additional distribution as needed based on determinations by the USDA and the State of Montana. 
  "Natural disasters hurt in so many ways," said Burns. "Recovering from these events can be tough on producers because many of the losses are uninsurable. These USDA dollars will go a long way toward helping these counties recover from what Mother Nature's dealt them this season. I have been urging USDA to provide funding to producers who have suffered through drought and wildfire this year, and I'm pleased to see these funds finally provided. I thank the USDA for listening to the concerns of Montana."
  The funds will be made available to the following Montana counties:
  * Big Horn/Yellowstone - $1,000,000 for wildfires
   * Blaine - $75,000 for wildfires
   * Custer - $75,000 for wildfires
   * Garfield - $225,000 for wildfires
   * Rosebud - $30,000 for wildfires

   * Big Horn/Blaine/Carbon/Stillwater - $413,000 for drought
