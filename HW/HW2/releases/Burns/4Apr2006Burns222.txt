SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS VOTE ATTACHING AGRICULTURE DISASTER RELIEF TO SUPPLEMENTAL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement regarding the unanimous vote to attach an Agriculture Disaster package offered by Senators Burns and Byron Dorgan (D - ND) to provide $3.9 billion in Agriculture Disaster Relief funding to the emergency supplemental appropriations for the Global War on terror and Hurricane Katrina. The Agriculture Disaster package will deliver funding equaling 30% of their direct payments to our nation's farmers and ranchers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and its damage to the Agriculture industry. After the vote, Senator Burns said: 
  "We cannot fund everything under the sun with limited federal resources, but governing is about priorities. The health and economic well being of our nation's agriculture industry, which produces the food and fiber that nurture our country and much of the world, is a priority for me and always will be. Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf very hard, but it also hit the agriculture industry hard, and this amendment will help our producers make up for the rising fuel and fertilizer costs they have incurred. We have a bipartisan coalition committed to seeing this amendment be part of a final package that passes the Senate, and we're united to ensuring it gets to the president's desk and the funding gets back to the small towns and rural communities in which our producers live and work."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, the committee of jurisdiction for the Supplemental funding request, as well as a former agricultural broadcaster.
