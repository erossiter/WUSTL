SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON 9-11 REPORT
 "The 9/11 report that has come out today is a constructive analysis of the security in our country and shortcomings prior to 9/11/01," said Burns.  
 "Since the attacks on the World Trade Towers, we have taken very big steps to improve the safety in our country, and there's no doubt that we are safer than we were on 9/11, but there's still work to be done. On the Congressional level, we must work to improve the coordination of our oversight, and I am committed to making that happen. I am glad this report came out without a negative tone-it didn't include finger-pointing and blame, but rather, a vision for how to best strengthen our intelligence capabilities into the future. I hope this tone continues as the subject matter is too important for political games."
