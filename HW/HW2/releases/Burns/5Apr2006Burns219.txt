SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION OF IMMIGRATION BILL TO STRENGTHEN BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement after today's obstructionist tactics used by the Senate Democratic leadership: 
  "This is an obstructionist move to allow amnesty. The Democrats are not committed to real border security. I've called for immediate, tough border security legislation before we do anything else or we will repeat the mistakes of history. We need to pass immigration reform legislation now, Montanans are demanding it. I've been fighting for common sense amendments which would block criminals from obtaining U.S. citizenship, combat foreign meth superlabs, and require passports are affordable for Montanans to facilitate honest commerce along the northern border. Now, none of these provisions can become law because the Democrats are not committed to border security, national security, and immigration reform. The Democratic leadership has weakened a nation today and all Americans should be outraged."
  Senator Burns served in the U. S. Marine Corps, is a senior member of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee and is a three-term U.S. Senator.
