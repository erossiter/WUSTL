SEN. BURNS FIGHTS TO DELAY BRAC
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) joined Senate colleagues today to move legislation forward that would delay the implementation of BRAC.  
   "Our country is facing some big challenges right now, and it does not make sense to move forward with this sweeping changes, which will undoubtedly put a huge strain on our forces serving at home and abroad," said Burns. "We need to examine the structure of our military forces and what we need-we are engaged in a war on terror right now, dealing with enemies that have changed the face of combat from what we have known. For the overall safety of our nation I feel there are several things we must ensure before we proceed with the BRAC process, and I feel this legislation will do just that. 
   The bill would postpone moving BRAC forward until: 
   * Complete analysis and consideration of the recommendations of the Commission on Review of Overseas Military Structure. 
   * The return from deployment of substantially all (as determined by the Secretary of Defense) major combat units and assets of the Armed Forces in Iraq. 
   * The completion of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) 
   * The development and implementation by the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security of the National Maritime Security Strategy 
   * The completion and implementation of Secretary of Defense's Homeland Defense and Civil Support Directive 
   "After looking at the facts here, it seems like common-sense to hold off on BRAC implementation," added Burns. "I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure we don't move forward in a process that may damage our military structure in the long haul."
