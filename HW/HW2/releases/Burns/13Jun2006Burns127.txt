SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES INTERNET SAFETY ACT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) today, along with Sen. Jon Kyl introduced the Internet Stop Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Youth (SAFETY) Act, which will federalize offenses relating to child pornography, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse. The bill, co-sponsored by the Senators, will increase the penalties for activities designed to exploit children for profit or perversion by on-line predators. 
  The Internet SAFETY Act:
  * Imposes Criminal Penalties for Financial Facilitation of Child Pornography: A maximum 10 year penalty for banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions that knowingly facilitate access to child pornography websites. 
   * Imposes Criminal Penalties for Internet Facilitation of Child Pornography: A maximum 10 year penalty for internet hosting companies or email provider that knowingly facilitate access to child pornography. 
   * Prohibits Child Pornography Enterprises: A maximum 10-year penalty for operating a child pornography enterprise. 
   * Increases Punishment for Registered Sex Offenders: A consecutive 10-year sentence for any registered sex offender who commits any child pornography or exploitation offense. 
   * Expands the Federal Private Right of Action: Allows civil remedies to be sought by victims, including the parents of a victimized minor. Victims can also seek civil penalties as an adult. 
   * Adds Child Sex Offenses to RICO and Wiretap Statutes. 
  The bill also creates the Office on Sexual Violence and Crimes Against Children within the Department of Justice. This office will coordinate efforts with state and local officials in registering and tracking of sexual offenders.
  Senator Burns said, "Child sexual predators have long used the internet for their sick perversions. This bill will go a long way toward shutting that down. Not only do those who commit these horrific acts need to be punished severely, people and businesses that facilitate the acts of these evil predators need to pay a significant price as well. Hosting and paying for these sites does not occur in a vacuum, businesses that host of pay these people need to be held accountable. The fear of real prison terms and financial penalties is exactly what is needed in dealing with those who would otherwise bury their heads in the sand when it comes to what they are really doing and making money off of."
