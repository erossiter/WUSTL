SEN. BURNS SPEAKS AT TELEHEALTH LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) spoke at the American Telemedicine Association's (ATA) annual Telehealth Leadership Conference. This conference is held to allow leaders in the telehealth community to hear from a panel of experts and participate in discussions on topics such as licensure, reimbursement, disease management, and the development of collaborative relationships in their field.  
   "Our wide open spaces in Montana make telehealth a critical part of our health care system," said Burns. "I have long played a role in the advancement of technology across our country, especially in our rural communities, and we must continue to invest in our technological capabilities in order to bridge the digital divide. This is important in the health care world, and across all disciplines. I recently hosted a health technology summit in Bozeman to focus on the advancement of telehealth, and it was a great success. We must embrace the growing world of technology and the benefits it offers in all arenas, and I look forward to working with folks back in the state, and here in DC, to make sure we continue to improve our health information technology capabilities across the nation." 
   Burns also spoke about electronic health records (EHRs), which would create personal health records that patients, doctors and other health care providers could securely access through the Internet, no matter where a patient is seeking medical care. "While the issue of EHRs is still in its infancy, steps toward advancing health information technology are essential to improving accessibility, affordability and quality in health care. This would be a huge step for rural and frontier areas like Montana because it would allow patients, doctors, hospitals and coverage providers to access important medical information immediately."
