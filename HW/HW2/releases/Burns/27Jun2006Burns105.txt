SEN. BURNS CONDEMNS DEFEAT OF FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) condemned the failure of the Senate to pass the Flag Protection Amendment today by a final vote of 34-66. The amendment was introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and had 59 co-sponsors. 
  While the amendment itself does not ban the desecration of the flag, it would allow Congress to prohibit it. 
  The amendment is required because two 5-4 Supreme Court decisions, Texas v. Johnson (1989), which overturned existing law in 48 states and the District of Columbia that protected the flag, and U.S. v. Eichman (1990), which overruled a measure to protect the flag after the Johnson decision which was voted for by ninety-one Senators, including Senator Burns. 
  "It is a shame that we fell a few votes short of protecting the symbol of freedom in the world from those who would desecrate it here at home," Senator Burns said. "This isn't the end of this debate; I'm going to keep fighting until Old Glory is protected from those who would do her harm. Anything less would be a disservice to the brave men and women serving our country overseas in the War on Terror."
