SEN. BURNS DEMANDS EPA INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF ASBESTOS CONTAMINATION AT OLD EXPORT SITE
  Today, Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) called for a thorough, independent investigation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after discovery of asbestos at what had been thought to be a thoroughly remediated area. 
  Senator Burns summoned EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson to his office to detail the ramifications of this unsettling news that an approximately 8 inch layer of vermiculite contaminated with tremolite asbestos found near the surface soil of the Old Export Site. The site was cleaned up by W.R. Grace with supervision by the EPA, which was followed by another cleanup by EPA on the same site, only after it was reported in the press that the site was still contaminated. Discovery of the contaminant was made earlier this week during installation of water and sewer lines at the site.
  Senator Burns said, "The sheer amount of material left behind and the proximity to the surface after this supposed cleanup is outrageous and inexcusable. The EPA has a responsibility to the community of Libby to make sure that their efforts are effective. This recent discovery calls into question the integrity of the entire cleanup process for me, and I want some answers immediately. What makes this even more unconscionable is that the contaminated area is adjacent to the Asbestos Victims Memorial Pavilion."
