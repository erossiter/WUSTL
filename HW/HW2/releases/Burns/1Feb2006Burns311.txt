SEN. BURNS CONGRATULATES GREENSPAN ON LIFETIME OF REMARKABLE SERVICE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today made the following statement as the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve System since 1987, Dr.  
 Alan Greenspan, retired from government service: 
   "Alan Greenspan has masterfully controlled the U.S. economy through rocky times and to unprecedented growth, in the most complex global economic situation in human history. Since August 11, 1987, he's filled a taxing, stressful, critical role in our federal government, and has been an advocate for free markets, capitalism, and budget restraint in bull and bear markets. Greenspan began his singular career in government service in 1974 when he served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Gerald Ford. Since then he's served as Chairman of the National Commission on Social Security Reform, and then for almost 20 years as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. On behalf of the state of Montana, and certainly on behalf of a grateful nation, we owe Alan Greenspan a great debt of gratitude and wish him a happy, healthy retirement."
