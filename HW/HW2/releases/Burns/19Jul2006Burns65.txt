SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES LIBRARY GRANT FOR RONAN
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont) announced today that the United States Department of Education will award the Ronan School District 30 a grant for $284,996 under the Literacy & School Libraries Program. The Ronan School District, which is located on the Flathead Indian Reservation, will receive these funds during a one-year period beginning in September. 
   The Literacy & Schools Library Program is designed to help local education authorities improve reading skills among students through expansion and improvement of school libraries. Outdated books will be replaced, and collections of cultural books will be updated and expanded to include books relevant to Native American issues.
   Significant portions of the grant will be focused on developing a well-equipped and technologically-advanced school library center. Funds from the grant will be used to ensure that the newly-enhanced library will be adequately staffed and will remain open during non-school hours including summer vacations.
   "I strongly support efforts to provide outstanding library facilities at our public high schools and I know the children in Ronan will benefit from this federal funding," said Senator Burns.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which funds the U.S. Department of Education.
