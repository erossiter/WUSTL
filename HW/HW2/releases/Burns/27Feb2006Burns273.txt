SEN. BURNS TO INVESTIGATE UAE PORT PROPOSAL IN COMMERCE COMMITTEE HEARING ON FEB. 28
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) will participate Tuesday in a full Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the Security of Terminal Operations at U.S. Ports. The hearing is being held to investigate the proposed transfer of management of six U.S. ports to Dubai Ports World (DP World) from P&O Port Management, a British company.  
   Senator Burns will be asking direct questions to Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Michael P. Jackson, Ed Bilkey, C.O.O. of DP World, Chris Koch, President and CEO of the World Shipping Council, and two port employee union representatives. The hearing will examine the role of the U.S. government in port security, foreign management of different aspects of port operations, and whether this transfer has an impact on port security. 
   Senator Burns said, "After the news of this proposed sale became public, I called for immediate and full congressional hearings. I'm looking forward to learning more tomorrow about this proposal and how it could effect our national security. Montana does not have any ports, but our economy relies heavily on products coming in and out of our ports. The security at our ports has a ripple effect on the safety and security of Montana. We must ensure the security of these ports will not be jeopardized by foreign management in a post 9/11 world." 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and three-term U.S. Senator.
