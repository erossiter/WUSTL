SEN. BURNS TO HOST ANNUAL WOMEN'S CONFERENCE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) will hold his annual Women's Conference this year on August 8 from 7:30am to 4:00pm at the University of Montana in Missoula.  
   "I am proud of the great success we have seen in the years since I began hosting these great events," said Burns. "Through these events, we are able to bring together a number of very talented women, and I am happy to help facilitate such valuable exchanges every year. This year we have a great panel lined up, and I hope to see you in Missoula." 
   The keynote speaker of this year's Women's Conference is Liz Murray. The child of drug abusers, Liz Murray was homeless at the age of 15. Determined not to be defined by her circumstances, she recognized education as the key to a new beginning. In two years she received her high school degree and earned a scholarship to Harvard that would change her life forever. Author of the inspirational memoir Breaking Night, her story was captured on Lifetime's Emmy-nominated Homeless to Harvard. 
   Additional workshop speakers include: Ladonna Lee, Director of Public Affairs Group at Foley & Lardner, a national business law firm; Laurie Richards, founder of Laurie Richards & Associates, Inc., and author of the popular Speaking Without Fear, and Making Meetings Produce; Regina Forte, an active participant in numerous financial trade organizations and professional women's organizations, both locally and nationally, and contributing author to the financial guide book Making Your Money Last; Matt Maxwell, M.D., FACS, a cardiac surgeon and Director of Cardiovascular Services at the International Heart Institute, a division of St. Patrick Hospital, and Captain in the Navy Reserves.
