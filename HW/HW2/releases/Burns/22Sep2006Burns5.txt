SEN. BURNS, REP. REHBERG ISSUE STATEMENT ON CALIFORNIA 'ROADLESS RULE' DECISION
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) and Rep. Denny Rehberg (R - Mont.) issued the following statement regarding Wednesday's ruling by San Francisco-based U.S. District Court Judge Elizabeth Laporte's decision regarding the "Roadless petition plan": 
  Senator Burns said, "I believe this decision is an extraordinary overreach by a District Court. This is one decision which ignores previous decisions by District Courts in Alaska, Idaho, Wyoming, and the 10 District Courts of Appeal that upheld the Wyoming District Court's decision to enjoin the Clinton Roadless Rule. I hope this decision is overturned or limited in appeal. The effect of this decision could grind all federal land management to a complete halt by requiring a massive national cumulative effects analysis. I deeply oppose this decision and will work with Western Senators and the administration to determine what to do next."
  Representative Rehberg said, "This is a matter of access for Montanans and people that enjoy public lands throughout America. I'm going to lean on the President to vigorously defend the public's right to access on public lands. Forest managers need to have all the tools necessary at their disposal to maintain healthy forests that can be enjoyed by everyone. We're seeing a dangerous trend of access to public lands being blocked or threatened and that practice needs to end immediately. Conrad and I have worked together many times in the past to oppose plans that limit access and we're not going to stop now. I refuse to see this part of Montana's heritage threatened."
  Senator Burns is Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and Congressman Rehberg is a member of the House Appropriations Committee.
