SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS TO SUPPORT MONTANA FIRE STATIONS
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced today that two Montana fire departments, the Kalispell Fire Department and the Chester Volunteer Fire Department, have been named the recipient of funds from the Department of Homeland Security's 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 The two stations have been awarded $21,420 and $13,095, respectively. 
   "I'm happy to see these funds designated for Montana," said Burns. "Boosting the functionality of our fire departments is critical to domestic security and I'm proud to know that our President and Secretary Ridge are steadfast in that endeavor," he continued. "To the people of Montana this means our fire departments will go through upgrades to improve their effectiveness. This funding goes towards the purchase of new equipment, bettering the health of our firefighters, enhancing Emergency Medical Service programs, and strengthening support safety and prevention plans." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of all current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
