SEN. BURNS SECURES FUNDING FOR DALY MANSION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today he included an important project for Hamilton in an Appropriations bill that will move through Committee this week. 
   This project is advancing toward federal funding in the fiscal year 2007 Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations bill.
   Senator Burns has secured major funding for Daly Mansion restoration project, which is upgrading this facility to be a year-round facility offering tours, exhibits, cultural programs, and community events. The restoration provides an economic impact in the Hamilton community, in the hiring of carpenters, electricians, engineers, architects, and other workers to complete this project. The Daly Mansion exists for children and adults to be able to visit and participate in activities and programs for cultural education and historical preservation. This project also received major federal funding in 2003 and 2004.
   "I know the Daly Mansion offers important programs and cultural educational opportunities for Hamilton and I fully support their restoration efforts," said Senator Burns.
   "Obviously, we are ecstatic to have this funding, because we have never had funding for the grounds," said Kim Morris, Executive Director of the Daly Mansion.
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, House and Urban Development or TTHUD, which funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
