SEN. BURNS DISAPPOINTED TAX PACKAGE DID NOT PASS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement regarding Thursday night's failed vote to advance the Family Prosperity Act: 
   "I was disappointed that the tax package did not pass before the August break. I thought it was a good compromise. This did not pass Thursday night and was blocked but those folks who really believe in the government can do more with taxpayer's money than the taxpayers. We have a strong economy because of a visionary tax package of 2001 and I would like to see that continue. The unemployment rate nationally is 4.8% and here in Montana is 3.8%. I think that is progress.
   "Here is what was blocked last night by a filibuster: tuition deduction for families, work opportunity tax credit and welfare to work to keep Montana working, deductions for teacher classroom expenses, Brownfield Remediation for our environment, Indian employment tax credit and accelerated depreciation on Indian reservations to spur economic development. It also would have deeply cut the Death tax.
   "It was a good package and I will fight for it when we return in September."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce and Small Business Committees and a former small business owner.
