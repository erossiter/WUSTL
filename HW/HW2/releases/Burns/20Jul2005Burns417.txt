SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS
  "I voice my support for John C. Roberts as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  
 Judge Roberts is a scholar of law, and has shown in his career to be a protector of the Constitution and a defender of individual rights. It is important to ensure we have justices on the bench who understand it is their job to interpret the law, not create it and I feel Judge Roberts has shown a clear understanding of both our judicial system and the Constitution it uses as a roadmap. I look forward to a hearty debate, and rapid confirmation in the Senate."
