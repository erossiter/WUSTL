SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY BENTSEN
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today issued the following statement on the news that former Senator, Treasury Secretary and 1988 Vice Presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen died today at the age of 85 at his Houston home: 
  "I served my first four years in the Senate with Lloyd Bentsen and worked with him many years after that. He was a good man and a friend. He was a lion in the Senate when I came here, especially revered for expertise in tax, trade and economic issues. That rare knowledge and experience made him a logical choice as President Clinton's first Treasury Secretary, the pinnacle in government on those issues. He served admirably throughout government, giving much of his life to public service, to America and for Texas. I wish Beryl Ann, and the children and grandchildren the best in this difficult time. Lloyd will be dearly missed and duly remembered."
  Senator Burns served in the United States Senate with Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) from 1989-1993 and they remained friends throughout the rest of Senator Bentsen's life and career.
