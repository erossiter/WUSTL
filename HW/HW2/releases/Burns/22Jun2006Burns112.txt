SEN. BURNS AMENDMENT SAVES MISSILES
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) successfully won passage of an amendment to delay a Defense Department (DOD) plan to cut our intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force by 50 missiles, as S. 2766, the Defense Authorization bill, passed in the Senate 96-0. 
  The Burns-Conrad amendment makes it the policy of the United States that the 500 ICBMs that the United States possesses in the three missile states (Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana) may not be decreased to 450 for this year. It also requires the U.S. Air Force to complete a report for the Congress justifying the need for decreasing the missile level as part of our strategic defense posture.
  Earlier this year the DoD produced a recommendation as part of their Quadrennial Defense Review to reduce the ICBM force by 50 missiles. The DoD intends to reduce the force by eliminating one squadron at Malmstrom AFB near Great Falls, Montana.
  "We were successful in delaying this unwise decision by one year and requiring DoD to better explain why this is needed," said Senator Burns. "From the beginning we felt that this proposal was more about cutting the budget than revising our strategic policy. At a time when we are focused on fighting terrorism and securing our nation I think it is more important to secure these missiles than to start eliminating them."
  The Burns-Conrad amendment also includes $5 million for the Remote Visual Assessment program (RVA) which will put security systems at missile silos.
  Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees.
