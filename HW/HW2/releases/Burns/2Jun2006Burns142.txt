SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MAJOR MONTANA CONSERVATION GRANTS FROM INTERIOR BILL
  Sen. Burns, Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced that the U.S. Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service will award major grants to private landowners and groups in Montana through their Private Stewardship Grants program. The funding, which was included by Chairman Burns in the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill, is intended for use by the groups to "undertake conservation projects on their land for endangered, threatened and other at-risk species." 
  The Montana awards under this federal initiative are the following projects:
   * The Arctic Grayling Recovery Program in Beaverhead County will receive $22,050 to work with a private landowner to restore riparian habitat in an important spawning reach for the riverine form of the arctic grayling, a candidate species for Endangered Species Act protection. 
   * The Kootenai River Network, Inc. will receive $100,000 to work with partners in Lincoln County to restore the lower mainstem of Grave Creek, which is an important spawning reach for the threatened bull trout. The project includes restoration of proper stream cross-sectional dimensions and revegetating over a mile of riparian floodplain. 
   * The Nature Conservancy will receive two grants for separate purposes. 
   * They will receive $40,626 to minimize conflicts between grizzly bears and livestock in Teton County by providing alternate water sources for livestock and fencing them away from a wetland that is used as a bedding area and travel corridor by the bears. Livestock exclusion will also benefit several sensitive plant species from livestock trampling during the growing season. 
   * They will also receive $88,841 to partner with private landowners in North Dakota and Montana to boost the reproductive success of endangered piping plover by removing man-made structures that provide hiding places for mammalian predators. The targeted alkaline lake region in Sheridan County and seven counties in North Dakota are important breeding areas for piping plovers. 
  Chairman Burns said, "These are important non-regulatory Montana conservation projects and I am glad we were able to fund them in my Interior bill. I support recovery and restoration programs that link private organizations with local folks on much-needed conservation projects, especially when there's a private match for part of the funding. Montana's fish and wildlife are part of what makes our state so beautiful and special, and projects such as these realize that fact."
  For this program, each of the Fish and Wildlife Service's grant awards required a minimum of a ten percent match in non-federal dollars or in-kind contributions.
  Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Matt Hogan said, "The Private Stewardships Program helps conservationists build new partnerships and strengthen existing ones to benefit wildlife conservation."
  Senator Burns is the Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the budget of the U.S. Department of the Interior.
