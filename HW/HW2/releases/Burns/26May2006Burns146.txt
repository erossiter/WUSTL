SEN. BURNS: CIA MUST ENACT REFORM
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement following the 78-15 vote in confirmation of General Michael Hayden to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency: 
  "With his experience and leadership, Gen. Hayden is an excellent candidate to enact proactive reform within the intelligence community. Our intelligence agencies have a difficult challenge in the world right now, but must continue transforming to target new threats.
  "There are some folks at Langley who still think the Cold War is going on. We need to change that and look ahead to address new threats. My colleagues and I in the Senate take our oversight responsibilities seriously. I will continue to ensure that effective transformation of the intelligence community moves forward."
  Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
