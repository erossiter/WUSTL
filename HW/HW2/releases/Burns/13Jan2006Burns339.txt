SEN. BURNS PRAISES PROGRESS IN RE-OPENING SOUTH KOREAN MARKET FOR U.S. BEEF
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) is pleased the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced today that the U.S. and South Korea have agreed to an initial import protocol, which will allow the exportation of beef to resume in late March 2006.  
 The Korean market is the third largest in the world for U.S. beef exports. 
   Senator Burns said, "After Japan finally ended its beef embargo, I expected other Pacific Rim countries wouldn't be far behind. These markets are essential for Montana cattle producers, and I've worked hard to lobby the administration on this urgent need. This is a good first step, but we need to fully open this market, along with China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand. American agriculture is our most important industry, feeding not just Americans but the entire world. Montana produces the highest quality and the safest beef in the world and it's time these markets are available to export. I'll continue to work hard for this." 
   The initial agreement will allow about 50% of U.S. beef exports to the Korean market, specifically boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months of age, and the U.S. government will continue to push Korea, Japan, and other trading partners to fully resume beef trade. 
   Korea prohibited imports of U.S. beef since December 2003 after Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) was found in a Canadian-born cow in Washington state. Before the ban, the U.S. exported $815 million in beef products to Korea.
