SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS CONFERENCE AGREEMENT ON TAX RELIEF
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today released the following statement on the House-Senate Conference agreement on the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005: 
  "Montana is benefiting everyday from the pro-growth, low tax policies that we have implemented. Yesterday's agreement between the House and Senate conferees to extend capital gains and alternative minimum tax relief is welcome news that will continue driving our economy to expansion and job creation. Our policies at the federal level have helped create 5.3 million new jobs since 2003 and an economy with a steady 4.7% unemployment nationally. In Montana, unemployment is only 3.4%, with some counties as low as 2%. My vision for the economy going forward is passing small business health plans to expand health care coverage and affordability, continuing to support alternative fuel research which will directly benefit Montana and killing the 'death tax'."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce and Small Business Committees and has never voted for a tax increase in his career.
