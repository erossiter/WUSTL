SEN. BURNS SECURES FUNDING TO IMPROVE TELEHEALTH IN MISSOULA, THROUGHOUT MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced today that, through his position as the only Member of the Montana Senate Delegation who is a Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he has secured $500,000 for St. Patrick's Hospital in Missoula to advance telehealth and cardiac care. 
   St. Patrick Hospital seeks to establish a telehealth network to provide local hospitals and rural physicians access to advanced levels of cardiac care throughout the region. This system will reduce health care and transportation costs for rural residents, and provide needed support to small struggling rural hospitals. The grant will be used to purchase an electronic medical record system to integrate patient records throughout the region and to enable all health care providers to have access to patient information. 
   The impacted communities are:
   * Missoula
   * Plains
   * Polson
   * Hamilton
   * Frenchtown
   * Helena
   * Deer Lodge
   * Butte
   * Dillon
   * Shelby
   * Great Falls
   * Stevensville
   * Florence
   * Lolo
   * Steeley Lake
   * Salish-Kootenai Tribal Health
   * Choteau
   * Anaconda
   Senator Burns said, "Telehealth is so important to Montanans because of how rural we are. The ability to consult with an expert without having to travel hundreds of miles will save time and money for Montanans. As telehealth spreads, the quality of life and access to health care for all Montana will increase. What St. Patrick's is going to create with this funding is a big, important step in that direction."
