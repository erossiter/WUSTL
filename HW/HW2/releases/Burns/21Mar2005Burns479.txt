SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MILLIONS FOR FORT PECK, KALISPELL
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced two Department of Transportation grants for Fort Peck Access Roads and the Kalispell Bypass project.  
 Fort Peck Reservoir Fishing Access Roads, including Hell Creek and Devil's Creek Roads in Garfield County, Valentine Road in Fergus County, Willow Creek Road in Valley County, Dovetail/Valentine Road in Petroleum County, Regina Road Scenic Loop in Phillips County, and South Fork Rock Creek and North Fork Rock Creek Roads in McCone County, will receive $3,127,938 for rehabilitation of roadways with crushed gravel. In addition, $1,984,000 will go to rehabilitation of the Kalispell Bypass. 
   "In a state like ours, our transportation systems are the arteries that keep the blood flowing," said Burns. When our roads are in bad condition it impacts the entire state, and we must work to make sure we get the funding out where it needs to go to make sure that's not the case. This type of funding works to keep our roadways and transportations systems up to par, and I am glad to see this funding come through for Fort Peck and Kalispell today." 
   Senator Burns is a member of the Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, HUD Subcommittee under the Senate Appropriations Committee.
