SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLING TO 4.6 PERCENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns today issued the following statement following the release of new national unemployment statistics by the U.S. Department of Labor: 
  "We've received more good news with the national unemployment rate falling to 4.6 percent, the lowest since July 2001. We created 75,000 new jobs in May and that makes 5.2 million new jobs since August 2003. In Montana, our statewide unemployment rate is 3.4 percent. Our federal policies of supporting low taxes, economic development, less regulation, and free market principles are generating strength across this economy. In June we need to finally kill the Death Tax to remove this double tax on family farms, small businesses and families across Montana."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
