SEN. BURNS: TIME FOR SANCTIONS HAS COME
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following upon the introduction Wednesday of legislation to punish Japan for its unnecessary delay of re-importation of American beef: 
  "I am fed up with these delays, and I think most cattle producers feel the same way. Japan continues to invent new hoops for our negotiators to jump through, and now I understand Korea is slamming on the brakes as well. The endless hearings and audits and reviews need to stop - they are nothing but delay tactics. Our beef is the safest in the world. There is no reason for Japan to continue its beef embargo. Unfortunately, I am beginning to think that the time for negotiations is coming to an end. I am not a fan of sanctions, but the continued stalling on the part of the Japanese shows no sign of ending. Unless meaningful progress - an actual date for resumption of trade - is made soon, I believe that the Senate must act to register its frustration and this legislation sends a clear message that this delaying will not be tolerated."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
