SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS TAIWAN'S MOVE TO RESUME BEEF TRADE WITH U.S.
 "Today's announcement is great news," said Burns. "I'm glad to see another important market resume trade with the United States.  
 Once the Taiwan market is officially opened again, we'll begin to see more revenue flow into our state-something I always like to see. Montana ranchers consistently produce the kind of high-quality beef that makes U.S. exports so valuable, and I am pleased to see more markets open to them." 
   Before the ban is officially lifted, a group of Taiwan experts will travel to the United States for visits beginning November 10. These visits will entail on-site inspections of the major features and implementation of the U.S. BSE measures. In 2003, Taiwan's purchases of beef and ruminant products amounted to some $325 million. 
   "We are very pleased with this progress in yet another important beef market," Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said. "We are continuing our market opening efforts in the remaining key countries. Our goal is a return to normal beef trade as quickly as possible."
