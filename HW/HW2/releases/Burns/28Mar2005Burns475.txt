SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANT FOR LINCOLN, FLATHEAD, LAKE COUNTIES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today a Department of Labor "Workforce Investment Act" grant for displaced timber workers in Lincoln, Flathead and Lake Counties.  
 The grant includes an initial award of $187,653 with funding approved up to $500,410. 
   This project will provide an array of services such as assessment, individual counseling, career planning, employment development, and occupational and job-readiness training. Supportive services may include transportation assistance, child care and job related certifications, uniforms and equipment. 
   "It's been a trying few months for too many folks in Lincoln, Lake and Flathead Counties, but it looks like things are about to get a bit better," said Burns. "This money will go to help Montanans transition from one line of work to another by adding to job training, opening up adult education, helping with child care and so on. These folks have been put into a difficult place and this award is a much welcome example of a good program going to good people. It's a good first step, and I'll continue doing everything I can to make sure small mills like Owens & Hurst don't ever face this kind of struggle again."
