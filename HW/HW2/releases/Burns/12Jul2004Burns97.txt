SEN. BURNS SIGNS ONTO BILL SUPPORTING FIREARMS INDUSTRY, GUN SAFETY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) voiced his support today of a new bill that promotes the purchase of gun safes for the storage of firearms in privately owned homes.  
 Entitled the "Child Protection and Home Safety Act of 2004", the legislation endorses the American tradition of prudent gun ownership while stressing the importance of safety as well. 
   "In Montana, we have a strong belief in the principles of individual freedom and responsibility, especially when it comes to gun ownership, and this bill offers incentives that will keep our children and our homes safe at the same time," said Burns. "It's a real-world solution to a real-world problem, and I'm happy to offer it my full support." 
   Among the provisions included in the act is a $250 tax credit for this year and beyond for the purchase of a gun safe, with the tax credit rolling forward if not used for up to three years. It also disallows the creation of a database identifying gun owners from tax returns on which the credit is claimed. 
   In a discussion of Senator Burns' commitment to the bill, Ernie Huether, president of Guns N Things L.L.C. of Glendive said, "By more easily being able to justify the costs of today's gun safes, the average person can better protect their firearms from theft and fire, which will keep stolen guns off the street and help reduce the increases in insurance premiums that result from the loss. This is great news for Montana and the country alike, and I thank Senator Burns for his effort to keep Montana's people out of harms way."
