  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that the Jordan Volunteer Fire Department will soon be the recipient of $105,732 from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Award Program.  
 These funds will go towards the improvement of the fire department's current fire operations and fire fighter safety systems. 
   "Montana has come to know the value of increased support for our state's firefighters," said Burns. "These folks put their lives on the line, day in and day out, to ensure the safety of Montana's people and property. I'm happy to see this funding designated to the Jordan Volunteer Fire Department, and will work hard in Washington D.C. to make sure more funding like it continues to come our way."
