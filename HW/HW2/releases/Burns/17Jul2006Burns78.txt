SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES MAJOR HOUSING GRANT FOR NORTHERN CHEYENNE RESERVATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will award a $2.8 million grant to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in southeastern Montana. This federal grant is an Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG), which is awarded annually after a rigorous application process. 
  "Ownership is the cornerstone of America, and well-built, affordable housing brings personal investment in our communities," said Senator Burns. "There's something special about owning your own home. It provides an incentive to improve the land you own and the neighborhood you live in, so that your family can grow up in a happy, safe environment. Whether tribal or non-tribal, Montanans should be given every opportunity to own a home, and these funds help make that a reality."
  The IHBG Program was created under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) of 1996. This program is designed to serve the needs of federally-recognized Indian tribes and tribally-designated housing entities.
  The grant has wide reaching potential, since the funds can be used for a variety of projects related to housing needs on the Reservation. The grant can be divided up to fund housing development, housing management for low-income families, or crime prevention and safety.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, House and Urban Development (TTHUD), which funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
