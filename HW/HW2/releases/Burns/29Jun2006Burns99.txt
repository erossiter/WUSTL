SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON VA LAPTOP RECOVERY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement regarding news that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has retrieved a laptop that was stolen in May 2006 and might have revealed sensitive personal information of millions of veterans: 
  "I am relieved about the recovery of the extremely valuable laptop. I remain hopeful that we can confirm that the information on my fellow veterans was not compromised. The FBI has said they have no evidence that the data has been accessed.
  "This was an important wake-up call for all of our federal agencies. I am very disappointed and worried that this incident occurred in the first place. I will continue to push the VA and all federal agencies with access to personal information to take significant steps to protect that private data. I am pleased with the steps the VA has taken to aggressively respond to this incident. Going forward I urge my fellow veterans to remain vigilant and utilize the resources available to monitor their personal information."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees and served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957.
