STIMSON EMPLOYEES CLEARED TO APPLY FOR EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Conrad Burns today announced the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration has certified workers laid off from Stimson Lumber Company's Bonner Mill for eligibility to apply for up to 24 months of assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, including retraining and re-employment funds.  
   "These folks at Stimson need as much help as we can give them," said Burns. "It's a terrible loss, and they deserve the support of the federal government. I'm relieved the Department of Labor agreed to provide the assistance for the displaced workers. We'll continue to work with them to ensure they get back on their feet while we work to resolve these softwood problems between our nation and our friends to the north." 
   Burns wrote a letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao last month requesting the Stimson workers be treated fairly and equitably in light of the layoffs that will take effect on October 3. The favorable decision by the Department of Labor releases trade assistance funds, as the Bonner Mill is being closed due to the depressed plywood market.
