SEN. BURNS SUPPORTS COAL TO LIQUID FUEL BILL
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) joined Sens. Jim Bunning (R - KY) and Kit Bond (R - MO) at a press conference to advocate for S. 3325, the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006. 
  This bi-partisan bill will create tax incentives for coal-to-liquid (CTL) technology and the construction of CTL plants, making CTL a viable energy resource if passed.
  "This legislation gives us independence from foreign sources of fuel, it ensures that our national security and that our military will have the fuel they need and also tax credits," said Senator Burns.
  The legislation is expected to be considered in a hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which Senator Burns is a member, in the coming weeks.
  Specifically, this legislation will expand the 20% tax credit for CTL plants (including the infrastructure needed to capture, transport and sequester carbon) capped at $200 million per plant and limited to 10 plants. It will also provide a similar provision for expensing these investments, but does not allow double dipping. Additionally, it will extend the fuel tax credit for CTL products from 2009 until January 1, 2020.
  If we use coal effectively, "We can make a cleaner diesel than we can from petroleum," said Senator Burns. "I think what we are looking for is something that will help the environment and still power the economy of this country." Montana has the largest coal reserves of any state in the country.
  Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
