2007 FARM BILL - PRESERVING AND PROTECTING AGRICULTURE FOR NEXT GENERATION
  As we begin the groundwork for the 2007 Farm Bill, I've had a chance to travel across Montana and speak with producers first-hand about ways to strengthen and improve our support for the folks that feed our nation. There are eight major points of importance I see must be addressed whether we create a new farm bill, or extend the current one:
  * Agriculture must be a part of our Nation's energy independence: As fuel prices rise, the potential for energy production from Montana's farms and ranches remains largely untapped. The 2007 Farm Bill must include a robust energy title, including incentives for infrastructure development, crop insurance for energy crops, and increased research & development for cellulosic ethanol. With input costs skyrocketing, biofuels have the potential to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and keep more dollars on the farm. 
  ? 
  * We need incentives for our young farmers and ranchers: The next Farm Bill must be written with an eye towards the future. Young and beginning producers must be able to make a living in agriculture, and that means tearing down barriers to success and providing responsible incentives, like long-term, low-interest rate loans and accelerated depreciation for equipment. Reforming tax laws and CRP is critical to providing opportunities to young producers.
   * Our livestock markets must have competition: Montana producers deserve fairness and transparency, which means that the competition provisions of the next Farm Bill deserve a careful look. Enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act is a priority, as is defending mandatory Country of Origin Labeling against efforts to weaken or repeal it. We must aggressively defend and develop international markets for our products. 
   * The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) must be reformed: Montana's small towns have been devastated by the unintended consequences of land retirement. The 2007 Farm Bill must take a serious look at the Conservation Reserve Program, including the impact of CRP on beginning producers. Senator Burns will continue to advocate for a 25% per farm limitation on CRP acres. As land comes out of CRP, a responsible method for restoring the base on those lands will be needed. 
   * The role of the Working Lands program must be strengthened: We all share the values of open spaces and preservation of our environment, but producers know that conservation can coexist with working lands. Montana producers are the best stewards of their land, and want to see historical land uses preserved. The next Farm Bill should include an expansion of these concepts, including an improved Conservation Security Program. More flexibility in Natural Resource Conservation Service programs is needed as well as simple and streamlined regulations. 
   * Our transportation networks should help, not hinder our producers' competitiveness: Agriculture relies on effective transportation to compete in a global market. Montana, like many rural areas is captive to just one railroad, and that lack of competition for rates and service reduces profitability. We pay some of the highest rail rates in the nation, and it is time for producers to get some relief. Common sense rail reform is necessary for a comprehensive farm agenda.
   * Commodity programs must benefit all program crops: The current Farm Bill includes a three-pronged approach to commodity programs - direct payments, counter-cyclical, and loan deficiency payments. Montana producers generally only receive direct payments, which places wheat and barley producers at a serious disadvantage. The safety net that was intended to help producers just isn't working in Montana. The next Farm Bill must reevaluate the structure of commodity programs, to ensure that all program crops benefit.
   * Expand available risk management tools: After years of drought, Montana producers know how important it is to have a comprehensive strategy to manage risk on the farm for years; producers have been subject to the whims of ad hoc disaster payments, providing little certainty. The next Farm Bill debate should explore a permanent disaster program that is funded through the regular budget process. In addition, the 2007 Farm Bill should build on the successes of crop insurance reform, and continue to provide producers new and innovative tools to manage risk. 
  With a Farm Bill reauthorization on the horizon, a lot of folks are nervous about what the debate could hold for their way of life. World Trade Organization trade talks could reform global agriculture trade, budget pressures are squeezing limited federal resources, and more and more Americans have lost touch with where their food comes from. Given these circumstances, many producers feel like Congress could yank the safety net that the Farm Bill provides right out from under them. 
  In Montana, there are some important agriculture issues that need to be addressed. Many producers feel like counter-cyclical payments and loan deficiency payments just don't work for them. Conservation programs like the conservation reserve program and the conservation security program are loved by some and hated by some. The growing desire for energy independence holds great potential for agriculture, but biofuels development will require large capital investments. 
  As we continue the debate and construction of a new farm bill, I will work with my Montana producers, and farmers and ranchers across the nation to construct legislation that will not only benefit those that feed our country, but all of our citizens; from the gas pump to the grocery line.
