SEN. BURNS MARSHALS SUPPORT OF 33 SENATORS TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) secured the signatures of 33 Senators for a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to support increased funding for the Procurement Technical Assistance Program (PTAP). 
  The effort, led by Senator Burns and joined by 33 other Senators, supports funding PTAP for $28,400,000, an increase of $8,600,000 from the FY07 budget request and $1,300,000 from the FY06 funding level. There are currently 93 Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs), with over 250 local offices nationwide, available for small businesses to use as a resource in bidding for Defense and other federal agency contracts. PTACs hold over 220,000 counseling sessions annually, with nearly 55,000 active clients. 
  Senator Burns said, "I am very pleased that 33 of my colleagues have agreed to sign my letter of support for these procurement centers. These centers are a huge benefit to our small businesses in Montana. For every dollar we spend to support the center, six dollars of federal contracts come back to Montana, and our small businesses.
  "Small businesses are the heart of our economy and connecting small businesses to federal contracts is a great way to bring jobs into Montana."
  Senator Burns is a Senior Member of the Senate Small Business Committee and the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee.
