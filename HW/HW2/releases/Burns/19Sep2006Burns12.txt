SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES NORTHERN BORDER AIR WING EVENT OCT. 16
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced he has worked with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to hold a formal dedication ceremony in Great Falls for the Northern Border Air Wing on October 16. On that date, Sen. Burns and other federal officials will join state officials and members of the law enforcement community for the Air Wing to demonstrate their operations and capabilities now that they are fully operational. 
  "I have been in constant contact with CBP officials and the Great Falls community at every step of this process," said Senator Burns. "We've worked hard to bring the Air Wing to Great Falls, working with the federal government to bring the assets to the airport, bringing these jobs to this community, and improving our northern border security against terrorists, immigration and narcotics. The event on October 16 will be an opportunity for Great Falls to see how our efforts have paid off."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and with his position he was able to secure $18.3 million for the facility in fiscal year 2006 and has $6.4 million set for 2007 in the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations bill. This facility is expected to bring more than 60 jobs to Great Falls.
  With this facility, CBP will provide a 24/7 rapid response capability along the entire northern border with Montana shares with Canada.
