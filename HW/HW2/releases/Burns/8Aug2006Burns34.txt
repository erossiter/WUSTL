SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES STAFF OUTREACH IN TOWNSEND
 Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced that his Helena Field Representative, Sharlene Snoddy, will hold community outreach hours in Townsend on Tuesday, August 15 from 2 - 4pm at the Community Library at 201 Spruce Street. She will be available to meet with anyone who has a problem with a federal agency or questions or comments regarding issues before Congress. 
   Senator Burns said, "With all the distances we have to travel in our state, I like to have my staff visit communities to save folks the trip to our Helena field office. Please take a moment to stop by and visit with Sharlene if you have comments or questions, and feel we might be able to assist you. Sharlene will let me know what's on your mind and we'll do what we can to help out."
   If you have any questions, please feel free to call Sharlene Snoddy at (406) 449-5403 or (800) 344-1513.
