SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TWO MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) today announced the allocation of funds to two local Montana fire departments by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 White Sulphur Springs Volunteer Fire Department will receive $40,050 and the Bearcreek Volunteer Fire Department will receive $14,175. Both fire departments will use the funding for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to fire stations and facilities. 
   "This money could not go to a more deserving group of people," said Burns. "With six years of drought and another difficult year ahead, Montana firefighters have stuck their necks out for our safety and they need all the support we can give them. This money will help improve the success of firefighting operations, firefighter safety and health as they combat the blazing wildfire season in and outside of town." 
   The costs of the funded projects are shared at a percentage based on the population of their respective jurisdictions. Grantees that serve jurisdictions of 50,000 or fewer, as in both White Sulphur Springs and Bearcreek, must provide a non-Federal cost-share of 10%. 
   Tim Ryan is Fire Chief for the Bearcreek VFD. "This is great news. We'll be able to get safe and modern equipment for our firefighters, including turnout gear, wildland fire equipment, and radios. This will really help us do our job with more safety and efficiency."
