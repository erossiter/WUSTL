WHAT SAVED MALMSTROM?
  In 1995, Malmstrom Air Force Base, and Montana were dealt a serious blow as the Base Realignment And Closure Commission (BRAC) took away the KC-135 Refueling Mission and sent it to MacDill Air Force Base in Florida. Sen.  
 Conrad Burns, just into his second term as Montana's junior Senator made a conscious decision to position Montana's military infrastructure so it was viable well into the future. 
   Having been brought on to the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee in 1992, Burns used his position and influence to direct millions of dollars in federal funding to improvements in Montana's military facilities. Burns was a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, and was Chairman of that committee from 1995 to 1999. 
   "It was a rough time watching that runway shut down," said Burns. "I knew we had to make a concerted effort to bring our facilities into the 21st Century to better ensure their survival. I started regular conversations with the leadership at Malmstrom and at the Montana Guard to figure out what we needed to do to protect our military installations in the state." 
   Over the next ten years, Senator Burns coordinated with military and community leaders in Montana to bring nearly $300 Million in appropriated federal funds back to Montana's armed forces. 
   While a flurry of recent meetings and press conferences with politicians and Pentagon officials have been in the spotlight, Burns noted "We've been working on this for ten years, not ten days, to ensure Malmstrom and our Guard facilities had adapted to changing defense needs."
