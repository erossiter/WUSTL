SEN. BURNS DEMANDS TIGHTER BORDER SECURITY
  Speaks on the Senate Floor Regarding Homeland Security Bill 
   "I have said it before and will say it again: we must secure our northern border," said Burns.  
 "The northern border has historically been understaffed, under-funded and overlooked, even after the attacks of September 11, 2001. My state of Montana is faced with the task of patrolling the longest stretch of unprotected international border in the United States. More than 500 million people cross our borders each year, 330 million of which are not U.S. citizens, which begs us to ask the question: Where do these people go? The Homeland Security Committee has recognized that we can no longer allow for gaps such as this in our national security and through this bill it has taken the proper steps to ensure that we have a plan in place to secure our borders. This issue is too important to ignore any longer, and it is my hope that we can get this bill passed with the proper plan in place to secure our borders."
