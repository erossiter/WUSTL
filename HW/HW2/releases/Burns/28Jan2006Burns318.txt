SEN. BURNS TO HOLD LIBBY VIDEOCONFERENCE
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) will meet with Libby residents Saturday to listen to their concerns as asbestos legislation moves forward in the U.S. Senate.  
 The videoconference will be held at the Flathead Valley Community College's Libby campus in room 214 from 12-1pm (MST). 
   Asbestos reform has been slated for consideration the first week of February in the Senate, and Senator Burns has vowed to make sure Libby is covered in any reform package, specifically through addition of the diffusion capacity test (DLCO), which would include 40% more Libby residents who've been affected by asbestos-related diseases than the current language provides. 
   Senator Burns said, "In order to support the bill, I need every assurance that the folks in Libby who are truly sick receive every consideration that this legislation can provide. We need a real Libby fix, a fair Libby fix. Libby's an isolated case and I challenge anyone to find a similar circumstance anywhere else in this country. I want to hear directly from Libby residents tomorrow, and throughout the debate on this legislation, and I want to share with them what I'm hearing in Washington. Most importantly, I want to tell them directly I will continue to fight for them."
