SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR OIL REPLACEMENT RESEARCH
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced Peaks and Prairies, LLC, a contracting company in Malta, MT, will receive a $250,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant to research Eco-Oil, a synthetic product believed to be superior to oil. The grant will fund the Peaks and Prairies' proposal to optimize the formulation and complete the research and development of Eco-Oil. 
  Initial tests of the Eco-Oil formula proved beneficial and yielded positive results. Fuel mileage increased 3-5% during early testing and horsepower increased an estimated 4-5 base points. Finally, a 60-80% reduction of nitrous oxides emissions created further benefit.
  Senator Burs said today, "The United States needs more projects like this. Synthetic fuels reduce the reliance on foreign oil and may be superior in quality. Montanans spend a lot of time driving around our big state and they will certainly benefit from this research."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations and Energy Committees.
