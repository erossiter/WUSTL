SEN. BURNS REACTS TO AGAUS LETTER TO BRAC COMMISSION
  Sen. Conrad Burns today reacted to the letter the Adjutants General Association of the United States (AGAUS) sent to Anthony Principi, Chairman of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) regarding the AGAUS meeting on Friday, June 22, 2005.  
   "I wholeheartedly concur with the letter to Chairman Principi from the Adjutants General Association of the United States," said Burns. "When the Department of Defense released their recommendations, many of us involved with the military on a day by day basis felt their Air National Guard proposals were flawed. Recently, legal counsel for the BRAC commission echoed those feelings. Nobody is in a better position to deal with operational decisions than the professionals who work with the Air National Guard on a daily basis. These leaders understand what the impact the recommendations, if enacted, would have on their Guard personnel, their families, as well as the states affected. It is my hope that Chairman Principi and the rest of the BRAC Commission will not follow the proposed actions that the DoD has recommended, but instead they'll work with the Adjutants Generals and the Air Force for the best possible outcome for all involved."
