SEN. BURNS SPONSORS EFFORT TO INCREASE COAL TO LIQUID USE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) sponsored language in the Defense Appropriations Bill that will direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition to research the use of synthetic fuel for defense applications. The Defense Appropriations bill passed the full committee today and is ready for full Senate consideration. 
   The language directs that the Defense Department provide a report on the feasibility of producing and using coal-derived synthetic fuel in military vehicles and aircraft.
   "Montana is the Saudi Arabia of coal," said Senator Burns. "This language will open up the possibility of expanded use by the Defense Department for coal to liquid fuel. This will help ensure that our Defense Department is not reliant on Middle Eastern fuel supplies."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
