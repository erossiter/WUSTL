SEN. BURNS HELPS SECURE HEALTHCARE GRANT FOR ASHLAND
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced a grant today that will go to Ashland Community Health Center for the amount of $235,273.  
 This grant will provide funding for the essential primary health, urgent and emergency care services, and mental health services at Ashland Community Health Center. Burns wrote a letter of support in order to help secure this grant. 
   "In Montana we often have to cover great distances to get where we need to go," said Burns. "In emergency medical situations, this time is critical, and Ashland Community Health Center offers essential care to an area that needs it. I am fully supportive of this health center, and will continue to support the work they do to keep Montanans healthy. I am glad to know that they will be receiving this funding to help further that goal." 
   Burns continued, "Barriers to primary healthcare for the population that is served by Ashland Community Health Center include its remote nature, the distances that must be traveled, poverty, and lack of transportation. Medical services would be difficult or non-existent without this clinic in this designated Medically Underserved and Health Profession Shortage Area."
