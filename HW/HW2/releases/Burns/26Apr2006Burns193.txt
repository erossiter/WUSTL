SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FOUR AWARDS FROM HUD TOTALING $11 MILLION
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced four awards from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Montana's benefit. Four flagship programs within HUD have announced the following awards, ranging from homeownership initiatives to emergency shelter grants, totaling more than $11.7 million. 
  Here is where the $11.7 million is coming from:
  * The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program has notified Montana that they will receive $6,886,683 to provide communities with resources to address a wide range of unique community development needs, from affordable housing to economic development projects.
   * HOME, a grant program for state and local governments to administer local housing initiatives, has awarded $4,340,864 to Montana to distribute formula grants that fund a wide range of activities that build, buy, and rehabilitate affordable housing.
   * Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) totaling $393,738 has been awarded to the state to be used for the rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into homeless shelters.
   * The American Dream Down Payment Initiative (ADDI) awarded $82,255 to increase the homeownership rate, especially among lower income and minority households while revitalizing and stabilizing communities.
  Senator Burns said, "I will continue supporting affordable housing initiatives in Montana, which are becoming increasingly important due to the rising costs of housing in many areas in Montana. Unfortunately, each year more Montana families find themselves making tough financial choices and HUD's work to alleviate that concern for Montana has not gone unnoticed."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Transportation, Treasury, and Housing Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees funding for housing programs, and is serving his third term as a U.S. Senator.
