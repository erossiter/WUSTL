SEN. BURNS CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF TAX RECONCILIATION PACKAGE, END TO DELAY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today held a press conference with Majority Whip Mitch McConnell (R - KY) and three other Republican Senators to call for immediate passage of the Tax Reconciliation bill, which is being debated on the Senate floor today.  
   Different versions of this legislation passed in the Senate in November 2005 and in the House in December 2005, and both were bi-partisan. In today's press conference, Senator Burns made the case for speedy passage of this legislation by stressing what it has meant to the Montana economy. 
   Senator Burns said, "Montana needs this bill; it's critical to our strong economy. Nationally we have 4.9% unemployment, lower than the average of the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. In Montana, our unemployment rate is only 3.7%, and in two counties it's below 3%. In Montana, there have been 34,100 new jobs created since May 2003, including 8,200 jobs in December 2005 alone. This critical tax reform legislation has benefited Montana, and we need to pass it immediately to ensure the economic benefit continues." 
   Among the other important provisions in the bill, there are several that are especially helpful for Montana's small businesses: 
   * Indian Employment Tax Credit: A business tax credit is available for the employer of qualified employees that work and live on or near an Indian reservation. The credit is for wages and health insurance costs paid to qualified employees (in the current year over the amount paid in 1993. The legislation would extend the provision an additional year through 2007, if passed in the Senate. 
   * Accelerated Depreciation for Business Property on Indian Reservations: A special depreciation recovery period applies to qualified Indian reservation property placed in service before January 1, 2006. In general, qualified Indian reservation property is property used predominantly in the active conduct of a trade or business within an Indian reservation, which is not used outside the reservation on a regular basis and was not acquired from a related person. This provision will also be extended through 2007 if passed in the Senate. 
   * Work Opportunity Tax Credit provides benefits to employers who hire those that may have employment problems or lack significant work experience, and would be extended one year, through 2006. The provision expired at the end of 2005. 
   * Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit is available to employers who hire workers receiving TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families). In this legislation, this credit would be extended another year under this legislation. 
   * A deduction of up to $250 for expenses for teachers and other school professionals will be continued through 2006, since the provision was set to expire at the end of 2005. 
   According to a recent Wall Street Journal Article, tax cuts actually generate more revenue for the federal government, rather than less. "The Congressional Budget Office has now confirmed that federal revenues will rise this year [2005] by more than $262 billion - the largest single-year increase in tax revenues in American history." 
   Senator Burns also said, "Cutting taxes increases revenue and stimulates economic growth. I know it's counterintuitive,e but when we encourage small business growth and individual tax relief it actually spurs growth, which brings more dollars through federal coffers than burdensome tax rates."
