PLANES, TRAINS, AND APPROPRIATIONS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) was joined by his colleague, Sen. Christopher "Kit" Bond (R-MO) as they rode from Whitefish to Cut Bank on Amtrak's Empire Builder, then took in an aerial view of the St. Mary's Canal and Fort Peck Reservoir. Sen. Burns and Sen. Bond are both senior members of the Senate Appropriations Committee with Sen. Bond as Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds Amtrak.  
   "I can't overstate how important this rail line is to Montana," said Burns. "Whitefish is the biggest station between Seattle and Minneapolis, and brings hundreds of visitors to the Flathead Valley, not to mention the passenger traffic both in state and cross state. We spoke with folks passing through, and local business owners who rely on the traffic. I asked Senator Bond to come ride the line personally so he could get a first-hand look at the importance of it to Montana, and our nation." 
   Senator Bond, Missouri's Senior Senator, is Chairman of the Subcommittee that funds Amtrak in the Senate. "The Administration is trying to bankrupt Amtrak, and I'm not going to allow that," said Bond. "With Senator Burns' leadership for Montana through his position on Senate Commerce and Transportation, plus his position on my Subcommittee, we can find a solution to this crisis, and protect passenger rail service in Montana." The Senators were also joined by David Gunn, President and C.E.O. of Amtrak as they rode the rail through Glacier National Park. 
   Following their trip on the Empire Builder, Burns and Bond talked about the need for repair along the St. Mary's Canal, and discussed the battle between upstream and downstream Missouri River states. After viewing Fort Peck Reservoir from the air, Burns and Bond agreed to keep working toward a long-term compromise on the flows of the 'Mighty Mo'.
