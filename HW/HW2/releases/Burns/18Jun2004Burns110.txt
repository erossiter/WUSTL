SEN. BURNS COMMENTS ON MURDER OF U.S. CITIZEN IN SAUDI ARABIA
 Sen. Burns' statement on murder of Paul Johnson 
  "I am disgusted and outraged by what has occurred today.  
 The evil actions we continue to see from this violent terrorist network once again solidifies the reasons we have waged a war on terror. These murderers hold no value in human life and have no shame for their unscrupulous actions. What they have done is not only illegal, but it is immoral and savage, and clearly shows the face and spirit of the enemy with whom we are dealing. I have full confidence our coalition forces will hunt down these evil-doers and bring them to justice. I look forward to that day."
