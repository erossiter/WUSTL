SEN. BURNS SAYS ETHANOL MEANS JOBS FOR MONTANA
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) called on the White House to implement key provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which will spur investment in cellulose ethanol refining. Sen. Burns and twelve other Senators sent a letter today to the White House, noting the strong private sector interest in pursuing emerging technologies and the need for a public sector commitment to speed commercialization of cellulose ethanol.  
   Senator Burns said, "I want to see cellulose ethanol production become a reality - using wheat and barley straw for fuel production will be a huge benefit to Montana. Support for this groundbreaking technology will bring more jobs to Montana, and lessen our nation's dependence on foreign oil. Montana farmers can be a key component of our nation's energy independence strategy, while at the same time keeping more dollars on the farm and strengthening rural economies. The Energy Bill we passed last year laid the foundation for the president's proposal, and we need to get it implemented." 
   The letter was co-signed by Senators Wayne Allard (R - Colo.), Sam Brownback (R - Kan.), Maria Cantwell (D - Wash.), Hillary Clinton (D - NY), Larry Craig (R - Idaho), Charles Grassley (R - Iowa), Chuck Hagel (R - Neb.), Jim Jeffords (I - VT), Richard Lugar (R - Ind.), and Patty Murray (D - Wash.), Pat Roberts (R - Kan.), and Ken Salazar (D - Colo.). 
   Senator Burns is a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
