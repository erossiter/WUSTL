SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMMIGRATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) issued the following statement today in advance of the president's immigration proposal to send National Guard troops to the southern border, expected in a national address tonight on immigration: 
  "We have an immediate need for improving our nation's border security, and I agree that this is an important step. Montanans want to see evidence that the federal government is serious about securing the border. At the same time, we need a long-term solution to our problems on the border, and there are a lot of ideas out there about how to address this problem. 
  "As we move forward in the Senate on an immigration bill, I will fight for my amendment to prevent illegal aliens being counted for congressional representation. I will support additional efforts to strengthen the immigration reform bill so that the American people are satisfied with this solution. I will not support amnesty, but I will work hard to include important, immediate border security and immigration reform provisions that protect our citizens."
  On May 2, Senator Burns introduced S. 2693, the Fair and Accurate Representation Act of 2006, which will prevent the federal government from including illegal aliens in the census for the purposes of congressional apportionment. Senator Burns today filed this bill as an amendment to S. 2611, the Immigration Reform bill, which is currently being debated on the Senate floor.
  S. 2693 has been referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senator Burns continues working to build support in the Senate for this legislation.
