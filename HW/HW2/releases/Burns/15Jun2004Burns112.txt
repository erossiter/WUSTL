SEN. BURNS REACTS TO FTC'S DO-NOT-SPAM LIST DECISION
  "I am glad to see the report released by the FTC today regarding the Do-Not-Spam list," said Burns.  
 "They have thoroughly examined the ability to successfully implement such a list at this point and the report has confirmed my concerns regarding the serious risks involved should the wrong person ever get their hands on a Do-Not-Spam list. All along I have stressed the need for continued oversight, both for enforcement purposes and to make sure we stay one step ahead of these big time spammers. Things change quickly in the cyber-world, and we have to work hard to keep up, but I believe we are doing a good job and I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure we continue coming down hard on these guys and continue making smart decisions to protect consumers from unwanted spam."
