SEN. BURNS CO-SPONSORS INDIAN HEALTH BILL
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) joined Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and six of his Senate colleagues in co-sponsoring S.1057, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Burns met with Montana and Wyoming Tribal leaders yesterday in a videoconference to listen to their concerns, and one of their requests was for him to lend his support to this legislation. 
   "We face serious health challenges in Indian country," said Burns. "Dwindling funds negatively impact the necessary preventative care that tribes work so hard to provide, and that hurts everyone in the long run. Type II Diabetes, methamphetamine addiction, cancer, and scores of other health problems tax the resources in Indian health care. My Tribal leaders asked me to help pass this legislation, and I will. I've also worked within the confines of the Interior Appropriations Bill to secure the necessary funds for the Indian Health Service (IHS) and other Tribal programs."
   This legislation reauthorizes and strengthens several IHS programs, and works to create a new national health policy for Indian country, with goals and benchmarks to increase the overall health level by 2010. The bill is also designed to allow the sovereign Tribes to take part in setting their own health priorities instead of a 'one-size-fits-all' national plan. This will allow Montana's Tribal Leaders to tailor the plans to their unmet health care needs.
   The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has been favorably passed out of the Indian Affairs Committee, and awaits action by the full Senate. Senator Burns is Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds IHS and all Native American programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
