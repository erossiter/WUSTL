SEN. BURNS: OMNIBUS BILL FINALIZED
  In a Saturday session, both the House and Senate came to an agreement on the omnibus package containing the nine remaining spending bills in Congress. The $388 Billion spending package was a combination of nine appropriations bills including Agriculture; Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; Energy and Water; Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development; Interior; Commerce, Justice, State; Foreign Operations; Transportation and Treasury; and Legislative Branch. Congress is expected to pass the Omnibus Bill this weekend.
   Senator Conrad Burns (R-Mont), a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations was deeply involved in the creation of this final spending bill, and was able to secure approximately $194 Million in funding for Montana-specific projects across the state.  
   "There's a lot to be proud of in this bill," said Burns. "Omnibus bills are notorious for including some unnecessary baggage, and some provisions that by themselves would never pass, but I feel overall we've got a pretty good bill here. You can never be completely happy, but Montana comes out on the positive side and I'm glad to see it. Included in this bill is funding for numerous Montana projects, and will go to continue improving our communities and our industries across the state." 
   HIGHLIGHTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL BILL 
   Agriculture Appropriations 
   Country of Origin Labeling: A last-ditch effort by members of the House of Representatives to reverse mandatory COOL failed after Burns and other colleagues who support mandatory COOL were able to block the attempt. As of right now, COOL will become mandatory in September 2006, although Senator Burns has introduced legislation that would move that forward to September, 2005. 
   Animal Identification: Included is a requirement that the U.S. Department of Agriculture provide detailed explanations to Congress before spending any funds provided for the National Animal ID program.

   Title V Education Funding: Burns was also able to secure $200 Million for Title V funding through his efforts with the Chairman of the Senate Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations Subcommittee. In a letter posed to the chairman, Burns said, "the removal of Title V, Part A funding is unacceptable and must be restored during the conferencing of this bill. Montana's schools use Title V funds in a variety of ways, from supporting the recruitment and training of our highly qualified teachers, to the supporting of technology programs, pre-schooling, even gifted and talented programs. This money is crucial to Montana, and I will continue fighting to make sure it is available to us long into the future."

   Transportation and Treasury 
   AMTRAK and Essential Air Service (EAS): As passed, the bill designates $1.217 billion in funding for Amtrak, providing support for their ongoing operations and capital investments during fiscal year 2005. It also authorizes $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, which ensures the longevity and continued improvement of our nation's most underutilized airports in rural communities. "Montana's vast networks of airports, roads and railways are constantly expanding, so they require lots of attention in the forms of planning, maintenance and development," said Burns. "I'm happy to see that the work we're doing will go to improve those systems in Montana, and I'll remain committed to ensuring their safe passage through the remainder of the appropriations process."

   Energy and Water 
   Helena Water Contract: Also included in the omnibus package is the Montana Water Contracts Extension Act of 2004. This inclusion extends specific water contracts for the City of Helena, the Helena Valley Irrigation District, the Toston Irrigation District, the Clarke Canyon Water Supply Company, Inc., the East Bench Irrigation District; all of which are under contract with the Bureau of Reclamation. "Without this extension, these contracts would have been renegotiated, and were likely to include a much higher costs for Montana producers. Agriculture drives our state, and affordable, consistent access to irrigating water is crucial to that. I'm happy to see that this language has been included in the omnibus appropriations package and will continue looking out for Montana's agricultural industry."

   Yellowstone Snowmobiling: Included in the package is language that ensures a continued ability to snowmobile within Yellowstone National Park through this winter's tourism season. Burns said, "Last year, mid-way through the winter, a Washington D.C. judge temporarily suspended all snowmobiling within the park. That action was devastating to West Yellowstone businesses, and the scores of families who were unable to enjoy the park. The language I've included works to protect those local businesses and economies by ensuring that, if snowmobiles are challenged in such a way again, the decision to remove them can't be implemented until the following season."
