SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS TO SUPPORT INDIAN HOUSING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) today announced the designation of funding to three of Montana's Indian Housing entities from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
   "The block grants that the Department of Housing and Urban Development have set aside for Montana will provide several of our Tribes with a great deal of flexibility in meeting the housing demands of their communities," said Burns. "Housing is one of our most basic community needs, so I'm pleased to see these grants easing one of the more difficult challenges faced by our state."
   The specific grants and their intended purpose are detailed below.
   * The Chippewa Cree Housing Authority, located on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation in Box Elder, is slated to receive $2,394,621 for maintenance of current assisted housing stock, identifying funding sources for new housing, planning and administration of assisted housing, and their operations.
   * Blackfeet Housing, located in Browning, will receive $6,402,214 that will go towards maintenance of current assisted housing stock, new housing construction and operations.
   * The Ft. Belknap Housing Department in Harlem will receive $2,520,154 for activities including modernization and operating assistance for low income housing, new construction, acquisition or rehabilitation of rental or owner occupied housing, housing services, housing management, crime prevention, and safety or model activities.
   The Indian Housing Block Grant Program is a formula grant that provides a range of affordable housing activities on Indian reservations and Indian areas. The block grant approach to housing for Native Americans was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996.
