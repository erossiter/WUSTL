SEN. BURNS TACKLES CORK TARIFF RELIEF
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) has teamed up with Rep. Rob Simmons (R-2nd CT) to introduce a bill that would address the problem of the unusually high tariff on unfinished cork compared with the import tariff charged to finished cork. Fishing rods, particularly fly-fishing rods, have grips with the main component consisting of cork, which is not available domestically and must be imported into the country. Finished cork has a six percent duty placed upon it, while unfinished cork has a 14 percent duty placed on it. The Burns bill would bring the unfinished cork tariff down to six percent.  
   "The disparity between finished and unfinished cork goes against common logic," said Burns. "Not to mention the fact that it discourages American producers from handcrafting their own products and forces them to increase the price of their fishing rods. This just doesn't make sense." 
   In support of this legislation, Mike Woodard, President and CEO of R.L. Winston Rod Company in Twin Bridges said: "The reduction in the tariff on cork will have a meaningful impact on our business and the industry as a whole. We import and use the finest quality premium priced cork to make the grips on every one of our Winston rods. This cork is expensive, and a reduction in the tariff is a very welcome change, especially in our industry where material and labor costs are increasing every year, and fly rod prices are remaining flat or decreasing due to competitive pressures." 
   Burns and Simmons are seeking to keep the price of fishing rods down, which would encourage Americans to produce and buy domestically. Passage of the bill would once again bring sense to increasingly complicated tariff laws, and have a positive impact on Montana's economy.
