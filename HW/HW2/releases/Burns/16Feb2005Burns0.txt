SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced funding for Montana fire departments from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards program.  
 In this round of funding the Coffee Creek Fire District will receive $29,389 for firefighting operations and safety improvements and the Valley Country Long Run Volunteer Fire Department in Glasgow will receive $117,000 for the purchase of a new firefighting vehicle. 
   "Both of these departments house some of Montana's finest first responders," said Burns. "Time and again these folks sacrifice their safety for our own, so I'm pleased to do my best here in Washington to make sure they have all the tools and equipment they need to do their job well."
