SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES ST. MARY'S FIELD HEARING SET FOR SEPT. 1
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) announced today that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, at his request, agreed to conduct a Field Hearing in Havre on September 1, 2006. Chairman Pete Domenici (R - NM) will chair the hearing, regarding authorization legislation for the Milk River project and the failing St. Mary diversion facilities. 
   On June 23, 2006, Senator Burns introduced S. 3563, the St. Mary Diversion and Conveyance Works and Milk River Project Act of 2006. This legislation authorizes major repairs for the water system along the Hi-Line. Senator Burns requested a field hearing so Committee members may gain a firsthand knowledge of the project and the effects on our state.
   "I am looking forward to this hearing so my colleagues on the Energy Committee can see how badly we need to rehabilitate the St. Mary's facilities and Milk River Project. This system is essential for sustainable irrigation and drinking water along the Hi-Line," said Senator Burns.
   The hearing will offer Montanans the opportunity to voice their opinions regarding this legislation. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will extend invitations to various stakeholders to present their oral testimonies. All interested parties are encouraged to submit written testimony after the conclusion of the hearing. If you have any questions, please contact Heather Stefanik or Sarah Converse at 1(800) 344-1513.
   Senator Burns is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
