It took a lot for us to get the $900 million for Byrne/ JAG money added to the budget resolution for fiscal year 2007 and it's great to see these efforts pay off for Montanans. This funding is critical to the efforts of the Montana Department of Justice to reduce crime and address the meth epidemic."
