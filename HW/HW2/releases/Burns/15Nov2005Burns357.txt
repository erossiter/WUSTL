DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) voted today to pass the 2006 Defense Authorization Bill, which ultimately passed 98-0. The legislation authorizes $441.6 Billion in defense spending and emphasizes the priorities of combating terrorism, homeland defense, enhanced protection for deployed forces, and quality of life improvements for members of the Armed Forces and their families. In addition, it authorizes $50 Billion in emergency supplemental funding for activities in support of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism.  
   "Our men and women in the Armed Forces deserve our unwavering support," said Burns. "This bill keeps our forces operating and addresses some important quality of life issues not only for our troops, but for their families as well. It also puts us on a path to begin bringing our forces home from the Iraq theater as the Iraqi government stands up and takes control of their fledgling democracy. As Iraqis stand up, Americans will stand down and they will come home. We have made great progress in Iraq, but we must complete the mission. To set a certain date to withdraw completely from Iraq only gives the terrorists around the world hope - hope that we will leave before the mission is complete." 
   Highlights of the 2006 Defense Authorization Bill include: 
   * Adding $1.4 billion over the President's budget request for force protection gear for service members, and providing the Department of Defense with the resources and authorities it needs to win the global war on terrorism, including adding $586.4 million over the President's budget request for combating terrorism. 
   * Authorizes full funding of the defense health program, including an initiative to better equip the military health care system to identify and treat early signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental disorders experienced by soldiers returning from combat. 
   * An amendment to correct certain inequities in the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). Currently, SBP annuities are reduced dollar for dollar by payments received through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Dependency Indemnity Compensation (DIC) program. This amendment repeals the requirement that these VA benefits be deducted from Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuities, affecting about 55,000 recipients of these benefits. 
   * Enacts the 'United States Policy on Iraq Act,' which clarifies certain aspects of U.S. policy with regard to Iraq by noting that 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq. The amendment also directs the Administration to report back to Congress within 90 days its policy on transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, and that U.S. forces should not stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. 
   The 2006 Defense Authorization Bill now goes to a joint House-Senate conference committee to reconcile differences with the version passed by the House earlier this year.
