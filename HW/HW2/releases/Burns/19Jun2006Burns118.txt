SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES AIR NATIONAL GUARD WILL RECEIVE AIR FORCE GOLDEN EAGLES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today announced a commitment from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) that they will transfer 18 upgraded F-15 C's, known as "Golden Eagles", to the Air National Guard (ANG) and will upgrade them with Active Electronically Scanned Array Radars (AESA). This transfer represents a major increase in capability for the Air National Guard, including the future compliment of fighters assigned to the 120th Fighter Wing in Great Falls. 
  Currently, almost the entire ANG F-15 fleet is made up of F-15 "A" models, which were built in the 1970's and have received few updates. This deal between the Air Force and the Air Guard represents a huge step forward for the ANG, which will now receive 18 top of the line F-15 C's with all new, upgraded electronics and bigger engines. The deal also includes reprogramming $73 million to buy advanced radars for that have the capability to shoot down incoming cruise missiles.
  "By getting these new fighters to the Air Guard we have helped guarantee a long term future for the 120th Fighter Wing," said Senator Burns. "As we saw on the morning of September 11, our Air Guard fighter force is the last line of defense. I am glad that the Air Force has recognized that the fighters guarding this great nation need the best equipment."
  Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955-1957 and is a senior member of the Senate Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees.
