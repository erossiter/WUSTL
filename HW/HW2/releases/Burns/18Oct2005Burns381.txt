PRESIDENT SIGNS HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  From the White House today, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) joined President George W. Bush as he signed the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill into law.  
   The bill includes a total of $30.8 billion for the operations and programs of the Department of Homeland Security. Included in the bill is $18.3 million for the creation of a Northern Border Airwing in Great Falls, Montana. Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, which includes the Homeland Security Subcommittee. He earlier penned a letter to Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH), Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, stressing the importance of our nation's northern border security and pushing for the dollars necessary to create the Air Wing in Great Falls. 
   "It's done. You can take it to the bank," said Burns. "The money we'll use to construct our new Airwing in Great Falls is all but in our hands, and I can't wait to get this project started. Now that we've gotten this ball rolling, I look forward to seeing how the new Airwing will bring jobs into the Great Falls area, boost Montana's economy, and play a roll in the defense of our nation as a whole." 
   In addition to the $18.3 million in funding for the Northern Border Air Wing, this bill includes important funding for immigration and border security, The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) and Emergency Management Performance (EMPG) grants, including: 
   * $3.4 billion for first responders, including grants to state and local communities, firefighters, and emergency management 
   * $5.05 billion for transportation security 
   * $9.8 billion for border protection, immigration enforcement, and related activities, an increase of $915 million from FY05 
   * $32 million for the Federal Flight Deck Officer and Flight Crew Training Programs, and increase of $7 million from FY05
