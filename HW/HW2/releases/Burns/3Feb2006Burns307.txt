SEN. BURNS: 'PATRIOT ACT EXTENSION RESPONSIBLE WHILE CIVIL LIBERTIES PROTECTIONS BEING WORKED OUT'
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement following last night's extension of the Patriot Act:  
   "Passing a second five week extension of the Patriot Act was a responsible thing for the Congress to do while we consider additional civil liberties protections. Our law enforcement officials require the tools the Patriot Act provides them, and we in Congress need to work out our differences to ensure they retain these tools in the future. As the president said in his State of the Union, 'We will not sit back and wait to get hit again'. The Patriot Act is a critical tool to make sure we're doing everything we can to protect America."
