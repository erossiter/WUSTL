SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH GENERAL CARTWRIGHT ON QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont) met today with General James Cartwright, head of U.S. Strategic Command to discuss the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the suggestion that Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls may ultimately stand to lose 50 operational missiles.  
 If the missiles were removed it would be over a period of five or six years, Gen. Cartwright said. 
   Burns has been engaging in high level discussions with the Defense Department, having already spoken on the phone with Cartwright last Wednesday, and meeting with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld Thursday and Deputy Secretary Gordon England Friday of last week. Today's meeting included a group of concerned Senators, including Sens. Craig Thomas (R - WY), Max Baucus (D - Mont), and Byron Dorgan (D - ND). 
   Senator Burns said, "I understand the importance of re-structuring the national defense to meet emerging threats. We need to shift from a Cold War mindset, to a mindset that faces new and emerging global challenges. As we do that we must not let our guard down; we have to keep a gun in our holster." 
   Senator Burns will meet this week with Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne to discuss the future of Malmstrom AFB and the possibility of bringing new missions to the base. The QDR and Defense Budget are expected to be released Feb. 6. 
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
