SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS PRESCRIPTION DRUG CHOICES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today that seniors can now sign up for Medicare-approved Prescription Drug Discount Cards that go into effect on June 1, 2004.  
 On December 8, 2003, the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act was signed into law, and this is the first phase of that new law. The Medicare-approved drug discount card will provide immediate savings for seniors on prescription drugs. 
   "Enrolling in a Medicare-approved drug discount card is a choice for all Medicare participants," said Burns. "In this program, many private companies will be offering their own discount cards, each with varying discounts on different drugs. Seniors should compare each card carefully to choose the one that best suits their individual needs. This is the first time in American History that Montanans with Medicare have access to a prescription drug benefit, and I'm happy they now have the choice to participate in this program if they desire." 
   The drug discount cards are expected to save beneficiaries an average of 10-15% off their overall expenses on prescription drugs, and up to 25% or more off the retail price of some individual drugs. This temporary phase will be in effect until the new, permanent prescription drug benefit program is established in 2006. 
   For more information about all the options available seniors can call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit www.medicare.gov.
