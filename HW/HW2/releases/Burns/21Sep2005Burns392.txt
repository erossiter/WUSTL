SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FUNDS TO DEVELOP RED LODGE TOURISM
  Sen. Conrad Burns today announced that Red Lodge will receive a $100,000 investment to help create an economic adjustment strategy to enhance its position as a tourist destination and coordinate local safety of tourists.  
 These funds are coming from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Adjustment Assistance program. 
   "Red Lodge and the neighboring communities are open for business," said Burns, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "We here in Montana know it, but we need to get the word out to the tourists coming in both this year and next: Even though the Beartooth Highway is undergoing repair, there's still plenty to do and see in this beautiful part of our country. It's important to the businesses in the region we combat any (notion) that they've shuttered their windows." 
   Burns was also instrumental in securing $250,000 announced last month from the Big Sky Economic Development Authority. Those funds went to the Red Lodge Chamber of Commerce to promote the region the immediate wake of the Beartooth Highway closure.
   Senator Conrad Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee which oversees the Federal Highway Administration. Burns also serves on the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Department of Transportation, and is co-chair of the Senate Tourism Caucus.
