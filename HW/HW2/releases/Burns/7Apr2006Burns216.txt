SEN. BURNS HIGHLIGHTS STRONG JOBS REPORT RELEASED BY LABOR DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) praised new economic statistics released today by the U.S. Department of Labor that reveal that the national unemployment rate decreased to 4.7% and the economy created 211,000 new jobs in March 2006. This follows the creation of nearly 243,000 new jobs in February and 30 consecutive months of uninterrupted job growth. Since May 2003, almost 5.1 million new jobs have been created and more Americans are working now than ever before.  
  Senator Burns said, "We continue to see good news on the economy, which has now expanded 17 consecutives quarters. We've created 5.1 million new jobs since August 2003. This is no time for us to welcome any tax increases or let the tax cuts expire. I've never voted for a tax increase in my life and I never will. I will continue to support our efforts to expand job opportunities to Veterans through my VET Act of 2006, increase research and development funding for Montana in the energy industry in order to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and expand health care coverage to employees of small business through the Small Business Health Plans bill I have co-sponsored with Senator Enzi. Our economy is growing nationally and is growing even faster in Montana. I'll continue advocating pro-growth policies to create more jobs."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Small Business and Commerce Committees and three-term U.S. Senator.
