TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE AIRPORTS IN MONTANA
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced three Department of Transportation grants that have been designated for Montana airports.  
 The funding, totaling $1,004,800 will go to improve a variety of systems within the airports. From the three awards, Ronan will receive $136,100 to update their airport master plan and construct an emergency snow removal equipment building, Columbus will receive $54,600 to rehabilitate their airport runway, and Chinook will receive $814,100 to install edge drainage on the runways, taxiways and aprons of Edgar G. Obie airport. 
   Burns said "This is a key part of Montana's infrastructure and ties in with all the growth we continue to see within our state. These transportation dollars will help to secure invaluable opportunities that will benefit our economy and our way of life," he continued. "It's important to keep Montana's airports in the best condition possible and I'm happy to see these that these funds will do just that." 
   Debbie Alke, Administrator of Montana's Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division, the agency charged with maintenance of airports and airport infrastructure said, "This news is absolutely wonderful. The funding ensures a smooth running Montana transportation system well into the immediate future, and on behalf of Montana, I can't thank Senator Burns enough for his continued dedication to our airways." 
   Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and the subcommittee on Aviation, which oversees the Department of Transportation.
