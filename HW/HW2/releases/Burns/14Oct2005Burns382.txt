SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS AMTRAK INCREASED RIDERSHIP
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced record numbers for Amtrak ridership in 2005. Nationally, Amtrak served 25,373,998 passengers in fiscal year 2005, and in Montana ridership increased from 129,044 last year to 140,475 this year.  
   "I don't think it's possible to overstate the important role of Amtrak to our country's transportation infrastructure, and the ridership numbers released today make that point all the more clear," said Burns. "I have long fought here in Washington to keep Amtrak intact and year in and year out I find we have to fight this same battle to get folks to understand the critical role of this rail system. As ridership numbers continue to increase each year, more and more folks will stand with me in support of Amtrak, and I am glad to see these great numbers come out today." 
   Burns, senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, secured over $1.45 billion in funding for Amtrak for fiscal year 2006. The Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, which funds Amtrak, comes to the Senate floor this week. Burns has vowed to continue fighting to preserve critical funding for Amtrak. 
   In August, Amtrak unveiled a new look for the Empire Builder, including refurbished rail cars, new on-board services and improved passenger amenities--improvements that been immensely popular among riders. In fact, September ridership numbers also showed a record overall increase, and Burns added: "In light of the recent increase in gas prices, I am pleased that folks have other options and are making the informed decision to conserve when possible." 
   Burns is also a co-sponsor of S. 1516, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005, which would reauthorize and reform Amtrak.
