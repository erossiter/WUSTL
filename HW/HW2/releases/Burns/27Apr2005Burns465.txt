SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns announced today that six counties in Montana will receive Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds for drought through the USDA Farm Service Agency.  
 Carter, Custer, Fallon, Garfield, Golden Valley, and Powder River will receive funding through ECP to assist producers with cost-share assistance to provide emergency water in pastures where the previously adequate water source has failed. 
   "Many of our producers are suffering from lack of vegetation and diminishing livestock watering sources due to drought, and these funds are an important boost for those folks," said Burns. "In Montana we have seen multiple years of drought, and although we have had some moisture in the past few weeks, that certainly can't change the tide of what has been such a long-term problem. This will be a real help for these counties, and I am glad to see them get this great news today." 
   Emergency practices include pipelines, tanks, troughs, constructing or deepening wells and spring developments, and in certain counties, water hauling and silt removal. Cost-share levels and eligibility requirements are determined in approved counties by the local Farm Service Agency county committee. Cost-share may be limited based on acres served. Permanent practices must be maintained for 10 years. 
   The following is a list of the funding each county will receive: Carter County, $105,000; Custer County, $105,000; Fallon County, $75,000; Garfield County, $105,000; Golden Valley County, $60,000; Powder River County, $195,000. 
   Further information regarding the Emergency Conservation Program may be obtained at your local county Farm Service Agency office.
