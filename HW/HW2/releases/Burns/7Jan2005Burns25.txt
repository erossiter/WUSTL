SEN. BURNS APPLAUDS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SAGE-GROUSE REMAIN OFF ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) applauded today's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announcement, stating that the sage-grouse does not warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act at this time.  
   "Montana has done and excellent job of managing our sage-grouse population, and today's announcement shows just how hard our folks have been working," said Burns. "After extensive review from the Service, I am glad that science has determined that these birds do not fall under the category of endangered species. This is great news, and I applaud the effort of all those that have been working hard to manage the sage-grouse in our state and across the country." 
   According to the Fish and Wildlife Service in December, 2004, greater sage-grouse are currently estimated to number from 142,000 to 500,000 individuals. Greater sage-grouse are currently found in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. They are also found in small populations in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
