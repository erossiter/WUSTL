SEN. BURNS TO SPEAK AT BRAC REGIONAL HEARING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) has been asked to speak at the Base Realignment and Closing Commission (BRAC) regional hearing being held in Portland, Oregon, on June 17, 2005.  
   "This is a great opportunity to make our case loud and clear before the BRAC panel," said Burns. "I am honored to join Major General Randy Mosley, Montana's Adjutant General, and Senator Baucus as we work to convince the members of the BRAC Commission that the Air Force made a mistake in their recommendations and that keeping our birds in Montana is the right thing to do. Since the news came out in May, we've all been working to first, keep the F-16 flying mission with the Montana Air National Guard, and expand possible missions, and that's what I'm headed to Oregon to do next week. 
   This meeting is open to the public and will be held in Portland, Oregon at the Federal Plaza, 911 North East 11th Avenue, in the first floor auditorium at 8:30 am. Burns added: "I encourage members of the Great Falls community and from around the state to stop by and show their support during this event." In addition to Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho will make their cases before the Commission.
   Contact: Jennifer O'Shea, 202/224-6830.
