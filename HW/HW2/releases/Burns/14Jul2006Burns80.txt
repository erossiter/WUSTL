SEN. BURNS REQUESTS ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM NRCG FOR FIRES
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) requested additional assistance from the Northern Rockies Coordinating Group (NRCG) as fires blaze throughout Eastern Montana. 
  In a letter to the NRCG, Senator Burns specifically requested pre-positioned fire fighting resources to protect property with current fire activity and forecast weather.
  "I receive updates every day on the fires across Eastern Montana, and we know it will be a hot and dry summer," said Senator Burns. "I want to make sure we are doing everything we can to protect our farms, ranches and communities across Eastern Montana."
  The Northern Rockies Coordination Group (NRCG) is established to provide an interagency approach to wildland fire management and all-risk support on all land ownerships within Montana and parts of four other states.
  NRCG is made up of representatives from the Montana Firewarden's Association, Montana Disaster and Emergency Services Division, Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, Idaho Department of Lands, North Dakota Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Montana Fire Chief's Association, and Montana Sheriff's and Peace Officer's Association.
  The purpose of NRCG is to further interagency cooperation, communications, coordination, and to provide interagency fire management direction and all-risk support for the Northern Rockies Geographic Area.
