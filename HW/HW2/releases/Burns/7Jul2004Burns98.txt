BIG SANDY VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT TO RECEIVE FIRE FIGHTING SUPPORT FUNDS
 Sen. Conrad Burns today announced that the Big Sandy Volunteer Fire Department has been named the recipient of $41,580 from the Department of Homeland Security's 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
 This funding is to be directed towards the department's Operations and Firefighter Safety Program, which is designed to improvement of training, equipment, personal protective gear, wellness and fitness, and modifications to the fire station and its facilities. 
   "The summer months are here and over the last six years we've learned that this can be a busy time for our first responders, particularly our firefighters," said Burns. "That's why I'm glad to see the Big Sandy Volunteer Fire Department receiving this money. It will go towards safeguarding the brave men and women working there, those who put their lives on the line for the rest of their community." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration, a division of FEMA, administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA website at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/.
