SEN. BURNS OPPOSES AMNESTY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today vowed to oppose any immigration reform legislation that includes amnesty. The Senate is considering immigration reform this week and possibly the next.  
  Senator Burns said, "If you are in the U.S. illegally, you need to go back to your country and apply for U.S. entry like any other legal immigrant. We cannot reward law breaking or we will invite more of it - history has shown that." 
  Senator Burns also expressed "serious concerns" that any temporary worker program will encourage more illegal immigration.
  "America is a country built on the rule of law," Senator Burns said. "If you are here illegally, for any reason, you have broken our laws. U.S. Citizenship is a privilege, and illegal immigrants cannot be given a place in the front of the line."
  Senator Burns said, "I will be working to implement workable reform options, not a one-size-fits-all approach that will have unintended consequences we will later regret. We must also provide the needed border security that Americans are demanding. Any immigration reform legislation will be useless unless we seal our borders first. As this debate moves forward, I will not support any plan that offers amnesty."
  Senator Burns served in the U.S. Marine Corps and is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
