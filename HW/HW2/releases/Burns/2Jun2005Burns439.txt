MONTANA ARTISTS TO BE FEATURED IN U.S. SENATE DISPLAY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today invited his colleagues to view artwork that will be on display in the United States Senate Russell Building Rotunda from June 6 to 10, 2005. The landscapes by Stuart Morse and Larry Zabel chronicle the bicentennial celebration of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the "Explore the Big Sky," signature events, June 1 - July 4, 2005 in Fort Benton and Great Falls, Montana.  
   "This remarkable journey," said Burns in a letter to the ninety-nine other members of the United States Senate, "is not only important for Montanans but for Americans from all fifty states. The exploratory drive of Lewis and Clark is the same exploratory drive that fuels today's astronauts, scientists, and school teachers." 
   Senator Burns' office worked closely with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to sponsor the exhibition. The purpose is to "promote and educate Members of Congress and the public-at-large about the Lewis and Clark expedition," wrote Burns. 
   Kathleen Clarke, Director of the Bureau of Land Management issued the following statement about the exhibit: "These tremendous works of art convey the grandeur, beauty and vast expanse of the Big Sky country in Montana and Idaho. Their vibrant, rich colors and scale depict the terrain traversed by the Corp of Discovery and the landscapes as they appear today. The BLM's theme for the Bicentennial is "Walk in the Footsteps of Lewis and Clark" and we think these paintings allow the viewer to do just that. We are thrilled to jointly sponsor this exhibit with Senator Burns and hope the public enjoys them as well as the upcoming Bicentennial signature and community events along the Trail." 
   The exhibit will feature three pieces by Larry Zabel: "Lewis and Clark at Stone Wall Creek", "Decision Point" and "Lewis and Clark at Cow Creek." Stuart Morse will feature two pieces: "A Quiet Gathering" and "Transcending the Sublime Wilderness".
