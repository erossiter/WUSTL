SEN. BURNS HAILS 3.7 PERCENT MONTANA UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, LOWEST IN STATE'S HISTORY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) hailed Montana job statistics unveiled today by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) that show Montana's unemployment rate of 3.7% is the lowest in the state's history, since the state-specific data collection began in the mid 1970s. DOL statistics have shown that Montana's jobless rate has steadily declined over nearly eight years. 
  Senator Burns said, "The economic climate in Montana is strong and we've been able to secure important funding projects, strengthen research and development opportunities at our universities and in the private sector, and provide incentives for businesses to make capital investments and expand. This is the lowest Montana employment rate in recent history - that's something all Montanans can be proud of.
  "I'll continue to work to make sure Montana is a great place to do business, and an important part of that effort is passing health care insurance relief for small business, in a bill I introduced with Senator Enzi. That bill will allow small businesses to band together and negotiate with insurance companies from a strong position. It will lower health care costs on small businesses, including farmers, ranchers, realtors, and family businesses and also provide small business employees with health care coverage. Efforts like these will continue to make Montana a great place to work and a great place to find work."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Small Business and Appropriations Committees.
