SEN. BURNS FIGHTS FOR COLLEGE TUITION TAX PROVISION
  Earlier this week, Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) urged his Senate colleagues to include a number of expiring and expired tax provisions as part of the Pension Reform bill expected to soon be considered in the Senate. 
  The Tax Reconciliation bill passed the Senate May 11 and was signed into law by the President May 17, but failed to include a number of important tax provisions. These provisions are:
  * A research-and-development tax credit for businesses and universities, the so-called R&D Tax Credit
   * Tax incentives for education including deductible college tuition
   * The above-the-line deduction for teacher classroom expenses, and Qualified Zone Academy Bonds
   * State sales tax deduction for residents of states without income tax
   * Tax credits for elective deferrals and IRA contributions (known as the Saver's Credit)
   * Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the Welfare to Work tax credit
   * New Markets Tax Credit and tax incentives for investment in D.C.
   * Indian employment credit and accelerated depreciation for business property in Indian Country
   * Extension of the 15-year straight line cost recovery for qualified leasehold and restaurant deductions
   * Enhanced deductions for computer contributions
   * Extension and expansion to petroleum products for expensing of Brownfields environmental remediation costs
  "I urge Senator Baucus and the rest of my colleagues to support deductible college tuition, along with these tax provisions," said Senator Burns. "We should be making college affordable and encouraging education and savings through tax incentives for Montana families. I will fight to ensure these important tax efforts are passed with the Pension bill in the near term."
  Senator Burns, along with Senators Gordon Smith (R - OR) and George Allen (R - VA) sent a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Finance Committee urging inclusion of these essential credits.
  In the letter, the Senators write, "We understand that a second tax package, comprised of several expired and expiring tax provisions, will be considered by the Senate. Through enacting comprehensive pension reform along with these common-sense tax provisions, Congress will continue to promote sound economic and education tax incentives while ensuring long-term pension stability for America's workers and retirees."
