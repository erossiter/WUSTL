SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES E-ELEVEN TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
  At the Internet Caucus "State of the Net Conference" today, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), a senior member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, announced his top communications priorities for the 109th Congress. The Burns e-Eleven Tech Agenda, aims to protect consumers, strengthen information security and usher reform for 21st Century Communication. The centerpiece of his technology agenda includes SPYBLOCK, Next Generation E-911, and CAN-SPAM Implementation, and is followed with priority items of Universal Service Reform, TV Ratings Fairness, ICANN Reform, Rural Broadband, Spectrum Reform, Digital Democracy, Ensuring Information Security in a Digital World, and the U.S. - Asia Network. 
   "We are in a digital age," said Sen. Burns. "It is no longer a world where we can distinguish between voice, video and data. Everything now is in the indistinguishable form of ones and zeroes. This will pose new challenges as we continue forward with reform legislation."  
   "My colleague, Sen. Wyden, and I are looking to reintroduce our SPYBLOCK Act in the coming weeks to ease the proliferation of harmful spyware." 
   "The passage of the ENHANCE 911 Act last December is only the first step towards setting up a grant program to help public safety officials to upgrade E-911 facilities. We must work now to secure appropriations to support this vital program." 
   "A year ago, CAN-SPAM was enacted into law. With spam continuing to pose threats to our small businesses and consumers, it is more important than ever to ensure that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the ability to enforce the provisions of the law." 
   SPYBLOCK 
   SPECIFY CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INSTALLATION OF SOFTWARE BY A THIRD PARTY ON PRIVATE COMPUTERS IS PERMISSIBLE. IMPOSE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF SOFTWARE ON PRIVATE COMPUTERS. 
   "Spyware", or software installed on a private computer without the owner's knowledge or informed consent, is a growing threat to the use of cyberspace. This software can be used for many nefarious purposes, including collection of personal data (such as bank account data or Social Security numbers) and allowing a private computer to be used by a third party for illegal activity without the owner's knowledge. Senator Burns, along with Senator Wyden, will reintroduce the Software Principles Yielding Better Level of Consumer Knowledge (SPYBLOCK) bill along with Senator Wyden, which will outline the conditions under which installation of such software is permissible and specifies penalties for unauthorized installation of spyware. 
   Next-Generation E-911 
   SECURE FUNDING FOR THE E-911 JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE SO THAT GRANTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE AS OUTLINED IN THE ENHANCE 911 ACT. EXPLORE OPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT VOICE-OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (VOIP) SERVICES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE E-911 SERVICES. IDENTIFY FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL INTEGRATE WITH TODAY'S E-911 SYSTEM IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY WITH TOOLS THAT CAN SAVE LIVES. 
   In the waning hours of the 108th Congress, Senator Burns led Congress in securing passage of the Ensuring Needed Help Arrives Near Callers Employing 911 (ENHANCE 911) Act. Senator Burns will be working closely with the Department of Commerce and the Department of Transportation in order to be sure that the Joint Program Office has sufficient resources to administer the E-911 grant program. 
   Furthermore, with the advent of technologies like Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP), users of this technology must have the same life-saving emergency communications services as those using landline and wireless phone services. 
   In the 108th Congress, along with Senator Clinton, Senator Burns launched the E-911 Caucus to help raise awareness of issues related to E-911. As Co-Chairman of the E-911 Caucus, Senator Burns will continue to work with his colleagues to address the challenges facing our 911 system. 
   CAN-SPAM Implementation 
   WORK WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO ENFORCE THE CAN-SPAM ACT AND MORE AGRESSIVELY PURSUE E-MAIL SPAMMERS. 
   Spam, or unsolicited commercial e-mail, is an increasingly serious problem that threatens to clog the Internet with junk messages, undermining its utility as a global communications network. Recent estimates predict that spam will cost U.S. business up to $90 billion in 2005. Senator Burns will urge Federal agencies to use the tools available to them under the CAN-SPAM, to more vigorously pursue spammers. He will also support the private sector's ongoing attempts to create technical fixes to the problem. 
   In addition, a coordinated international effort is necessary to track down and prosecute spammers. Senator Burns and Senator Wyden will continue to take a leadership role in developing an international framework to prosecute spammers. 
   Universal Service Reform 
   ENSURE AFFORDABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO RURAL CONSUMERS. 
   Building on the Universal Service Summits hosted by Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan in the 108th Congress, Senator Burns will continue to firmly support a solvent and stable Universal Service Fund that sustains consumers in rural America through the availability of high-quality and affordable telecommunications and information services. He remains committed to reforming the universal service contribution system so that the needs of rural consumers continue to be met. Senator Burns' initiatives in universal service reform will be guided by the following principles: 
   * To ensure the stability and sustainability of the universal service fund. 
   * To ensure that contributors are assessed in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner. 
   * To minimize the regulatory costs associated with complying with universal service obligations. 
   * To develop a contribution recovery process that is fair and readily understood by consumers. 
   TV Ratings Fairness 
   ENSURE THAT TV RATINGS ARE ACCURATE AND FAIR TO ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. EXPLORE THE PROPER GOVERNMENT ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN TV RATINGS. 
   Senator Burns took a leading role in looking into last year's controversy over the introduction of Local People Meters (LPMs) by Nielsen, the monopoly TV ratings company. Although Nielsen, overseen by the Media Ratings Council (MRC), is taking steps to ensure that all demographic groups are counted fairly, there is still a significant degree of dissatisfaction in the industry with Nielsen's approach. The public interest in maintaining accurate and fair TV ratings remains clear, and Senator Burns will continue to monitor the situation, in consultation with key players. 
   ICANN Reform 
   STRENGTHEN AND SECURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE INTERNET. ENSURE ICANN ADHERES TO ITS MISSION. EXAMINE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT ROLE IN ICANN OVERSIGHT. 
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit private company created by the Clinton Administration to manage the technical aspects of management of the domain name system (DNS), as well as the assignment of Internet numbers (IP addresses), for all Internet users. After a rocky start, ICANN has made strides in recent years toward developing an institutional framework appropriate to its mission. However, it continues to come under pressure to address other, non-technical areas outside its charter and mandate, and politically-driven international processes threaten to push Internet governance back to governments or international bureaucracies. In addition, the administration may allow the Commerce Department's current oversight agreement with ICANN to expire in 2006, which would effectively end the U.S. government's highly successful historic role as the chief sponsor and responsible steward of the Internet as a unitary global communications network. Senator Burns will continue his leadership role in exercising oversight during the 109th Congress. 
   Rural Broadband 
   BRING HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS TO RURAL AMERICA 
   Broadband is a powerful tool that helps to fuel economic development. In the 109th Congress, Senator Burns will continue to ensure that the Rural Utility Service's (RUS) Broadband Loan program functions in a way that quickly gives qualified candidates the assistance needed to deploy broadband services to rural areas. 
   Sen. Burns will reintroduce legislation that provides tax incentives to businesses that invest in broadband, with a focus on accelerating the deployment of high-speed Internet access across the country, especially in rural America. The broadband bill creates a temporary tax incentive for providers in the form of "expensing," allowing an immediate deduction of a capital expenditure in the first year of service rather than depreciating that investment over time. 
   In the case of "current generation" broadband investments in rural and underserved areas, the bill would allow 50% expensing of the investment, with the rest to be depreciated according to normal depreciation schedules. When providers build out "next generation" broadband networks, which are typically more expensive, the bill would provide for 100% expensing. 
   Spectrum Reform 
   TRANSFORM AN INEFFICIENT AND BURDENSOME FRAMEWORK INTO A MORE BALANCED MODEL FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. 
   Senator Burns is committed to moving away from the current auction model, under which the public's airwaves are transferred to private users based on the highest bidder. This policy has resulted in bankruptcies, botched auctions, and failed promises for consumers. Senator Burns will examine a totally different approach based on a royalty or revenue-sharing concept. These kinds of models have worked well in several Asian countries, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and balance the costs more fairly among consumer, government, and private operators. Senator Burns will introduce a bill based on these ideas. 
   Digital Democracy 
   LEVERAGE THE INTERNET REVOLUTION TO BRING GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE 
   Senator Burns held Congress' first interactive, online hearing on June 12, 1996. Nine years later, Senator Burns plans a coordinated effort to make the legislative process available to citizens over the Internet through cybercasts and online documents.
  The Digital Democracy Act is a good-government bill that requires that certain governmental proceedings and documents be made available via the Internet. Congressional proceedings and hearings, along with public executive branch meetings, should be available to the public in real time and archived along with searchable transcripts. Furthermore, Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports should be posted online for public use. The Digital Democracy Act will be introduced this spring. 
   Ensuring Information Security in a Digital World 
   IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES ON ONLINE THEFT OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR MISREPRESENTATION IN SUPPORT OF SUCH ACTIVITY. MANDATE RESPONSIBILITIES ON COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS IN SUPPORT OF ENFORCEMENT. DEFINE LIMITS ON USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED BY RADIO-FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) DEVICES. 
   As more and more economic activity migrates to the Internet, "phishing", or illegal theft of personal information - such as a Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or passwords to secure sites - is a growing problem. Meaningful penalties are necessary to curb this activity, which can take place either via software (or "spyware") surreptitiously entered into a personal computer, or by misrepresentation via e-mail or other means of open communications. Senator Burns will look into these practices and ensure that the proper authorities have the tools necessary to go after the offenders. To shift the balance of power away from the malicious code-writers who seek to cause informational and financial damage, Senator Burns will also support the private sector's ongoing proactive attempts to mitigate remotely exploitable security vulnerabilities. 
   Although the proliferation of RFID devices has led to economic efficiencies and increased convenience to companies and individuals in many areas, there has not been enough attention paid to how the personal data collected and disseminated by RFID devices, and the networks that support them, is used. In many cases the potential for abuse exists, and Senator Burns wants to raise awareness about how entities that collect and propagate personal data using these devices can be used. 
   U.S.-Asia Network 
   PROMOTE FREE-TRADE AND A MORE ROBUST COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ASIA. SHARE INFORMATION AND EXPERIENCES ABOUT SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATIONS AND IT POLICIES. FACILITATE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN AMERICANS AND THE PEOPLES OF ASIA. 
   The Asia-Pacific region is of increasing importance to Montanans and all Americans, whether in terms of trade, culture, foreign policy, or personal exchanges. U.S.-Asian relations will play a significant role in the lives of our children. The U.S.-Asia Network is a forum for members of Congress and Asian parliamentarians, government officials, technology companies, investors, businessmen and ultimately ordinary people, to make these relations as good as they can be. It exists to expand communications and electronic links throughout the region, share ideas about the right communications and IT policies, expand trade, and facilitate people-to-people contacts. The U.S.-Asia Network is poised for significant growth in the coming year, and Senator Burns will continue his leadership role in the organization and representing our nation in Congressional Delegations to Asia.
