SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT FUNDING FOR PARK CITY, SHELBY, HARRISON
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced funding for three Montana Fire Departments from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards Program.  
 Park City Rural Fire District will receive $106,970 for Operations and Safety, and the City of Shelby Volunteer Fire Department and HPNS Volunteer Fire Department in Harrison will receive $229,900 and $197,132 respectively for vehicle acquisition. 
   "Firefighting in Montana is a dangerous business," said Burns. "The bravery displayed by the men and women who are out in the field battling these blazes is a remarkable thing. I feel it's my job to do all I can to make sure they go out there with the best equipment, the best training, and the best support staff behind them, and that's exactly what this funding does. I am happy to see these funds go out to Park City, Shelby and Harrison today, which will undoubtedly help make Montana a safer place." 
   The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), administers the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program. The program assists rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States. A list of current award recipients announced to date is posted on the USFA web site at: http://www.usfa.fema.gov/fire-service/grants/. Future grant recipients will be listed as awards are made.
