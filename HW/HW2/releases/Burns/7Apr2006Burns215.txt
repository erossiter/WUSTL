SEN. BURNS VOTES AGAINST IMMIGRATION COMPROMISE WHICH IS STILL AMNESTY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) voted against the proposed Hagel/Martinez compromise to the immigration reform legislation today, which failed 60-38. The compromise would have allowed a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants currently living within the United States. 
  Senator Burns said, "This compromise is still amnesty. It provides an automatic path to citizenship for immigrants who are in this country illegally. When people break our laws by entering our country illegally, we have no way to ensure the security of the American people and that's our number one responsibility. I believe we must pass tough, sensible border security legislation as soon as possible and only then can we consider efforts to deal with those already living within the U.S. We cannot drain the lake when we're in a flood."
  Senator Burns served in the United States Marine Corps, is a senior member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee and is a three term U.S. Senator.
