SEN. BURNS SIGNS ON AS CO-SPONSOR OF 'CONQUER CHILDHOOD CANCER ACT OF 2006'
  Sen. Conrad Burns has pledged his support to the "Conquer Childhood Cancer Act" by signing on as an original cosponsor. Sen. Burns and his colleagues recognize that our country has a long way to go in the fight against the number one killer of children in this country: pediatric cancer.  
   The bill specifically seeks to help children between the ages of one and 20 years old. Children in this group develop some form of cancer before their twentieth birthday at a rate of one in every 330. Consequently, more children die each year from cancer than from asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS, combined. 
   The "Conquer Childhood Cancer" bill has been introduced as an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. Senator Burns notes the legislation "will give a voice to the thousands of children and families in the Unites States who have been touched by childhood cancer." 
   The act authorizes appropriations of $20,000,000 annually for five years. This funding will both expand medical research and improve available treatment in order to help fight numerous forms of childhood cancer. Also included is a plan to establish a database so that trends in diagnoses may be evaluated to discover causes for these cancers and increase the likelihood of prevention. 
   Senator Burns said, "Our goal with this legislation is to ease and eventually eradicate the suffering of so many of our children. By funding the fight against pediatric cancer, we can ensure that the physicians, nurses, and scientists that serve Montana families have the best tools available to them. With this bill, we are ensuring a healthier future for young Americans."
