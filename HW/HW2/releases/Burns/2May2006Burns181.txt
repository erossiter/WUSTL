SEN. BURNS SECURES $400,000 GRANT FOR MONTANA SUPREME COURT
  Today Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced that he secured a $424,508 grant for the Montana Supreme Court. This fiscal year 2006 grant is an appropriation earmark that Sen. Burns secured through the Senate Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. The CJS funding request was made to Sen. Burns' office and was requested by the Montana Supreme Court Administrator. The funding will be used to institute a more efficient, automated case management system compared to the paper-based system that has been used for many years. 
  The Montana Supreme Court, including the Court's Boards and Commissions, will have a complete, cutting-edge automated system for case management from this grant. Also, an electronic document management system, which will improve the operations of the court, will be installed for the Clerk of the Supreme Court. This will make information readily accessible to state and federal agencies.
  Senator Burns said, "We stopped by to look at this new system in January. Making the transition to an electronic system is speeding up due process and reducing the backlog caused by paperwork overload, and that's a win for everyone. I'm pleased we were able to get this important funding to upgrade the technology for Montana's court system."
  Ed Smith, Clerk of the Montana Supreme Court, said "Technology for the Supreme Court is essential to our operation of the system of justice in the 21st century. We are very pleased to receive federal funding for the second phase of the case management system and we thank Senator Burns for his sponsorship of this important project."
   Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and three-term U.S. Senator.
