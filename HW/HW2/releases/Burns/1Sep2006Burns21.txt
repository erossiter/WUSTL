SEN. BURNS ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT FALLING TO 4.7 PERCENT
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) today issued the following statement regarding economic statistics for the month of August released by the U.S. Department of Labor this morning: 
  "We have received more good news about the strength of our growing economy. National unemployment is down to 4.7% and our economy created 128,000 new jobs last month. Our economy has created over 5.7 million new jobs in the past three years. In Montana, the economy is even stronger, with unemployment at 3.8%. The strength of our economy is that more people are keeping their own money, with the series of wise tax cuts we passed in Congress. Looking forward, we must pass the tax extenders package before it expires this year, make the tax cuts permanent, and provide estate tax relief to keep this economy strong and growing."
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the Senate Commerce and Small Business Committees.
