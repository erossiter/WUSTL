SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $172,000 HHS GRANT TO MONTANA HEALTH NETWORK
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) today announced that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), awarded $172,000 to the Montana Health Network (MHN), based in Miles City. MHN is a collaborative of 41 nonprofit rural health care organizations covering more than half the State of Montana. Since 1987 MHN promotes, preserves and develops an effective system of providing quality health care for the residents of Montana. 
  Senator Burns said, "I'm pleased this funding will be used in Miles City to immediately improve the pharmacy services offered to Montanans."
  Funding from this grant will assist in the development of MHN project called the Network Pharmacy Support Services. This project includes recruitment assistance and a three-tier, telepharmacy services approach. In tier one, the hub-to-nine network members will receive pharmacy services as satellite sites. Three MHN pharmacies will function as tier two. Tier three will have two additional MHN Members with extensive experience that will function as consulting pharmacies.
  The development of this project was crucial in providing pharmacy services to these rural communities. Many residents of Eastern Montana have to drive 35-50 miles to have a prescription filled, and a majority of Eastern Montana community pharmacists are planning to retire soon. Young pharmacists who were recruited for these rural areas are often forced to leave all together due to low salaries and a national shortage of trained pharmacists. This program will assist rural communities in over 15 Eastern Montana counties obtain prescriptions more efficiently and effectively.
  Senator Burns is a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and a three-term U.S. Senator.
