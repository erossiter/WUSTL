SEN. BURNS RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL EDUCATION AWARD
  Sen. Conrad Burns received the Congressional Education Award from the National School Board Association (NSBA) today in a ceremony where Burns was congratulated for being a "strong advocate for education funding."  
   "The National School Board Association is an important organization, and their work from the ground up is instrumental in affecting education legislation and policy," said Burns. "I am honored to receive this award today." 
   NSBA applauded Burns for his instrumental role in restoring a $198.4 million of the funding for Title V state grants for innovative education programs, along with his efforts in the release of e-rate funding. 
   "Montana's education system is exceptional at providing young people with the necessary tools to go out and be productive citizens," said Burns. "It is critical that Montana's education system tailor itself to the needs of Montana's labor force and economy, and I think we have a strong set of folks working out in the state to make sure this happens." 
   Burns continued by emphasizing the importance of distance learning in Montana's rural schools: "Our high school students often graduate with a semester of college credits under their belts because of our far-reaching distance learning programs. With all the space in our state, these programs do an incredible job of reaching out to some of our more rural areas, and it offers our students extremely important opportunities in their education."
