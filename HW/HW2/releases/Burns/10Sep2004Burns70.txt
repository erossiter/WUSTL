SENS. BURNS, BAUCUS PAIR TO IMPROVE NORTHERN BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced his support for an amendment to this year's Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill that today passed by unanimous consent. Sen. Burns joined Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) in the fight to pass this amendment, which would extend the sunset date on customs user fees for products entering the United States. That extension would generate an additional $200 million for the establishment of five new Northern Border Wing bases in 2005, including one in Great Falls, Montana.  
   "My greatest responsibility is the safety of all Montanans," said Burns. "Montana lays claim to one of the longest stretches of the United States' northern border, and with much of it undeveloped I'd be remiss not to do everything possible to seal off that route to those wishing to do us harm. In the polarized political environment of the day, I'm happy to team together with Senator Baucus and do what's right for our state and the country as a whole." 
   Attached to that amendment is Burns co-sponsored language that will contribute $170 million more to the bill. The addition, which was included through Burns' effort with the Senate leadership, provides significantly more funding for our nation's Firefighting Assistance programs and Emergency Management Performance Grants, the support structure that coordinates our state and local governments as they prepare for future emergencies. 
   "These programs are designed and enacted to further our readiness in the event of any disaster, whether caused by man or nature," said Burns. "Funding them as much as possible is the best way to prepare for the things we can't predict, so I'll continue working to make sure they have all the resources necessary to do their jobs well."
