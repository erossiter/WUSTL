SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES $8.01 MILLION IN AIRPORT FUNDING
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today the distribution of funds set aside for Montana from the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration. In all, fourteen grants were included in the announcement, totaling $8,008,410.00. 
   "What a day for Montana," exclaimed Burns. "With more than $8 Million dollars on its way to 14 different parts of our state, our transportation infrastructure is going to be that much more effective at bringing all of our counties, cities and towns even closer together. I'm excited to see work on all of these projects begin, and am happy to have been able to do my part in Washington to make sure Montana's aviation industry is one of the country's finest."
   "This is great news for Montana," said Debbie Alke, the Department of Transportation's Administrator within the Montana Aeronautics Division. "Especially because the money included in these grants is going to help so many of our smaller airfields," she continued. "They keep our state up and running, and we can't tell you how much we appreciate all Senator Burns does in their support."
