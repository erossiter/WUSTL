SEN. BURNS COMMENTS AT FIRE FIGHTING AIRCRAFT HEARING
 Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) participated in a Commerce Committee hearing this morning regarding Fire Fighting Aircrafts.  
 The Committee heard comments and asked questions of Ellen Engleman Conners, Chairman of the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB), Nick Sabatini, Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification for the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Mark Rey, Undersecretary for Natural Resources for USDA, Mark Timmons, President of Neptune Aviation in Missoula, and William Grantham, President of International Air Response Inc. 
   "I was very disappointed in the Forest Service's decision last month to terminate the contracts of large air-tanker companies," said Burns. "Missoula's Neptune Aviation has a good safety record, and a long-standing partnership with the Forest Service, and I feel as if they have been punished for the safety missteps of others. Fire season is quickly closing in all across the west, and as we move forward it is critical we have the ability to protect the millions of acres of in-danger land from fire. Everyone knows the destruction these fires can cause, and without tankers we are facing an even more dire situation. As we sit on the eve of the fire season, there is no longer time for finger pointing and blaming-we must look for and find solutions."
