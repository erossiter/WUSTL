SEN. BURNS MEETS WITH EPA ADMINISTRATOR ON LIBBY CONTAMINATION DISCOVERY
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) met with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Stephen Johnson to discuss a new discovery of asbestos contamination in Libby at the Old Export Site. 
  Administrator Johnson told Senator Burns of a previously-planned trip by the Assistant Regional Administrator, Max Dodson, who will be visiting Libby next Tuesday at the request of community leaders. In addition to the events already scheduled for the Regional Administrator, Dodson will also answer the community's concerns with this latest development. Administrator Johnson expects to brief Senator Burns more fully next week after the EPA is able to provide more details about Export site's remediation history.
  In today's meeting, Administrator Johnson detailed the timeline of the discovery and what efforts have already been undertaken. According to Administrator Johnson, removal of the asbestos has already been completed. He said this discovery was made 18 inches below the ground and the materials were immediately removed, in compliance with EPA's Removal Authority Order.
  Earlier this week during installation of water lines, Libby officials were notified that an approximately eight-inch thick layer of vermiculite mixed with tremolite asbestos was found near the surface soil of the Old Export Site.
  Administrator Johnson reported that EPA will pay for expenses related to this removal and continue to work with the community to ensure that every effort is made to keep the community safe.
   "I wanted to learn as much about this as possible so we can make the town of Libby feel secure about the integrity of these cleanup efforts," said Senator Burns. "The good people of Libby have been through an unimaginable and difficult time, and I will make sure the EPA is doing their part. We'll know a lot more in the coming days."
