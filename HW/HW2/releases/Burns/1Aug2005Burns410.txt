SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO BALANCE PESTICIDE TRADE
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) introduced legislation last week that would put an end to the pesticide trade imbalance affecting the agriculture community. Burns introduced the Pesticide Harmonization and Joint Labeling Act to tear down the barriers that currently exist in the pesticide industry as demonstrated by the U.S.-Canadian border.  
   "When Montana farmers have to compete against Canadian growers who are getting their pesticides at a substantially lower price, that is an example of free trade gone wrong," said Burns. "We are talking about the exact same product, being sold at two different prices to growers who have to compete against each other in the world market. It is time these barriers be eliminated. If we are going to have free trade in grain, then we need free train in the input costs for production agriculture. This bill accomplishes that, and I look forward to its speedy passage." 
   The bill establishes a process by which interested growers can petition the Environmental Protection Agency to require a pesticide to be jointly labeled, if the product is already registered in both countries. In addition, this bill gives EPA the authority needed to require a joint label on a new product that is being introduced into the market. 
   Burns noted that a recent study done by Montana State University completed a study that found there are times when pesticides are cheaper in the U.S. and times when they're cheaper in Canada. For 13 pesticides widely used in Montana and Alberta, seven were less expensive in Canada, five were less expensive in the U.S., and one (glyphosate) showed little or no difference in price. 
   S. 1579 is supported by the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Barley Growers Association, the U.S. Durum Growers Association, the National Farmers Union, the Montana Grain Growers Association, and the North Dakota Grain Growers Association.
