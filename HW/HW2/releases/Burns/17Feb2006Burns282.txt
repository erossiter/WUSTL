SEN. BURNS INTRODUCES METHAMPHETAMINE AWARENESS, PREVENTION LEGISLATION
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R - Mont.) Thursday introduced S. 2315, the Methamphetamine Awareness and Prevention Act of 2006, aimed at supporting local, grassroots campaigns to effectively prevent the use of methamphetamine. These education and awareness campaigns must show an equal, private funding match, doubling the resources available and extending the reach of federal dollars. There's a lower requirement for the match for rural and Native American communities that face a significant meth problem. 
   Sen. Burns said, "There's not a neighborhood in Montana that hasn't been hurt by this terrible drug. It kills the first time, indiscriminately, and we must attack the consumer attitude about meth. Often times, this drug is used by adolescent children in our communities, and we must reward local, grassroots efforts that utilize dynamic images to reach our children. Meth is hurting Montana and our nation, and this bill will dramatically help our communities by supporting proven advertising campaigns."
   The competitive grant program would be administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, specifically the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
   Senator Burns participated in several media interviews on his meth bill in Washington, D.C. yesterday, and co-hosted a National Town Hall on Meth in Washington in January, which included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Drug Czar John Walters.
   Senator Burns founded the Senate Meth Caucus in 2005, which now has over 30 members. Senator Burns will continue his town halls in the state of Montana through the next few months, including his next one in Great Falls on February 25 at 2:30pm.
