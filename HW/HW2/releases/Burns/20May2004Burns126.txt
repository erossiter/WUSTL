SEN. BURNS ANNOUNCES GREAT FALLS AIRPORT FUNDS
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) announced today a Department of Transportation grant of $4,300,000 that will go to Great Falls International Airport for runway low visibility landing equipment. 
   "We all know how critical transportation is in our state, country and across the world," said Burns. "In Montana, our rural areas magnify that importance, and I am always looking for ways to make sure all Montanans have access to safe and reliable transportation. I am glad to see this significant funding get to Great Falls International to help make this airport, and in turn, transportation across the state, more sound.
   Cynthia Schultze, Airport Director at Great Falls International said: "The airport is grateful for the support of Senator Burns, and his efforts to increase the competitiveness of Montana airports in serving global commerce."
   Sen. Burns is a senior member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
