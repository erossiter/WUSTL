MONTANA AIR NATIONAL GUARD REDUCTIONS MAY BE DISALLOWED
  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont) was informed today by the Office of General Counsel of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) the Department of Defense recommendation to relocate Air National Guard wings is likely outside the boundary of the force restructuring law that guides the BRAC process.  
   A portion of the memorandum states, "It has been concluded that the base closure act does not grant the commission the authority to change how a unit is equipped or organized. Recommendations that serve primarily to transfer aircraft from one unit to another, to retire aircraft, or to address an imbalance in the active-reserve force mix are outside the authority granted by the Act. The Commission must act to remove such provisions from its recommendations." It goes on to question a number of other legal and policy concerns to the Commission. 
   "It appears to mean they can't do what they want to do," said Burns. "Ever since the Pentagon announced their intent to take away our fighters, we've been asking questions about the propriety of it and it seems we were right. It looks like they're going to have to find another way to try to take away the F-16's from Great Falls, and we'll fight 'em there too." 
   While the paper does discuss legal and policy restraints on the BRAC Commission, it does not represent the views of the Commission and is not a result of the commissioners themselves. 
   Burns, along with Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont) and Congressman Denny Rehberg (R-Mont) as well as Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer and dozens of Great Falls community members have been working together to stop the Pentagon attempt to take away the flying mission from the Montana Air National Guard.
