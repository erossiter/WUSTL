SEN. DAYTON PROMOTES TAX CREDITS FOR FAMILY FARMS THAT USE WIND POWER
  Sen. Mark Dayton joined with his Senate colleagues to introduce legislation that would give tax credits to farmers and co-ops that produce clean, renewable wind power.  
 Currently, under the Production Tax Credit, utilities and other large investors can receive a 1.8 cent per kilowatt-hour tax credit on electricity produced by wind. Today's legislation removes two roadblocks from the tax code, so that individual farmers and small, rural co-ops can reap the same benefit. 
   "Wind power is a reliable source of clean and sustainable energy and is readily available in Minnesota," said Dayton. "It is important that we do everything we can to encourage our farmers to invest in renewable energy and share in this rapidly growing industry." 
   The bill, which Dayton introduced yesterday with Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA), Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), would make the 1.8 cent tax credit applicable to a farmer's entire farm income, not just income generated from wind power. Currently, most farmers are ineligible for the tax credit, because wind power represents such a small portion of on-farm revenue. The bill would also allow farmers to join together and establish co-ops to install and operate wind turbines; all members of such a co-op would be eligible for the tax credit. Co-op members are not eligible for such a benefit under the current law.
