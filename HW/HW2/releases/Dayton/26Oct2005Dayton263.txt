SEN. DAYTON DENOUNCES CONGRESS FOR FAILING HELP AMERICANS WHO FACE RECORD HEATING COSTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today denounced the Senate's failure to adequately fund the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
 Dayton cosponsored an amendment, offered to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill, which would have provided $3.1 billion in emergency funding to the program. With 60 votes needed for passage, the amendment failed on the Senate floor today by a vote of 54 to 43. Dayton also supported the LIHEAP amendment when it was offered to both the Defense Appropriations bill and Transportation Appropriations bill, which also failed to pass. 
   "For the third time in the past month, I have called upon the Senate to provide additional emergency assistance to low-income families, who are facing home heating crises," said Dayton. "The lack of LIHEAP funding will soon force many Minnesotans to forego food, clothing, and heat. The Senate must show the heart to respond to their urgent needs." 
   This winter, skyrocketing energy prices, in the wake of the recent hurricanes, will result in tremendous increases in heating energy costs across the country. The Minnesota Department of Commerce predicts that the typical home heating bill will be $77.19 in October, 2005, in contrast to a $44.63 average cost in October, 2004 - an increase of 73%. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that Minnesota will again receive $73.7 million in LIHEAP funding, the same level of funding that the state received last year; the U.S. Department of Energy projects that natural gas heating bills in the Midwest will be 61% higher than last year.
