SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FOR ANOKA HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Anoka County Community Action Program, Inc. will receive a $1.3 million federal grant for its Head Start program. The grant, provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be used to fund the Anoka Head Start branch's Handicapped Training and Technical Assistance program.  
   "Head Start builds the confidence and skills children need to succeed in school," said Dayton. "This grant will enhance the quality of services provided to Head Start children and families in Anoka county." 
   Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
