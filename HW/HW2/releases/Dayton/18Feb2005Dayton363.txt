SEN. DAYTON URGES CONTINUED FUNDING FOR COMMERCIAL AIR SERVICE PROGRAM SERVING NORTHERN MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Mark Dayton and a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues today sent a letter to Sens.  
 Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Kent Conrad (D-ND), the leaders of the Senate Budget Committee, urging them to protect the Department of Transportation's Essential Air Service program in the FY06 budget resolution. The program, which helps provide commercial air service to communities that would otherwise be unable to afford it, serves approximately 100 rural communities across the country, including Chisholm, Hibbing, and Thief River Falls in Minnesota. 
   The President's FY 2006 budget proposal would eliminate commercial air service to 27 communities, and would require other communities to pay up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain their commercial air service. 
   "Many people living in Greater Minnesota would rather fly out of their regional airport than the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport," said Dayton. "Our state's excellent regional airports are vital links - to the rest of our country and the world - that must be sustained. I will do everything I can to preserve the federal funding that maintains the existing air service throughout Minnesota." 
   In the letter, Dayton also requested that funding for the program remain, at a minimum, at the same $102 million level as for the current fiscal year. 
   Congress established the Essential Air Service program in 1978 to ensure that communities with commercial air service before deregulation would continue to have access to scheduled service.
