SEN. DAYTON SUPPORTS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE TO BENEFIT 7.3 MILLION AMERICANS, INCLUDING 86,000 MINNESOTANS
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton voted in support of legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 over the next two years. This increase would benefit 7.3 million workers, including 86,000 minimum wage earners in Minnesota. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), and offered as an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform bill, would raise the minimum wage employers can pay hourly workers from the current $5.15 to $5.85 60 days after the enactment of the bill, to $6.55 one year later, and to $7.25 one year after that. Unfortunately, the amendment failed 46-49.  
   "Once again, the Republicans in the Senate have rejected an increase in the minimum wage," said Dayton. "They support tax breaks for multi-millionaires, but they oppose helping the working poor to earn a decent income." 
   Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, currently earn $10,700 a year. That is $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. Since the last increase in 1997, the value of the minimum wage has eroded by more than 15 percent. Since President Bush took office, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased by 4.3 million. 
   Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would have meant an additional $4,370 a year for minimum wage workers. 
   Dayton voted against an amendment offered by Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), which would have raised the minimum wage to $6.25, helping only 1.8 million workers. That amendment also would have allowed employers to force employees to work overtime without compensation. That amendment failed with a vote of 38-61. 
   "The Santorum Amendment is a cruel hoax for the working poor, as it would cut overtime pay and cause millions of Americans to lose wage protections."
