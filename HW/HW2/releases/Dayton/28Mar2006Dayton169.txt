SEN. DAYTON: MINNESOTA SHORTCHANGED BY CUTBACKS TO JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Minnesota will receive $695,000 under the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program - a 13 percent cut from what the state received last year. The grant provided by the U.S. Department of Justice, helps state and local police prevent youth delinquency and crime. In 2005, Minnesota received $800,000 in JABG funds. "I am disappointed that funding has been cut for the fourth consecutive year," said Dayton. "This could result in local agencies downsizing their efforts in helping Minnesota's youth, while forcing cash-strapped communities to pick up the slack."  
   The JABG program was created in 1998 and was the largest federal funding source for juvenile justice between 1998 and 2002, receiving funding at or near $250 million per year. Since 2002, funding for JAGB has been drastically cut. 
   * FY 2006 - $50 million - an 80 percent reduction since the program's inception 
   * FY 2005 - $54 million 
   * FY 2004 - $60 million 
   * FY 2003 - $190 million 
   The President's FY 2007 budget proposes eliminating the JABG Program, in addition to deep cuts for other juvenile justice programs. JABG funds are awarded based on a state's relative population of youth under age 18. Seventy-five percent of the funding is awarded directly to agencies at the local level. The Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice will use remaining funds towards the Disproportionate Minority Contact Program (DMC) to examine ways to improve the disproportionately high number of minorities in Minnesota's correctional facilities.
