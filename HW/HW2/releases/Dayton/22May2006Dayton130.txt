SEN. DAYTON: OVER $5.7 MILLION FOR MINNEAPOLIS - ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport (MSP) will receive $5,764,354 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration. "This airport is a major travel center for Minnesotans, Americans and international travelers," said Dayton. "This grant will improve infrastructure to ensure safe and efficient air service for domestic and international destinations."  
   The funding will be used to extend Taxiway M to enhance access to a new runway, and to rehabilitate the Taxiway C-D complex. 
   The Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport is the 16 busiest airport in the world, as measured by daily passenger traffic. Airlines serve 131 nonstop markets from MSP, including 116 domestic and 14 international markets. Compared to other metropolitan areas in the United States, only Denver serves more non-stop markets per capita.
