SEN. DAYTON: $1.7 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS ON RED LAKE RESERVATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Red Lake Homeless Shelter, in cooperation with the Jourdain/Perpich Extended Care Center, will receive $1,738,800 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build affordable housing for adults with physical disabilities on the Red Lake Reservation.  
   "During my time in the Senate, I have strongly advocated equal access for people with disabilities," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this funding will help the Red Lake Reservation serve the needs of its community members." 
   The award will fund the construction of seven handicapped-accessible duplexes on sites in Little Rock, Red Lake, Redby, and Ponemah, and will subsidize the rent of those living in the duplexes for the first three years. 
   The 14 housing units will vary in size from one to three bedrooms. They will be available to very low-income households that have an adult with a disability who would benefit from the accessible housing design and the supplementary in-home support services that will be provided by the shelter. 
   "The Red Lake Homeless Shelter and Jourdain/Perpich Extended Care Center are thrilled to be awarded this grant funding," commented Carol Priest, Executive Director of the Red Lake Homeless Shelter. "There is a wide gap in types of housing available on the Red Lake Reservation in the area of supportive housing for special needs households. The Supportive Housing for People with Disabilities funding will enable us to begin addressing this gap. We are very grateful to HUD for this award, and to all the people who helped with our grant proposal." 
   The funding is administered under HUD's Section 811 program. The award is interest-free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income persons with disabilities for at least 40 years.
