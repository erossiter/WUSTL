SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES NEARLY $1 MILLION FOR WHITE EARTH RESERVATION RENEWABLE ENERGY INITIATIVE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the White Earth Reservation Tribal Council will receive $990,000 in federal funding from the Department of Energy (DOE). The funding aims to increase the White Earth Tribal Community's use of renewable energy and to develop strategies for one or more future wind power projects.  
   "Minnesota is a national leader in the development of renewable energy sources," said Dayton. "I am delighted that the White Earth Reservation has received this federal funding which is critical to continue our state's role in promoting national energy independence." 
   White Earth Tribal Nation intends to use the wind power to service its own community, but is also examining the possibility of selling the power into a grid. The tribe will first complete a feasibility study on possible wind projects. The study will entail wind monitoring, environmental impacts, and power grid tie-in issues. The project is expected to start in the fall and will be completed by 2009. The first year will be dedicated to determining the best sites for the turbines, the second year will be used to detail the planning of the project, and the third year will be reserved for installing the turbines and other equipment. 
   The White Earth Tribal Council is required to match 50 percent of the total project amount, which could cost upwards of $3,108,000. DOE provides $990,000 for the project with White Earth Tribal Council contributing up to $2,118,000.
