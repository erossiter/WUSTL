SEN. DAYTON VOTES TO OVERTURN USDA PROPOSAL TO RESUME CANADIAN BEEF IMPORTS
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton voted in support of a Senate "resolution of disapproval" to overturn a controversial USDA rule that would reopen the U.S. border to live Canadian cattle under 30 months of age. Sen. Dayton had yesterday joined with a bipartisan group of 32 of his Senate colleagues in signing a petition which enabled the resolution to bypass the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and be sent directly to the full Senate for consideration.  
   A resolution of disapproval is a form of legislation designed to reverse specific government agency rules. Under the Congressional Review Act, 30 signatures were needed for the resolution to bypass the Senate Committee and be sent directly to the floor for an immediate vote. 
   "This premature and flawed proposal could do serious harm to Minnesota's farm economy," said Dayton. "Given the BSE situation and the lingering concerns regarding lost exports to countries such as Japan, I do not believe the protections are yet in place to guarantee a safe cattle supply if we reopen the U.S.-Canadian border." 
   On December 29, 2004, the USDA issued the final rule which would designate Canada as a minimal-risk region for BSE. Since USDA released its rule, however Canada has reported two new cases of BSE-infected cattle. 
   In order to take effect, the resolution will now need to be passed by the House of Representatives and signed by President Bush. 
   In a separate but related matter, a federal judge yesterday in Billings, Montana, issued an injunction that will delay the reopening of the U.S. border. The USDA had planned to reopen the border Monday, March 7, but a U.S. livestock group, which has filed a lawsuit against the USDA, asked for a delay. Judge Richard Cebull granted an order which will temporarily prevent the border from being opened.
