SEN. DAYTON URGES MINNESOTANS TO LEARN FACTS ABOUT THEIR MEDICARE DRUG PLAN CHOICES
  Sen. Mark Dayton today urged Minnesotans to be fully informed about their choices before enrolling in the new Medicare Part D drug program. After complaints to Dayton's Fort Snelling office that the Medicare drug benefit handbook cited inaccurate information about the monthly premiums Medicare would cover, Dayton pushed legislation through the Senate to ensure that the problems was corrected.  
   Also, beneficiaries may be unaware that based on the plan they choose and the level of assistance for which they qualify, they may be required to spend up to $3,600 out-of-pocket on their premium, deductible, and co-payments before Medicare catastrophic coverage kicks in. 
   "Unfortunately, clear accurate information about these benefits and about the penalties for late enrollment has not been readily available," said Dayton. 
   "I encourage Minnesotans who have questions about the new drug benefits to call my Health Care Help Line at (612) 727-5244 or (866) 296-4319 to get straight facts about their coverage choices." 
   Beginning today, Minnesota's 695,000 Medicare beneficiaries can begin enrolling in one of the 63 plans being offered in the state. The Medicare Open Enrollment period for the new drug benefit will continue through May 15, 2006. If individuals do not sign up by that time, they will also have to pay a late-enrollment penalty, which will increase their premium by one percent for each month they are not enrolled in the program. 
   Janine Stiles, Health Programs Manager at the Minnesota Senior Federation said, "Medicare eligible individuals should proceed with caution, do their homework and talk with trained counselors at the MN Senior Federation or the MN Senior Linkage line before making a decision on Part D. We are doing what we can to help people make educated and informed decisions on their specific prescription drug needs." 
   Dayton stressed the following resources available to Minnesotans seeking to learn more about the Medicare drug coverage options. He specifically encouraged Minnesotans to call his Health Care Help Line - a toll-free number that constituents can call for help in navigating through the complicated health care system.

   KEY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEW BENEFIT 
   Do I have to enroll in this program? 
   No. But if you don't, you may pay a higher premium later. Most Medicare beneficiaries must make a decision to enroll in a Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Plan beginning November 15, 2005 through May 15, 2006, or risk having to pay a higher premium. However, if you are currently receiving Medicare and Medical Assistance, or Medicare and Supplemental Security Income, you will automatically assigned to a Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Plan. You may then opt out of this Plan or choose another. 
   When do I need to sign up for the benefit? 
   All individuals entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Part B can enroll in the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Plan from November 15, 2005 through May 15, 2006. After May 15, 2006, enrollment will only be allowed under special circumstances, and you may have to pay more for the same drug benefit because you enrolled late. If you become eligible for Medicare after November 15, 2005, Medicare will inform you of the dates of your six-month enrollment period. 
   How do I get the new drug benefit? 
   You can enroll with the plan of your choice beginning November 15, 2005. You may compare plans and choose the one that is best for you by going to www.medicare.gov or by calling the Minnesota Linkage Line at 1-800-333-2433. 
   How much will it cost? 
   If you do not qualify for extra help with Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Plan costs, you will pay a monthly premium, an annual deductible, and co-payments, which will vary according to the plan you choose and where you live. Under the standard plan, individuals will pay an estimated premium in 2006 of $32 every month and a $250 deductible before Medicare starts helping with costs. After you have paid $3600 for your prescription in a year, your Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit plan may pay 95% or more of the costs for your prescriptions for the rest of the year. 
   Is there any additional assistance for persons with disabilities or low-income Medicare enrollees? 
   Extra help paying for Medicare Prescription Drug Benefits Plan costs is available. If your income if less than $14,355 (or less than $19,245 for couples) and your assets are less than $10,000 ($20,000 for couples), you may qualify for extra help. Contact the Linkage Line or the Social Security Administration with additional questions or to apply. 
   Can I keep my current prescription drug coverage? 
   If you currently have prescription drug coverage you will receive a notice in the mail informing you whether or not your coverage is "creditable". If your current prescription drug coverage is at least equal in value to the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, known as "creditable", you may keep your current coverage without risk of having to pay a higher premium for the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. If you loose your current prescription drug benefit, or if it is no longer "creditable", you will have a Special Enrollment Period to enroll in the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit without penalty. Call your insurance provider, employer, or union to find out if your current coverage is creditable. 
   Who can I contact for additional assistance and questions?
