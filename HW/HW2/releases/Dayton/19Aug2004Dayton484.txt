SEN. DAYTON: $525,000 TO INCREASE NUMBER OF POLICE ON STREET IN BURNSVILLE, ISLE, ROCHESTER
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced a total of $525,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, awarded to Minnesota police departments in Burnsville, Isle, and Rochester.  
 The grants, provided under the COPS' Universal Hiring Program, will help local communities expand their policing efforts by putting more police officers on the beat. "I commend the COPS Program for successfully reducing crime in Minnesota communities and across the country," Dayton said. "By increasing the number of officers patrolling our streets, this funding will help keep the neighborhoods of Burnsville, Isle, and Rochester safe." Since 1995, the COPS Program has helped over 13,000 law enforcement agencies to hire more than 118,000 officers. The program provides grants covering up to 75 percent of each officer's total salary and benefits over three years, with local funds paying the balance. Communities receiving funding include:
   * City of Burnsville - $150,000
   * Isle Police Department - $75,000
   * City of Rochester - $300,000
