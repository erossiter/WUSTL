SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF LOBBY REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton today voted in support of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act (S.2349). The bill contains provisions to curb lobbyist abuses and conflicts of interest, while increasing transparency in the legislative and earmark processes. The measure includes new reporting requirements, such as the disclosure of privately funded travel and negotiations by members regarding their future employment after Congress. Unfortunately, many amendments that would have strengthened the bill, including provisions to ban all privately funded travel and gifts, were not allowed to be offered. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 90 to 8. 
   Said Dayton: "This legislation is far from perfect. However, I supported it because I believe it is a step in the right direction to restoring Congress' credibility in the eyes of the American people."
