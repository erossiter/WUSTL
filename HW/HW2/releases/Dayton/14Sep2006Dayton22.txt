SEN. DAYTON: OVER $8 MILLION COMING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Metropolitan Council, which serves the Twin Cities area, will receive a total of $8,158,957 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Transit Administration, to help replace old buses. 
   "This funding will help to ensure that both passengers and the environment benefit from a modernized public transportation system," said Dayton. 
   Funding will be used to purchase up to 20 additional 40-foot replacement buses and up to 15 hybrid buses. The Metropolitan Council is the regional planning organization for the seven-county Twin Cities area. It runs the regional bus and light rail system, collects and treats wastewater, manages regional water resources, plans regional parks and administers funds that provide housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals and families.
