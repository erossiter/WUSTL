SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $85,000 FOR NEW SENIOR CITIZEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN WINONA, FIRST OF ITS KIND IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Winona will receive an $85,000 grant to launch Minnesota's first PACE (Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) site. PACE is a health care system model that provides cost effective health care, including emergency room services, dental care, optometry, nursing home services, and mental health services, for senior citizens. The grant is provided by the Department of Health & Human Services.  
   "The Winona community is a 'pacesetter' for Minnesota," said Dayton. "I am delighted that the Winona Rural PACE Initiative grant will improve the quality and availability of essential healthcare for senior citizens." 
   The PACE program provides one-stop, comprehensive health and social services for the elderly, and tailors its care and services to meet each individual participant's needs. In addition to medical care, the program provides meals, chore services, adult day care, and transportation for seniors. The target population is residents, age 55 or older, in Winona and Houston Counties, who have been certified as eligible for nursing home care by staff from the states' Medicaid agency. The Winona Network, which is comprised of Saint Anne of Winona hospital, Sauer Memorial Home/Lamberton Residence, Winona Health, and Winona State University, worked to secure Minnesota's first PACE site. The program has had tremendous success in other states; currently, more than 17,000 senior citizens nationwide receive their healthcare through PACE.
