SEN. DAYTON: TWO HARBORS AWARDED $117,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO ENHANCE PORT SECURITY
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway has been awarded a $117,000 federal grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to improve security at the Two Harbors port.  
 The funding, through the Port Security Grant Program, will help upgrade important defensive features, such as surveillance and communications equipment and access controls for restricted areas, and will contribute to the construction of new command and control facilities.
   "We need to make sure that Minnesota's rail and shipping industries have the necessary resources to meet growing national security demands," said Dayton. "I am pleased that these federal funds will help ensure that the Two Harbors port is safe, secure, and open for business."
   Ray Skelton, Security Director for Duluth Seaway Port Authority, said, "The DM&IR facility in Two Harbors is one of the busier docks in Minnesota. It is significant to note that Homeland Security is recognizing the importance of securing privately owned facilities against potential disruptive acts. We are hopeful that other private facilities will now be encouraged to apply for security grants."
   The Port Security Grant Program provides resources for projects to improve security at federally regulated seaports and facilities. 
   The Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway, as a part of the Great Lakes Transportation companies, has historically provided a broad range of specialized rail and waterway transportation services to steel, utility, mining, and chemical industries.
