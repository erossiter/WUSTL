SEN. DAYTON: OVER $290,000 COMING TO MOORHEAD TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Moorhead will receive $290,723 in federal funds for projects that will expand affordable housing options, create new businesses, and spur economic growth. The grants are provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.  
   "Often, access to adequate, affordable housing can mean the difference between a family, even a community, flourishing or floundering," said Dayton. "I am delighted that Moorhead will benefit from these grants, which have been essential to the revitalization of thousands of communities across the United States." 
   The CDBG program helps communities nationwide meet the challenges of providing affordable housing; making public improvements, such as maintaining flood and drainage facilities; building senior centers, libraries, and water/sewer projects; and fostering economic development. 
   Currently, CDBG funding serves more than 3,000 rural communities across the country. Over 95 percent of grants benefit low- to moderate-income people. In 2004, CDBG assisted 168,938 households and funded service projects that benefited over 13 million people.
