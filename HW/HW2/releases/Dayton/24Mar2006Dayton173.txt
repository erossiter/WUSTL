SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FOR SHAKOPEE HEAD START PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Scott-Carver Dakota Community Action Agency in Shakopee will receive a federal grant in the amount of $1,020,131 for its Head Start program. The grant, provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be used to fund the Shakopee Head Start branch's Handicapped Training and Technical Assistance program.  
   "Head Start is one of the few programs that offers valuable, early childhood development services to low-income families," Dayton said. "This grant means many children and families in Shakopee will have access to the programs they need." 
   Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive child development programs that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. They are child-focused programs and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.
