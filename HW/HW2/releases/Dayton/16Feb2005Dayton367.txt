SEN. DAYTON: PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS FOR AMERICA'S VETERANS UNCONSCIONABLE
  Sen. Mark Dayton and several of his Senate colleagues joined together today in sending a letter to Sens.  
 Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Kent Conrad (D-ND), the leaders of the Senate Budget Committee, urging them to reject a proposal in the President's FY 2006 budget which would establish an annual enrollment fee and increase prescription drug co-payments for veterans. Under the President's proposal, prescription drug co-payments would increase from $7 to $15, and an annual enrollment fee of $250 would be imposed upon middle-income veterans. 
   "There is already a lack of sufficient funding for veterans' health care and other services," said Dayton. "Many soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from serious, long-term, physical and mental health problems, due to their service. It is unconscionable to cut the already limited health care benefits available to these brave men and women. 
   "Once again, this President's actions do not match his lofty rhetoric. His budget cuts will have the harshest effect on those most in need and most deserving." 
   Dayton also expressed concern that the President's overall $28.1 billion veterans' health care budget not only fails to meet the rate of inflation, it also falls far short of what will inevitably be needed to treat the influx of new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.
