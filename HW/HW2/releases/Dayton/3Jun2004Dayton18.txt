SEN. DAYTON PRAISES SENATE'S PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR RESERVISTS
  Sen. Dayton praised the Senate's passage this week of an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that would give members of the National Guard and Reserve access to the military's TRICARE health system regardless of whether they are deployed.  
 Reservists now receive coverage only while on active duty and for a limited period thereafter. Dayton, a longstanding supporter of expanding health care benefits to all members of the military and their families, was an original cosponsor of the TRICARE amendment. 
   "Many of our troops in Iraq have had their tours extended for much longer than they expected, and many have taken significant pay cuts while serving their country," said Dayton. "The least we can do is relieve these brave men and women from worry about securing health care for their families and themselves upon their return home." 
   The amendment, which was offered by Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would require that reservists pay 28 percent of the premium costs and that the government picks up the remainder. Currently, 40 percent of U.S. forces in Iraq are reservists.
