SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $12 MILLION NEW DOLLARS FOR MINNESOTA PUBLIC SCHOOLS
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton announced that Senate appropriators restored $12 million in Title I funding for Minnesota public schools so that no school district in the state will receive less Title I funding than it did last year.  
   On May 26, 2004, Dayton, Representative Martin Sabo, and 69 other Members of Congress from across the country sent a letter to appropriators asking for these additional funds. Today's action was a response to this request. 
   "I am delighted that Senate Appropriation Committee members have acted against the Bush Administration's wishes and added these funds, preventing Minnesota schools from losing Title I dollars," Dayton said. "There are more Title I eligible schoolchildren in Minnesota than ever before. While the new funding level does not address this increase, at least now our state will not lose any money."
   The President's budget and the House of Representatives' Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill underfunds Title I by $6.2 billion in FY2004. The Title I program under No Child Left Behind gives funds to school districts for the purpose of improving the education of disadvantaged children, principally in the subjects of reading and math.
