SEN. DAYTON JOINS NORTHWEST EMPLOYEES IN FIGHTING FOR PENSION REFORM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today joined a crowd of over 250 Northwest employees who were in Washington to call on Congress to immediately enact meaningful pension reform legislation before the August recess. 
   "Northwest Airlines is one of Minnesota's largest employers and critical to our state's economy," said Dayton. "For the sake of Northwest employees and retirees, Congress must pass this long overdue pension bill to protect their retirement security. "
   It has been seven months since the House and Senate passed bi-partisan pension reform bills, and it's been four months since pension conferees were appointed.
   The Senate overwhelmingly passed pension reform by a vote of 97-2 in November, 2005, demonstrating bi-partisan support for addressing critical retirement security challenges. Senator Dayton strongly supports that any pension reform bill must safeguard workers' retirement through stronger protections for workers and retirees.
   The Senate-passed pension bill would strengthen and protect retirement plans for millions of workers. It also would require employers to pay more into the federal trust fund, which saves at least part of the retirees' benefits if their employer goes bankrupt.
   Northwest employs 40,000 employees, 15,000 of whom are in Minnesota. Northwest has current pension obligations to 71,000 current and former employees.
