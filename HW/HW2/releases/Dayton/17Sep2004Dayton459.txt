SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. CITIZENSHIP DAY
  Today, in special ceremonies across the nation, more than 20,000 men, women, and children from over 44 foreign countries celebrated Citizenship Day by becoming United States citizens. These immigrants pledged their oath to defend the Constitution of the United States and to support the rights and responsibilities of our great democracy. I congratulate these newest Americans and remind them that ours is a nation of immigrants, continually strengthened by the addition of new ideas, cultures, and traditions.
