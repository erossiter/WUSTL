SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $1.8 MILLION TO FIGHT CRIME IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that he has secured $1.8 million in federal funds for Minnesota crime fighting and criminal justice projects. Six Minnesota projects are included in the final FY2006 appropriations bill for Science, the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, and related agencies, which is expected to pass the Senate today.  
   Said Dayton: "These federal funds will help to keep our citizens and our communities safer, by equipping our law enforcement officers with the most advanced technologies available and targeting the scourge of meth, the most rapidly spreading drug in the country." 
   The following projects receive funding in the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill. 
   * $500,000 for the Integrated Biometric Identification System (IBIS) in Hennepin County. IBIS is a portable, handheld, digital fingerprint and photograph collection device. Carried in police patrol cars, it is used to capture fingerprints, which are then wirelessly transmitted for evaluation against national and local fingerprint databases. Law enforcement agents receive a response from the system within two minutes. 
   * $500,000 for CriMNet. CriMNet is a program to integrate criminal justice information systems throughout Minnesota. The funding will be used to create a central, statewide indexing service that tracks people and events in the criminal justice system and is able to accurately match an individual with events. Funding will also support a grant program for local criminal justice initiatives. 
   * $300,000 for the National Child Protection Training Center at Winona State University. The Center trains social workers, teachers, nurses, psychologists, and law enforcement agents to detect and prevent child abuse and to promote early intervention. The Center, a national leader in child abuse prevention education, will use the funds to mentor other child abuse training programs across the country. 
   * $225,000 for the Methamphetamine Hot Spots Initiative. This program targets meth production and trafficking in Minnesota. It helps the Bureau of Criminal Apprehensions and local law enforcement agencies to: prevent meth production, by targeting meth cooks and labs; safely respond to meth lab seizures; raise public awareness of the dangers of meth; and increase meth addiction treatment capacity in the corrections system. Funding will support the cleanup of meth labs, prosecution of meth cooks and dealers, and expanding treatment options for addicts. 
   * $150,000 for the White Earth Tribal Nation Fight Meth Program. White Earth Tribal Nation seeks to become a national leader in preventing the use of meth on tribal lands. Funding will be used to acquire hazardous material suits for the crews that clean up seized meth labs and to hire additional law enforcement agents. The funding will also support substance abuse education programs for students and community outreach to raise public awareness of the dangers of meth. 
   * $150,000 for the Minnesota Teen Challenge Drug and Alcohol Program (MNTC) in Minneapolis. MNTC is dedicated to meeting the emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual needs of teens and adults who are addicted to drugs and alcohol. The funding will be used to cover operating costs, including the acquisition of more staff, housing, beds, and other supplies, for a 60-day, extended care, residential drug and alcohol addiction treatment program and a 12-month drug and alcohol addiction program.
