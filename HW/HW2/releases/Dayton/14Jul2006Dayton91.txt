SEN. DAYTON: $300K FOR NEWLY ARRIVED HMONG, SOMALI REFUGEES COMING TO RAMSEY COUNTY
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Hmong American Partnership ($108,845) and Ramsey County's Hmong/Somali Community Outreach Program ($190,412) will receive $299,257 in federal funding under the Unanticipated Arrivals Program. The funding, administered by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement, will be used to provide resettlement services in assisting an influx of Hmong and Somali refugees who have migrated to Ramsey County.  
   "This federal funding will help Ramsey County to provide essential social services and transitional assistance to the recent influx of Hmong and Somali refugees." 
   There has been an unexpected increase of Hmong and Somali refugees to Ramsey County. The Hmong/Somali Community Outreach Program will use the funding to improve access of services for newly-arrived refugees. The county will work with Hennepin County's Office of Multicultural Services - which will serve as a mentor organization - to help create a similar, coordinated service delivery center for Ramsey County. 
   The Unanticipated Arrivals Grant Program provides additional resources to communities where the arrival of refugees is not anticipated. The program is also available for communities that are unable to provide adequate or appropriate services. 
   The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) assists refugees and other special populations in obtaining economic and social self-sufficiency in the United States. ORR oversees several programs which assist refugees in integrating in the United States; provides aid to victims of torture and trafficking; and helps care for and place unaccompanied alien children in appropriate settings.
