SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES NEARLY $1 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ROSEAU FLOOD-CONTROL PROJECT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the U.S. Small Business Administration has awarded nearly $1 million in federal grants to help fund the West Interceptor Project, a 7.5-mile channel to curb and reroute existing floodwaters around the City of Roseau.  
 The project will bring much-needed relief to the city which has been devastated in recent years by flooding. In 2002, the entire region was ravaged by weeks of heavy flooding, which damaged over 80 percent of the city.
   "Protecting Roseau's residents and businesses against future water damage and flooding is a top priority for me," said Dayton. "This community has battled flooding for far too long, and I am pleased that these federal grants will enable Roseau to complete this crucial project."
   Roseau Mayor Jeff Pelowski said, "I want to thank Senator Dayton on behalf of our city's residents for his involvement in our recovery efforts. This project is a vital piece in our flood-recovery efforts, and it will help us grow as a community and will create a safe place for our citizens and industries to flourish."
   The West Interceptor Project will divert waters from Roseau's flood-plagued western half where the city's business district and many of its larger commercial developments, including Polaris Industries, are located. The project will also restore hundreds of acres of the region's prairies and wetlands.
   The U.S. Small Business Administration provides aid, counsel, and assistance to protect the interests of small businesses and families recovering from disasters. For more information on the U.S. Small Business Administration please visit: http://www.sba.gov/.
