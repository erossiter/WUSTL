SEN. DAYTON CONDEMNS CAFTA FOR PUTTING MINNESOTA SUGAR BEET INDUSTRY, JOBS AT RISK
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton participated in a press conference with a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives, as well as business, trade, and labor organizations, to speak out against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).  
 If implemented, CAFTA would allow increased sugar imports from Central American countries and the Dominican Republic into the United States, jeopardizing the sugar beet industry in northwestern Minnesota and putting 32,500 industry jobs at risk. Minnesota is the nation's top sugar beet producer. 
   "This proposed agreement would bankrupt sugar beet growers and co-ops and cost hundreds of workers their jobs," said Dayton. "It would also ruin many businesses in the area who depend upon the industries revenues." 
   Dayton has made numerous attempts to defeat sugar industry provisions included in trade agreements by the Bush Administration. Last year, Dayton joined with U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota to offer a Senate Resolution, which called for sugar to be excluded from all future trade talks. In 2003, Dayton joined in sending two letters to President Bush, urging him to reconsider his proposal to raise sugar import quotas and lower tariffs on imported sugar. 
   CAFTA had its first hearing in the Senate last week. The House will have its first hearing on CAFTA tomorrow, in the House Ways and Means Committee.
