GAS PRICES TOPPING $2 PER GALLON; SEN. DAYTON URGES ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION
  Sen. Mark Dayton joined with his Senate colleagues in urging Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham to reconsider the Administration's current policy of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which is helping to drive up gasoline prices for U.S. consumers.  
 Without prompt action by the Administration to increase the supply of oil available, which is achieved by halting or cutting back on the current filling rate of the SPR, the price of gasoline during the summer ahead will exceed record prices.
   "Since January, the Administration has doubled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helping to drive gas prices through the roof," said Dayton. "Yet, with oil prices climbing and gas prices topping $2 per gallon, the Administration has not called off these deliveries to the Reserve. In order to stabilize prices for the millions of drivers in this country, the Administration must take immediate action."
   The SPR is the world's largest reserve of government-owned, emergency crude oil and was established to provide relief to consumers when oil and gasoline shortages cause economic hardship. Yet, with the U.S. available oil supply at historically low levels and current prices hitting record highs, the Administration is unwavering in its filling policy regarding the SPR. Under current policy, the SPR operates filled to 94% of capacity, which further limits the supply of oil to the market and sustains high gasoline prices.
