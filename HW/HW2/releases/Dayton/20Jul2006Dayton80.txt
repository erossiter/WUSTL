SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF SEX OFFENDER BILL THAT INCLUDES 'DRU'S LAW'
  Sen. Mark Dayton today lauded passage of legislation that would create the first ever national registry of sex offenders. Dayton pushed for the measure, which passed the Senate by voice vote. The President has promised to sign the bill into law by July 27. The legislation incorporates sex offender database legislation known as "Dru's Law," named for Pequot Lakes-native Dru Sjodin, who was abducted and murdered three years ago by a convicted sex offender. 
   "I applaud the Senate's action today, to protect our children from sex offenders in their communities and from predators on the Internet," said Dayton. "I am proud to cosponsor this bill, which will honor the memory of Dru Sjodin and help to prevent such a terrible tragedy from happening again."
   Today's bill, introduced by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), will create a national database and require convicted sex offenders to register their whereabouts every month, in person. Failure to comply would be a felony. Existing sex offender sites are managed from state to state, and do not correspond with each other. Under current law, convicts are required to register usually only once per year, by mail, and failure to comply is only a misdemeanor.
   Additionally, the bill authorizes funding for tracking devices for the worst sex offenders. The bill also increases minimum prison sentences for sexual offenses against children, trafficking of children, and violent crimes against children, and provides grants to combat sexual abuse of children and for a national sexual assault hotline.
