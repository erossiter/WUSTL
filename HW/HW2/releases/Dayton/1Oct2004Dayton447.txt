SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE
  Seven Senators representing Midwest states had a hopeful meeting this morning with the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Ted Stevens of Alaska.  
 Our bipartisan group consisted of Sens. Max Baucus and Conrad Burns from Montana; Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad from North Dakota; Pat Roberts from Kansas; Chuck Hagel from Nebraska; and myself.
   Sen. Stevens told us his House counterparts and the Bush Administration were supporting a much lower amount of agriculture disaster aid than the Senate bill's $2.9 billion. However, he promised to do his best to negotiate a final bill close to the Senate position.
   Yesterday, I wrote my House colleagues and urged them to get their colleagues' support for the higher amount of disaster aid in the Senate bill. Their success will be key to providing Minnesota farmers with the disaster relief they need.
