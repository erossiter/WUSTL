SEN. DAYTON: OVER $38K COMING TO MEADOWLANDS FOR NEW AMBULANCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that first responders in the City of Meadowlands will receive $38,300 from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development program. $13,000 of the total amount is in the form of a grant, with the remaining $25,000 in a loan. The funding will be used to purchase a new ambulance.  
   "Reliable ambulance service is often a matter of life and death," said Dayton. "I am pleased this funding will allow first responders in Meadowlands to do their jobs even more efficiently, to better serve communities in Northeastern Minnesota." 
   Meadowlands currently relies on 16 volunteer emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and one ambulance to serve the city and 10 surrounding communities. The ambulance averages over 100 runs per year, and Meadowlands last purchased an ambulance in the fall of 1998. Increasing maintenance costs, as the ambulance ages, and the large service area prompted the city to request funding for a new ambulance.
