SEN. DAYTON: SENATE APPROVES $2.9 BILLION IN DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Less than six days after Sen. Mark Dayton secured a commitment from Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to allow consideration of emergency disaster assistance for states in addition to Florida, which is receiving funding to help repair damages caused by Hurricane Charley, the Senate passed a $2.9 billion disaster assistance amendment.  
 The amendment will provide aid to farmers and ranchers in Minnesota and across the country who have experienced loss from weather related disasters such as flooding, frost, and drought. 
   "Minnesota farmers faced another devastating season filled with crop losses and uncompromising weather," said Dayton. "Just a few weeks ago, an early frost caused more than $190 million in crop losses for farmers all across the state. This aid is desperately needed by our farmers and is crucial to helping restore economic health to our rural communities.
   "We need to send this legislation to the President's desk immediately, so that he can sign it, and give our farmers the help they deserve." 
   The disaster assistance amendment includes:
   * Emergency assistance through the Crop Disaster Program (CDP), Quality Loss Program (QLP) and Livestock Assistance Program (LAP) for losses sustained by producers in counties in primary or contiguous disaster areas during the 2003 or 2004 production years. 
   * Producers may receive assistance for 2003 or 2004, but not both years. 
   * Contains the same payment limitations per person and maximum personal gross income eligibility provisions as in previous disaster bills. 
   * Producers must agree to purchase crop insurance for two years.
