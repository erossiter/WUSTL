SEN. DAYTON SECURES SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF OVER $4.4 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA CONSERVATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Senate Committee on Appropriations passed a bill that would allocate over $4.4 million to several important conservation projects in Minnesota.  
 The approved legislation provides funds for the U.S. Department of the Interior to support the Minnesota based projects. The spending bill passed the Senate today and now it will go to conference with the U.S. House of Representatives where negotiators will agree on final funding amounts.
   "Minnesota is home to some of the most beautiful forests and wildlife refuges in the country," said Dayton. "Every year, millions of people from around the nation visit these special places. It is crucial that we continue to fund preservation initiatives which protect our precious lands, including the Mississippi headwaters and the Brainerd Lakes region, which is the heart of lake country, so that generations to come can enjoy the natural beauty of these areas."
   The following is a list of programs included in the Appropriations bill:
   * $2,800,000 for the Brainerd Lakes Forest Legacy Program: Funding will protect the region's environment, economy, and community through a conservation easement on 4,790 acres of privately owned forest in the Brainerd Lakes region.
   * $750,000 for Chippewa/Superior National Forests land acquisition: Funding will be used to acquire a one-mile stretch of land known as "Long Island" for wildlife protection and controlled public recreation. 
   * $500,000 for the Northern Tallgrass Wildlife Refuge: Funding will be used to help conserve 750 acres of private, tallgrass prairie land. 
   * $400,000 for the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife & Fish Refuge: Funding will be used to acquire land and conservation easements on 300 acres within the wildlife and fish refuge.
