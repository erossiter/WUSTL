  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Neighborhood House in St.  
 Paul has been awarded a $150,000 federal grant to provide services to 5,000 Hmong refugees who are resettling in Minnesota. The grant, provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, will fund essential programs such as classes in English language learning and parenting skills. 
   "Neighborhood House has been an institution in St. Paul for more than 100 years, helping thousands of refugees and immigrants make a new home in Minnesota," said Dayton. "This federal grant will allow the Neighborhood House to continue its tradition of welcoming and assisting Minnesota's newest residents." 
   Neighborhood House is a multicultural, multilingual community center that provides programming and services to individuals and families. Its services include food shelves offering culturally appropriate foods to help families meet economic emergencies; and community-building activities for immigrant newcomers.
