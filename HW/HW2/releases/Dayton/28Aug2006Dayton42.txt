SEN. DAYTON: BRAINERD LUTHERAN SOCIAL SERVICE SNAGS $100K
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Lutheran Social Service (LSS), based in Brainerd, has received a grant in the amount of $100,000 from the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS).  
   "Lutheran Social Service has a stellar track record of serving people in need," said Dayton. "This funding will help the organization to continue its vital work, to improving the quality of life for Minnesotans." 
   The grant will help the LSS Lakes Area Street Outreach Program to educate youth on the dangers of "couch hopping" (moving frequently with no permanent residence) and living on the street. The Lakes Area Street Outreach program also helps connect youth with short term shelters and establish independent living situations. 
   LSS assists homeless or runaway youth, adults, and families secure affordable housing; provides mental health counseling; and offers a youth mentoring program. LSS is the largest, statewide non-profit social service agency in Minnesota, with over 2,300 employees and 6,000 volunteers who serve in 300 communities.
