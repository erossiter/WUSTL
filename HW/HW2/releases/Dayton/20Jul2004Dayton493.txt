SEN. DAYTON VOTES AGAINST CONTROVERSIAL BUSH JUDICIAL NOMINEE
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton joined 43 of his Senate colleagues in voting against the federal judicial nomination of William G. Myers III to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  
 Over 180 environmental, Native American, labor, civil rights, disability rights, and women's rights organizations oppose the nomination.
   "Mr. Myers' anti-environmental record - which caused the National Wildlife Federation, for the first time in its 68-year history, to take a position opposing a judicial nomination, as well as his lack of qualifications - which caused the American Bar Association to give him their lowest passing grade, are reasons enough to vote against giving him a lifetime appointment to the bench.
   "The Senate has confirmed 198 of President Bush's judicial nominations while turning down only six. Mr. Myers is the seventh, and rightfully so."
