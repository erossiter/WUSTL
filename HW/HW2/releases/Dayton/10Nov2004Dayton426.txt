SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  On November 11th, our country pays tribute to our nation's veterans of military service.  
 For over 50 years, Veterans Day has been a time to thank the nearly 27 million living Americans who have sacrificed so much over the years to protect our freedoms and liberties. This year, we also thank and honor our men and women in uniform who are actively serving our country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and others places around the world. Our gratitude and appreciation are especially appropriate, as those soldiers continue to serve our country with great courage and patriotism. 
   Today, thousands of Minnesotans are actively deployed across the country, and around the world. They have been separated from their homes, families, and jobs for indefinite periods of time. Their families and employers share the hardships of those separations. Yet, Minnesotans continue to serve willingly and proudly. They are true American heroes! 
   This Veterans Day is a powerful reminder of the heroic service and patriotic sacrifices America's veterans have made and continue to make on behalf of our country. I join with all of you to extend our heartfelt gratitude to veterans living today and our respectful condolences to the families and friends of veterans deceased. 
   We owe it to those who have sacrificed so much for our country to ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they have earned and the services they deserve. I will continue to do all I can in the Senate to fulfill our commitment to our nation's veterans. Our veterans deserve no less.
