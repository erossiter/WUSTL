SEN. DAYTON: $250,000 AWARDED TO LIBERIAN CULTURAL AND COMMUNITY CENTER IN BROOKLYN PARK
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that $250,000 in federal funding for a cultural and community center in Brooklyn Park was included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today.  
 The funding, secured by Dayton, will help the Organization of Liberians in Minnesota finance the construction of this new facility. 
   "I'm pleased that funding for this worthwhile project was included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill," said Dayton. "The Liberian Cultural and Community Center will provide some very important and much-needed services to Northwest Hennepin County's growing West African immigrant population, aiding their transition into the local community." Once completed, the Liberian Cultural and Community Center will afford area residents public meeting facilities and access to various services, including orientation programs, employment counseling, and job placement. 
   Additionally, the center will house several classrooms, a cultural food and gift shop, and a banking and wire-transfer facility. Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
