SEN. DAYTON: $3.7 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IN WYOMING, MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Ebenezer Society of Minneapolis will receive $3,756,300 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build affordable housing for the elderly in Wyoming, MN.  
   "It is important that older people in our communities be able to age with dignity," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this funding will help meet the needs of seniors in Wyoming." 
   The award will fund the construction of MeadowView Apartments, a 32-apartment supportive housing complex for low-income seniors, and will subsidize rent within the complex for the first three years of operation. 
   The housing project was launched in response to a need for affordable rental housing for seniors that was identified in studies conducted by the Ebenezer Society in 2003 and 2005. The date when construction will begin has not yet been set. 
   The funding is administered under HUD's Section 202 program. The award is interest-free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income, elderly persons for at least 40 years. 
   The Ebenezer Society was founded in 1917 by Minneapolis Lutherans to help older adults and others to live more independent, meaningful lives in an environment of health and security.
