SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS FOR RURAL MINNESOTA IN ENERGY BILL
  At a press conference today, Sen. Mark Dayton highlighted the proposals to strengthen rural America, which he and other Senators successfully included in the Senate Energy Bill.  
 Dayton, joining with Sens. Tom Harkin (D-IA), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), and Ken Salazar (D-CO), called on members of a House-Senate Conference Committee to maintain the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), the Wind energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in their negotiations to arrive at the final Energy Bill, which will then go to the President. 
   The Senate's energy bill would substantially increase use of domestic bio-based and renewable resources, giving an economic boost to rural America. The increase in clean, affordable, homegrown energy sources, such as ethanol, would also reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
   "I would like to see an E-10 mandate, nationwide, by 2015 or even 2012," said Dayton. 
   "I think it's easily achievable, and anyone who thinks that gas prices will go down by then is wrong," said Dayton. "But, this bill is a step in the right direction. I commend the leaders on this legislation, particularly Senators Domenici and Bingaman. 
   "I just wish that it did more. America needs more." 
   The Senate Energy Bill includes: 
   * A Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) of eight billion gallons per year, doubling the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the country, by 2012. 
   * A Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) to expand production of wind energy. 
   * A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to ensure that at least 10% of the nation's energy comes from renewable energy sources.
