SEN. DAYTON: OVER $365,000 COMING TO PIONEER PUBLIC TELEVISION IN APPLETON
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Pioneer Public Television in Appleton (KWCM-TV) will receive a $365,550 federal grant. The funding, provided by Congress to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), will be used to assist the station with its conversion from analog to digital transmissions.  
   "With the aid of this grant, more Minnesotans in more areas of our state will be able to enjoy the terrific educational and cultural programs that can only be found on PBS," said Dayton. 
   Specifically, Pioneer Public Television will use the grant to purchase and install equipment for upgrading its single channel system to a digital, multi-channel, multi-format operation. The upgrade will allow KWCM's broadcasts to reach more homes and will enhance picture quality. 
   This round of digital conversion grants, totaling $9.7 million, will be distributed to 37 local public television stations throughout the country. The funding is part of the nearly $220 million that Congress has provided to CPB over the last six years, to assist both public radio and public television stations with the conversion from analog to digital transmission. So far, CPB has distributed grants to 461 public radio stations and 285 public television stations, to assist with digital upgrades.
