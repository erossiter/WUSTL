SEN. DAYTON: $169K FOR NEWLY ARRIVED HMONG REFUGEES IN ST. PAUL
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Lao Family Community of Minnesota (LFC) will receive $169,430 in federal funding under the Unanticipated Arrivals Program. The grant, administered by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement, will be used to provide resettlement services in assisting an influx of Hmong refugees who have migrated to St. Paul.  
   "Lao Family Community of Minnesota gives refugees with a strong foundation to become economically self-sufficient and contributing members of society," said Dayton. "This funding ensures they continue their essential work." 
   The Unanticipated Arrivals Grant Program provides additional resources to communities where the arrival of refugees is not anticipated. The program is also available for communities that are unable to provide adequate or appropriate services. 
   Lao Family Community of Minnesota, Inc., is a non-profit mutual assistance association founded in 1977 as the Hmong Association of Minnesota. The organization received its first funding from public and private sources in 1980 and incorporated under its current name in 1983. LFC's mission is to promote pride and knowledge of Hmong history and culture; offer direction, mutual support, strength and hope; and advocate for the success of Hmong people in Minnesota. 
   The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) assists refugees and other special populations in obtaining economic and social self-sufficiency in the United States. ORR oversees several programs which assist refugees in integrating in the United States; provides aid to victims of torture and trafficking; and helps care for and place unaccompanied alien children in appropriate settings.
