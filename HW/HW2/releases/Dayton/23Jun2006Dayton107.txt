SEN. DAYTON: $150K FOR MINNESOTA TEEN METH PREVENTION PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Minnesota Teen Challenge, one of the largest residential drug and alcohol programs in the state, will receive $148,084 in federal funding to support its methamphetamine prevention program. The funding is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice.  
   "This federal funding will bring critical resources to expand community prevention against meth abuse," said Dayton. "Minnesota has been hit hard by the meth epidemic. Prevention is one of the most effective ways to protect our communities - particularly our youth - from the devastating results associated with illegal drug usage." 
   "Minnesota Teen Challenge wants to thank Senator Mark Dayton for his support in helping us with this request," said Richard Sherber, Executive Director of Minnesota Teen Challenge. "We're continuing our prevention program, getting into schools and community organizations to make known the tragedy of meth usage, through volunteer residents who share their personal experiences. This funding will help us to continue and expand these efforts." 
   Minnesota Teen Program will use the funding to equip teenagers with drug and alcohol refusal skills and to reduce juvenile delinquency. Presentations will be conducted at local high schools by recovering addicts who are close in age and in background to the high school students they will be addressing. These presentations will include self-assessment surveys and the gathering of statistical data to measure the program outcomes.
