SEN. DAYTON: WINONA STATE TO RECEIVE $300K FOR NATIONAL CHILD PROTECTION TRAINING CENTER
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Winona State University will receive $300,000 in federal funding for its National Child Protection Training Center (NCPTC). Dayton secured the funds in a FY 2006 spending bill, and the Department of Justice is expected to release the grant next week. 
   "Winona State University provides an invaluable, national resource for child abuse prevention, and I'm glad it will receive continued federal support for its unique training program," Dayton said.
   Established in 2003, the NCPTC teaches social workers, teachers, nurses, psychologists, and law enforcement agents to detect and prevent child abuse and to promote early intervention. Today, the Center is a national leader in child abuse prevention education. NCPTC will use the Department of Justice funds to mentor other child abuse prevention training programs across the country, guiding the development of graduate and undergraduate curricula
   Since 2003, Dayton has secured over $1 million in federal funding for the National Child Protection Training Center.
