SEN. DAYTON TO MEET WITH CHINA PRESIDENT ON OFFICIAL TRIP TO ASIA
  Sen. Mark Dayton is in China this week with several Senate colleagues to discuss energy, international security, and trade issues with Chinese officials. Dayton will meet with President Hu Jintao, as well as with members of the National People's Congress, China's highest legislative body. 
   Senators Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Richard Burr (R-NC) are also attending the trip, hosted by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK). The official visit is part of an inter-parliamentary exchange program between the two countries. Dayton will pay for most of the trip's cost with personal funds.
