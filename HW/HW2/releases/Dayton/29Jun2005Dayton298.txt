SEN. DAYTON SECURES $7.3 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA CONSERVATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Senate has approved $7.3 million for Minnesota projects aimed at preventing water contamination and preserving forests and wildlife refuges. Dayton worked to secure the funds, which passed yesterday as part of the $26 billion Interior Appropriations bill. The bill will now go to conference with the House, where the final funding amounts will be decided.  
   "Minnesota is home to some of the most beautiful forests and wildlife refuges in the country," said Dayton. "Every year, millions of people from around the world visit these exquisite places. It is crucial that we continue to fund preservation initiatives, so that generations to come can enjoy the natural beauty of these areas." 
   The following is a list of programs included in the Interior Appropriations bill: 
   * $500,000 for Crow Wing to establish a unique sanitary management district to fulfill current and future wastewater treatment needs. 
   * $500,000 for the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District in Duluth, where funds will be used to provide backup generators at four major pumping stations and at the treatment plant, an overflow basin on the waterfront, and the western portion of WLSSD. 
   * $500,000 to the Northern Tallgrass Wildlife Refuge for conservation easements to increase the conservation of tallgrass prairie on private land. 
   * $1.2 million for the Brainerd Lakes Legacy Program to protect 5,000 acres of working forest lands in and around the Crow Wing and Pillsbury State Forests with a working forest easement. 
   * $125,000 for the Chippewa National Forest to protect Starr Island's unique mix of forests and wetlands, which provides nesting habitat for bald eagles and several species of waterfowl. 
   * $500,000 for the construction of Willmar's new Wastewater Treatment Plan to focus on wastewater treatment that exceeds the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System's permit requirements for improved pollutant removal. 
   * $4 million for the construction of the Grand Portage Heritage Center.
