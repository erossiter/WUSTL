SEN. DAYTON PAYS TRIBUTE TO HISTORIC OPENING OF SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN INDIAN
  Sen. Mark Dayton today celebrated the opening of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian.  
 Dayton will meet with several Minnesota tribal representatives this week while they are in Washington to attend the Museum's Grand Opening ceremonies.
   "I think W. Richard West, Jr., the Director of the National Museum of the American Indian, said it best: 'We are truly on the threshold of a very special and unprecedented undertaking,'" said Dayton. "I am so proud of Native Americans' contributions to our country's heritage. The opening of this wonderful new museum will allow people from across the globe to learn about the significance of this distinguished group of Americans in our country's history."
   Dayton will meet this week with representatives from several Minnesota tribes including White Earth Tribal Nation, Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, Prairie Island Indian community, and Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe.
