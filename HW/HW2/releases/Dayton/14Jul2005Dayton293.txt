SEN. DAYTON PUSHES TO RESTORE FUNDS FOR MINNESOTA'S FIRST RESPONDERS FOR TERRORISM, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING, EQUIPMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton cosponsored and voted for an amendment (S.A.1112) late last night that would restore full funding for first responder grant programs to their fiscal year 2005 appropriated levels. The amendment was offered to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006, in order to restore funds which were cut in President Bush's proposed budget. The Administration's proposal would have eliminated a total of $597 million from the fiscal year 2005 levels for various first responder programs. The amendment failed by a vote of 42-55.  
   "First responders are not expecting the federal government to fund all of their activities, but they are expecting the federal government to be consistent in providing resources for those additional efforts," said Dayton. "The grants are vital to helping Minnesota first responders acquire the necessary equipment and training to respond to emergencies." 
   Due to the additional burden on local agencies since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many Minnesota fire departments rely on funds from FIRE Act and state formula grants to hire additional personnel, buy new fire trucks, radios, and other equipment, and establish general fire-prevention programs. Last year, Minnesota received $17 million from this program. 
   To cover the 2006 budget cuts, the amendment would: 
   * Increase the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP)/Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) funding for state and local assistance grants used for training, equipment, exercises, and technical assistance to improve readiness for potential terrorism incidents. 
   * Increase funding to the Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) that coordinates the efforts of local law enforcement, firefighters, HAZMAT teams, and EMS, hospital, public health, and other personnel to improve all-hazards response capabilities. 
   * Increase funding to the FIRE Act which sends grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. 
   * Fund other first responder programs, not mentioned, above at FY05 levels.
