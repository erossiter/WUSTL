SEN. DAYTON CALLS ON CONGRESS TO ADDRESS REAL ENERGY REFORM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today called for real energy reform to address soaring gas prices, instead of attempts to dress up an offshore oil drilling bill and call that the answer to America's foreign oil dependence. The Republican House leadership today, for its long-awaited "Energy Week," brought to the House floor a bill that would weaken the current ban on offshore oil drilling along the U.S. coastlines. 
   "That's it. That's evidently the House's plan to provide relief for Americans from the high cost of energy. Not the slightest mention of the role that renewable fuels might play in solving this energy crisis," said Dayton. "Ethanol and biodiesel are here today; they are ready for consumers, and automakers are ready with the vehicles."
   Dayton said it doesn't make sense that alternative energy isn't part of the discussion. The additional oil produced from expanded offshore oil drilling won't even be available to consumers for years.
   "Americans don't have a decade to wait," Dayton said.
   Dayton recently introduced the Renewable Fuels Promotion Act (S.2812) that would ensure that biofuels, like ethanol and biodiesel-- clean burning gasoline alternatives, made from corn and other crops--are widely available to consumers. The bill would eliminate barriers for service station owners to install the pumps. The bill would also require the federal government to install a renewable fuel pump at every federal fueling station nationwide, in response to Department of Energy reports that renewable fuels made up less than one percent of the federal government's total fuel usage in 2004. Despite a 2000 Executive Order requiring the federal agencies to reduce petroleum consumption by 20 percent of 1999 levels, the government has succeeded in reducing petroleum consumption by just 0.6 percent.
   Summary of the Dayton Renewable Fuels Promotion Act:
   * Bans oil company directives and franchise contract provisions that prohibit the sale of renewable fuels anywhere on the gas station premises.
   * Requires every federal fleet fueling station to make available at least one renewable fuel pump and authorizes the funds to install them.
   * Requires the President to report to Congress each year its progress in complying with: the bill's federal fleet renewable fuel pump mandate; the 2000 Executive Order that mandated a 20 percent reduction in petroleum consumption; and the 1992 Energy Policy Act requirement that 75 percent of all new federal fleet vehicle purchases be alternative fuel vehicles.
