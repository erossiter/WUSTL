SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $888,000 FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN DULUTH
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Duluth will receive $888,385 in federal funding to help improve emergency homeless shelters and to expand affordable housing. The money is provided by the Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) and HOME program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
   "Often, access to adequate, affordable housing can mean the difference between a family, even a community, flourishing or floundering," said Dayton. "I am delighted that Duluth will receive this money to help improve housing and combat homelessness." 
   The Emergency Shelter Grant Program funds renovations and the conversion of buildings into emergency shelters. Funding may also include employment, health, drug abuse and education services. The ESG Program is allocated to state and local governments on a formula basis. Each year the HOME program awards $2 billion to state and local governments. These programs enable communities to rehabilitate and operate emergency shelters; buy, build, and rehabilitate affordable housing; and run prevention assistance to those at risk of homelessness. 
   Over 500 residents are homeless in Northeastern Minnesota, according to the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation's most recent 2003 study on homelessness. Statewide, it reported that 20,347 are homeless or at risk for becoming homeless. Homeless women and children greatly outnumber homeless men. One-quarter of homeless adults have children with them in metropolitan shelters, and one-third of homeless adults have children with them in greater Minnesota shelters.
