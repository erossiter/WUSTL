SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATHS OF MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARDSMEN IN IRAQ
  "All of us mourn the tragic deaths of the Minnesotans killed this week in Iraq. Their patriotism and heroism were extraordinary, as they gave their lives in the effort to rescue their wounded comrades. 
   I have spoken with their families and offered any possible assistance. Although my words were inadequate, I told them how proud they should be of these American heroes, and I expressed how grateful their fellow citizens are for the patriotic service of these young guardsmen."
