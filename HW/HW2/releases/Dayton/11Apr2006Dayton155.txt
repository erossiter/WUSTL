SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $300,000 TO COMBAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today a federal grant of $305,573 to the University of Minnesota's Office on Violence Against Women. The grant is administered under the U.S. Department of Justice, and will include funding for critical support services for African American women who are victims of domestic violence.  
   "This funding will help our state to continue to respond to the needs of domestic violence victims," said Dayton. "Domestic violence is a threat to every community in Minnesota. It's crucial that we provide the support women need to feel safe, to avoid future violence, and to rebuild their lives." 
   "This grant will be used to examine sexual assault in the African American community. We plan to hold a conference to focus on developing efforts that best support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and methods to best confront the perpetrators," said Oliver Williams, director of the University of Minnesota Institute on Domestic Violence. "We want to help people heal from the effects of sexual assault and domestic violence." 
   The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) Technical Assistance Program provides grantees with the expertise and support they need to increase victim safety and increase offender accountability. Through cooperative agreements, OVW supports educational initiatives, conferences, peer-to-peer consultations, and targeted assistance that allow grantees to learn how to overcome obstacles and incorporate promising practices in their efforts to address violence against women.
