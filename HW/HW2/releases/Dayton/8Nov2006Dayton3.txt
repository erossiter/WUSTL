SEN. DAYTON: $1.2 MILLION FOR HEALTHCARE IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) will receive $1,203,274 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The award will be used to provide maternal and child health services.  
   "Receiving necessary healthcare should never depend on how much money a person has," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this funding will be used to make healthcare more affordable for new mothers." 
   The funding is part of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant, an annual award distributed as multiple partial payments. The total 2007 MCH Block Grant awarded to MDH approximates $9,000,000. 
   The MCH Program was enacted in Title V of the Social Security Act of 1935 to serve as a health services safety net for all women and children.
