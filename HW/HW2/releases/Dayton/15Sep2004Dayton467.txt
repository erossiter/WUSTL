ON 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, SEN. DAYTON RECALLS SEN. WELLSTONE, MRS. WELLSTONE'S COMMITMENT TO ENDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today observed the 10th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a bill championed by the late Minnesota Sen.  
 Paul Wellstone and his wife, Sheila. In an address to members of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Dayton paid special tribute to the Wellstones for their passionate advocacy and support of VAWA. Dayton also praised the law which has improved the lives of thousands of women and children throughout the country.
   "As we observe this tremendous anniversary, let us remember two incredible people - Paul and Sheila Wellstone - who were deeply committed to the protection of our families and the termination of domestic violence in our communities," said Dayton. "There is no doubt Paul and Sheila would continue to champion this noble cause if they were with us today. I am very proud to celebrate this legislation which protects our nation's women and children from the horrors of domestic abuse."
   Since its enactment in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has benefited thousands of women and children. The act has increased the number of programs and shelter services available to victims, provided resources to prosecutors and police officers investigating domestic violence cases, and created a national toll-free hotline to report abuses and receive counseling.
