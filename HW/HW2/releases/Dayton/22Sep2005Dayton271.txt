SEN. DAYTON SECURES $6.5 MILLION FOR DULUTH AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE IN MILITARY SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Mark Dayton, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, today pushed through the Senate $6.5 million for the 148th Fighter Wing of the Duluth Air National Guard Base.  
 The funding, which is part of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 (H.R. 2528), will be used to complete the next phase of a fire station that will serve both the Duluth International Airport and the Guard Station. The bill, which was approved in the Senate by a vote of 98 to 0, will now go to the joint House and Senate Conference Committee. Since Dayton's election to the Senate in 2000, he has delivered over $40 million to the Duluth Air National Guard Base. 
   "The Duluth Air National Guard Base is vital to our national defense," said Dayton. "I have made its renovations a top priority during my four - and - a - half years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am extremely pleased by the approval of these funds to continue construction of a new fire station, which will serve both the Guard's base and the Duluth International Airport." 
   The $6.5 million will finance an addition to the Joint FAA/Air National Guard Fire Station Facility, currently under construction, to provide space for all fire operations at the airfield. The new addition will include a control room, training and administrative spaces, facilities for personnel who are on call for 24/7 operations, and eight apparatus bays. Upon completion of the new Air National Guard Fire Station Facility, the existing old "main fire station" will be used to support the organization's security forces squadron.
