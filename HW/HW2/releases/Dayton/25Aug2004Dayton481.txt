SEN. DAYTON INVITES MINNESOTANS TO APPLAUD THEIR FAVORITE TEACHER AT HIS LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE STATE FAIR BOOTH
  Sen. Mark Dayton encourages Minnesotans attending the State Fair this year to stop by his booth, which resembles a little red schoolhouse, to honor their favorite teacher.  
 Minnesota students, past and present, who stop by Dayton's booth will have the opportunity to send a written note of appreciation to their all-time favorite teacher. The Senator's office will then make every effort to mail these notes directly to the teacher. Additionally, Dayton will send his own personal note of appreciation to the educator, thanking them for having made a positive impact on a Minnesota student. This fall, Dayton will also recognize all honored teachers in a Senate floor speech. While No Child Left Behind and the Minnesota Department of Education's Star Rankings focus on the perceived failings of Minnesota schools, Dayton wants to draw attention to the thousands of very talented and dedicated teachers who are appreciated by their students long after they have left the classroom.
   Minnesotans unable to stop by Dayton's State Fair booth can send a note to their favorite teacher by emailing their request to teacher@dayton.senate.gov, or by calling his office at (612) 727-5220 or (888) 224-9043.
