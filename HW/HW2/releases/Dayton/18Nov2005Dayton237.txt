SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR FARMERS STRUGGLING WITH HIGH ENERGY COSTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton last night introduced legislation that would ease the pain of this year's unprecedented energy prices for farmers. Dayton's amendment (S.A. 2629) to the Tax Reconciliation bill (S. 2020) would provide a federal tax credit to farmers for 30 percent of their 2005 energy costs, up to $3,000 per farmer. The measure failed last night by a vote of 47 to 51.  
   "Before we go home to our Thanksgiving feasts, Congress ought to give thanks to the farmers that put food on our tables," said Dayton. "2005 has been a hard year for farmers across the country - soaring energy prices have eaten into their profits, and unlike other small business owners, farmers can't pass on those high costs to their customers. The federal government should provide emergency assistance in the form of a tax credit for energy expenses." 
   Farmers could receive the tax credit on their costs for fuel, energy utility, natural gas, fertilizer, and heating oil used in the farming business. Dayton's amendment is offset by closing a tax loophole that gives a foreign oil and gas income tax credit for oil companies. 
   Last week, nationwide diesel prices averaged 30 percent above one year ago. Prices for natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer have nearly doubled since last year. In addition to skyrocketing energy costs, many farmers have been hit with higher transportation costs. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, shipping costs on the Mississippi River have been the highest in history. 
   "Unlike many businesses, farmers have no ability to pass their higher costs of production on to their customers," said Dayton. "Two dollars per bushel corn does not pay for shipping costs of 70 cents per bushel and higher energy bills. American farmers desperately need relief."
