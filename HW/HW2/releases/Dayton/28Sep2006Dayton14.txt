SEN. DAYTON: OVER $88K COMING TO GREEN ISLE FIRE, RESCUE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that $88,258 is coming to the Green Isle Fire and Rescue, to pay for fire operations and fire safety. The funds are being awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  
   "The brave men and women who work tirelessly everyday to protect our homes and neighborhoods deserve the best training and equipment available," said Dayton. "I am pleased this funding will provide Green Isle's firefighters with the resources they need to do their jobs and keep their community safe." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the 25th round of awards this year, with Minnesota receiving over $15 million. 
   Due to the additional burden on local agencies since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many Minnesota fire departments rely on funds from FIRE Act and state formula grants to hire additional personnel, buy new fire trucks, radios, and other equipment, and establish general fire-prevention programs.
