SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $4.6 MILLION RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN TO PROVIDE INTERNET SERVICE IN SOUTHEASTERN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Jaguar Communications, Inc., in Owatonna, will receive a $4,641,000 loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Economic Development Loan program. The loan will provide broadband internet services to more than 6,000 residential and business customers in Southeast Minnesota. The broadband loan program was created in the 2002 Farm Bill to specifically target rural areas and ensure they received affordable and quality internet access, just like their more urban neighbors.  
   "I am delighted that Jaguar Communications received this assistance," said Dayton. "Having cost-effective, high speed internet access is vital to small businesses and rural residents." Jaguar Communications, Inc. will use the loan funding to construct an eight county system in southeast Minnesota utilizing wireless, digital subscriber lines (DSL) and Fiber to the Home technology. When the system is completed, it will provide varying degrees of voice, data and video broadband service to more than six thousand residential and business customers. Jaguar Communications is a community backed company, with small business owners, farmers, college professors and other small investors from the area comprising its stockholders.
