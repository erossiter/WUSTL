SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $315,000 IN COPS GRANTS TO KEEP MINNESOTA'S SCHOOLS SAFE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that eight Minnesota communities have been awarded over $315,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), to improve security at local schools.  
 The funds, issued under the Secure Our Schools program, will be used to purchase new metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other equipment that helps keep students and teachers safe.
   "Our children should always feel safe in their own schools," said Dayton. "The COPS grants will allow several Minnesota communities to equip their schools with the security tools they need to prevent violence in our schools, ensuring a safe learning environment for students, teachers, and administrators."
   Secure Our Schools program grants provide up to 50 percent of the total cost for communities to buy and install equipment to deter crime at schools. These funds can also be used for security training and other measures that promote student safety.
   Communities receiving funding include:
   Apple Valley Police Department - $50,000
   City of Fairmont - $45,000
   Fridley Police Department - $36,466
   Minnetonka Police Department - $44,410
