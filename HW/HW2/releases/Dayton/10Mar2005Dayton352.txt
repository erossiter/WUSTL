SEN. DAYTON VOTES AGAINST BANKRUPTCY BILL
  Sen. Mark Dayton voted this evening against the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (S.256), which passed the Senate by a final vote of 74-25.  
 The legislation was introduced last month to prevent bankruptcy abuse and make it more difficult for consumers to escape debt by filing for bankruptcy. 
   Numerous amendments were offered by Democratic members to the bankruptcy bill were defeated which would have provided individuals who have been forced to file for bankruptcy due to medical expenses, job loss, identity theft, or other extenuating circumstances from exemption to the means test portion of the bill. 
   "The bankruptcy bill is an abomination. It does nothing to protect consumers, as its title claims, nor does it reflect the urgent need to address corporate bankruptcy abuse and predatory lending practices," said Dayton. "This bill attacks working Americans, many of whom have been thrown into dire financial straights, through no fault of their own, by uncovered medical expenses or loss of a job. While it professes to be a consumer protection bill, in reality, it is a credit card company profit assurance plan. 
   "Three-fourths of the Senate voted against my consumer protection amendment, which would have capped interest rates at a still absurdly high 30 percent. It is a sad, sad commentary on the priorities of the United States Senate that people are not going to be protected, but profits are." 
   In addition to offering an amendment which would cap interest rates charged by all lenders at 30 percent, Dayton also co-sponsored three separate amendments which would have stopped companies filing for bankruptcy from denying retirees their earned health and pension benefits. All measures were voted down by the Republican majority.
