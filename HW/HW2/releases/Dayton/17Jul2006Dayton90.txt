SEN. DAYTON: DAKOTA, ANOKA, RAMSEY COUNTIES TO RECEIVE OVER $6.7 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Anoka, Dakota and Ramsey Counties will receive $6,716,916 in federal funding for projects that will expand affordable housing options, create new businesses, and promote home ownership opportunities. The three counties will receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) awards - $1,484,895 (Anoka County), $1,759,425 (Dakota County), and $1,075,654 (Ramsey County) - and Dakota County will receive an additional $457,347 for the American Dream Down Payment Initiative (ADDI), which is part of the HOME program. The funding is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
   "Community Development Block Grants are vital in helping Minnesota neighborhoods provide essential services and affordable housing." said Dayton "I will continue to work hard to ensure that funding for CDBG is preserved." 
   CDBG funds develop viable communities by providing housing, a suitable living environment, and increased economic opportunities primarily for persons of low and moderate income. Currently, Dayton is working to ensure that CDBG is fully funded in the FY 2007 budget, despite President Bush's proposal to reduce the formula funding by an additional 25 percent, thereby cutting the formula allocation by over a third in just three years. 
   ADDI is a new initiative under the HOME Program that helps to promote homeownership opportunities by providing necessary resources for downpayment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority families.
