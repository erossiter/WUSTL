SEN. DAYTON CALLS FOR PERMANENT FLOOD CONTROL IN NORTHWESTERN MINNESOTA
  As residents of the Red River Valley continue to recover from another round of devastating floods, Sen. Mark Dayton today expressed the urgent need for permanent flood control in the region. 
   "Today, I received a letter from the City Council of Ada, which began 'Enough is enough!,' and I agree," said Dayton. "Communities throughout Northwestern Minnesota have sunk hundreds of millions of dollars and man hours into flood recovery and mitigation, only to watch their efforts run down the Red River the following spring. It is time to invest in permanent flood control; it is long overdue."
   For the last decade, communities throughout Northwestern Minnesota have battled floods, which caused widespread evacuations and extensive property damage. Despite repeated requests by local, state, and federal officials, little federal funding has been made available for permanent flood control projects.
   The lack of funds has created a vicious and costly cycle in the Red River Valley. Many towns that receive federal aid get only enough to complete a portion of their permanent flood control projects. As a result, the community is still vulnerable to flood damage, and the partially completed projects are often destroyed. Some communities, such as Roseau and Breckenridge, have been waiting years to receive the funds they need to complete their projects. Though it falls short of Northwestern Minnesota's needs, Dayton has secured over $1.2 billion for flood control projects in the region. Dayton says he will remain vigilant in the fight to secure urgently needed funding for permanent flood control in the Red River Valley.
