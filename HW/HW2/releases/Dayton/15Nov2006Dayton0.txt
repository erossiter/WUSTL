SEN. DAYTON RAISES CONCERNS WITH U.S. MILITARY COMMANDERS' VERACITY ON IRAQ WAR
  Sen. Mark Dayton today raised concerns at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Iraq that U.S. Generals may have failed to give the Committee honest assessments on military needs in Iraq and instead towed the line of the Bush Administration. Dayton questioned General John Abizaid on earlier statements he had made before the Committee and what he privately told others about what we need to do to win this war, according to recent books, State of Denial and Fiasco. 
   "I don't question for a minute our shared desire to win this conflict?but, I find here, consistent contradictions of upbeat statements of agreement with the Secretary of Defense about these major decisions being pursued here again today, the question of troop strength. Again and again these books attest that you and some of the other military commanders believed that we needed more troops. I don't know what to believe sir, when I hear these contradictions," Dayton said.
   Dayton stated that he has relied on the assessments and recommendations of military commanders for his legislative decision-making and was appalled to read that General Abizaid and other commanders were not as candid as they promised to be with Congress on conditions in Iraq and their recommendations.
   Abizaid would not comment on the book, but said he has always told the Committee his official position on what resources are needed to secure Iraq and eliminate the growing insurgency.
