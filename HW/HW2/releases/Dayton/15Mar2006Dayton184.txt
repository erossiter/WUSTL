SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS ST. PAUL-BASED 3M FOR WINNING 3RD CONSECUTIVE ENERGY STAR AWARD
  Sen. Mark Dayton today congratulated 3M, headquartered in St. Paul, on winning the Energy Star Partners of the Year award, for a third year in a row. The award, presented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), honors businesses that have gone above and beyond in protecting the environment through energy efficient products and practices. 
   "Congratulations to 3M on winning its third straight Energy Star Partners of the Year award!" said Dayton. "In addition to producing environmentally sound products, 3M is a national leader in promoting energy conservation. Everyone at 3M should be tremendously proud of their accomplishments."
   3M has created a website and newsletters on energy management, and regularly features its energy program and energy goals in its internal newspaper. The company also created an Energy Awareness Month for all employees and uses 3M TV to regularly broadcast the importance of energy management.
   The EPA's Energy Star program is a voluntary public/private that works with manufacturers, utilities, and retailers to help the environment through responsible energy policies. The Energy Star label can now be found on various products, as well as new homes, schools, and commercial buildings. Using Energy Star products, Americans saved enough energy in 2005 to power 24 million homes.
