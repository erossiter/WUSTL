SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today voted in favor of compromise legislation regarding the Patriot Act. This key legislation to impose limits on government powers regarding civil liberties passed with a 95 to 4 vote. The legislation (S.2271) was the result of negotiations between Congress and the White House regarding an earlier version of the bill, which had raised bipartisan concerns about its potential effect on the civil liberties of Americans. The measure, although not perfect, aims to address those concerns. The House of Representatives is expected to pass the compromise, and a vote on the final version to extend the Patriot Act is expected to occur in the Senate later this week.  
   Senator Dayton's statement on his vote to extend the Patriot Act is below. 
   "I am reluctantly voting for an extension of the Patriot Act, despite its significant flaws. I do so, because federal and local law enforcement officials in Minnesota have told me repeatedly that the Patriot Act's provisions are critically important to their abilities to detect and prevent another terrorist attack against the United States. Protecting our citizens is the paramount responsibility of the federal government, and we must give our protectors the capabilities they need."
