SEN. DAYTON PUSHES TO ALLOW MILITARY FAMILIES TO USE FAMILY, MEDICAL LEAVE ACT BENEFITS
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton joined with several of his Senate colleagues to introduce legislation that would allow military family members to take paid and/or unpaid time off for certain family and medical reasons.  
 This legislation would apply to family members who already qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and who are facing family or medical problems arising from a loved one's deployment. Since the enactment of FMLA ten years ago, the deployment of military personnel has increased dramatically, with a corresponding increase in the demands placed on their families. 
   "This legislation will enable many working wives and husbands to be with their military spouses during their brief leaves - often the only time they can be together for over a year," said Dayton. "I have met with hundreds of Minnesotans with family members serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. These men and women, like their loved ones overseas, are enduring tremendous sacrifices in service of our country. They need and deserve our help to keep their families together during these difficult separations." 
   This bill has been endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, and the National Partnership for Women & Families.
