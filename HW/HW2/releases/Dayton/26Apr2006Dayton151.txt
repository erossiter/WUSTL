SEN. DAYTON: NORTHEAST MINNESOTA TO RECEIVE NEARLY $200,000 TO COMBAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today a federal grant of $193,615 to Praxis International of Duluth for the Violence Against Women Technical Assistance Program. The grant is administered under the U.S. Department of Justice, and will include funding for training and technical assistance programs to Latina and American Indian women in rural areas who are victims of domestic violence.  
   "This funding will help our state to continue to respond to the needs of domestic violence victims," said Dayton. "Domestic violence is a threat to every community in Minnesota. It's crucial that we provide the support women need to feel safe, to avoid future violence, and to rebuild their lives." 
   The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) Technical Assistance Program provides grantees with the expertise and support they need to increase victim safety. Technical assistance through OVW is tailored to meet the specific needs of domestic violence practitioners, programs and community collaborators operating in rural areas. Through a cooperative agreement with Praxis International, Inc., technical assistance includes developing a Latino institute training program, convening tribal institute training, developing Advocacy for Children of Native Women training, and providing direct technical assistance to grantees. 
   Praxis International, Inc. is a nonprofit research and training organization that works toward the elimination of violence in lives of women and children.
