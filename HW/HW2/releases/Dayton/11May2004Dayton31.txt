SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON MURDER OF NICHOLAS BERG
  Statement of Sen. Mark Dayton the murder of Mr. Nicholas Berg, an American civilian in Iraq: 
   The beheading of an American civilian, Mr. Nicholas Berg, was a horrible, despicable act. It is also despicable that his murderers are trying to blame their crime on the United States. Nothing justifies murder.
   It is also shocking that some people here are trying to blame the public disclosures of Iraqi prisoners abuses for Mr. Berg's murder, rather than the abuses themselves. Their solution, censorship in the public interest, has been tried before with even more disastrous consequences. Censorship is antithetical to democracy. The truth makes us and keeps us free.
   My heartfelt condolences go out to Mr. Berg's family and loved ones.
