SEN. DAYTON: ST. PAUL RECEIVES OVER $10.8 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that St. Paul will receive $10,895,140 in federal funding for projects that will expand affordable housing options, create new businesses, and improve emergency homeless shelters. The grant awards - $8,211,748 in Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), $2,291,390 in the HOME Program, $348,842 in Emergency Shelter Grants and $43,160 in the American Dream Downpayment Initiative Program (ADDI) - are administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
   "This federal funding will support a broad range of critical services for St. Paul residents who otherwise may not be able to afford housing," said Dayton.
   The CDBG program helps communities nationwide meet the challenges of providing affordable housing; making public improvements, such as maintaining flood and drainage facilities; building senior centers, libraries, and water/sewer projects; and fostering economic development.
   Each year the HOME program awards $2 billion to state and local governments. These programs enable communities to rehabilitate and operate emergency shelters; buy, build, and rehabilitate affordable housing; and run prevention assistance to those at risk of homelessness.
   The Emergency Shelter Grant Program funds renovations and the conversion of buildings into emergency shelters. Funding may also include employment, health, drug abuse and education services. The ESG Program is allocated to state and local governments on a formula basis. ADDI is a new initiative under the HOME Program that will help to promote homeownership opportunities by providing necessary resources for downpayment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority families.
