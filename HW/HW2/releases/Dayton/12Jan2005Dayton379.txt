  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that five Minnesota fire departments have been awarded over $525,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used to purchase new equipment and firefighting vehicles, improve fire station facilities, and support firefighter training and wellness programs.
