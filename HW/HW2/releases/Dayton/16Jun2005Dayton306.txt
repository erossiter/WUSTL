SEN. DAYTON URGES MINNESOTANS WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR LOANS BY JULY 1
  Sen. Mark Dayton today urged borrowers with student loan debt to immediately determine whether they are eligible to consolidate their federal school loans.  
 Consolidation is necessary to avoid an impending interest-rate increase of 2 percentage points, which will take effect on July 1st. 
   On that date, loan interest rates for borrowers with Stafford loans will increase to 4.7 percent for borrowers who are in school or in a grace or deferment period and increase to 5.3 percent for borrowers in repayment or forbearance for any loan disbursed on or after July 1, 1998. For those with PLUS loans, rates will also increase, from the current 4.17 percent to 6.10 percent. The rate increase will be the first in recent years for student loans. 
   "It is financially wise for many students with student loan debts to lock in lower-interest rates, by consolidating their federal student loans now," said Dayton. "Student loan interest rates will increase on July 1st, so I urge Minnesotans with student loans to find out quickly whether they can consolidate their loans and whether they would benefit from doing so." 
   Under current law, the interest rate for most loans is capped at 8.25 percent or 9 percent, depending on the type of loan. Not all types of loans are eligible for consolidation and certain other restrictions apply. 
   To determine your eligibility for consolidation, please contact the Department of Education at 1-800-557-7392, or your lending institution.
