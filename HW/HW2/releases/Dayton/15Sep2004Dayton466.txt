SEN. DAYTON: OVER $5.1 MILLION FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Minnesota has been awarded over $5.1 million in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 The funding, provided through USDA's Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program, will enable Minnesota farmers, ranchers, and small businesses to develop renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements in their present operations. 
   "Minnesota continues to lead the way in developing renewable fuels and energy sources," said Dayton. "I am pleased this federal funding will help farmers and small businesses throughout Minnesota make significant investments in renewable energy and in the process, spur economic growth in our rural communities." 
   The Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program, created as part of the 2002 Farm Bill, supports developing or improving wind power, anaerobic digester, solar, ethanol and other bioenergy related systems or energy efficiency improvements. A large portion of the grants awarded will be used to support anaerobic digesters and wind power ventures.
