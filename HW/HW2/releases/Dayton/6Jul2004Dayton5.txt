USDA AGREES TO SEN. DAYTON'S REQUEST FOR CANADIAN BEEF INVESTIGATION; ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY MAY HAVE JEOPARDIZED FOOD SAFETY
  The Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has agreed to an investigation requested by Sens.  
 Mark Dayton, Tom Daschle (D-SD), and Tom Harkin (D-IA), all members of the Senate Agriculture Committee. In her letter of response to the Senators late last week, Inspector General Phyllis Fong confirmed that her Office would pursue a probe into the Senators' concerns that Bush Administration officials at the USDA "did not follow appropriate safety measures sometime in the fall of 2003, in allowing expanded Canadian beef imports into the United States." Dayton has heard from many Minnesotans who worry that USDA has not done enough to protect the safety of American's food supply.
   "Minnesota's cattle producers cannot compete with imported beef that doesn't even meet USDA's own standards," Dayton said. "Additionally, Minnesota consumers shouldn't have to worry about the safety the food they serve their families."
   When the Senators called for the investigation on April 24th, they did so in an effort to determine why, after the discovery of mad cow disease in Canadian cattle, Bush Administration officials relaxed food safety standards on imported, high-risk beef products. The Administration took these steps without informing Congress or the public.
   "I just cannot understand why the Administration would put the health of millions of American in jeopardy through cross-contamination. We need to get to the bottom of this, so it does not happen again in the future."
