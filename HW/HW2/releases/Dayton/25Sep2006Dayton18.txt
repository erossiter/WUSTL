SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $5 MILLION FOR NORTHSTAR CORRIDOR RAIL PROJECT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minnesota Department of Transportation will receive a total of $4,917,912 from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The funds are administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and will be used to advance the Northstar Corridor project, by designing commuter rail stations and maintenance facilities. Dayton has been a longtime advocate for the Northstar Corridor project and has worked to secure federal resources to move it forward. 
   "This funding is a critical to help the Twin Cities develop a state-of-the art transportation system," said Dayton. "Once completed, the Northstar Corridor project will help to alleviate traffic congestion by providing an environmentally friendly transportation alternative." 
   The funding will be used to obtain materials necessary for the advance designs of commuter rail stations and maintenance facilities, and for a four-block extension on the northwest end of the Hiawatha Light Rain Transit (LRT) to reach the downtown Minneapolis commuter rail station. 
   The Northstar corridor will link downtown Minneapolis to the northern metropolitan suburbs and the City of St. Cloud. It will use existing railroad tracks owned by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) and include six stations: Big Lake, Elk River, Anoka, Coon Rapids, Fridley and Minneapolis. With the exception of the downtown Minneapolis station, all of the stations will have park and ride facilities.
