SEN. DAYTON: $500K FOR RURAL FIREFIGHTERS IN LINDSTROM, MILACA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that fire departments in the communities of Milaca and Lindstrom will receive a total of $500,000 in federal loans from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development's Rural Economic Development loan and grant program. Milaca will receive $300,000 and Lindstrom, $200,000.  
   "Minnesota's firefighters risk their own safety to protect our citizens and our neighborhoods," said Dayton. "I am delighted that these heroes will receive the assistance and equipment they need to help them do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible." 
   The USDA funding, loaned through East Central Energy, will be used to help Milaca renovate two existing buildings into a new fire hall, and to provide Lindstrom Fire Department with new equipment including outfitting their new fire truck.
