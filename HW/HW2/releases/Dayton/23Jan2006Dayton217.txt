SEN. DAYTON: ST. PAUL, FRIDLEY TO RECEIVE $145K FOR TRAIL IMPROVEMENTS ALONG MISSISSIPPI RIVER
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that $145,000 in federal funding is coming to the Twin Cities, for improvements to regional trails along the Mississippi River. The City of St. Paul Parks and Recreation Department will receive $97,000, and the Anoka County Parks and Recreation Department will receive $48,000, in grants provided by the National Park Service (NPS). 
   "More than 360,000 outdoor enthusiasts travel these trails each year," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this grant money will preserve and improve them for many future generations of Minnesotans." 
   Currently, in St. Paul, bicyclists and pedestrians along the Mississippi River must use a narrow roadway that runs through Lilydale-Harriet Island Regional Park. The NPS grant will be used to construct a new 1.37-mile trail, which will link to existing trails at Harriet Island and the Big River Regional Trail. The project is designed to improve pedestrian safety and to protect the integrity of the Lilydale wetlands. 
   In Fridley, the Anoka County Parks and Recreation Department will use the NPS grant to replace a section of trail in Riverfront Regional Park, south of Interstate 694. The new trail will replace a three-mile section of deteriorated trail, which will be recycled and the site restored to natural conditions. 
   The two trail segments are located within the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a unit of the National Park System that includes 72 miles of the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities. Both projects are expected to be constructed this year.
