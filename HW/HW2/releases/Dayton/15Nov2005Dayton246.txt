SEN. DAYTON, SENATE COLLEAGUES CALL FOR CLEAR, EFFECTIVE STRATEGY ON IRAQ WAR, BRINGING TROOPS HOME
  Sen. Mark Dayton today voted with his Senate colleagues for legislation that would require the Bush Administration to give a progress report to Congress every three months on the Administration's strategy in Iraq and its plan to bring U.S. troops back home.  
 The amendment, introduced by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner (R-VA) and Senate Majority Leader Frist (R-TN), would require that the first progress report be due to Congress in 90 days. The measure passed by a vote of 79 to 19. 
   Dayton also voted for an almost identical amendment introduced by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Carl Levin (D-MI), and Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), which would have made the first progress report due to Congress in 30 days and also included a requirement for a timetable for withdrawal of troops to be included in those reports. The amendment failed by a vote of 40 to 58. 
   Said Dayton, "Since the beginning of the Iraq War, the U.S. Senate has provided every dollar requested for defense authorizations, appropriations, and supplementals, with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   "Despite this support, the Bush Administration has repeatedly failed to outline an effective strategy for winning the war. The Senate Democrats succeeded in getting our Republican colleagues to finally admit that this Administration lacks a strategy for victory and needs to develop one now."
