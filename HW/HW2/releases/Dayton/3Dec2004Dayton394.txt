SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $35 MILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS FOR MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Minnesota has been awarded over $35 million in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  
 The funding, provided through seven of the Department's grant programs, will be used to support emergency first responders, and improve state and local government's ability to respond to acts of terrorism and natural disasters.
   "Emergency responders are a vital first line of defense for the safety and protection of our communities," said Dayton. "These grants will help ensure that Minnesota's fire departments and local law enforcement agencies have the equipment, training, and resources they need to get their jobs done."
   To be eligible to receive funding through the Department of Homeland Security's grant programs, states were required to develop a long-term homeland security strategy and undertake a risk and capability assessment.
   Minnesota will receive funding for homeland security initiatives through the following DHS grant programs: 
   * State Homeland Security Grant program - $18,895,426 
   * Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program - $6,871,064
