SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES ST. CLOUD NATIVE'S APPOINTMENT TO U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton announced that St. Cloud native Danielle Marie Rogowski has been offered an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  
 Dayton nominated Rogowski for the appointment. 
   Danielle Marie Rogowski attended St. Cloud Apollo High School, where she was a member of the National Honor Society and the St. Cloud Apollo Girls Tennis team, which earned All-Conference honors. Rogowski was also an active member of the Apollo High School Marching Band and participated in the summer and winter color guard. 
   "I am very proud that Danielle has been appointed to the U.S. Air Force Academy," said Dayton. "Danielle is an outstanding student and a very well-rounded young woman. I have every confidence that she will meet the Academy's rigorous academic, military, and athletic challenges and will go on to serve honorably as an Air Force officer." 
   The Academy's intensely competitive selection process considers applicants' ability to meet high academic, extracurricular, and physical fitness standards. Upon graduation from the four-year institution, cadets are commissioned as officers in the Air Force. 
   Each year, Dayton considers it an honor to nominate Minnesotans to serve their country and broaden their education by attending one of the nation's military service academies. Students are encouraged to contact Dayton's Office in the spring of their junior year to begin the academy nomination process.
