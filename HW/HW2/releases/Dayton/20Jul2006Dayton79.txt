SEN. DAYTON PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today hailed Senate passage of the Voting Rights Reauthorization Act, legislation he cosponsored, which renews expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The bill passed overwhelmingly in the Senate by 98 to 0. 
   "We've come a long way since 1965, but we cannot ignore the fact that discrimination at the ballot box still exists," said Dayton. "That's why renewal of this Act is so important, to remain committed to the goal of full and equal access to the polls for every American."
   The bill reauthorizes expiring provisions of the landmark 1965 legislation for a period of 25 years. It authorizes the federal government to send election examiners and observers to certain jurisdictions where there is evidence of attempts to intimidate minority voters at the polls. In addition, the legislation renews Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to restore it to its original congressional intent, by authorizing the U.S. Attorney General to block the implementation of voting changes that are motivated by discriminatory purposes.
   The full title of the bill is "The Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006."
