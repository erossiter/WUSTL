SEN. DAYTON SECURES $650K FOR MINNESOTA YOUTH, VETERAN, EDUCATION INITIATIVES
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that $650,000 is coming to Minnesota for programs that provide essential educational and veterans' employment assistance and services for at-risk youth. Dayton worked to secure the funds, included as part of the FY2007 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill, which was approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations today. The bill will soon head to the full Senate for consideration. 
   "I am thrilled that funding for these valuable Minnesota programs has been included in the bill," said Dayton. "It is vital that we remain committed to helping all Minnesotans receive the educational and employment opportunities they deserve."
   Below are the programs for which Dayton secured funding in the bill:
   $300,000 for the Dakota County All Children Excel (ACE) Program. Dakota County will use the funds to partner with Ramsey County in the implementation of programs replicating All Children Excel. The goals of All Children Excel are to reduce problem behaviors, to increase school participation and success, and to prevent participants from entering the juvenile justice system.
   $200,000 for the Ramsey County All Children Excel (ACE) Program. Prevention goals focus on substance abuse, school dropouts, and chronic offending. Funds will be used for staffing, case management, mental health consultation and evaluations.
   $150,000 for the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) for its Veteran Re-entry Education program. The goal of this project is to secure the rapid civilian reemployment of all separating veterans in Minnesota, with special attention given to younger veterans and those who are medically discharged or disabled.
