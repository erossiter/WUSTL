SEN. DAYTON: $300,000 COMING TO HELP 24 CENTRAL MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES PLAN CITYWIDE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Initiative Foundation, based in Little Falls, will receive $300,000 in federal money from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The grant will fund the Healthy Community Partnership (HCP) program, which helps residents of low-income communities in central Minnesota to plan and lead citywide development projects. The grant will be used in 24 communities, including: Freeport, Mora, Hinckley, Onamia, Eagle Bend, Browerville, Clarissa, Garrison, Wahkon, Isle, Menahga, Burtrum, Henriette, Riverton, Brainerd, Milaca, Princeton, Pillager, and Pine County.  
   "The Healthy Community Partnership program is win-win," said Dayton. "I am delighted that these USDA funds will allow many more Minnesotans to simultaneously improve their own leadership and planning skills, while helping to improve their communities." 
   With the USDA grant, the Healthy Communities Partnership program will provide one year of leadership training for as many as 325 local leaders, from communities with populations below 50,000 and median household incomes below the state average. During the training, participants will develop their own initiatives for community-wide improvement projects. HCP provides each community with a grant to implement the projects. 
   Communities that have previously participated in the HCP program have completed a wide variety of projects, including: creating a citywide newsletter and website in Baxter; starting a Boys and Girls Club chapter in Cass Lake; creating a local farmers' market in Delano; and constructing a new community library in Nisswa.
