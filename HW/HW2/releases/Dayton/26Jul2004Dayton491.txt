  Sen. Mark Dayton today received a 'Lead on!' Award from Self Help for Hard of Hearing People, a national advocacy organization.  
 Dayton was recognized for championing the rights of Americans with disabilities, specifically for introducing legislation to make movies more accessible to the 28 million Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Dayton was one of several Members of Congress to receive an award at today's ceremony, celebrating the 14th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   "My legislation is about expanding public services and adding to the quality of life of the 28 million Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing," said Dayton. "I am hopeful that Congress will pass this legislation, which would provide theater owners and movie producers with tax incentives to make movies accessible to everyone."
   Said Mariana V. Nork, Senior Vice President for Development & Communications for the American Association of People with Disabilities: "In his first term in the Senate, Senator Dayton has proved a valuable ally for people with disabilities, and he has cosponsored legislative action that would improve funding or accessibility in the areas of education, Medicaid, veterans' affairs and captioning."
   Self Help for Hard of Hearing People, with over 10,000 members, is the nation's largest organization for people with hearing loss.
