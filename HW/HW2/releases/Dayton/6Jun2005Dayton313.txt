SEN. DAYTON CALLS FOR CONTINUED FEDERAL FUNDING TO FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION IN MINNESOTA
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton joined with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) in sending a letter to Senate Appropriators, urging that they provide at least $634 million in FY2006 funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program.  
 Local law enforcement agencies across the country need these dollars to fight the war on drugs. In Minnesota, 20 drug task force agencies currently depend on over $8.2 million in Byrne funding to target criminal trafficking and selling of drugs, including methamphetamines. The Dayton-Chambliss letter was signed by 43 other Senators. 
   "The Byrne Grant program funds local drug education and drug law enforcement programs, as well as task forces which are especially important in combating the rising rates of "meth" production and distribution in communities across Minnesota," said Dayton. "Any decrease in federal funding for this program will adversely impact local law enforcement's ability to keep "meth" and other deadly drugs off our streets and out of the hands of our children. 
   "I will continue to fight to restore the funding that our law enforcement agencies so desperately need." 
   Dayton's letter, which is supported by the National Sheriffs' Association and the National Narcotic Officers' Associations' Coalition, does not ask for an increase in funding; rather, it requests that Congress commit to nearly the same level of funding provided last year. Last year, the Byrne Grant program was combined with the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program and overall funding for the new program was reduced. In his FY2006 budget, the President proposed eliminating funding for the new Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program.
