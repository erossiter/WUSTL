SEN. DAYTON: $190K COMING TO LAC QUI PARLE COUNTY AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Lac Qui Parle County Airport will receive a total of $190,000 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration. 
   "This grant will ensure that the Lac Qui Parle County Airport has reliable equipment to meet the burden of snow removal during the winter," said Dayton. 
   The funding will be used to construct a new equipment building that will house the airport's snow removal equipment. This not only helps improve the safety of the airport, but will also improve equipment reliability and extend its useful life.
