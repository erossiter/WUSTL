SEN. DAYTON: SENATE DENIES WORKING AMERICANS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today rebuked his Republican colleagues for rejecting a measure to increase the minimum wage, despite the fact that it has been nearly 10 years since the last increase. Dayton pushed for the Democratic amendment, introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and cosponsored by Dayton, which would have increased the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour, over two years. The amendment received only 52 votes, 8 short of the 60 needed for passage. Currently, 53,000 Minnesotans earn the minimum wage. 
   "It is shameful that, for more than nine years, Republicans in the Senate have refused to increase the minimum wage for working Americans," said Dayton. "Meanwhile, during that same period, Congress has voted to increase its own members' salaries by over $30,000."
   The measure, offered as part of the 2007 Defense bill, would have raised the minimum wage by $2.10 in three stages: an increase from $5.15 to $5.85 after 60 days; from $5.85 to $6.55 after one year; and from $6.55 to $7.25 after two years. Dayton is a longtime advocate of increasing the minimum wage.
   The Minnesota legislature last year approved the state's first minimum wage increase since 1997, from $5.15 to $5.25 per hour for small employers and to $6.15 per hour for large employers. Twenty other states and the District of Columbia have also responded to Congress's inaction by raising state minimum wage levels.
   Currently, minimum wage employees working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, earn $10,700--$4,500 below the poverty line for a family of three. The real value of today's minimum wage is more than $4.00 below what it was in 1968; to have the same purchasing power, the minimum wage would have to increase to more than $9.26 per hour.
   Raising the minimum wage can make a dramatic difference for working families. For a fulltime, year-round worker, this wage increase would have added $4,370 in annual income. For a low income family, that kind of money would help pay for the power bill, childcare, and even tuition at a community college.
   History shows that raising the minimum wage has not had a negative impact on jobs or inflation. In the four years since the last increase in 1996, the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades. More than 12 million jobs were added, including 10 million new service industry jobs and more than 1.5 million retail jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
