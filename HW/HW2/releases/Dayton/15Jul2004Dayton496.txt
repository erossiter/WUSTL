SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON GOV. PAWLENTY'S PROPOSAL FOR HYBRID VEHICLES IN HOV LANES
  Statement by Sen. Mark Dayton on Governor Pawlenty's Proposal for Hybrid Vehicles in HOV Lanes 
   I favor opening up the HOV lanes to all vehicles, rather than special classes of vehicles. I also believe that this kind of gimcrackery is an awful substitute for a greatly expanded highway construction program throughout Minnesota.
   In Washington, President Bush has blocked the Senate-passed highway funding bill, which would increase Minnesota's share of the federal Highway Trust Fund by 82 percent, the largest increase of any state. In St. Paul, Governor Pawlenty and the legislature have failed to authorize highway construction bonds, which would multiply the number of projects that the increased federal funds could finance.
   Minnesota is in a transportation crisis, due to years of accumulated neglect. Desperate motorists need real solutions.
