SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $200K COMING TO LOWER SIOUX MDEWAKANTON COMMUNITY
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Lower Sioux Mdewakanton community will receive $196,640 in federal funding under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program. The Indian Housing Block Grant Program provides direct grants to tribal governments to provide affordable housing for American Indian communities.  
   "I am pleased that the Lower Sioux Mdewakanton community will benefit from this funding," Dayton said. "Affordable, safe housing should be available to all families." 
   The IHBG funds can be used for a variety of eligible affordable housing activities, such as modernization and operating assistance for low income housing, new construction, housing services, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that present creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. 
   IHBG is a formula grant that provides a range of affordable housing activities on Indian reservations and Indian areas. The block grant approach to housing for Native Americans was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA).
