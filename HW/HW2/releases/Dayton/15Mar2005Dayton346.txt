SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS REPUBLICAN ATTEMPT TO SLASH MEDICAID FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA'S NEEDIEST FAMILIES
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton urged the restoration of billions of dollars in Republican-proposed cuts to Medicaid funding in the fiscal year 2006 budget.  
   "The very neediest and most defenseless people in our state depend on Medicaid for their care," said Dayton. "Pulling numbers out of thin air and using them as a guide to drastically cut funding for this vital program, as the Republican Leadership has done, is a mistake." 
   In the budget which President Bush submitted to Congress last month, he proposed slashing Medicaid funding by more than $45 billion. According to Families USA, the President's proposed cuts will mean a loss of $712 million in federal assistance for Minnesota over the next 10 years. Families USA is a national, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works to achieve high-quality, affordable health care of all Americans. 
   The Medicaid program has helped our nation's most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens gain access to quality health care since 1965. Fifty-one million people, including nearly 480,000 Minnesotans, rely on Medicaid for health care coverage. 
   Dayton said, "We cannot give billions away in tax cuts for the super-wealthy and then turn around and try to balance the budget on the backs of our working poor. Because of the President's fiscal recklessness, our nation's most vulnerable citizens will suffer." 
   Medicaid funds support public hospitals, community health centers, nursing homes, home and community-based care providers, and physicians and nurses - all providers of health care to vulnerable Minnesotans.
