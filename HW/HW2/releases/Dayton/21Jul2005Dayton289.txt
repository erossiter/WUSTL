SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $5 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA TRANSIT, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Senate Committee on Appropriations has approved $5.45 million in federal aid for transit and economic development initiatives throughout Minnesota. Dayton, who pressed for the funding, said that it had been approved as part of the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and HUD Appropriations bill (H.R. 3058). This bill will soon go to the full Senate for a vote. Funding for highways and airports will be negotiated, once the bill goes to Conference, with the House.  
   "In recent years, Minnesota's population has increased faster than our economy and our public transportation systems," Dayton said. "These badly needed funds will create new opportunities for economic growth throughout the state and will help to update our mass transit for the 21st century." 
   The following is a list of programs for which Dayton secured funding in the Appropriations bill:
