SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION WATCHDOG AMENDMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today praised passage of a measure that ensures the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) retain its authority to protect the American taxpayer from waste, fraud and abuse in the Iraq Reconstruction effort. Since its inception in 2003, The SIGIR has saved American taxpayers nearly $2 billion and cost only $73 million. However, it was recently discovered that language was quietly inserted into the final conference of the 2007 Defense Authorization bill that would set October 2007 for the SIGIR authority to expire, which is long before Iraq reconstruction is expected to be completed. 
   "This backdoor removal of the Special Inspector General was disgraceful. We have seen case after case of waste and fraud by major U.S. contractors in Iraq. As long as we keep pouring American tax dollars into rebuilding Iraq, we must have independent oversight of the contractors spending that money," said Dayton, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a longtime advocate for strong oversight of contractor waste and fraud that has occurred in the Iraq rebuilding effort.
   The amendment by Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) to the 2007 Military VA Construction spending bill restores the sunset date for the SIGIR to 10 months after 80 percent of the money from the Iraq reconstruction fund is spent. The date is designed to provide independent oversight throughout the expenditure of reconstruction funds. According to Senator Collins's office, this is expected to be sometime in 2008. The amendment passed unanimously. Once the Senate approves the overall military construction bill, it heads to a joint House and Senate conference committee to work out the differences of the two versions of the legislation before final passage.
