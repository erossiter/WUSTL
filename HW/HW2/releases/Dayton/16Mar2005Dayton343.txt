SEN. DAYTON VOTES TO PROTECT ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE FROM OIL DRILLING
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton voted against opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to harmful oil drilling.  
 According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, opening ANWR to drilling would reduce U.S. imports by only three percent, thus challenging Republican lawmakers' contention that the drilling would substantially reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil. 
   "Opening Alaska's precious wildlife refuge to drilling is absolutely unnecessary," said Dayton. "Doing so would yield an insignificant amount of oil, while destroying the habitats of more than 250 species of fish and wildlife. The solution to our nation's dependence on foreign oil lies in expanding our use of renewable and alternative energy sources that are already available, such as ethanol. This corn-based fuel is readily available year-round in Minnesota, and it frequently costs less per gallon than gasoline." 
   Dayton, a longtime opponent of drilling in ANWR, introduced legislation earlier this year with Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) that would designate the coastal plain of ANWR as a federal wilderness area, thereby making it permanently off-limits to oil development. 
   Several years ago, Dayton visited ANWR's wild and pristine land with Minnesotan Will Steger. In March, 2001, he traveled with a Congressional delegation and Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton to tour ANWR and existing drilling sites in northern Alaska to view the emerging technologies available. Although Dayton was impressed with the technological progress the oil companies had made, he saw nothing to alter his view that ANWR should remain protected.
