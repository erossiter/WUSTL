SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS TO RESTORE $2.8 BILLION FOR AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS IN 2006 BUDGET
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton voted for an amendment to restore $2.8 billion in Republican-proposed cuts to agricultural programs in the Senate's 2006 budget resolution.  
 Last year, many of the same farm programs that are now on the chopping block provided much-needed assistance to over 100,000 Minnesota farmers and 115,000 needy families across Minnesota. 
   "The Republican proposal to slash funding for important farm programs will have a devastating impact on rural Minnesota," said Dayton. "It is unacceptable for the President to balance the budget on the backs of America's farmers and disadvantaged families." 
   Not only will farmers and ranchers be adversely affected by the Senate's proposal, nutrition assistance programs, such as the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, the food stamps program, and the National School Lunch Program, could face significant funding cuts under the Republican plan. Last year, hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans received vital assistance through these federally funded programs. 
   The Senate budget resolution which mirrors the President's own 2006 budget, proposes cutting billions in funding for agricultural programs across the country. This is despite the fact that those programs cost $16 billion less than originally estimated, when funding was authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill.
