SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton the Death of President Ronald Reagan 
   I join with my Senate colleagues and with my fellow Americans in paying tribute to our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. I never had the opportunity to meet Mr. Reagan, but I was strongly impressed by his demeanor of personal warmth and humanity. He was a "compassionate conservative." His heart was truly in his work, his policies, and his principles.
   His ability to place his humanity above ideology was one reason Mr. Reagan left office with one of the highest public approval ratings of any U.S. President in history. He had many successes during his terms in office, and he served his country with courage, warmth, and charm. I honor him for his distinguished service, and I mourn his passing. I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family.
   In tribute to him, I attended last night's service in the Capitol Rotunda, where he will lie in state, and I will attend his funeral at Washington National Cathedral tomorrow.
