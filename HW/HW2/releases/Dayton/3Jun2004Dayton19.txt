SEN. DAYTON JOINS FIRST-EVER SENATE HUNGER CAUCUS
  Today, on National Hunger Awareness Day, Sen. Mark Dayton became a member of the newly created Senate Hunger Caucus.  
 Despite the advancements in food growing technology and distribution, over 33 million Americans are hungry or at risk of hunger including 413,000* Minnesotans who lack access to enough food to meet their basic needs. 
   "Even though we are blessed with an abundant food supply, millions of Americans, including people across Minnesota, go hungry every day," said Dayton. "Hunger is not a concern just for the hungry, but for all of us. Just because hunger isn't felt in your household doesn't mean it doesn't affect your child's school, your church or workplace. It is our duty to help our fellow 413,000 Minnesotans who go to bed hungry every night.
   "I am honored to become a member of the Senate Hunger Caucus and hope my colleagues and I will create solutions to end the scourge of hunger." 
   The Senate Hunger Caucus will focus on:
   - Bringing awareness to problems associated with hunger, at home and around the world;
   - Informing senators and their staff about hunger and related issues;
   - Creating a coalition of Senators to support nonpartisan initiatives to combat hunger;
   - Serving as a vehicle for local, state, and national hunger nonprofits to communicate to Congress about hunger.
