SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF VETERANS' HEALTHCARE FUNDING
  Sen. Mark Dayton today praised the passage of legislation to an emergency spending bill to provide an additional $430 million in urgently needed funds to serve the nation's veterans under the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA). Dayton pushed for the amendment, introduced by Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-HI), which provides $148 million for counseling and mental health services, and $182 million for VA hospitals and networks. The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 84 to 13. 
   "It is unconscionable that we are asking our troops to risk their lives defending our country overseas, without adequately investing in their healthcare when they return home," said Dayton. "This amendment will help to ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they have earned."
   The amendment, of which Dayton is a cosponsor, is part of the FY2006 Supplemental Appropriations Bill (H.R.4939).
   Since 2000, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has been drastically under-funded, resulting in a $1 billion deficit in FY2005. Huge budget shortfalls remain in FY2006, while the number of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan in need of medical care continues to rise. The VA estimated that it would treat 110,000 returning veterans this year, but, to date, it has already treated 74,000.
   A substantial portion of the funding will go to the VA's Readjustment Counseling Service, as well as to treat veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. A recent Army study found that one in three servicemembers returning from combat will experience some sort of readjustment issue.
