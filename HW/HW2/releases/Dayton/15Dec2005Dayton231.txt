SEN. DAYTON BACKS SUCCESSFUL BID TO PROVIDE MORE HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE THIS WINTER
  Sen. Mark Dayton today voted in favor of a successful motion to provide more funding for the Low- Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), on which thousands of Minnesotans depend to make ends meet during Minnesota's frigid winters.  
 Earlier legislation provided the same level of funding for Minnesota as last year, despite projections that natural gas bills will be 61% higher this year. 
   Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) offered a motion to instruct the Members of Congress who will determine the final funding level for LIHEAP to provide an additional $2.92 billion - the amount that Congress promised last August - for the program. The motion passed by a vote of 63 to 28. 
   "I am extremely grateful that the Senate today approved nearly $3 billion more for LIHEAP," said Dayton. "Those urgently needed funds will help keep many more Minnesotans out of the cold this winter." 
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced last month that Minnesota will again receive $73.7 million in LIHEAP funding, the same level of funding that the state received last year; however, the U.S. Department of Energy projects that natural gas heating bills in the Midwest will be 61% higher than last year, due to skyrocketing energy prices resulting from the recent hurricanes. LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low-income households. In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low-income families and the elderly, LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs, low-cost residential weatherization, and other energy-related home repairs.
