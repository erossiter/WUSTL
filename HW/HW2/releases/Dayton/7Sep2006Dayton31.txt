SEN. DAYTON: $1 MILLION COMING TO POLK COUNTY CHILDREN
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today the Children Succeed Initiative in Polk County has received $1,000,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
   "The Children Succeed Initiative provides an essential care network for children and their families, which is crucial to their development and personal growth," said Dayton. "This program ensures that Minnesota children become healthy, active, and contributing members in their community." 
   The Children Succeed Initiative is a collaboration among six rural counties in northwestern Minnesota to provide a system of care to serve children and youth with serious emotional disturbances. The initiative specifically focuses on building a network of core services, not only to serve young children, but also older youth who are at particular risk for dropping out of school or being involved in the justice system.
