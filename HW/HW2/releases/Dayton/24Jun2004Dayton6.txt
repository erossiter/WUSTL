SEN. DAYTON: SENATE APPROVES MORE THAN $120 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA-BASED DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced today that the Senate has approved more than $120 million for Minnesota-based defense projects and programs.  
 Dayton worked tirelessly to secure the funds, which passed today as part of the $416.2 billion Defense Department FY2005 Authorization bill.
   "Minnesota companies continue to play a key role in forging America's military preeminence and this year's Defense Authorization bill will continue their strong involvement," said Dayton. "These funds will generate more jobs in Minnesota, and I am proud that I could use my position on the Senate Armed Services Committee to help secure those jobs"
   The bill also funds an across-the-board pay raise of 3.5 percent for military service members and an increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing to reduce average out-of-pocket expenses for military personnel from 3.5 percent to zero. Additionally, the bill includes an amendment, which Dayton cosponsored, that seeks to correct a grievous wrong by giving National Guard and Reserve members and their families full-time access to TRICARE, the military health care system.
   "Offering our Guard and Reserve adequate health care is the least we can do at a time when we are increasingly dependent on non-regular forces for our security at home and abroad. I will continue the fight to fund, train, and equip Americans serving in uniform, just as I will push for better benefits for our Guard and Reserve. It is, without question, our duty, to our servicemen and women."
   The Defense Authorization bill will soon proceed to conference with the House of Representatives.
