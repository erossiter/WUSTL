SEN. DAYTON: OVER $6 MILLION FOR DULUTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Duluth International Airport will receive $6,318,751 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration.  
   "I am delighted the Duluth International Airport has received this funding," said Dayton. "Maintaining airport infrastructure and planning for future projects is essential to improve air service for Minnesotans and visitors to our great state." 
   The funding will help restore structural integrity to the pavement of two runways and permit other improvements, necessary to comply with airport certification. The grant will also provide for a pavement evaluation study to plan for the airport's future needs and an environmental mitigation plan that is needed to comply with the Clean Water Act.
