SEN. DAYTON: $2 MILLION FOR CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that several Minnesota communities will receive a total of $2 million in Brownfields grants from the Environmental Protection Agency.  
 These funds will be used to conduct environmental assessments and initiate cleanup activities on abandoned and contaminated waste sites.
   The EPA's Brownfields program encourages redevelopment of brownfields, that is, properties where expansion, redevelopment, or reuse may be impeded by the presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Minnesota has over 2,000 such sites.
   "Brownfield sites pose a great risk to the economic and environmental health of cities and rural areas across Minnesota," said Dayton. "Therefore, these grants will help bring new life to these discarded properties, making possible the creation of new green spaces, development, and jobs."
   Communities receiving grants include:
   * Hennepin County Department of Environmental Services - $1,000,000
   * City of Moorhead - $400,000
   * St. Paul Port Authority - $400,000
   * Hennepin County Department of Housing, Community Works and Transit - $400,000.
