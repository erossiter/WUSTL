SEN. DAYTON: HOLLOWAY FIRST RESPONDERS TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that first responders in Holloway will receive $9,500 from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development program.  
   "Our first responders deserve the best training and equipment available," said Dayton. "I am pleased this funding will provide Holloway's first responders with the resources they need to do their jobs and keep their community safe." 
   Holloway first responders will use the funding to purchase jackets, ECG machines to screen for cardiac conditions, stethoscopes, a radio, and oximeters to measure pulse rate and strength. This equipment will allow Holloway to expand service and grow as a first responders unit.
