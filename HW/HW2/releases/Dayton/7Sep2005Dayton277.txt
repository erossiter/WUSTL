SEN. DAYTON PUSHES FOR HEARING ON U.S. CROP DAMAGE DUE TO HURRICANE KATRINA, OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today urged the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), to hold a hearing to assess the damage that natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, have caused to the country's agriculture industry.  
   The full text of Senator Dayton's letter is below: 
   September 6, 2005 
   The Honorable Saxby Chambliss 
  Chairman 
  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry 
  United States Senate 
  Washington, D.C. 20510 
   Dear Mr. Chairman: 
   I respectfully request that the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry conduct a hearing to determine the extent of damage to U.S. agricultural production caused by Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters this year. It is my understanding that, as of August 25, 2005, 40 percent of the counties in the United States had received disaster declarations by the Secretary of Agriculture-even before Katrina struck the Gulf Coast. Certainly, that number has risen substantially during the past week. 
   In my home state of Minnesota, severe storms and flooding in the northwest have resulted in substantial losses this year. Those losses lead me to believe that there is an urgent need for a nationwide program of disaster relief for farmers. 
   My best regards. 
   Sincerely, 
   Mark Dayton 
  United States Senator
