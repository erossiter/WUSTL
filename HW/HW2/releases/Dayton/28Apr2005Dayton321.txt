SEN. DAYTON CALLS FOR CONTINUED FUNDING FOR COPS PROGRAM
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton joined with Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) to introduce legislation that would reauthorize funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, which has provided $118 million to Minnesota communities since 1994.  
 The COPS program furnishes critical financial support for local law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and to protect local communities from crime. 
   "It is a fact: putting more police officers on the streets deters crime, making our communities safer, better places to live," said Dayton. "The COPS program has made possible the hiring of more than 1,400 new police officers to Minnesota. It is a vital part of keeping our state safe, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation." 
   In addition to funding an additional 50,000 new community-oriented local law enforcement officers, this legislation would fund the COPS School Resource Officer program and law enforcement technology grants, and would help district attorneys to hire community prosecutors. 
   Since 1994, COPS has funded the hiring of more than 118,000 community police officers, through grants that have been awarded to more than 12,000 of the nation's local and tribal law enforcement agencies.
