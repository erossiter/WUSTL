SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $2.5 MILLION USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN TO BUILD ROSEAU ASSISTED-LIVING CENTER
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that USDA Rural Development will guarantee a loan of $2.5 million under the Community Facility Guaranteed Loan program to Oak Crest Senior Housing.  
 The loan will be used to help finance the construction of a 42-unit, assisted-living facility in Roseau.
   "Rural communities across the State of Minnesota, including Roseau, are suffering from a lack of assisted-living facilities to care for our elderly citizens," said Dayton. "This USDA Rural Development loan will help to fill an urgent need in Roseau County."
   "The approved financing by USDA Rural Development will allow Oak Crest Senior Housing to fulfill its vision of developing senior housing with services which promote an 'aging in place' concept and which will enrich the lives of its residents, families, and our community," said Shannon Carlson, Senior Leader of Roseau Area Hospital and Homes. "We thank Senator Dayton for his personal attention to this project during his visits to Roseau."
   The Community Facility Guaranteed Loan program, by USDA Rural Development, guarantees loans to help develop essential community facilities, such as day-care centers, hospitals, and schools, in rural areas and towns of up to 20,000 in population.
