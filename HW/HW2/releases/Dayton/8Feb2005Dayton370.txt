SEN. DAYTON: HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT TO HOLD WORKSHOPS ACROSS MINNESOTA ON APPLYING FOR IMPORTANT FIRE GRANT PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will hold workshops throughout Minnesota to explain to local fire personnel the Federal Emergency Management Association's competitive grant program. In addition to informing fire officials about the program and its application process, the workshops will provide assistance in the writing of effective grant applications, to aid fire departments in the competitive application process.  
   "The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is vital to helping Minnesota fire departments acquire the necessary equipment and training to respond to emergencies," said Dayton. "I urge every Minnesota fire department, regardless of size, to apply for this program, which last year, provided over $14 million to our state, helping fire fighters do their jobs, improve safety, and save lives." 
   Administered through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program - along with the U.S. Fire Administration - provides direct assistance to local fire departments and emergency responders in order to improve general firefighter and first-responder operations.
