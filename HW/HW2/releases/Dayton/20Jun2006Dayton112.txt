SEN. DAYTON, DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO PREVENT AMNESTY FOR IRAQI TERRORISTS
  The U.S. Senate, by a 79-19 vote, today approved a strongly worded Democratic measure urging the Iraqi government to reject any plan granting amnesty to persons who attack or kill U.S. forces. 
   "The Iraqi Prime Minister's reported amnesty proposal is offensive to the courageous Americans who gave their lives in Iraq, to their families, and to our troops who are risking their lives," said Dayton. "It should be rejected in the strongest possible terms."
   The Sense of the Senate Resolution (#4265), introduced by Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), calls on the President to immediately inform the Iraqi government, in the clearest possible terms, that the United States does not condone amnesty for those who attack American servicemembers.
   The Senate's action today comes in response to recent reports in the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times that indicate the new Iraqi government is preparing a national reconciliation plan that could include granting pardons for those who attack U.S. troops.
   The text of the Sense of the Senate Resolution is below.
   Sense of the Senate:
   (1) The Iraqi government should not grant amnesty to persons who have attacked, killed, or wounded members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving heroically in Iraq to provide all Iraqis a better future.
   (2) President Bush should immediately notify the government of Iraq that the United States government opposes granting amnesty in the strongest possible terms.
