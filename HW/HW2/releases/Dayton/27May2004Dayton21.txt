SEN. DAYTON PUSHES FOR $12 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton joined with his Congressional colleagues today in sending a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees asking for an additional $237 million for the Title I education program, which includes over $12 million for Minnesota schools.  
 Without this additional funding, 7,500 school districts nationwide will receive less Title I funding this July than they did last year.
   "Our schools are already having extreme difficulty in trying to implement No Child Left Behind requirements with the little funding they now receive," said Dayton. "If Congress does not appropriate an additional $12 million in Title I funding for next year, things will only get worse for the 325 Minnesota school districts which currently count on this assistance.
   "I have heard from teachers, students, parents, and school administrators across Minnesota who all describe the devastating impact of defunding public education in our state. Our schools just cannot take another financial hit. I will continue to fight for these funds until they are delivered to our schools, which so desperately need them."
   The Title I program was appropriated $12.3 billion for FY 2004, leaving it $6.2 billion short of the level of funding promised under the federal No Child Left Behind Act. The relatively small increase of $660 million in Title I funding, together with the use of Census data recently released by the U.S. Department of Education, are responsible for the loss of funding for the 7,500 school districts.
   The Title I program gives funds to school districts for the purpose of improving the education of disadvantaged children, principally in the subjects of reading and math.
