SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON BOYCOTTING IRAQI PRIME MINISTER AL-MALIKI'S CONGRESSIONAL ADDRESS
  Statement by Sen. Mark Dayton on Boycotting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Congressional Address 
   I will not attend Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki's speech today, because I believe that his recent remarks blaming Israel and absolving Hezbollah were wrong and unwarranted. Mr. al-Maliki's time and attention belong in his own country, mobilizing his government and his security forces to assume their responsibilities and relieve our heroic soldiers, including 2,600 Minnesota National Guardsmen and women, of those burdens.
   I further believe that addressing Congress should be a rare honor, one accorded to historic international leaders, such as Winston Churchill or Nelson Mandela. It should not be used by this Administration and the Congressional leadership to promote or defend their political agendas.
