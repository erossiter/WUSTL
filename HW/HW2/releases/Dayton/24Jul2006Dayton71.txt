SEN. DAYTON: $600K RURAL DEVELOPMENT LOAN FOR EDEN VALLEY, ALBANY
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the communities of Eden Valley ($300,000) and Albany ($300,000), both located in Stearns County, will receive $600,000 in federal loans from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development's Rural Economic Development loan and grant program. Funding will be used to construct a new fire and rescue hall in Eden Valley, and to construct a new water treatment facility in Albany.  
   Dayton said, "I am delighted that these USDA funds will help to update the infrastructure of Eden Valley and Albany, improving vital services for residents of those communities." 
   The USDA grants will be loaned through Stearns Electric Association. Under the Rural Economic Development program, USDA provides loans and grants to Rural Utilities Program borrowers--usually rural telephone or electrical cooperatives--which in turn provide loans to rural businesses and communities in their service areas. 
   The funding is part of $9.4 million in rural economic development loans from USDA, to assist communities and businesses in 11 states.
