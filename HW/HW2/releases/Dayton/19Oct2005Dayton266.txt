SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES GOODHUE COUNTY TO RECEIVE $100,000 FOR DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Goodhue County will receive $100,000 in federal funding for its Chemical Health Initiative, which will combat illegal drug use among children and teens in the community.  
 The grant, provided through the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Drug-Free Communities Support Program, will be used to develop substance abuse prevention curriculum, to promote drug and alcohol-free activities throughout Goodhue County, and to raise public awareness of community substance abuse issues. 
   "I have heard from many law enforcement officials in Minnesota, who are fighting to keep meth and other illegal drugs out of our schools, that we are not doing enough," said Dayton. "The Chemical Health Initiative of Goodhue County is critically important to save our kids from the ravages of drug addiction. I am delighted that it will receive federal support." 
   Joanne Theobald Pohl, Director of Goodhue County Court Services, said, "Community mobilization is a powerful tool for implementing community policies and practices to eliminate illegal drug use. This grant will assist Goodhue County communities in their efforts to enhance the quality of life for their families and children."
