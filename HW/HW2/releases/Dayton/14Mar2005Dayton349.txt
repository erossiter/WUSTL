SEN. DAYTON DENOUNCES NEW EPA RULE ON MERCURY EMISSIONS FOR PUTTING AMERICA'S CHILDREN AT RISK
  Tomorrow the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to institute a federal rule to regulate mercury emissions which will give energy companies an extra 10 years before they must reduce their mercury pollution.  
   "Coal-fired power plants, the single largest source of mercury emissions in the U.S., are being given a pass by this Administration," said Dayton. "Protecting our lakes, rivers, and streams and assuring Minnesotans that they can safely eat walleye, pike, and bass harvested from these pristine waters, are priorities for me. It is disgraceful this Administration allows the single largest source of mercury pollution to continue. This Administration is granting mercury polluters special exemption from laws designed to protect the public's health. 
   "We are jeopardizing the health of our nation's children. Why does this Administration continue to put big business ahead of protecting our most valuable citizens?" 
   The new rule will set up a cap-and-trade system of negotiable pollution allowances that is administered by the states, each of which has its own mandated cap on emissions and each of which can develop its own system of distributing allowances subject to the approval of the EPA. 
   Last week Dayton joined with several of his Senate colleagues in urging the EPA to strengthen its proposed rule on mercury emissions. The Senators cited new reports, from the EPA Inspector General (IG) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which emphasize serious flaws in how the EPA analyzed the impacts of mercury on the health of children and women of childbearing age. In Minnesota alone, more than 5,000 babies are at risk of developing learning and behavioral disorders from exposure to mercury.
