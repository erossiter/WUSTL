SEN. DAYTON SECURES $500K FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY CENTER IN SOUTHERN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that he has secured $500,000 for the Minnesota Center for Renewable Energy, located at Minnesota State University-Mankato and Minnesota West Community and Technical College. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the funds, to support renewable energy research and professional training, as part of the FY2007 energy and water spending bill, which will now go the full Senate.  
   "The need for renewable energy sources has never been greater," said Dayton. "I am delighted that the Minnesota Center for Renewable Energy will receive $500,000 for alternative energy research and training, to help reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil." 
   The Minnesota Center for Renewable Energy (MCRE) seeks to expand fossil fuel alternatives, through the development of renewable fuels and wind energy. Funding will be used to customize training programs for the personnel who service wind turbines and work in ethanol production, in addition to supporting research of new renewable fuel technologies. 
   The MCRE is a collaborative effort of Minnesota State University-Mankato and Minnesota West Community and Technical College, which has campuses in Canby, Granite Falls, Jackson, Pipestone, and Worthington.
