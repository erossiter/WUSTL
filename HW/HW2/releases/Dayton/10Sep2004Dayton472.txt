SEN. DAYTON: EVERGREEN HOUSE AWARDED OVER $75,000 TO HELP BEMIDJI YOUTH STAY SAFE, OFF STREET
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a $75,500 Street Outreach Grant to Evergreen House of Bemidji.  
 The funding, through the federal Administration on Children, Youth and Families, will be used to support Evergreen's SafeStreets Program, which provides runaway, homeless, and street-dependent youth with food, clothing, counseling, and healthcare. The program focuses on helping homeless youth stabilize their living situation and learn the skills necessary to reestablish a positive relationship with their family and/or community.
   "Youth homelessness is a serious problem in this region, and those young people most at risk require extensive care, provided in a culturally appropriate manner," said Dayton. "Evergreen House has a solid track record of helping vulnerable youth. I am very pleased this federal funding will enable this organization to continue giving Minnesota's rural youth the support and services they need to stay safe and off the street." 
   Becky Schueller, Executive Director of Evergreen House, said, "This Street Outreach Grant is very important to Evergreen House. We can help homeless youth with school clothing, food, sanitary supplies, warm coats, and help finding shelter, transitional housing, or reuniting with their families. We greatly appreciate Senator Dayton's strong, public advocacy on behalf of Evergreen House."
   Founded in northern Minnesota in 1977, Evergreen House serves more than 1,000 children, teens, and families every year. The Evergreen SafeStreets Program is an established, rural street outreach program for runaway, homeless, and street-dependent youth, ages 10 to 21, living in Bemidji and surrounding communities in northwest Minnesota.
