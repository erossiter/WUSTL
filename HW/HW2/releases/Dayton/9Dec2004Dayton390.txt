SEN. DAYTON: OKLEE FIRE DEPARTMENT AWARDED $18,000 FEDERAL GRANT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Oklee Fire Department has been awarded an $18,000 federal grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, can be used to purchase new equipment, support firefighter training and fitness programs, and improve current fire station facilities. 
   "Minnesota's firefighters work tirelessly every day to protect our homes and neighborhoods," said Dayton. "I am pleased that this funding will provide Oklee firefighters with the resources they need to do their jobs and keep their communities safe." 
   Administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program teams with the U.S. Fire Administration to provide direct assistance to local fire departments for general firefighter and first-responder operations. The program also supports the acquisition of emergency vehicles.
