SEN. DAYTON STANDS UP FOR MINNESOTA FARMERS, VOTES NO ON U.S.-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today voted against the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which could harm Minnesota's farmers, dairy producers and cattlemen.  
 Instead, it threatens certain U.S. agriculture markets by providing greater access and import opportunities to Australian producers.
   "I oppose the Australia Free Trade Agreement," said Dayton. "This agreement reflects the Administration's strategy of entering into a flurry of trade agreements with each one giving away a slice of U.S. market access on the cheap without ensuring U.S. farmers, producers and consumers get equal benefits in return. It is time we started looking at these trade agreements more critically and make sure we enter only into those agreements that actually work to the benefit of U.S. producers, farmers and consumers."
   In the last ten years, Australian agricultural exports into the U.S. have more than doubled. More than 98 percent of these commodities directly compete with U.S. production and exports. On the other hand, U.S. agricultural exports to Australia have risen by only 50 percent. The U.S. agricultural trade deficit with Australia has grown from $577 million in 1994 to more than $1.5 billion for calendar year 2003.
