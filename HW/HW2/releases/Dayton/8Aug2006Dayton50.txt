SEN. DAYTON: FEMA RELEASES OVER $1.6 MILLION FOR AUSTIN FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has finally released $1,658,231 in federal funds for flood damage prevention in the City of Austin. The grant was awarded in 2005, through the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Competitive Grant Program (PDMC), but had not been released, due to delays at FEMA. Funding will be used to acquire and demolish structures that have been repeatedly damaged by flooding in the Wildwood Park neighborhood of Austin.  
   "I am pleased that FEMA has released this vital funding for Austin," said Dayton. "Though it is long overdue, this grant will help to protect the city, which has already been devastated by severe flooding, from sustaining future damage." 
   The FEMA grant will cover 75 percent of the costs for the Wildwood Park project, with the City of Austin contributing the remaining 25 percent. The project will be administered by Minnesota's Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
