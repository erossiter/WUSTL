SEN. DAYTON: COMBAT METH ACT IS STEP TOWARD FEWER MINNESOTA METH LABS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today applauded passage of the Combat Meth Act, which he introduced with Sens. James Talent (R-MO) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), to restrict the sale of a key ingredient found in methamphetamine or "meth." The legislation, which was included in the Patriot Act renewal, passed the Senate by a vote of 89 to 10. The bill requires that Sudafed and other cold medicines containing the chemical pseudoephedrine, which is often used to make meth, be moved from grocery shelves to behind the pharmacy counter. The state of Minnesota enacted a similar law last year.  
   "We need to make it impossible for meth producers to merely visit their local pharmacy and buy in large quantities, right off the shelf, the ingredients used to manufacture meth," said Dayton. "Our bill eliminates this convenience for meth cooks. 
   In April of 2004, the state of Oklahoma banned over-the-counter sales of cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine. Less than one year later, meth lab seizures in Oklahoma were down more than 80 percent. 
   In 2004, there were 317 meth lab busts in Minnesota. The same year, meth use resulted in 18 accidental overdose deaths in the state and 705 visits to Twin Cities-area emergency rooms.
