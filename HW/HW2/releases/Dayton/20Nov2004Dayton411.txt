SEN. DAYTON PRAISES NEARLY $19 MILLION FOR LEWIS AND CLARK RURAL WATER PROJECT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that nearly $19 million in funding for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Project was included in the 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today.  
 The funding, secured by Dayton, will help the project complete several goals in 2005. The Lewis and Clark Project is critical to the health and well-being of Minnesotans and will provide a steady supply of drinking water, which is vital to promoting economic growth in the region. 
   "The Lewis and Clark Project, upon completion, will supply safe, reliable drinking water to citizens in over 20 communities and rural water districts in southwestern Minnesota" said Dayton. "This project represents a unique regional approach to these common water resource problems in a more effective and cost-efficient manner than each state could address alone. Federal funding is needed to keep progress on this important project moving forward." 
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
