SEV. DAYTON BLASTS ADMINISTRATION FOR CONTINUING ITS JOBLESS POLICIES
  Sen. Mark Dayton spoke to more than 75 Minnesotans at a labor convention in St.  
 Paul today. At the event, Dayton blasted the Bush Administration for its refusal to admit the failure of its fiscal policies in restoring jobs for Americans. Dayton will continue to urge his colleagues to focus on investing in the basic building blocks of job creation when the Senate reconvenes next week. 
   "The only jobs that really seem to matter to this Administration are their own. We've had three years of whopping tax cuts for America's multi-millionaires and billionaires and endless tax give-aways to the off-shore, tax-evading, oversees job-creating corporations. Yet, while the President has delivered his promise to the multi-millionaires of America, he has failed to deliver the jobs he promised to the rest of America," Dayton said. 
   According to a report issued earlier this month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market remains very weak, with unemployment remaining at 5.6 percent last month due to a shrinking labor force. The economy created only 21,000 jobs in February, none of which are in the private sector. This number falls far short of the forecasted 125,000 - 150,000 gain for the month. 
   President Bush is on track to be the first President since Herbert Hoover to end his term with fewer jobs than when he started. Overall, there are 8.2 million unemployed Americans, and about 4.6 million additional workers who want a job but are not counted among the unemployed. An additional 4.4 million people work part-time because they are unable to find full-time employment in this weak economy.
