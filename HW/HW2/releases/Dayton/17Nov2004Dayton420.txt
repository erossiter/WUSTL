SENS. DAYTON, COLEMAN URGE INCREASED LIMITS ON TEMPORARY WORKER VISAS, CRUCIAL TO NORTHERN MINNESOTA COMPANIES
  In a letter sent today to Congressional leaders, Sens.  
 Mark Dayton and Norm Coleman urged that an increase in H-2B temporary worker visas be included in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill, to ensure that northern Minnesota industries have the seasonal workers necessary to operate next year. The Omnibus bill is scheduled to be voted on at the end of this week.
   Dayton and Coleman proposed increasing the current yearly limit on visas, a move that would provide much-needed relief to Minnesota's manufacturing, tourism, construction, and forestry industries. Last year, Minnesota employers who relied on the H-2B visas for summertime seasonal workers were shut out of the application process because the limit available nationwide was reached by other states in the spring.
   "It is extremely important for Congress to recognize the unique circumstances facing U.S. employers along the Canadian border," said Dayton. "Minnesota companies are committed to hiring qualified U.S. workers; however, in the sparsely populated regions in the northern part of our state, employers must be able to rely on Canadian temporary workers to meet commitments to their customers. If additional H-2B visas are not made available, it could have a lasting, damaging effect on northern border businesses and communities."
   "In my travels throughout northern Minnesota, I hear time and time again from folks like Marvin Windows about the need for an increase in H-2B temporary worker visas," Coleman said. "I introduced legislation to help out Northern Minnesota earlier this year, I have been working with Judiciary Subcommittee Chairman Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), and I am very hopeful we can make this happen before the Senate adjourns. Stay tuned."
