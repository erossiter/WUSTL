SEN. DAYTON SUPPORTS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO REAUTHORIZE SPECIAL EDUCATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton voted today to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which guarantees the right of every child with a disability to a free, appropriate public education.  
 Over 6.5 million children with disabilities receive special education services provided under this law. Despite voting for the bill, Dayton remains concerned that the legislation fails to provide full funding for special education.
   "Over a quarter of a century ago Congress promised to fund 40 percent of the costs of special education," said Dayton. "Today, we provide less then half of that promise, costing Minnesota schools over $250 million a year." 
   "It's not that we don't have the money. We don't have the right priorities. We don't have the will... This money is badly needed in Minnesota, and I assume elsewhere in the country."
