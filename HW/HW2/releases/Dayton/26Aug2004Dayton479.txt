SEN. DAYTON: 14 MINNESOTA FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO RECEIVE OVER $1.2 MILLION
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that 14 Minnesota fire departments have been awarded over $1.2 million in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used to purchase new fire trucks and equipment, install smoke alarms and fire suppression systems, promote fire prevention awareness, and support firefighter training programs. "Minnesota's firefighters work hard every day to keep our communities safe and to educate our residents about fire prevention," said Dayton. "I'm happy to report that this funding will help many local communities introduce training programs and purchase vehicles and equipment that they otherwise couldn't afford." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism.
