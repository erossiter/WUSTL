SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $11 MILLION FOR RUNWAY CONSTRUCTION, NOISE MITIGATION AT MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Metropolitan Airports Commission will receive two federal grants, totaling $11,187,500, for runway construction and noise mitigation efforts at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The funding is provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a division of the Federal Department of Transportation.  
   "This funding is critical to the safety of millions of airline passengers and to hundreds of Minnesota households, which must endure the aggravation of excessive airport noise on a daily basis," said Dayton. 
   The FAA awarded a $7.5 million grant to help fund construction of a new runway at Minneapolis-St. Paul International, to increase capacity and reduce delays. The second grant of $3.68 million will be used to insulate 502 homes in Bloomington and 28 homes in Richfield from noise in the 65-69 day-night noise level. Eligible homes may receive new or reconditioned windows and doors, wall and attic insulation, central air, venting or ductwork modifications, roof vents, and attic baffling.
