SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $400,000 TO COMBAT GANG VIOLENCE IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minnesota State Department of Public Safety in collaboration with Minnesota's U.S. Attorney's Office will receive $432,588 in federal funding through the Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative Program. The grants, provided by the U.S. Department of Justice, will be used in Minnesota to enhance the Project Safe Neighborhood Taskforce, which combats gang activity in the seven-county, Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area. 
   "I am delighted that Minnesota received this critically important funding," said Dayton. "Gang violence is a serious problem, and local and state agencies depend on federal support to prevent and deter gangs and their violent crimes." 
   The new Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative will incorporate prevention and enforcement efforts, as well as programs to assist released prisoners as they re-enter society. The initiative complements the Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative, an existing Justice Department program, to combat gang violence and reduce gun-related crime throughout the country.
