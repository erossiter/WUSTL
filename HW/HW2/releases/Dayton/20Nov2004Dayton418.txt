SEN. DAYTON SECURES $250,000 TO HELP PROVIDE HOMELESS MINNESOTA VETERANS WITH SAFE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY 2005, which passed the Senate today, includes $250,000 in federal funds for the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.  
 The funding, secured by Dayton, will provide supportive housing to homeless veterans in St. Paul. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that nearly 300,000 veterans nationwide are homeless on any given night and that more than 500,000 experience homelessness at some time during the course of a year. 
   "Minnesota's veterans have served our country with great dignity and respect, making enormous personal sacrifices," said Dayton. "For these same veterans to be sleeping on the streets is unconscionable; our veterans deserve better. I will continue fighting to provide our nation's veterans with the support they were promised and so rightfully deserve."
   The Omnibus Appropriations bill is expected to be signed into law by the President soon.
