SEN. DAYTON'S MONTGOMERY GI BILL WOULD ADDRESS MILITARY RECRUITING CRISIS
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton introduced the Montgomery GI Bill Revitalization Act, which would enhance and improve educational benefits for members of the military. Under the current, basic Montgomery GI Bill benefit, a soldier receives between $7,000 and $9,000 for tuition, fees, books, and supplies-far less than the average $11,300, which a commuter student pays to attend a four-year, public college. Sen. Dayton's bill would remedy this disparity, requiring the federal government to pay the full costs of tuition, fees, books, and supplies for soldiers who enlist or reenlist in any branch of the military for a minimum of four years.  
   In addition, the Montgomery GI Bill Revitalization Act would provide a subsistence allowance of $900 per month, indexed for inflation, for up to 36 months. It would also eliminate the $1,200 reduction in basic pay, which the current law requires for participation in the program. 
   "After World War II, the GI Bill enabled an entire generation of young Americans to climb America's socio-economic ladder by giving them access to a college education," Dayton said. "As the price of higher education has soared over the years, the program's purchasing power, along with the military's ability to recruit able men and women, has steadily declined. That hurts not only our long-term military preparedness, but also the quality of life for those serving in our Armed Forces. I believe every soldier in this country should be able to pursue the highest educational level that his or her ability and motivation permit." 
   Senator Dayton first introduced the Montgomery GI Bill Revitalization Act in 2003, as a commitment to American veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, to help them pay for the ever-increasing costs of higher education.
