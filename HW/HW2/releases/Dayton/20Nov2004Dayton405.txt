SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $36 MILLION FOR IMPORTANT NORTHWESTERN MINNESOTA FLOOD CONTROL, WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY 2005, which is expected to pass the Senate today, includes over $36 million in federal funding for flood-control and water projects in northwestern Minnesota. $34 million will bring much-needed relief to East Grand Forks which was previously devastated by flooding. Unfortunately, two vital projects in Crookston and Breckenridge were under funded. 
   Dayton said, "I am delighted with the $34 million provided East Grand Forks flood control projects. However, I am appalled by the disgracefully low level of funding that the conferees provided urgent flood control projects in Crookston and Breckenridge. The Senate funding levels, which I submitted were $1.2 million for Crookston and $10 million for Breckenridge.
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
   The following is a list of programs included in the Appropriations bill: 
   * $34,095,000 for East Grand Forks/Grand Forks: Funding will be used construct levees and floodwall, forming three "rings" around both communities. Additionally, funding will help stabilize an existing dam, remove a former railroad bridge, support extension and expansion of an existing diversion channel, provide for interior flood control features and numerous road and railroad closures, and construct a new diversion channel. The project is expected to be completed by fall of 2006.
   * $250,000 for Breckenridge: Funding for ongoing flood reduction projects.
   * $600,000 for Crookston: Funding for ongoing flood reduction projects.
   * $731,000 for Red River of the North Basin: Funding will be used to initiate additional 2-3 year cost-shared sub-basin feasibility studies in the Red River of the North basin which includes parts of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Manitoba. 
   * $149,000 for Roseau: Funding will be used to support ongoing flood control studies to identify project costs and benefits.
   * $250,000 for Roseau Storm Water Control Project: Funding will be used to support ongoing water control project in Roseau.
   * $400,000 for Wild Rice River: Funding will be used for water projects aimed at flood damage reduction and natural resources restoration and enhancement.
