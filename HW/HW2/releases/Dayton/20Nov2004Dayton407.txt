SEN. DAYTON PRAISES $700,000 FOR CONSTRUCTION OF PAUL, SHEILA WELLSTONE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY BUILDING, IN ST. PAUL
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that $700,000 in federal funds for the Neighborhood House in St.  
 Paul has been included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today. The funding, requested by Dayton, will help complete the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building. Additionally, the Senator secured $100,000 for the Cornerstone organization's Sheila Wellstone Center, in Bloomington. 
   "Paul and Sheila Wellstone cared deeply about the Neighborhood House and they faithfully supported the mission of this great organization," said Dayton. "I am thrilled to have helped secure funding to help for the construction of this new community building in St. Paul. I am proud Congress is keeping its commitment to fund a project Paul and Sheila championed - it is a fitting tribute to Paul and his family." 
   Neighborhood House is a multicultural, multilingual community center, which provides programming and services to individuals and families. The federal funding would be used to expand and build a new state-of-the-art facility which will offer meeting and gathering space for people of all ages and cultural and economic backgrounds. The 93,000-square-foot facility will consist of a 300-seat auditorium, classrooms, gymnasiums, computer labs, a youth center, a caf?, and an exercise room. 
   Cornerstone, a community-based non-profit organization whose primary mission is the prevention of violence and domestic abuse, recently opened a new facility in Bloomington dedicated to the late Sheila Wellstone, an ardent advocate for victims of domestic violence. This new facility will house the many social services the organization offers Minnesotans.
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
