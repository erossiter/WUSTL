SEN. DAYTON: OVER $500,000 TO FIVE MINNESOTA COMMUNITY FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton this week announced that firefighters in five Minnesota communities will receive over $500,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to purchase new firefighting and detection equipment and to expand fire-prevention programs.  
   "Keeping our homes free of fire hazards is especially difficult during the holiday season," said Dayton. "These grants will provide funds for community fire prevention programs and will provide our firefighters with the resources necessary to keep our families safe all year round." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. This is the twenty-fifth round of FY 2003 awards, and we expect notifications to take place on a weekly basis until all funds are awarded. 
   Communities receiving grants this week are: 
   * Jackson $ 99,729 
   * Blomkest $ 53,669 
   * Clements $125,550 
   * Fredenberg $210,320 
   * Nisswa $ 73,800.
