SEN. DAYTON: OVER $35,000 COMING TO STILLWATER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that $35,000 is coming to the Stillwater Fire Department, to pay for fire operations and fire safety. The funds are being awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
   "I am delighted that more than $35,000 in federal funding is coming to the Stillwater Fire Department," said Dayton. "These grants will help outfit our firefighters with the best and most advanced equipment available, keeping them and our communities safer." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the 22nd round of awards this year, with two fire departments in Minnesota receiving a total of $47,787. 
   Due to the additional burden on local agencies since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many Minnesota fire departments rely on funds from FIRE Act and state formula grants to hire additional personnel, buy new fire trucks, radios, and other equipment, and establish general fire-prevention programs. Last year, Minnesota received $17 million from this program.
