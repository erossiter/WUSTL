SEN. DAYTON, REP. OBERSTAR ARRANGE FOR MEETING WITH HOMELAND SECURITY UNDERSECRETARY TO PRESENT BORDER SECURITY PROPOSAL FOR INTERNATIONAL FALLS
  Rep. James L. Oberstar and Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that they, along with Sen.  
 Norm Coleman, will hold a meeting on Tuesday, May 18, with Department of Homeland Security Undersecretary Asa Hutchinson, who heads the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security. At the meeting, representatives from International Falls will present a proposal to establish a northern border homeland security training program in International Falls.
   Securing the United States' 4,000-mile northern border with Canada represents an enormous challenge for the nation's law enforcement agencies. Tuesday's meeting is intended to inform Undersecretary Hutchinson about a proposal to create a location along the northern border to conduct border security training for federal law enforcement personnel tasked with overseeing its security. 
   This proposal is not intended to compete with or duplicate the current training programs at the various existing facilities; rather it would take a cost-effective approach to annual/supplemental/as-needed training for personnel charged with the task of securing the northern border.
