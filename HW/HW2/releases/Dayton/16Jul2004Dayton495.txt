SEN. DAYTON TAKES LEADERSHIP ROLE IN DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL NEGOTIATIONS
  Sen. Mark Dayton was named to the Conference Committee that will complete the FY 2005 Defense Authorization bill. As a Conferee, Dayton will take a leadership role on behalf of the Senate during negotiations with Members of the House to resolve differences in their respective Defense Authorization bills. The Senate bill includes several important initiatives in need of funding, including $4.9 million for the 934th Airlift Wing at the Minneapolis - St. Paul Airport; over $120 million for Minnesota companies to provide critical national defense products and services; and benefits for members of the military and their families. 
   "With just over a week of working days for the Senate before summer recess, I am extremely pleased that Congress is moving forward on the Defense Authorization bill," said Dayton. "Congress needs to get back to the business of protecting our nation and giving our men and women in uniform the pay and benefits they are so valiantly earning."
   Among issues being negotiated in the Defense Authorization bill are:
   * Concurrent Receipt - Senate proposal to immediately grant qualified, disabled veterans full disability and retirement benefits. The House has no such provision.
   * TRICARE Health Coverage for Guard and Reserve - Senate proposal to provide permanent health care to National Guard and Reserve and their families. The Senate proposal would also pay for portions of premiums under private insurance during mobilization periods. House proposal offers a three-year pilot program for members who lack access to employer-provided coverage.
   * Repeal of Widows Tax - Both the House and the Senate proposals would repeal the age-62 Widows Tax. At present, the benefits afforded to widows of service members are unfairly cut by 20 percent when they reach the age of 62.
   Conference negotiations are expected to take place throughout the rest of the summer. Once all differences have been worked out between Members of the House and the Senate, both chambers will then vote on final passage, and the bill will be presented to the President.
