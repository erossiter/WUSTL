SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $45,000 FOR CEYLON FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the City of Ceylon Volunteer Fire Department has been awarded a federal grant of over $45,000 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used to purchase 12 new self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) units.
   "I'm proud to have helped secure funding for the Ceylon Fire Department," said Dayton. "I will continue to do everything I can to get first responders across Minnesota the equipment they need to stay safe and get the job done."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the fourteenth round of awards for fiscal year 2004.
