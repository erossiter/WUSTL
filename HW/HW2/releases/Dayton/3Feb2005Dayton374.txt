SEN. DAYTON JOINS CONGRESSIONAL COLLEAGUES, ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS AT RALLY TO PROTECT ARCTIC REFUGE FROM 'BACKDOOR' PUSH FOR DRILLING
  Sens. Mark Dayton, Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), and Barbara Boxer (D-CA); Rep.  
 Ed Markey (D-MA); and former EPA Administrator Carol Browner, were joined by environmental leaders at a rally in Washington today to protest a backdoor attempt to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to harmful drilling. The rally was a response to attempts by Congressional Republicans to include revenues from ANWR drilling in the FY 2006 federal budget. Sens. Dayton, Lieberman, and Rep. Markey also reintroduced legislation today that would designate the coastal plain of ANWR as a federal wilderness area, making it permanently off-limits to oil development. 
   "Opening Alaska's wildlife refuge to drilling is absolutely unnecessary," said Dayton. "Doing so would only yield a minuscule amount of oil and would destroy the habitats of more than 250 species of fish and wildlife. The solution to our nation's dependence on foreign oil lies in expanding our use of renewable and alternative energy sources that are already available, such as ethanol. This corn-based fuel is readily available year-round in Minnesota and frequently costs less per gallon than gasoline." 
   The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that the ANWR region would provide between 3.2 and 5.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil, which is the amount of oil the United States consumes in six months. 
   Today's legislation, first introduced in 2003, would designate the 1.5-million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, thereby placing it off-limits from oil development.
