SEN. DAYTON ADVOCATES FOR MEDICARE TO COVER NEW MEDTRONIC DEVICE USED IN TREATING PARKINSON'S DISEASE
  Sen. Mark Dayton joined with several of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mark McClennan urging that a new device, produced by Minnesota-based Medtronic, be covered under Medicare.  
 The device, the Kinetra neurostimulator, is used in treating Parkinson's disease.
   Medtronic's breakthrough technology enables therapy to be delivered to the brain through a single device. Previously, implantation of two devices was required for treatment. The Kinetra is presently underused, in spite of its benefits, because it is more expensive than devices currently being used. Medicare coverage of this device would provide broad access of this breakthrough treatment to patients who need it.
   "I am proud that a Minnesota company is leading the way in developing new, life-saving technologies," said Dayton. "It is imperative that Medicare take advantage of these medical breakthroughs by making sure that all patients, regardless of ability to pay, have access to these devices."
   Medicare provides coverage for devices that are: new; inadequately paid for under current coverage; and result in substantially improved clinical outcomes over previously available treatments.
