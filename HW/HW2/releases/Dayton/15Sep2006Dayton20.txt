SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $2.3 MILLION FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today three federal grants totaling $2,304,464 to help respond to the needs of domestic violence and sexual assault victims. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety will receive $2,138,382 for the STOP Violence Against Women program (STOP program) in St. Paul. Additionally, the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women in St. Paul, and the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault in Minneapolis will each receive $83,041. The grants are administered under the U.S. Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW).  
   "These organizations help victims avoid future harm and rebuild their lives," said Dayton. "Their work is an essential component to helping heal victims and keep our communities safer." 
   This funding will help the STOP program collaborate with law enforcement agencies to respond effectively to domestic violence reports, prosecution of offenders, and court strategies to increase victims' safety and hold offenders accountable for their crimes. The State Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Coalitions program will use the funding to provide technical assistance to member agencies, conduct statewide, regional, and local workshops, and increase access to victim assistance in underserved populations.
