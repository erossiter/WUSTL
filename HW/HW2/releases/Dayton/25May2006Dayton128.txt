SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $745,000 FOR MINNESOTA'S STATE ENERGY PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the State Energy Office, part of the Minnesota Department of Commerce, will receive $745,000 in federal funding to support a wide-range of innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The grant is provided by the State Energy Program (SEP), within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  
   "Minnesota is a national leader in the development of renewable energy sources," said Dayton. "This federal funding is critical to continue our state's role in promoting national energy independence." 
   The State Energy Office will use the grant for education, outreach activities and technical assistance to develop and promote renewable energy initiatives. Recently, the State Energy Office partnered with the Minnesota Corn Growers to launch the nation's first flexible-fuel vehicle leasing program. The funding will also support the MN Energy Information Center and technical assistance for developing and installing wind and solar technologies. 
   In FY2006, funding for the State Energy Program formula grants was reduced by 20 percent. In its FY2007 energy spending bill, the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee eliminated funding for the program. Though the President's budget proposes to restore the 20 percent cut, it would still leave the program funded at approximately half of the $100 million authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   The State Energy Program formula grants are awarded to states according to a national allocation formula. The Department of Energy requires a 20 percent match of state funds.
