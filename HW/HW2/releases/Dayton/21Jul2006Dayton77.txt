SEN. DAYTON SECURES $240,000 FOR NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE IN ST. PAUL
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Neighborhood House in St. Paul will receive $240,000 in federal grants, which will be used to provide services to newly arriving Hmong and East African refugees. Dayton pushed for this funding, provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).  
   "Neighborhood House has welcomed and assisted refugees for over 100 years, giving them a strong foundation to become economically self-sufficient and contributing members of society," said Dayton. "This funding ensures they continue their essential work." 
   Since 2004, Minnesota has received over 5,000 new Hmong refugees from Thailand. This funding would allow Neighborhood House, in collaboration with the Jane Addams School for Democracy, to help these new immigrants learn English, parenting skills, naturalization assistance, and cultural empowerment activities. 
   Neighborhood House is the site of the new Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building, a 93,000-square-foot structure that houses social services and community and recreational programs for area families, which opened this past April. Dayton supported legislation designating the Neighborhood House as the living memorial to Paul and Shelia Wellstone, and helped to secure millions of dollars in funding for the site. 
   The Office of Refugee Resettlement assists refugees and other special populations in obtaining economic and social self-sufficiency in the United States. ORR oversees several programs which assist refugees in integrating in the United States; provides aid to victims of torture and trafficking; and helps care for and place unaccompanied alien children in appropriate settings.
