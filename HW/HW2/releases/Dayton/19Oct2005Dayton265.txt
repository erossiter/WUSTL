SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS TO PROTECT EMERGENCY AID FOR MINNESOTA DAIRY FARMERS
  Sen. Mark Dayton, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, today offered legislation to restore funding to the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, which provides emergency funding to dairy farmers. The Committee met today to hash out drastic cuts to farm and subsidy programs in order to meet President Bush's budget goals; their reconciliation bill proposed a 27% cut to the MILC program that Dayton sought to restore. Dayton's amendment failed 4 to 16.  
   Last year, Minnesota received $16.2 million from the program and ranks fourth highest in the country for receiving emergency aid from the MILC program. The state currently has 5,920 dairy farms. 
   "I offered an amendment to restore the funding that was cut for the MILC program because that commitment was made by the President and I believe it should be honored," said Dayton." "It's a working program, it's one of the most well designed and effectively performing programs we have and to axe it would be a severe injustice." 
   In October, 2004, during a campaign stop in Wisconsin, President Bush vowed to support full continuation of the MILC Program, stating that, "Dairy farmers all across the country can count on the support they need." 
   Dayton went on to say that while the MILC program would be cut by 27%, other commodity programs would only take a 2.5% hit. 
   "It's grossly unfair to pit the MILC program against other commodity programs. That's exactly the injustice that's been forced upon this Committee, through this budget reconciliation process. The MILC program, under this bill, takes a worse cut than any other program." 
   Dayton voted against the Agriculture Committee's reconciliation bill, saying it "reflects the wrong priorities of tax cuts for the rich paid for by program cuts on the middle class."
