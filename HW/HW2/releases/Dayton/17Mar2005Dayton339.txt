SEN. DAYTON WORKS TO PRESERVE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS, LIFELINE FOR 250 MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton voted to preserve funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which was drastically cut in President Bush's 2006 budget.  
 CDBG assistance helps communities across the country, including 250 in Minnesota, meet the challenges of providing affordable housing; making public improvements, such as maintaining flood and drainage facilities; building senior centers, libraries, and water/sewer projects; and fostering economic development. Dayton supported an amendment to the 2006 budget resolution that restored this funding. The amendment, offered by Senator Coleman, passed 66-31. 
   "Community Development Block Grants are essential to helping thousands of communities across the country, including 250 Minnesota neighborhoods, provide essential services to their residents, such as affordable housing," said Dayton. "Often, access to decent, affordable housing can be the decisive factor, influencing whether a family, and even a community, will flourish or founder. 
   "It is unthinkable that hardworking Americans will be denied a decent home in which to raise their families, when we are in a position to fulfill this basic human need. This grant money must be preserved." 
   CDBG was funded at $4.5 billion in 2005. The 2006 budget resolution, which reflects the President's budget request, consolidated CDBG with 17 other programs under one account that was funded at only $3.7 billion. 
   At present, CDBG funding serves more than 1,100 communities, urban counties, and states, and over 3,000 rural communities across the country. Over 95 percent of CDBG funds benefit low- to moderate-income people. In 2004, CDBG assisted 168,938 households and funded service projects that benefited over 13 million people.
