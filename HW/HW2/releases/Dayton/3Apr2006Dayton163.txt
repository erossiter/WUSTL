SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $2.6 MILLION FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO ROCHESTER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the City of Rochester will receive a $2,677,927 grant to make improvements to Rochester International Airport. The funding, provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will be used to expand the snow removal equipment building and to install a 10-foot high perimeter fence, to prevent wildlife from entering the runway area. 
   "The Rochester International Airport serves as a major gateway for Southern Minnesota businesses, local and regional travelers, and international visitors, especially those seeking treatment or training at Mayo Clinic," said Dayton. "It is imperative that this airport, which is such an important crossroads, receive the funds necessary to make travel as safe and convenient as possible."
