SEN. DAYTON MOURNS DEATH OF FORMER GOVERNOR ANDERSEN
  Minnesota has lost an excellent Governor, an outstanding leader, and its "First Citizen," Elmer L. Andersen. I have lost a good friend and an excellent teacher.
   Governor Andersen served our state with great distinction. He made significant contributions to our advancement as an extraordinary citizen-leader. He built a great company, he enhanced a great university, and he offered his resources, his prestige, and his wisdom to so many important causes.
   He was a true visionary, a rare man truly deserving of that accolade. I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Eleanor, and the rest of his family.
