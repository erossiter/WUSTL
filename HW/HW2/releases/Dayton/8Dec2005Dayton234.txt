SEN. DAYTON OFFICE PRESENTS PURPLE HEART DECORATION TO BRAINERD NATIVE
  The office of Sen. Mark Dayton today presented Brainerd native Mr.  
 Douglas A. Splady with the prestigious Purple Heart, from the U.S. Navy. Mr. Splady received the medal for the injuries to his back and damage to his hearing that he sustained from a land mine explosion during World War II. The Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces who have been wounded or killed in service to their country. 
   "I am honored to present Douglas Splady with the prestigious Purple Heart from the U.S. Navy," said Steve Bradach, Northeast Regional Director for U.S. Senator Mark Dayton. "His personal sacrifices in service to the United States during World War II are an inspiration. Truly, he is an American hero." 
   "I am very happy to receive this award," said Splady at the reception following the presentation. "I tried to get this award over 20 years ago, and I am very proud of my daughter, Mary, for pushing for this." 
   Twenty years ago, Splady testified in Ft. Snelling to a panel charged with the task of deciding whether he should receive the Purple Heart. He also presented letters from fellow World War II soldiers, but was told the letters did not qualify as proof to support conferral of the decoration. In June, 2004, Splady's daughter, Mary, sent a letter to Dayton requesting help in securing the Purple Heart.
