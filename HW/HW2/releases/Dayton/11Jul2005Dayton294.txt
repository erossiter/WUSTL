SEN. DAYTON VOWS TO HELP KITTSON RESIDENTS WITH DISASTER RELIEF; COMMUNITY RECOVERING FROM RECENT FLOODS, TORNADOS
  Sen. Mark Dayton met with Kittson County farmers, residents, and leaders on Saturday to listen to their concerns about the severe flood damage to their community and said he would help them in their efforts to acquire disaster assistance.  
 Kittson County endured floods due to severe storms and extremely heavy rainfall since early May. The 12 ? inches of rain and multiple tornados that ripped through the county just last weekend resulted in washed-out bridges and roads; drowned crops; loss of power; and severe overland flooding. 
   Kittson County's floods prevented approximately 30 percent of the planting of and damaged existing crops by excessive moisture, overland flooding, hail, and wind. In July, a tornado with sustained winds of 130 to 135 miles per hour struck the Lancaster, Humboldt, and Orlean region. 
   "I am here today to listen to local farmers' and residents' concerns," Dayton said. "The people of Kittson County need federal funds to rebuild following the catastrophic damages inflicted by the floods. I will do whatever I can to assist the county in working with FEMA and the Governor's Office. I will maximize disaster aid assistance to the best of my ability." 
   "Kittson County, in the last 10 years, has had one disaster after another," said Kittson County Commissioner and farmer John Anderson. "Local farmers have been taxed year after year. The cumulative disasters have caused an overall negative effect on the local and regional economy. Some farmers have already given up, and others are now seriously considering it."
