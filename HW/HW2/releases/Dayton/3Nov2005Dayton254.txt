SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $3 MILLION FOR UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TO HELP MINNESOTA FARMERS IMPROVE BUSINESS/MARKETING SKILLS
  Sen. Mark Dayton, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, announced today that his request for $3 million in funding for the University of Minnesota's Intensive Technical Assistance Program, and his request for $298,000 for the University's Uniform Farm Management Project have received the final stamp of approval from Congress.  
   The University of Minnesota's Center for Farm Financial Management will use the $3 million to develop a five- to 10-day technical assistance program to provide business and marketing training to farmers who have been hurt by competition from imports. The Center will use the $298,000 to further develop a national database of farm financial information to allow farmers to compare their expenses and earnings to those of similar farms, thereby improving their management and business decisions. 
   "The University of Minnesota's Intensive Technical Assistance Program and the Uniform Farm Management Project are invaluable resources for Minnesota's farmers, who now face more foreign competition than ever before," said Dayton. "I am delighted that the Center for Farm Financial Management will receive over $3 million for these important programs." 
   Kevin Klair with the Center for Farm Financial Management at the University of Minnesota said, "Senator Dayton's support for these programs funded in the FY 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill played an important role in the continuation of the Uniform Farm Management Project and the Intensive Technical Assistance Program. We thank him for his efforts during this time of shrinking federal budgets." 
   The projects, approved by the joint House and Senate Conference Committee, received the funding in the Senate Agriculture's spending bill (H.R. 2744). The Conference Committee's final report will now head to the White House for the President's signature.
