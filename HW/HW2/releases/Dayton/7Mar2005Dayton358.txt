SEN. DAYTON CALLS ON EPA TO ADDRESS SERIOUS FLAWS IN MERCURY EMISSIONS RULE
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton joined with several of his Senate colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen its proposed rule on mercury emissions. The Senators cite new reports, from the EPA Inspector General (IG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which emphasize serious flaws in how the EPA analyzed the impacts of mercury on the health of children and women of childbearing age. In Minnesota alone, more than 5,000 babies are at risk of developing learning and behavioral disorders from exposure to mercury. 
   "Minnesota is one of 48 states that has issued fish consumption advisories for mercury," said Dayton. "Once mercury reaches our waterways, it is highly toxic and builds up in the fish we eat. It is shameful that this Administration continues to ignore scientific facts and instead, allows mercury pollution to jeopardize our health and way of life in Minnesota. Mercury emissions will continue to harm the environment and to endanger the health of children and pregnant women, until this Administration puts public health before politics." 
   A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently concluded that 8 percent of American women of childbearing age have elevated blood mercury levels. Children born to women with elevated blood mercury levels are at higher risk for delayed development, neurological defects, and mental retardation. A recently published study by the Mount Sinai Center for Children's Health and the Environment found that children with lower IQ levels linked to fetal mercury exposure cost the United States $8.7 billion a year. 
   The IG and GAO reports also criticize the EPA's rulemaking process, saying it violated EPA policy, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and, in some instances, provisions of the Clean Air Act.
