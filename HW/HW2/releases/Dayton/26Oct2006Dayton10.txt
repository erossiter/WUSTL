SEN. DAYTON: $1 MILLION TO IMPROVE SAFETY ON HIGHWAY 36
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) will receive a total of $1,000,000 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, administered by the Federal Highway Administration. The funds will be used to reconstruct two miles of Highway 36 between Minneapolis and St. Paul in an effort to reduce injuries and fatalities along this stretch by 20 percent.  
   "Safety should always be our first concern in transportation," said Dayton. "I am delighted that Minnesota will receive this funding to improve our highways and help ensure that commuters arrive at their destinations safely." 
   Specifically, the funding will be used to construct a diamond interchange, an overpass, a pedestrian bridge, and a tunnel. To speed completion and minimize safety hazards, the State plans to close the highway during construction. Because this will be the first time Mn/DOT has implemented a full road closure on a major freeway, an extensive public information program is planned. 
   Construction is scheduled to begin in February of 2007, with completion scheduled for June 2008. The total cost of construction is projected at $22 million.
