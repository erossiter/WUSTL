SEN. DAYTON: FEDERAL FUNDING AWARDED TO ROCHESTER FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR PREVENTION PROGRAMS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Rochester Fire Department will receive nearly $55,000 in federal funds from the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
 These funds will be used to conduct fire prevention programs and activities in the community, specifically aimed towards children. 
   "As summer approaches, the threat of fires and fire-related injuries increases when families plan activities around campfires, fireworks, and barbeques," said Dayton. "This funding will help Rochester firefighters keep their neighborhoods safe by teaching families, and especially children, to be aware of the dangers associated with fire." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration, which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and assists fire departments throughout the U.S. For more information, visit http://www.usfa.fema.gov/grants.
