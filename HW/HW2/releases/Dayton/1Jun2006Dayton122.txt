SEN. DAYTON: $80 MILLION IN TAX CREDITS COMING TO MIDWEST MINNESOTA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION IN DETROIT LAKES
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation (MMCDC), based in Detroit Lakes, will receive a total of $80 million in tax credits from the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI). The corporation is one of 63 organizations, selected from over 250 applicants, to receive tax credits for making qualified investments in low-income communities.  
   "These tax credits will allow the Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation to continue its invaluable contributions to our state's rural communities and local farming economies," said Dayton. 
   MMCDC will use the tax credits to provide loan capital, with flexible and below market rates and terms, for economic development initiatives in Minnesota. Projects include: development of value-added agricultural products, sustainable energy projects, and office and retail space development projects. Flexible loan terms include: significantly reduced interest rates, seven-year interest-only payment periods, and subordinated debt. It is estimated that 75 percent of the funds will go to rural areas of Minnesota. 
   The $80 million tax credit is part of $1.4 billion allocated by the Department of the Treasury's New Markets Tax Credit Program, in FY2006. 
   MMCDC is a nonprofit organization specializing in economic, housing, and community development. Its primary goal is to provide capital to rural residents, businesses, and communities, with special focus on low-income individuals.
