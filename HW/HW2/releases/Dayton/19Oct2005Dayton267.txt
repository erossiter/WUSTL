SEN. DAYTON: SENATE FAILS TO PASS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE TO BENEFIT 49,000 MINNESOTANS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today expressed his disappointment of the Senate's failure to pass legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from the current $5.15 per hour to $6.25 per hour, over the next year and a half.  
 Dayton was a cosponsor of the amendment, which was offered by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to the Transportation and Treasury spending bill. The increase would have benefited 49,000 minimum-wage earners in Minnesota. 
   The amendment would have raised the minimum wage that employers can pay hourly workers from the current $5.15 per hour to $5.70 per hour, six months after the enactment of the bill. The minimum wage would then increase to $6.25 per hour, six months after that. The amendment failed 47 to 51. 
   "It is disgraceful that Congress has turned its back on the low-income workers of America and failed to enact an increase in the minimum wage for almost a decade," said Dayton. 
   Congress has not increased the minimum wage since 1996. Meanwhile, since President Bush took office, 5.3 million more Americans have fallen into poverty. A minimum-wage employee working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, earns only $10,700. That's $4,500 below the poverty line for a family of three. 
   Earlier this year, the Minnesota Legislature approved the first minimum-wage increase in the state since 1997, from $5.15 per hour to $5.25 per hour for small employers and $6.15 per hour for large employers. In 2004, an estimated 49,000 workers in Minnesota were earning $5.15 per hour or less. 
   Yesterday, Senator Dayton voted to strip a provision in the spending measure that would have given Members of Congress a $3,100 cost-of-living adjustment.
