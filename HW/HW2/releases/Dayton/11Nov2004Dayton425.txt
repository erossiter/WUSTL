  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that 10 Minnesota fire departments have been awarded over $700,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used to purchase new fire trucks and equipment, improve firefighting operations, and support training and safety programs.
   "The brave men and women who work tirelessly everyday to protect our homes and neighborhoods deserve the best training and equipment available," said Dayton. "I am pleased this funding will provide Minnesota's firefighters with the resources they need to do their jobs and keep our families safe."
