  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Hutchinson Municipal Airport will receive $285,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration. 
   "Airport safety is critical, and this grant will help the Hutchinson Municipal Airport to meet the burden of snow removal to keep the airport safe during the winter," said Dayton.
