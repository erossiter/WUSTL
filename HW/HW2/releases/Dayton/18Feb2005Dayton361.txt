SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE TO BECOME DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
  Statement of Sen. Dayton on the nomination of Ambassador John D. Negroponte to become Director of National Intelligence: 
   "I voted against Ambassador Negroponte's previous nomination because of his former public record. I will consider this nomination based upon that record, which now includes his service as Ambassador to Iraq, and his qualifications for this new position, which is critically important to our national security. I will not decide whether or not to support his nomination, until I have completed that review."
