SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $300K COMING TO FOSSTON FOR AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Fosston Municipal Airport will receive $290,237 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration.  
   "Local airports in rural areas serve many needs--from aerial crop spraying, to recreational flying, to business travel," said Dayton. "It is critical that their safety and functionality are well-maintained, and this crucial funding will help do that." 
   The grant will be used to acquire snow removal equipment, which is needed to keep aircraft operational areas open during winter weather conditions. The funding will also help construct a service road, improve an access road, rehabilitate a parking lot to restore structural integrity to pavements, and update an airport master plan study, needed to plan future development.
