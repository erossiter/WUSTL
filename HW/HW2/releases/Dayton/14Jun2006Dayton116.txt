SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $192,000 FOR WINSTED MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Winsted Municipal Airport will receive $192,090 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration.  
   "I am delighted Winsted Municipal Airport will receive this federal assistance," said Dayton. "Local airports in rural areas serve many needs - from aerial crop spraying, to recreational flying, to business travel. It is critical that their safety and functionality are well-maintained." 
   The funding will be used to extend the taxiway, to provide access for new planned hangars; to pave a gravel access road; and to reconstruct and expand the parking lot, to better serve the needs of the airport users.
