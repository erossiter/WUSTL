SEN. DAYTON: OVER $286K COMING TO MINNEAPOLIS PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARIES
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Minneapolis Public Schools will receive $286,396 in federal funds for its Improving Literacy through School Libraries program. Funds are provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Dayton noted that Minneapolis Public Schools was the only applicant to receive its full grant request in a highly competitive pool of applicants.  
   "I am delighted that the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program has received this grant, which will help ensure that students in Minneapolis have access to the best books and most advanced technology available," Dayton said. 
   This program serves over 5,000 students at 10 elementary schools that have dated and inadequate media center resources, and whose students demonstrate below-average reading achievement on Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments. Literacy through School Libraries aims at creating cultures of literacy by providing books for students who can and want to read. These resources also reflect the schools' curriculum, students' interests, languages and cultural needs. 
   "We are thrilled to receive this grant allowing our elementary/K-8 media centers to be upgraded with wonderful books and resources that our students deserve and need in order to achieve their reading goals," said Donna von Lehe, curriculum integration specialist for Minneapolis Public Schools. 
   The district will improve student reading by integrating engaging reading materials, complementary technology resources, and literacy initiatives into a comprehensive, research-based reading program. Key project activities will include high quality professional development, site assessments, and collaborative curriculum planning, which will inform the purchasing and use of books and technologies.
