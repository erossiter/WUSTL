SEN. DAYTON COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE TO BECOME DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
  Statement of Sen. Dayton on the nomination of Ambassador John D. Negroponte to become Director of National Intelligence: 
   I voted to confirm Ambassador Negroponte, because he is well-qualified, and because I have been impressed with his service in his very difficult and dangerous role in Iraq. 
   I expressed my strong concerns about his reported activities while Ambassador to Honduras when I opposed his confirmation as Ambassador to Iraq. I believe that his performance in Iraq warrants this confirmation.
