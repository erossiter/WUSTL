  Dayton's Washington Wire
  A semimonthly report on Senator Mark Dayton's activities in Washington, D.C. 
   Dayton's Legislation to Make Movies More Accessible to 28 Million Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Americans Passes the Senate - A Dayton amendment to provide a tax credit for theaters and movie producers to provide captioning access to deaf and hard-of-hearing patrons passed last week in the Senate JOBS bill. Dayton learned of the limited access after he met with students and faculty from the Metro Deaf School in St. Paul. Fewer than 500 of the 35,774 movie screens nationwide have captioning available. http://www.dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004505B06.html

   After Pressure from Minnesota and Wisconsin Congressional Leaders, VA Shelves Plan to Contract Out Services at Twin Ports Clinic - Four weeks after the Veterans' Administration (VA) indicated the possibility that it would end operations at the Twin Ports outpatient veterans clinic, the head of the Minneapolis VA Medical Center informed the area's Congressional leaders that the VA has dropped the idea. http://dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004513839.html
   Dayton Hails Passage of Legislation That Promotes Renewable Energy - Dayton praised the Senate's passage of the JOBS Act late last week. The bipartisan bill includes a provision-originally developed by Dayton - to provide a tax credit to promote the production of biodiesel. It also includes several renewable-energy provisions, including tax incentives for the production of ethanol, biodiesel, and wind energy. http://dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004514A04.html
   Senate Passes Coleman - Dayton Resolution Designating Day in Honor of Norman Borlaug - The Coleman - Dayton resolution designates October 16, 2004, as World Food Prize Day in honor of Minnesotan Dr. Norman Borlaug. Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for expanding food production, saving hundreds of millions of people worldwide from starvation. http://dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004514B23.html
   Dayton Supports Bipartisan Legislation to Reauthorize Special Education Funding - Dayton voted last week to reauthorize IDEA, a bill which guarantees the right of every child with a disability to a free, appropriate public education. Over 6.5 million children with disabilities receive special education services provided under this law. Despite voting for the bill, Dayton remains concerned that the legislation fails to provide full funding for special education, thus shortchanging thousands of Minnesota students. http://dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004513E12.html 
   Senator Blasts Republicans for Denying Unemployment Insurance to Jobless Americans - Dayton voted last week to extend unemployment insurance benefits to over 1.5 million Americans, including 19,000 Minnesotans, who have exhausted their jobless benefits. http://dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004513345.html
   As Gas Prices Top $2 per Gallon, Dayton Urges Administration to Take Immediate Action - Last week Dayton joined with his Senate colleagues asking the Energy Secretary to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because it is driving prices up at the gas pump. Without prompt action by the Administration to increase the supply of oil available, the price of gasoline during the summer ahead will exceed record prices. http://dayton.senate.gov/~dayton/releases/2004/05/2004512702.html
