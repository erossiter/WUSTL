SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $300,000 FOR DODGE CENTER AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Dodge Center Airport will receive $300,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration.
   "I am delighted Dodge Center will receive this federal assistance," said Dayton. "Local airports in rural areas serve many needs - from aerial crop spraying, to recreational flying, to business travel. It is critical that their safety and functionality are well-maintained." 
   The funding will be used to build a new taxiway to facilitate access to the hangar area.
