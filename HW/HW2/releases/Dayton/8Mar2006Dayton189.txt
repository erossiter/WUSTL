SEN. DAYTON, COLLEAGUES PASS MODEST LIHEAP FUNDING PACKAGE; NOT ENOUGH TO MEET MINNESOTA'S NEED, SEN. DAYTON FEARS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today applauded the Senate's passage of an additional $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), but expressed disappointment that it will not be enough to cover every eligible Minnesotan. The bill (S.2320), which passed last night, allocates an additional $1 billion for the program, in FY2006.  
   "Though it falls far short of Minnesota's needs, I am pleased that the Senate today approved $1 billion in additional LIHEAP funding," said Dayton. "I hope that the House will quickly follow suit, to help ease the pain of soaring energy costs for our nation's neediest citizens." 
   So far, in FY2006, only 145,859 of Minnesota's 450,000 eligible households have received heating assistance from LIHEAP - less than 1/3. Minnesota has received $81.6 million LIHEAP funding in FY2006. 
   The additional $1 billion approved today by the Senate would bring total LIHEAP funding to $3.16 for FY2006 - nearly $2 billion below the federally authorized level. Dayton has cosponsored four amendments to fully fund LIHEAP at the authorized level of $5.1 billion, but all were defeated by the Republican-controlled Congress. In his FY2007 budget proposal, President Bush allocates only $1.78 billion for LIHEAP.
