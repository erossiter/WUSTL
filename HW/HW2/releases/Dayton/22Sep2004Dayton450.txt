SEN. DAYTON CALLS ON COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO EXPAND TREATMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton joined with Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Congressional Conferees urging them to include, in the final version of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act, an amendment that would expand treatment and other services for sickle cell disease patients.  
 The amendment would increase funding for treatment and research efforts; expand public awareness about the disease; establish a national sickle cell disease research center; and provide additional services, such as genetic counseling and testing, for those with sickle cell disease.
   "Sickle cell disease affects the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every day," said Dayton. "I urge my colleagues to retain this important initiative in the final JOBS bill, so that we can increase access to affordable, high-quality medical treatment for children and adults afflicted by this devastating disease."
   Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder which causes normally round blood cells to take on a sickle shape, clogging the bloodstream and creating severe medical complications. Approximately 70,000 Americans suffer from sickle cell disease, and more than 2.5 million Americans carry the sickle cell trait. In the United States, the disease primarily affects African-Americans; one in 300 African-American newborns has the disorder. 
   This legislation is endorsed by several organizations, including: the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, the National Medical Association (African American Doctors' Association), the National Association of Children's Hospitals, and the National Association of Community Health Centers.
