SEN. DAYTON CALLS ON BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO REVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF GREAT LAKES
  Sen. Mark Dayton today called upon the Bush Administration and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael O. Leavitt, who is visiting Duluth today, to move expeditiously to address the grave environmental problems afflicting the Great Lakes. Dayton commends the goals of the new Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, created by an Executive Order in May, 2004, and managed by the EPA, to provide direction regarding federal policies and programs to restore the Great Lakes. He is disappointed however, by the Administration's refusal to adequately fund existing programs to restore the Great Lakes. 
   "On one hand, you have the President creating this task force, giving the impression that cleaning up the Great Lakes is a priority. But then, on the other hand, you have the President submitting a budget to Congress that under funds almost every program designed to restore the Great Lakes," said Dayton.
   In fiscal year 2004, Dayton, as a member of the bipartisan Congressional Great Lakes Task Force, championed increased funding for many projects aimed at cleaning up and restoring the world's largest freshwater system, while the President's budget recommended cutting current spending levels. Some important projects, such as the invasive species dispersal barrier for the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, which the Congressional GLTF, Minnesota Governor Pawlenty, and other Great Lakes Governors supported, were underfunded by the President. The following chart details funding for fiscal year 2004 projects affecting the Great Lakes:
   Program, Congressional GLTF Recommendation, President's Request, Amount Appropriated:
   * U.S. Department of Agriculture Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion: $3 million, $0, $2.5 million
   * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $82.9 million, $73.3 million, $77.6 million
   * U.S. Department of State Great Lakes Fishery Commission: $16.5 million, $12.2 million, $12.2 million
   * U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Great Lakes Fish & Wildlife Restoration Programs: $4 million, $1.2 million, $1.7 million
   "The President has created a new layer of bureaucracy without providing sufficient funding for the programs which this bureaucracy is designed to oversee," said Dayton. "I urge Administrator Leavitt to use the task force to start delivering real solutions to preserve the Great Lakes for future generations."
   In the U.S. Senate, Dayton continues to support legislation aimed at the environmental restoration of the Great Lakes area. He cosponsors the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act (S. 1398), which would provide $6 billion over 10 years for Great Lakes ecosystem restoration, and the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act (S. 525), which would protect U.S. waters by preventing the introduction of new aquatic invasive species. Furthermore, Dayton joined with his Senate colleagues in requesting a two-year extension of a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes.
