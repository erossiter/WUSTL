SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S SPEECH ON IRAQ
  Sen. Mark Dayton's Statement on President Bush's Speech on Iraq 
   "There has always been a big gap between the President's rhetoric and Iraq's reality. If conditions there were as good as he claimed tonight, the lives of the Iraqi people would be much better, the burdens on our courageous troops would be far lighter, and the levels of violence directed against all of them would be much less than they actually are. 
   "All Americans want the President to succeed in creating a democratic, secure, and self-reliant Iraq. We needed him to tell us tonight why, over two years, after our military forces swept the country so successfully and toppled Saddam Hussein, his efforts to secure and restore the country have been so unsuccessful and have left the conditions of lawlessness, violence, and misery that are exploited for terrorist operations."
