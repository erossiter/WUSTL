SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $140K COMING TO LEECH LAKE TRIBAL COLLEGE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Leech Lake Tribal College of Cass Lake will receive $139,800 in a federal grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Economic Development loan and grant program. Funding will be used to purchase equipment for the college.  
   "Ensuring that all Minnesota education institutions receive the resources needed to fulfill their mission has been a top priority of mine in the Senate," said Dayton. "This funding will ensure Leech Lake Tribal College educators and students receive the tools they need to be successful." 
   The funding comes on the heels of $350,000 and $638,000 USDA Rural Economic Development loans in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
