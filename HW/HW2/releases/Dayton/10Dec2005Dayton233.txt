SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF SEN. MCCARTHY
  "Gene McCarthy was truly one of Minnesota's greatest senators. He changed the face of national politics in 1968, when he forced the incumbent president Lyndon Johnson to drop his re-election bid. Senator McCarthy's own presidential campaign and his principle opposition to the Vietnam War ignited a generation of political activists and civic leaders. His brilliance and eloquence will be missed."
