SENATE VOTES ON SEN. DAYTON AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD ENSURE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR MEN, WOMEN PROVIDING SECURITY AT FEDERAL BUILDINGS
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton offered an amendment which would ensure that the men and women providing security protection at federal buildings in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana are being adequately compensated.  
 The measure was defeated by a vote of 49 - 45. Dayton learned of the employees' situation after speaking with the officers who protect the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Ft. Snelling, the location of Dayton's principal Senate office in the state.
   "At a time when private companies are providing security at sites such as U.S. Army bases and federal circuit courts, it is critical that we not simply sell off our security to the lowest bidder," said Dayton. "Any company can underbid a contract merely by cutting the guards' pay or benefits, and this is wrong."
   Specifically, Dayton's amendment states that if a company enters into a pre-existing contract with the federal government, that company cannot change the benefits of the employees performing the contract, without the employees' consent. 
   "My amendment simply required that if a company wants to cut the benefits of the good men and women who protect federal buildings across this country, then the company has to let the employees know. This is the least we could have done for the people who are risking their lives every day to protect us," said Dayton.
