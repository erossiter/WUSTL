SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW REPORT ABOUT EDUCATION SPENDING IN MINNESOTA
  Today, the national publication, Education Week, released findings highlighting that Minnesota is providing less increased funding for its schoolchildren than most other states in the country.  
 The report released today shows that Minnesota increased its per-student spending by one of the smallest percentage increases of any state in the nation from 2001 to 2002. The state's spending increased by only 1.2 percent per-student compared to states such as Arkansas and Arizona whose per-student spending increased by 13 percent. The national average in state increased spending per-student was 4.9 percent. 
   "Education Week's report confirms what I have been saying for the last several years: Minnesota is failing its schoolchildren. Our citizen's per capita income ranks 8th highest among the 50 states; yet we are only 23rd in the state's per pupil funding for K-12 schoolchildren. On average, the other states' increases in their education support were 4 times greater than Minnesota's in the most recent reported year. The federal government has also failed to provide the funding promised for special education and for No Child Left Behind programs. 
   "Federal and state officials have rightfully preached the necessity of accountability in public education. Yet, they have failed to hold themselves accountable for providing the funds and policies that will give every child the chance to learn and to succeed. This failure is morally wrong, socially destructive, and tragically short-sighted. Our children are our state's future."
