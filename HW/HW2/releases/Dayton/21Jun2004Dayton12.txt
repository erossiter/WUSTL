SEN. DAYTON'S BUY AMERICAN AMENDMENT WOULD HELP KEEP AMERICAN DEFENSE JOBS AT HOME
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton asked his Senate colleagues to vote for his "Buy American" amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill.  
 Provisions in the current bill allow the Secretary of Defense to offer defense contractors in foreign countries the same considerations as American companies. Thus, in making purchases, the Department of Defense could consider defense materials made in France to be "Made in the USA." The Dayton amendment would eliminate those provisions from the bill. A vote in relation to Dayton's amendment is expected early this week.
   "Critical defense needs, such as planes, steel, ball and roller bearings, engines, pumps, etc., could be bought by our own Defense Department and treated as made in the USA, if my amendment does not pass," said Dayton. "This would demolish well paying American manufacturing jobs. U.S. tax dollars sent overseas reap no return on American taxpayers' investment in defending America and the rest of the free world."
   DOD's budget is larger than the combined budgets of the next ten largest spending countries on defense. "Almost $500 billion tax dollars spent on our defense systems should be used for putting Americans to work, not employing overseas contractors.
   "It is one thing for the private sector to export American jobs, but for our own government to do it with taxpayers' money is reprehensible. The Department of Defense should be focused on national security. Do we really want other countries making our defense systems? Don't we want to employ our own citizens in making our defense systems?
   "A vote against my amendment is a vote to export American defense jobs."
