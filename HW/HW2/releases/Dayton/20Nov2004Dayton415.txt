SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS OVER $85 MILLION FOR IMPORTANT MINNESOTA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Minnesota is set to receive over $85 million in the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY 2005, which is expected to pass the Senate today.

   "Our state's highways, bridges, mass transit systems, and rail lines are in terrible condition and are getting worse every day.
