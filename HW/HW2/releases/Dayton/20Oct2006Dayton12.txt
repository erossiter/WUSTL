SEN. DAYTON: ST. CLOUD RECEIVES OVER $490K FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced today that St. Cloud will receive $490,904 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, administered through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.  
   "This funding plays a vital role in providing housing and infrastructure for families and communities," said Dayton. "I am delighted that St. Cloud will benefit from these grants, which have been essential to the revitalization of thousands of communities across the United States." 
   The CDBG program helps communities nationwide meet the challenges of providing affordable housing; making public improvements, such as maintaining flood and drainage facilities; building senior centers, libraries, and water/sewer projects; and fostering economic development. Awards are determined based upon indicators of community need, including the extent of poverty, population, housing overcrowding, age of housing, and population growth lag. Founded in 1974, the CDBG program is one of the longest continuously run programs at HUD.
