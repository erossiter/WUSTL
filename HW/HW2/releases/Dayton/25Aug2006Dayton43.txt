SEN. DAYTON: $500K COMING FOR MINNESOTA CRIME-FIGHTING INFORMATION SYSTEM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced $500,000 in federal funding for the CriMNet program, which integrates criminal justice information systems between Minnesota law enforcement agencies. 
   "The CriMNet program ensures that local police forces in Minnesota are able to efficiently communicate with one another, greatly boosting their ability to fight crime," Dayton said. 
   The goal of the CriMNet program is to provide all criminal justice professionals in Minnesota with access to complete and accurate information about offenders. The funding will be used to create a central, statewide indexing service that tracks people and events in the criminal justice system, which is able to accurately match an individual with events. Currently, many local police departments have no efficient way to communicate with each other, and there is no common database that all law enforcement agencies can access in order to share information. 
   The funding, included at Dayton's request, was approved last year by Congress, as part of the FY 2006 spending bill for the Commerce, Justice, and Science agencies.
