SEN. DAYTON AWARDED 'GOLDEN TRIANGLE' BY NATIONAL FARMERS UNION FOR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP ON ISSUES AFFECTING RURAL AMERICA
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton received the 2004 National Farmers Union Golden Triangle Award, the organization's highest honor, for his leadership and support of legislation affecting rural America.  
 Specifically, Dayton is being recognized for his support of fairer trade initiatives, mandatory country-of-origin labeling, agricultural disaster aid, and the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act.
   "Agriculture is at the heart of Minnesota's economy and is the lifeline for rural communities across the state," said Dayton. "Yet, over the last couple of years, Minnesota's farmers and producers have been battered by bad weather, crop losses, and low farm prices. Our farmers are out of money and being forced into bankruptcy.
   "During my time in the Senate and as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, I have made it a top priority to work with the National Farmers Union and other farm groups in Minnesota to develop and support legislation which encourages investment in our farmers and furnishes them the aid they need to secure a more stable, prosperous future and remain competitive in the global marketplace.
   "I am thrilled to receive this honor today and will continue to concentrate my efforts on supporting legislation which will restore the economic well-being of rural America."
   Originated in 1988, the Golden Triangle is presented annually to select lawmakers who show leadership in a variety of policy areas important to farmers and agricultural producers, including emergency farm assistance, trade assistance, mandatory price reporting, and concentration in the agricultural industry. The award is based on the National Farmers Union symbol: a triangle with "legislation" and "cooperation" forming the sides and "education" forming the base.
