SEN. DAYTON: ITASCA COUNTY TO RECEIVE $350K TO HELP VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Safe Havens for Children Program of Itasca County will receive $350,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Domestic Violence Against Women. The grant will help fund the supervised visits and safe exchanges of children in situations involving domestic and dating violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and stalking.  
   "This funding gives communities the tools to assist victims of domestic violence," said Dayton. "This program provides an essential support network for victims, which enables them to feel safe, avoid future violence, and rebuild their lives." 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 created the Safe Havens for Children Program to protect children, parents, and caretakers from witnessing domestic violence, experiencing sexual assault, experiencing abduction, injury or death during parent and child visitation exchanges. Itasca County will be working with the Advocates for Family Peace and its Wellstone Family Safety Program (WFSP), a non-profit organization that aims to support women and children to lead lives free of violence or abuse. Itasca County will use the funding to increase the number of supervised child visits and exchanges within underserved populations, enhance community collaboration with other human service agencies, and increase staff and volunteer training to ensure client safety.
