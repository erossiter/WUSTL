SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS TO DELIVER $900 MILLION TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COMBAT METH EPIDEMIC
  The U.S. Senate today unanimously passed legislation by Sens. Mark Dayton and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) to restore the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Grant programs to $900 million. Byrne grants, which fund state and local police efforts to combat methamphetamine and other drugs, have been repeatedly slashed every year since FY2003. 
   "It's wrong to keep asking our local law enforcement officials to do more and more enforcement with less and less resources," said Dayton. "Without federal support through Byrne grants, there will be fewer regional drug task forces and less training and equipment for police and sheriffs."
   In FY2006, Byrne was cut by 34 percent from the previous year, which resulted in a $1.7 million loss in grants for Minnesota alone. For FY2007, the Administration has proposed to eliminate the program. Below is a summary of funding cuts for the Byrne grant program, since FY2003
   *FY 2006 - $416 million, a 54 percent cut from FY 2003
   *FY 2005 - $634 million
   *FY 2004 - $725 million
   *FY 2003 - $900 million
   The Byrne Grant program targets illegal drugs, including meth-the most rapidly spreading drug in the U.S.-by allowing law enforcement agencies to acquire new personnel, equipment, training, technical assistance, and information systems. It also provides critical funding to Minnesota's 21 regional drug task forces, which combat the epidemic of meth trafficking and production. Rural communities are especially dependent upon Byrne Grants to stop the illegal use and production of methamphetamine; over 75 percent of all meth labs in Minnesota are located in rural or semi-rural areas.
   Major law enforcement groups, including the National Narcotics Coalition, the National Sheriff's Association, and the National Police and Peace Officers support the Dayton-Chambliss amendment.
   Cosponsors of the Dayton-Chambliss amendment include: Senators Baucus (D-MT), Bingaman (D-NM), Hagel (R-NE), Kerry (D-MA), Kohl (D-WI), Levin (D-MI), Mikulski (D-MD), Nelson (D-NE), Obama (D-IL), Salazar (D-CO), Snowe (R-ME), Stabenow (D-MI), and Talent (R-MO).
