SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES NEARLY $200,000 IN GRANTS FOR FOUR MINNESOTA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that four Minnesota fire departments have been awarded nearly $200,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used to purchase new equipment, improve fire station facilities, and support firefighter training and wellness programs. 
   "Minnesota's firefighters risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe," said Dayton. "It is crucial that we continue to provide first responders with the equipment and training they need to perform this demanding task."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, provides direct assistance to local fire departments for general firefighter operations. The program helps support training and safety programs, emergency-vehicle and equipment acquisition, and fire station improvements. This is the twentieth round of awards for fiscal year 2004. 
   Communities receiving grants include: 
   Fergus Falls Fire Department - $55,566 
   Foley Fire Department - $46,011
