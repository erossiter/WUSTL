SEN. DAYTON: CENTER FOR ADVANCED RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AT UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TO RECEIVE $328 K FOR UNIQUE LANGUAGE PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition (CARLA) at the University of Minnesota will receive $328,000 from the U.S. Department of Education under the Language Resource Centers Program. The competitive grant will be used to establish, strengthen and operate centers to improve the nation's capacity for teaching students foreign languages.  
   "This funding provides teachers and students with the best technology available to help in the acquisition of essential language skills for the 21st Century global society," said Dayton. 
   The grant will enable CARLA to collaborate with several programs throughout the country to support K-12 language teachers' technology needs, develop web based programs for less commonly taught languages, and expand language immersion projects in the Twin Cities area. The grant will also allow CARLA to continue to serve as a sponsor for the Language Teacher Education Conference which helps to ensure that the needs of language educators are met. 
   Elaine Tarone, Director of CARLA at the University of Minnesota, said: "We are honored to receive this highly competitive grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The University of Minnesota's CARLA is one of only a handful of National Language Resource Centers in the country that conduct research to improve the quality of foreign language teaching and learning. We look forward to working with Minnesota's highly qualified foreign language professionals to increase the number of students who achieve high levels of foreign language proficiency in our K-12 and post-secondary institutions."
