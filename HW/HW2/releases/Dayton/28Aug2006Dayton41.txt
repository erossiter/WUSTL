SEN. DAYTON: OVER $1.2 MILLION FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO 3 MINNESOTA AIRPORTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that three airports in Minnesota will receive a total of $1,218,594 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration. 
   "Regional airports play a key role in spurring economic development throughout the state," said Dayton. "This FAA funding will help to upgrade and expand our regional airports, so that they can continue to provide safe air travel and high quality customer service in Minnesota."
   Funding will be delivered to the following Minnesota communities: 
   *$804,317 for Duluth International Airport, to expand the terminal building. This funding is provided as part of a multi-year grant to improve the efficiency and capacity of the terminal building. 
   *$289,277 for Red Wing Regional Airport, to expand the general aviation parking apron, which will increase the capacity for parking aircraft at the airport. 
   *$125,000 for Albert Lea Municipal Airport, to be used towards obstruction removal (tree topping) in the approach, which will enhance safety at the airport.
