SEN. DAYTON: OVER $3 MILLION COMING TO TWIN CITIES FOR HIV TREATMENT, SOCIAL SERVICES
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Hennepin County Community Health Department will receive $3,046,512 in federal funding for health and social services for people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The grant, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, will be used to provide hospital and ambulance services, substance abuse treatment, counseling, and treatment education for HIV-positive individuals and their families in the Twin Cities metro area. 
   "Congratulations to Hennepin County Health Department for winning this important grant award," said Dayton. "It will help their dedicated effort to assist patients who are HIV positive."
   More than 5,100 Minnesotans currently live with HIV. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, about 41 percent of Minnesotans who were aware of their HIV status in 2003 did not receive medical care for their disease. Since 1990, the number of people in Hennepin County living with HIV has increased by six or seven percent, annually. During the same time, the number of AIDS-related deaths has decreased, which public health officials attribute, in part, to more effective treatment options.
