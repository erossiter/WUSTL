SEN. DAYTON: $99K COMING TO HELP HOMELESS YOUTH
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) will receive $99,000 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help provide housing for homeless youth. The funding, which Sen. Mark Dayton fought to secure in the 2006 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development spending bill, is part of a HUD Economic Development Initiative Special Project Grant.  
   "Every child deserves a place to call home," said Dayton. "I am delighted that the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency will be able to use this funding to help eliminate juvenile homelessness in our state." 
   The grant will support MHFA development projects that provide housing to homeless youth, as part of a program that aims to eliminate long-term homelessness in Minnesota by 2010. MHFA also provides home mortgage financing for first-time homebuyers, apartment financing for low-income families, rehabilitation financing for single- and multi-family housing, and operating support and rental subsidies.
