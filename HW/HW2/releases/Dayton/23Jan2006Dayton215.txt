SEN. DAYTON GOES TO BAT FOR MINNESOTA CATTLE RANCHERS, SECURING OVER $1 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today secured $1,001,749 for three cattle ranchers in Beltrami County who were promised compensation from the USDA but had not received it after more than a month of delays. When the ranchers, joint owners of a large herd recently diagnosed with tuberculosis, learned of their cattle's disease, they immediately reported it to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Department's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) as mandated by the USDA. However, the USDA failed to compensate the ranchers for their infected cattle.  
   The ranchers' herd of about 1,000 animals has been quarantined and slated for depopulation since mid-December. USDA should have compensated the ranchers quickly, so they could process their infected cattle and repopulate their farms. Instead, farmers were told they would need to wait an additional 30-60 days - losing $1,200 each day on feed - because of bureaucratic red tape at the APHIS. 
   After a call today from Dayton expressing the urgency of the situation, APHIS Administrator Ron DeHaven agreed to release the funds this afternoon from his Administrator's Contingency Fund reserved for emergency disease purposes. 
   "I am pleased to help Minnesota farmers in any way that I can, and I would like to thank Dr. DeHaven for his quick action on this urgent matter," said Dayton. 
   One partial owner, a first-year farmer suffering serious financial losses, estimates the delay has cost him $43,000 in wasted feed so far. "To me, depopulation is a stressful time in your life and all of the delays and all the problems I've had in getting compensated makes it that much more difficult. I would like to thank Senator Dayton for his help to get APHIS to do what has been promised for a long time." 
   The ranchers' herd marks Minnesota's fifth confirmed instance of tuberculosis.
