SEN.DAYTON BLASTS REPUBLICANS FOR DENYING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO JOBLESS AMERICANS
  Sen. Mark Dayton voted last night in support of an amendment to extend unemployment insurance benefits to over 1.5 million Americans, including 19,000 Minnesotans, who have exhausted their jobless benefits.  
 Although the majority - 59 members - of the Senate supported the unemployment extension amendment, the measure failed because Senate budget rules require a three-fifths supermajority. 
   "For the second time in the past two months, my Republican colleagues have failed to recognize the need to immediately extend assistance to the thousands of Americans who cannot find work and are struggling to provide for their families," said Dayton. "Since President Bush took office, over 1.5 million Americans have lost their jobs. Until this job deficit is erased, Congress should do the right thing and support people who are looking for work but cannot find it."
   This amendment would have extended the federal Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation program for six months, providing an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits. Funding would have been provided by the federal unemployment trust fund, which currently has $13.3 billion designated for unemployment insurance situations such as the current one.
