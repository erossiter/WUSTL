SEN. DAYTON SECURES NEARLY $618 MILLION IN BYRNE GRANTS TO HELP FIGHT WAR ON DRUGS INCLUDING METHAMPHETAMINES
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton praised the inclusion of $618 million in funds for the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Grant Program in the FY2005 Senate Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations bill. Dayton has been fighting for these funds since last April, when he and Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) sent a letter to Senate Appropriators urging them to provide $659 million in FY2005 funding for the program. Dayton's letter was signed by 47 of his Senate colleagues. 
   "I was happy to hear today that the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee preserved the integrity of the Byrne Grant Program by providing a significant portion of the funding I requested earlier this year," said Dayton. "Local law enforcement agencies across the country need these dollars to fight the war on drugs. And 23 drug task force agencies in Minnesota currently depend of this funding to target criminal trafficking and selling of drugs, including methamphetamines. 
   "I will continue to work with my colleagues to increase funding for this vital program so that Minnesota law enforcement officials will not receive less funding next year than they did last year. Earlier this year, the President eliminated this very important program from his budget. Why he would decide to select the Byrne Grant Program to be fiscally responsible is mind-boggling to me."
   Bob Bushman, President of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association and a narcotics officer, said, "This funding is critical to drug law enforcement operations in Minnesota. Any loss of funding would seriously hamper our efforts and would also set back the progress we have made over the past years in the State of Minnesota. We would like to thank Senator Dayton and others in the Minnesota delegation who supported our efforts to get this Byrne Grant funding restored."
