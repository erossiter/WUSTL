SEN. DAYTON: HENDRICKS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL TO RECEIVE $300,000 TO BUILD NEW CLINIC
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Hendricks Community Hospital will receive a $300,000 federal grant to start phase two in the expansion and renovation of their hospital. The grant is provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Economic Development Grant program.  
   "I am delighted that the Hendricks Community Hospital will receive USDA's funding," said Dayton. "The new clinic and hospital improvements will enable the dedicated medical staff to better serve their patients." 
   The USDA grant will be used for phase two of the Hendricks Community Hospital expansion project. Last year, the hospital received a USDA loan for phase one that included additions of a new operating room, recovering room and admitting area. Phase two will consist of demolishing the Hendricks Clinic - housed in a 1926 hospital building - and relocating and building a new, state-of-the art clinic to join the hospital and nursing home complex. 
   Hendericks Community Hospital is a private non-profit organization that provides comprehensive care services to a service area of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people in southwestern Minnesota and east central South Dakota.
