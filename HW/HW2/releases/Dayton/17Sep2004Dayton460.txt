SEN. DAYTON: DULUTH RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS SHELTER RECEIVES $100,000 TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OVER 150 LOCAL TEENS WHO SLEEP ON STREET EVERY NIGHT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a $100,000 Street Outreach Grant to Lutheran Social Service of Duluth.  
 The funding, through the federal Administration on Children, Youth and Families, will be used to support the Basic Center Runaway and Homeless Youth Program. The program provides transitional housing, meals, counseling, and free transportation to shelters for runaway, homeless, and street-dependent youth. It is estimated that over 150 homeless young people sleep on the streets of Duluth every night.
   "At-risk young adults in northeastern Minnesota depend upon the services of the Basic Center Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, the only source of assistance to this vulnerable population in a five-county area," said Dayton. "This funding will help Lutheran Social Service continue to keep our youth safe and off the street." 
   John Moline, Lutheran Social Service Director of Counseling and Youth Family Resources, said, "This funding is extremely important to northeast Minnesota in helping to educate and to assist these youth in finding alternative solutions to street living."
   Established in 1865, Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota is now the largest, statewide, private nonprofit social service agency in Minnesota, with over 2,300 employees serving in 300 communities.
