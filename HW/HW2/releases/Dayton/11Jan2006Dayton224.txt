SEN. DAYTON: OVER $113,000 COMING TO CLEARBROOK FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that $113,221 is coming to Clearbrook Fire Department, to pay for fire operations and fire safety. The funds are being awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). "The brave men and women who work tirelessly everyday to protect our homes and neighborhoods deserve the best training and equipment available," said Dayton. "I am pleased this funding will provide Clearbrook's firefighters with the resources they need to do their jobs and keep their community safe." The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the 20th round of awards this year. Due to the additional burden on local agencies since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many Minnesota fire departments rely on funds from FIRE Act and state formula grants to hire additional personnel, buy new fire trucks, radios, and other equipment, and establish general fire-prevention programs. Last year, Minnesota received $17 million from this program. In July, Dayton fought to restore $597 million to the FIRE grants program, which would be cut under the Bush Administration's FY06 budget.
