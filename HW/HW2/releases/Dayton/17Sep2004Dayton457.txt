SEN. DAYTON INTRODUCES BILL TO PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY FOR TAXPAYERS, PREVENT POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP WITH TAX CUTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton introduced legislation to prohibit Congress from passing tax laws that change from one year to the next.  
 Dayton's bill states that any changes to the federal tax code must take effect within one year of enactment and remain fully in effect until changed by a future action of Congress.
   "It is time to stop the ridiculous games and gimmickry with tax laws," said Dayton. "My bill would prevent tax changes from appearing, abruptly disappearing, and then reappearing from year to year. 
   "For example, the 10 percent tax bracket, marriage penalty tax relief, and the child tax credit are set to expire in December. Under my plan those tax cuts would be permanent. Taxpayers would not have to ride the precarious politics of every election year. And they could hold their current Members of Congress responsible for each tax change they make."
   Dayton's bill will be referred to the Senate Finance Committee, where it will be considered for future action by the Senate.
