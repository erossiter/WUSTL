SEN. DAYTON: OVER $575,000 GRANT WILL HELP DULUTH YMCA TO IMPLEMENT MENTORING PROGRAM FOR AT-RISK SCHOOL CHILDREN
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Duluth-area Family YMCA has received a grant of $575,864 from the U.S. Department of Education, to provide at-risk children with adult mentors.  
 The funds will be used to develop and implement the Duluth YMCA's "Mentor Duluth" program, which pairs at-risk children in grades four through eight with adult volunteer mentors, chosen through the AmeriCorps program. 
   "Congratulations to the Duluth YMCA for receiving the AmeriCorps in-school mentoring grant," said Dayton. "As a former teacher myself, I know how important it is for students to work with teachers and mentors on a weekly basis to build their confidence. One-on-one mentoring results in happier kids, better grades, and improved relationships with parents, teachers, and other students."
