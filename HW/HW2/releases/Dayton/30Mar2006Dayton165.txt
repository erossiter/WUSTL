SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $350,000 TO CURB UNDERAGE DRINKING IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Minnesota has been awarded $350,000 through the Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws Block Grant Program. The grant provided by the U.S. Department of Justice, funds activities at the state and local levels in law enforcement, public education programs, and innovative methods to prevent underage drinking.  
   "I am delighted that this funding will help keep many Minnesota teens alcohol-free," said Dayton. 
   The goal of the Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) Program is to support and enhance state and local efforts to enforce laws prohibiting the purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors. The funding will be used primarily in the Division of Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement for training law officers and towards alcohol compliance checks. Funding will also be applied towards community coalition building and Youth in Action, a youth program that is partnered with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), to combat underage drinking.
