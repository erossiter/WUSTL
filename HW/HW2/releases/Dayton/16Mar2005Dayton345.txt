SEN. DAYTON: BUDGET SHORTCHANGES VETERANS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today voted in support of increasing the Veteran Administration's health care account by $2.85 billion in 2006.  
 The President's budget proposal continues to bar certain veterans from acquiring VA care and insufficiently funds the medical care account due to the high number of new veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Since January, 2003, over 192,000 veterans have been denied treatment at VA health care centers across the country, including 4,119 in Minnesota, due to lack of funding. 
   "Why must this Administration continue to make it so hard for veterans to get the health care they need and deserve?" said Dayton. "The President's budget includes a ridiculously small increase of less than two percent for veterans' health care, not enough even to maintain current, woefully inadequate services. What an insult to our servicemen and women after their devoted service to our country. 
   "We owe our veterans quality health care. That is absolutely the least we can do for them." 
   In Minnesota, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates major medical centers in Minneapolis and St. Cloud. In 2004, VA served 13,149 inpatients in Minnesota and received over 784,979 outpatient visits. To provide better access to health care for veterans, especially those living in rural areas, VA has community-based outpatient clinics in Brainerd, Chippewa Falls, Iron Range, Maplewood, Superior, WI, and a South Central clinic serving Rochester and Montevideo. Additionally, VA operates Vet Centers in Minneapolis, St. Cloud, and Duluth.
