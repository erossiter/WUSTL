SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $200K FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMING TO MINNETONKA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that Minnetonka will receive $196,706 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in the form of a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).  
   "I am delighted that Minnetonka will benefit from this grant," said Dayton. "CDBG awards have played a vital role in revitalizing thousands of communities nationwide and have helped provide housing for many who could otherwise not afford it. 
   CDBG funding develops viable communities by providing housing, a suitable living environment, and increased economic opportunities, primarily for persons of low and moderate incomes. Founded in 1974, the CDBG program is one of the longest continuously run programs at HUD.
