SEN. DAYTON DEFENDS MILK INCOME LOSS CONTRACT PROGRAM IN BUDGET BILL
  Sens. Mark Dayton and Herb Kohl (D-WI) today successfully prevented a possible budget point of order against the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program.  
 Earlier today, Dayton and Kohl argued to fellow Democrats that removing this program from the 2006 Budget Reconciliation bill (S. 1932) could have devastating effects on small dairy farmers. 
   "I am delighted that we were able to prevent a planned budget point of order against the MILC Program," said Dayton. "This program is vital to dairy producers in Minnesota and elsewhere nationwide." 
   A two-year extension of the MILC Program, which provides assistance to dairy farmers when the price of milk falls, was attached to the Budget Reconciliation bill earlier this fall; the bill is currently being debated on the Senate floor. Although the extension cuts benefits under MILC by nearly 25 percent, eliminating the program entirely would be even more harmful to Minnesota farmers.
