SEN. DAYTON PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF OVER $3.7 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA CONSERVATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY 2005, which is expected to pass the Senate today, includes over $3.7 million for several important conservation projects in Minnesota. The funding, secured by Dayton, will help continue efforts to preserve the state's forests and wildlife refuges.  
   "Minnesota is home to some of the most beautiful forests and wildlife refuges in the country," said Dayton. "Every year, millions of people from around the nation visit these special places. It is crucial that we continue to fund preservation initiatives which protect our precious lands, including the Mississippi headwaters and the Brainerd Lakes region, the heart of lake country, so that generations to come can enjoy the natural beauty of these areas.
   "I am pleased that this funding will be used to restore the historic Duluth Armory, which witnessed the last funeral of a Union Civil War soldier, prepared the 125th army infantry unit which faced more combat than any other unit in World War II, and served as a stage for American music history. It is truly important we preserve this Minnesota treasure for future generations."
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
   The following is a list of programs included in the Appropriations bill: 
   * $2,000,000 for the Brainerd Lakes Forest Legacy Program: Funding will protect the region's environment, economy, and community through a conservation easement on 4,790 acres of privately owned forest in the Brainerd Lakes region. 
   * $375,000 for the Superior National Forests land acquisition: Funding will be used to acquire land for wildlife protection and controlled public recreation. 
   * $250,000 for the Duluth National Guard Armory, Save America's Treasures: Funding will be used for the conservation and historic preservation of the historic Duluth National Guard Armory.
