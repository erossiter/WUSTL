SEN. DAYTON SECURES $263,000 TO GIVE SOUTHEASTERN MN FARMERS TOOLS TO INCREASE WATER QUALITY IN THEIR COMMUNITY
  Sen. Mark Dayton, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, announced today that his request for $263,000 in funding for a coalition of six Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Councils in four states to study and implement methods of improving water quality has received the final stamp of approval from Congress.  
 Minnesota's portion of the funds will go to the Hiawatha Valley RC&D in Rochester, serving southeastern counties. 
   The federal funds will go to the Driftless Area Initiative, an association of six nonprofit Resource Conservation and Development Councils working to improve natural resources and develop the rural economy in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois. The Initiative will improve water quality by identifying major sources of pollution in the Driftless Area by working with farmers to implement practices to reduce soil erosion, sedimentation, and runoff. 
   The Driftless Area Initiative is a win-win for southeastern Minnesota," said Dayton. "With the aid of this funding, it will preserve and improve natural resources in the Hiawatha Valley, while helping to expand economic development in Rochester." 
   The project, approved by the joint House and Senate Conference Committee, received the funding in the Senate Agriculture's spending bill (H.R. 2744). The Conference Committee's final report will now head to the White House for the President's signature.
