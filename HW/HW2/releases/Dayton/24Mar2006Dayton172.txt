SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $3.6 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LEECH LAKE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Leech Lake Indian Reservation will receive $3,623,732 in federal funds to construct and expand affordable housing. The grant is provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program.  
   "Often, access to adequate, affordable housing can mean the difference between a family, even a community, flourishing or floundering," said Dayton. "I am delighted that Leech Lake will receive this money to help improve housing for its residents." 
   The IHBG will build homes and modernize existing buildings to create affordable housing options, at a cost of no more than 30 percent of a family's adjusted income. It will also provide housing services such as energy auditing and homeownership counseling to eligible individuals and families. The funds will also be used for rental assistance and neighborhood safety activities.
