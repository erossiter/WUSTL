SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $500,000 FOR CRIMNET TO ENSURE 1,100 LOCAL MINNESOTA LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS CAN SHARE INFORMATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton today celebrated the awarding of $494,000 in federal funds to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for the CriMNet program.  
 The funding will ensure that the 1,100 criminal justice entities in Minnesota, including local and state law enforcement agencies, have the capability to transfer and share criminal justice information in a timely and complete manner.
   "Helping secure funding for CriMNet is essential to making Minnesota a safer place," said Dayton. "CriMNet is crucial to putting criminals behind bars by ensuring that our local sheriffs, police, and criminal justice professionals have timely access to important information."
   Under the current system, many criminal histories are incomplete and not integrated into a system available to all appropriate personnel. CriMNet will help bridge these gaps, and allow law enforcement agents to see a person's complete history, regardless of where a conviction occurred.
