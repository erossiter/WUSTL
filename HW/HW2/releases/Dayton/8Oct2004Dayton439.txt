SEN. DAYTON INTRODUCES BILL TO TRACK OUTSOURCING OF AMERICAN JOBS OVERSEAS
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton introduced a bill which would require the Secretary of Commerce to develop and implement a reporting system on the foreign operations of U.S. companies.  
 This would enable the tracking of American jobs being outsourced to cheaper labor markets overseas.
   "Currently, there is no comprehensive tracking of foreign activities by U.S. companies, so we have no way of knowing where American companies are taking American jobs and American dollars," said Dayton. "The Chinese Government seems to have more credible data on the number of American companies operating there than we do. We need to identify the U.S. companies that are sending American jobs overseas so that we can stop rewarding them with government support in the form of subsidies and other incentives. We also need to better understand why so many U.S. jobs are being lost."
   Today, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 8 million Americans are unemployed, and the county is millions of jobs short of the Administration's predictions.
   Dayton said, "We cannot afford to outsource any more American jobs, when over 8 million Americans are unemployed. The U.S. manufacturing industry lost another 18,000 jobs last month because of this outsourcing epidemic. This Administration supports outsourcing jobs, because they say it makes economic sense. My bill will provide us with the comprehensive data for independent analysis of the economics and other factors involved."
