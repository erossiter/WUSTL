DAYTON SECURES $19 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HMONG, SOMALI REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that $19 million in additional federal funding for Hmong and Somali refugee resettlement was included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today.  
 The funding, secured by Dayton, will ensure that the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has the resources necessary to help Hmong and Somali refugees resettle in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California.
   "I am thrilled that my request for additional Hmong and Somali refugee resettlement funding has been included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill," said Dayton. "This funding will ensure that Minnesota has the resources needed to welcome these newest Americans into our communities." 
   Funding for ORR is especially critical this year, because of the challenges facing Hmong refugees from Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand. In December, 2003, the U.S. Government introduced a resettlement program for over 15,000 Hmong refugees from the region. Many of these refugees have special needs due to malnutrition and the hazardous working conditions they endured in Wat Tham Krabok. Without the additional funding secured by Dayton, Minnesota communities would be extremely hard-pressed to provide sufficient social services for the arriving refugees.
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
