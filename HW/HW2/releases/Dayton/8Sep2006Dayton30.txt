SEN. DAYTON: ROSEAU WINS THREE YEAR BATTLE WITH FEMA; OVER $600K AWARDED TO REPAIR FLOOD DAMAGED ROADS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the City of Roseau, which is still recovering from the devastating floods of 2002, has been awarded $616,732 by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The city has been fighting for more than three years to receive this emergency assistance.  
   "This is great news for Roseau and a great tribute to Mayor Pelowski, Community Development Coordinator Todd Peterson, and everyone else who worked so hard to secure this important funding," said Dayton. 
   Dayton twice personally informed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, whose department oversees FEMA, of the extensive delays Roseau had experienced throughout the grant process. 'It should not take three years after a flood for a city in such desperate need to get approval for a project?' Dayton wrote in a March 1, 2006 letter, which he handed directly to Chertoff. 
   The City of Roseau will use the grant to repair flood damaged roads.
