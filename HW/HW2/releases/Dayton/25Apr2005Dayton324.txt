SEN. DAYTON FIGHTS TO PROTECT MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD BASES FROM CONSIDERATION FOR CLOSURE
  Sen. Mark Dayton sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, late last week, alerting him to a law that prohibits the closing of a National Guard base without the consent of the Governor of the affected state.  
 Minnesota has two National Guard bases, in Duluth and Minneapolis. The 133rd Airlift Wing at the Minneapolis International Airport employs 1,287 workers. The Duluth Air Base employs about 1,100 people, including 400 who work full-time, making it the ninth-largest employer in the Twin Ports. 
   Dayton said in his letter, "I respectfully ask whether your Legal Counsel concurs or does not concur that this section [Section 18238 (e) of Title 10 of the United States Code] of federal law precludes any action to close a National Guard base or installation, pursuant to BRAC, without the agreement of the Governor of the state involved." 
   Section 18238 (e) of Title 10 of the United States Code states: A unit of the Army National Guard of the Air National Guard of the United States may not be relocated or withdrawn under this chapter without the consent of the governor of the state or, in the case of the District of Columbia, the commanding general of the National Guard of the District of Columbia. 
   Secretary Rumsfeld will take the next few weeks to recommend Base Realignments and Closures (BRAC) to the BRAC Commission. The President will receive the Commission's report by early September and will accept or reject their recommendations two weeks later. If accepted, Congress will have 45 legislative days to accept or reject the closure recommendations.
