SEN. DAYTON, MINNESOTANS TO TRAVEL TO ISRAEL
  Sen. Mark Dayton will travel with leaders of Minnesota's Jewish community on an educational trip to Israel, during next week's Senate recess.  
 Dayton will be joined by Stephen Silberfarb, Executive Director of Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas (JCRC), Marvin Feuer, Director for Defense and Strategic Issues at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and Tom Borman, member of the Board of Directors for Temple Israel in Minneapolis. The trip is being organized by the American Israel Education Foundation, a supporting foundation of AIPAC. 
   Today, U.S. Senator Mark Dayton issued the following statement: 
   "I will travel next week at my own expense on an educational trip to Israel. I look forward to meeting with Israeli and Palestinian policymakers and learning about progress to the peace process." 
   Steven Silberfarb, Executive Director of JCRC said, "Senator Dayton is visiting the Middle East during a historic time. Israel's courageous initiative to disengage from the Gaza Strip and the democratic election of Palestinian President Abbas offer renewed hope for peace. Additionally, Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon and Iran's nuclear ambitions have ramifications for the peace process and the entire region." 
   Dayton was last in Israel in December 2004.
