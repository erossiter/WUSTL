SEN. DAYTON/DEMOCRATS DEMAND STRAIGHT ANSWERS ON IRAQ
  Sen. Mark Dayton and other Democrats at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing today called on Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to give straight answers on the Administration's Iraq strategy. Rumsfeld, who had initially declined to appear before the Committee, was questioned about the lack of a clear plan to quell the violence, bring American troops home and turn over responsibility to the new Iraqi government. 
   "So what the people of Minnesota and, I believe, in this country are asking us?is to tell them what is really going on there, not with political spins from either side of the aisle; the truth, the basic facts," Dayton told the Defense Secretary. "Why is it seemingly getting worse not better?What is our strategy for reversing that slide? What is the solution?"
   Three years into the war, the U.S. military is stretched to the brink, Iraq is hurtling toward civil war, reconstruction is a mess, and American troops, who are performing heroically, are being placed in increasingly dangerous and difficult situations.
   "It isn't the will of the American people that is being tested, it is their tolerance for failure," said Dayton. "Over 2,600 [Minnesotans] are serving in Iraq? some will never return alive. They are the best and the brightest; it is not just their families, it is entire communities that are affected by their absences."
