SEN. DAYTON SECURES $550,000 TO ELIMINATE SEWAGE OVERFLOW THAT THREATENS TO CONTAMINATE LAKE SUPERIOR
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that $550,000 in federal funding to prevent the discharge of untreated human and industrial waste into Lake Superior was included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today.  
   The funding, secured by Dayton, will help the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District (WLSSD) and the City of Duluth eliminate overflows of sewage from pump stations and sewer lines by providing backup generators to entities within the sewage system. "In Minnesota, as everywhere, clean water is essential to our way of life," said Dayton. 
   "I am pleased that this funding will enable the WLSSD and Duluth to purchase backup generators for their sewage system, helping to keep Lake Superior clean and local residents free from any public health hazards." Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
