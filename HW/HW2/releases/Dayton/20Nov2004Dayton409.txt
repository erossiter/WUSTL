SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $8 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that over $8 million in federal aid for Minnesota agricultural projects has been included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today. The funding, secured by Dayton, will support seven important agricultural projects affecting the state. 
   "Agriculture remains the backbone of Minnesota's economy, and our farmers produce some of the finest products in the world," said Dayton. "By giving them our support, and funding these important projects, we are making a conscious investment in our farmers and helping them secure a more prosperous future."
   "In light of the most recent inconclusive test result for BSE, I am pleased that under my recommendation funding was secured for the National Farm Animal Identification and Records Program which will assist Minnesota's farmers in continuing to provide the world's safest supply of beef."
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law. The following programs are included in the bill:
   * $2,250,000 for the Minnesota Association of Cooperatives' Health Care Cooperative Purchasing Alliance: Funding will be used to create a stop-loss fund in order to allow the organization to create a health care co-op. The co-op will allow farmers to be able to better afford health insurance because farmers are generally placed in the "high risk" category.
   * $2,039,246 for the Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul: Funding will be used to replace the laboratory's retiring research scientist. The position is a key part of a team that investigates the genomics of plant pathogens involving blights of wheat and barley. 
   * $283,000 for the Uniform Farm Management Project at the University of Minnesota's Center for Farm Financial Management: Funding will be used to provide farmers with cost-of-production figures to help them make sound financial and investment decisions.
   * $388,587 for the Minnesota Cultivated Wild Rice Council: Funding will provide for germplasm research on wild rice, which is North America's only native cereal grain. The research will help thousands of rice producers by adding value to their products through enhanced wild/white rice blends.
   * $597,000 for the Northern Great Plains Council: Funding will be used to continue work on the region-wide education program around the "Renewing the Countryside" project, and to maintain developing regional projects to gain marketplace advantage for producers.
   * $688,000 for the Midwest Poultry Research Program: Funding will support research based on issues critical to Midwest poultry producers, such as food safety, animal health, waste management, and combating poultry diseases. Funds are distributed among nineteen research projects at nine different Midwest universities.
   * $600,000 for the National Farm Animal Identification and Records Program: Funding will be used to expand the voluntary cattle identification program which has been in existence since 1998. The program tracks approximately one million animals in 28 states. This funding will expand the program allowing farmers in Minnesota, Michigan, Vermont, and Ohio to participate. 
   * $1,491,000 for the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority: Funding will be used to promote agricultural diversity, helping farmers to develop new crops, information technology and training programs for farmers, and transportation planning for rural areas. The Northern Great Plains Authority focuses on Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, and Nebraska.
