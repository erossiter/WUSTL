SEN. DAYTON, REP. PETERSON SECURE OVER $1.9 MILLION FOR ROSEAU FLOOD PROTECTION PUMPING STATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton and Rep. Collin Peterson today secured $1,927,500 in a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant for the construction of a flood-protection pumping station in Roseau. The station, which is part of Roseau's storm water system, will keep the system operational in the event of future floods. The system will also prevent water from the Roseau river from backing up into the city during heavy rains and flood, as it did in 2002, when more than 80 percent of Roseau was ravaged by heavy rain and flooding.  
   "Protecting Roseau's residents and businesses against future water damage and flooding is a top priority for me," said Dayton. "This community has battled flooding for far too long, and I am pleased that these federal grants will enable Roseau to complete this crucial project." 
   "This pump station project is an important piece in Roseau's recovery, and although it was a long time coming, I'm relieved that they finally will have this funding in place," Peterson said. "Roseau city officials have dealt with a lot of red tape throughout this process." 
   Roseau Mayor Jeff Pelowski said, "This is great news for the City of Roseau. Internal flooding has been a recurring problem within the city, and was a major player in the horrific flood of 2002. As Mayor, on behalf of our citizens, I want to thank FEMA, MN HSEM, and, in particular, our Congressional delegation and staff for making this possible." 
   FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) today released the funds to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM). The grant will pay 75 percent of the $2,570,000 cost of the project. The remaining $642,500 will be matched by the State of Minnesota and the City of Roseau.
