SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF CIA DIRECTOR TENET
  Statement by U.S. Senator Mark Dayton Resignation of CIA Director George Tenet
   "CIA Director George Tenet has shouldered enormous burdens for America's security and safety during the past seven years. For his dedicated service, he deserves our gratitude. 
   "Investigations now under way into the horrors of 9-11 and pre-Iraq war intelligence, as well as other future disclosures, hopefully will clarify the causes for the serious failures of U.S. intelligence during the past several years. It is imperative to our national security that these causes be quickly identified and corrected. Mr. Tenet could perform yet another invaluable service to our country by helping us to accomplish this task."
