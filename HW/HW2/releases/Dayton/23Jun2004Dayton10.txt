SENATE-APPROVED SEN. DAYTON AMENDMENT WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FROM PENTAGON ON BILLIONS BEING SPENT FOR ADMINISTRATION'S MILITARY OPERATIONS
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton's amendment, which would require the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide a quarterly report to Congress on the billions of taxpayer dollars being expended on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and any other effort in the Global War on Terrorism, was adopted by the Senate.  
 Currently, DOD is not required to account for these costs.
   "Billions of taxpayer's dollars are being spent on the global war on terror," said Dayton. "Providing the American people with a report on how their tax dollars are being consumed for military operations - something we know very little about right now - is the right thing to do."
   As of today, the Senate's ambitious plan is to finish its work on the Defense Authorization and Appropriations Bills before breaking for the Fourth of July recess period. Now part of the Authorization Bill, the Dayton amendment is poised to become law after the House and Senate resolve the differences between their versions of the bill, later in July.
