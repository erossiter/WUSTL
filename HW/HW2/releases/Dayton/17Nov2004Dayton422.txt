SEN. DAYTON OPPOSES NORMALIZING TRADE RELATIONS WITH LAOS UNTIL HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE ADDRESSED
  Sen. Mark Dayton joined today with Senators Norm Coleman (R-MN), Russ Feingold (D-WI), and Herb Kohl (D-WI) in condemning the serious human rights abuses occurring in Laos.  
 The Senators passed a resolution in response to a provision included in the final version of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill. The provision would grant Laos normalized trade relations with the United States. Dayton voted in opposition to the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill.
   "We need to first address the real problems in Laos, including human rights violations and the lack of freedom and equality for the Hmong, before we consider normalizing trade relations with this region," said Dayton. "Hmongs continue to be abused and persecuted in Laos. And - as with most trade agreements with underdeveloped countries - this provision is about cheap labor, not about improving the standards of living for all affected people.
   "I am pleased that the Senate passed our bipartisan resolution condemning the serious human rights abuses in Laos, and urged the Government of Laos to respect the basic human rights of all citizens in order to maintain trade relations with the United States."
