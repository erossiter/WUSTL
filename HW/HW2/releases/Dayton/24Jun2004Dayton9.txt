SEN. DAYTON'S PAPERWORK REDUCTION INITIATIVES PASS, SPARING 14,000 MINNESOTA DAY-CARE PROVIDERS FROM UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK
  Sen. Mark Dayton today praised the Senate's passage of the Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill, which included four Dayton initiatives designed to reduce burdensome paperwork for day-care providers nationwide, including over 14,000 providers in Minnesota. The bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, will now go to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass without modification. 
   "Passage of my paperwork reduction initiatives will relieve day-care providers of the thousands of hours they spend every year on mandatory paperwork," said Dayton. "Now, Minnesota's 14,000 licensed day-care providers can dedicate more of their valuable time to what they do best - taking care of our children."
   "Senator Dayton's initiatives are the first significant, positive change to the child food program since before welfare reform in 1996, which was devastating to the program," said Rod Hofstedt, President of the National Child and Adult Care Food Program Forum and Executive Director of St. Paul's Adults & Children's Alliance. "In Minnesota alone, Dayton's amendments will probably save a forest of trees in paperwork."
   The Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill sets funding levels for the School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Women, Infants, and Children Program.
   Dayton's four paperwork reduction initiatives in the bill include:
   * Permanent agreements - Minnesota is second only to California in its number of licensed providers in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Every year, all providers must sign agreements with their sponsoring organizations, necessitating thousands of pages of paperwork. Dayton's provision would allow providers to sign one agreement, to remain in effect indefinitely.
   * Reasonable audit requirements - State agencies, such as Minnesota's Department of Children, Families, and Learning, are required to audit day-care providers and pursue accounting errors that cost small amounts of money, even if the recovery process is not worth the time and effort. Dayton's provision would allow the auditors to disregard minor errors, thereby saving time and money.
   * Longer certifications - Currently, when the state determines that a day-care provider lives in a low-income area, the determination remains in effect for three years. Dayton's provision would extend that determination to five years, eliminating needless and time-consuming recertification.
   * Paperwork reduction study - This provision would mandate the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to study record-keeping requirements for licensed day-care providers nationwide and to develop a plan to reduce their paperwork burden.
