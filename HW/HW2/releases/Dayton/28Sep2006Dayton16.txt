SEN. DAYTON: $700K COMING TO AMERICAN INDIAN NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the American Indian Neighborhood Development Corporation (AINDC) will receive a $700,000 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Community Services (OCS). The grant will be used to restore the Broadway Business Center, which will serve as office space for small business technical assistance providers and other local businesses.  
   "The need for development in North Minneapolis is great," said Dayton. "With its proven track record of building economic opportunities, American Indian Neighborhood Development Corporation is an ideal recipient for this grant, which will provide hundreds of new jobs in Minneapolis." 
   In April, Dayton wrote a letter to OCS in support of the AINDC 's grant application. In it he cites the AINDC's success in revitalizing the Hawthorn Neighborhood of North Minneapolis and areas of South Minneapolis. 
   AINDC has already secured an existing facility at 800 West Broadway Avenue, which formerly housed an auto sales lot and furniture store. The grant will be used improve the appearance of West Broadway Avenue, by restoring the 1956 building to its original state. It will also be used to help low-income adults and ex-offenders find jobs, through partnerships with non-profit agencies; expand the capacity of minority owned businesses, through partnerships with public business developers; and to expand the technical capacity of both employees and employers in the construction trades, through public transportation upgrades that will connect West Broadway with the two colleges offering certificate, diploma, and degrees in the construction trades.
