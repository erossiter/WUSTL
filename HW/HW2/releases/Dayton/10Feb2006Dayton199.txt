SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON TESTIMONY BY FORMER FEMA DIRECTOR BROWN
  Sen. Mark Dayton today questioned former Director Michael Brown and other top officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) about the government's failed response to Hurricane Katrina. At a public hearing of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Sen. Dayton asked Brown to detail when and how the President and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff were informed of the situation in New Orleans, immediately following Hurricane Katrina's landfall. Today's hearing was the first time former Director Brown has testified before the Senate.  
   Senator Dayton's statement on Michael Brown's testimony is below. 
   "Today's testimony by former FEMA Director Michael Brown raised very serious questions about when the failure of New Orleans' levees was first reported to Secretary Chertoff and to President Bush. Both men have previously stated that they were not aware of the massive flooding in New Orleans until midday Tuesday. Yet, Mr. Brown testified that he spoke personally with the President, who was vacationing at his ranch, on the weekend before Hurricane Katrina struck, and also with top White House staff on Monday afternoon. Likewise, Secretary Chertoff's Deputy and his Chief of Staff were both e-mailed Monday evening with reports of the levees' failure. 
   "It is incomprehensible how those top Administration officials failed to notify the President and the Secretary immediately of the catastrophe that was unfolding in New Orleans."
