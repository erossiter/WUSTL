SEN. DAYTON DEMANDS HONESTY FROM BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS TESTIFYING ABOUT IRAQ; SEN. REQUESTS THAT FUTURE WITNESSES TESTIFY UNDER OATH
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton sent a letter to Sen.  
 John Warner (R-VA), Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, respectfully urging him to place all future witnesses who testify before the Committee under oath. Since the onset of the war in Iraq, Dayton has attended numerous public hearings and nonpublic meetings at which Bush Administration officials have testified falsely to the Committee about critically important matters including the supposed progress in key aspects of the war effort, prisoner abuse, and the production of armored vehicles for American troops. 
   "It is impossible for the Committee to provide oversight and represent the vital interests of all Americans if we do not have access to complete and reliable information from top Administration officials," said Dayton. "It is our job to hold Bush Administration officials to their words; the stakes are too high not to." 
   Recent published news reports quote manufacturers of armored vehicles as saying that they have been operating at less than full capacity during the past year, because of insufficient military orders. Repeatedly, Dayton and others on the Armed Services Committee had pressed Administration officials about whether new armored vehicles produced in maximum numbers. Repeatedly, the Senators were assured that they were. 
   "It is morally intolerable to not do everything possible, and not use the funds Congress provided, to protect our soldiers by providing them with lifesaving armor. It is unforgivable if Bush administration officials were aware of it and didn't do anything about it. At the President's determination, anyone responsible should be fired."
