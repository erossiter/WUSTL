SEN. DAYTON SECURES $1 MILLION FOR MUCH-NEEDED WATER TREATMENT PROJECTS IN DULUTH, MINNEAPOLIS, MOORHEAD
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1 million in federal funds for water infrastructure and sewage overflow projects in Minnesota.  
 The funds, which Dayton secured, were included in the FY2005 VA-HUD Appropriations bill. The FY2005 VA-HUD Appropriations bill will now move to the full Senate for passage, and then to Conference Committee, where Congressional negotiators will reconcile the differences between the Senate and House versions.
   "I am proud to have helped secure funding which will help keep Duluth residents' water bills from increasing due to costly water quality projects while protecting the St. Louis River and Lake Superior from contamination," said Dayton. "Additionally, I am happy that the Minnesota State University - Moorhead will be able to replace outdated waterlines which provide drinking water to the campus and many local families."
   Communities receiving funding include:
   $550,000 for the City of Duluth and Western Lake Superior Sanitary District-Funding would be used to defray residents' utility costs, following the implementation of several sewage overflow projects which are aimed at ensuring all waste water is adequately treated before being released into the St. Louis River and Lake Superior. 
   $300,000 for the City of Minneapolis - Funding would be used for wastewater infrastructure improvements including combined sewage overflow projects which would enhance water quality for local residents.
   $150,000 for the Minnesota State University in Moorhead - Funding would be used for water infrastructure improvements including the replacement of outdated water lines which service the Minnesota State University - Moorhead campus and many local single-family homes.
