SEN. DAYTON ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
  Together with his congressional colleagues, Sen. Mark Dayton today will commemorate the fifth anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. Tonight at 6:00 PM, Dayton will participate in a bipartisan ceremony on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to honor the victims of 9/11. Five years ago, dozens of lawmakers gathered on the Capitol steps to sing "God Bless America," as a symbol of the nation's unity following the attacks. 
   Dayton today made the following statement:
   "Tonight, I am going with my colleagues to remember the Americans who lost their lives during the terrible terrorist attacks five years ago. We honor the thousands who perished, including the selfless heroes who sacrificed themselves to save others during that horrible tragedy."
