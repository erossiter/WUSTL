SEN. DAYTON, DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO END CONTRACT ABUSE, WASTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today denounced Senate Republicans for rejecting a measure to hold Administration-awarded contractors accountable for their work and their paychecks. Originally introduced as a separate bill by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND), and cosponsored by Dayton, the amendment would have punished war profiteers with harsh new penalties; forced real competition for government contracts; and banned cronyism in contracting. The legislation, offered as part of the Defense Authorization bill, was blocked from further consideration by a vote of 55 to 43. 
   "As Congress continues to approve billions of dollars for the Iraq war and the military, it must ensure that taxpayer money is not subject to contractor waste, fraud, and abuse," said Dayton. "It is deplorable that today the Senate Majority rejected the opportunity to hold those contractors accountable to the American people."
   In June of 2005, Dayton joined colleagues at a Democratic Policy Committee hearing, which outlined rampant federal contracting abuses in Iraq. According to a February 10, 2005 USA Today article:
   "Halliburton alone has earned more than $9 billion. Pentagon audits released by Democrats in June showed $1.03 billion in 'questioned' costs and $422 million in 'unsupported' costs for Halliburton's work in Iraq."
   Additionally, the Inspector General for Iraq reported that $8.8 billion in reconstruction contracts remains unaccounted for.
   Today's amendment would have created new penalties of up to 20 years in prison and at least $1 million in fines for such abuses. Other key provisions of the amendment include:
   * Restoration of a rule, dropped by the Bush Administration, that prohibits awarding federal contracts to companies with a pattern of failing to comply with contracting laws.
   * Establishment of a "Truth in Contracting" public website identifying significant over-charges by major contractors.
   * A prohibition of huge monopoly contracts, in order to ensure price competition from multiple companies.
   * A requirement that federal agencies conduct their own contract oversight, rather than paying contractors, often with conflicts of interest, to oversee each other.
   * Strengthening conflict of interest rules that now allow federal contracting officials to take jobs representing companies to whom they once awarded contracts.
   * Requiring that political appointees to key federal jobs relating to federal contracting and public safety have credentials and experience that qualify them for those positions.
