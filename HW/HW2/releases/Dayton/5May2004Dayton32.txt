SEN. DAYTON INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO MAKE MOVIES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO 28 MILLION DEAF, HARD-OF-HEARING AMERICANS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today introduced an amendment which would make movies more accessible to the 28 million Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.  
 Dayton's amendment would provide a 90 percent tax credit for theaters and movie producers to provide captioning access to deaf patrons. Dayton was made aware of the limited access for this large constituency after he met with students and faculty from the Metro Deaf School in St. Paul. 
   "My amendment serves an important public service - adding to the quality of life of 28 million Americans by allowing them to enjoy one of life's great pleasures," said Dayton. "Providing theater owners and movie producers an incentive, a 90 percent tax credit, seems reasonable. It is the right thing to do. I was proud to find a solution to a problem I became aware of after meeting with students and teachers at the Metro Deaf School in St. Paul."
   Of the 35,774 movie screens in the U.S. today, 53 have cinema subtitling systems, which project captions onto the screen; 235 show movies with captions; and 70 show movies with closed, rear-window captioning.
   Dayton was joined at a press conference today, announcing the introduction of his amendment, by Tawny Holmes, President, Gallaudet University Student Body Government; Cheryl Heppner, Chair, Coalition for Movie Captioning; and Kelby Brick, Director of Law and Advocacy, National Association of the Deaf.
