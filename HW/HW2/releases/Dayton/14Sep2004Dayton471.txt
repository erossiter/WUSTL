SEN. DAYTON BACKS BILL TO PROVIDE IMPROVED BENEFITS, SERVICES TO MINNESOTA'S NATIONAL GUARD, RESERVISTS ON EXTENDED ACTIVE DUTY
  Sen. Mark Dayton today cosponsored the National Guard and Reserve Bill of Rights Act, which would improve the benefits and protections offered to members of the National Guard and Reserve who are serving on extended active duty.  
 The act includes legislative measures which would: better inform servicemembers about the facts of their deployment, guarantee timely compensation, provide comprehensive TRICARE health coverage and re-enlistment bonuses, reduce the reservist retirement age, enhance educational benefits, and create new positions within the Department of Defense to better represent the interests of reservists. The Senate Armed Services Committee, of which Dayton is a Member, will consider the bill later this year.
   "I am so proud of the members of our Reserve and National Guard, many of whom are serving their second or even third tour of duty in recent years," said Dayton. "They deserve our gratitude, and they deserve our solid support, including better health care benefits and increased pay, to say the very least. I will do everything I can to see that this legislation is enacted."
   Since September 11, 2001, President Bush has called more than 225,000 members of the National Guard and Reserve to active duty. In Minnesota alone, over 4,100 members of the National Guard and Reserve are actively serving in the war on terror. The benefits and protections they now receive are less than those received by full-time soldiers.
