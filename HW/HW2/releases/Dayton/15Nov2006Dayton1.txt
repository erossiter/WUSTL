SEN. DAYTON: BAXTER RECEIVES $260K FOR WILDLIFE CORRIDOR
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the City of Baxter will receive $260,123 in federal funding from the National Park Service, administered by the Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) program. The grant will be used to acquire approximately 63 acres of forested land along the Mississippi River.  
   "Beautiful forests and wildlife refuges are part of Minnesota's legacy," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this funding will be used to help make sure this legacy never fades." 
   The land lies across the river from Crow Wing State Park and extends past Camp Ripley. It will be preserved as a wildlife corridor. 
   The LWCF program uses revenue from offshore oil leasing to fund state and local acquisition and development of outdoor recreation areas. Lands purchased or developed with these grants must be retained forever. To date, Minnesota has received approximately $68 million in funding through this program.
