SEN. DAYTON SECURES $700,000 FOR CONSTRUCTION OF PAUL AND SHEILA WELLSTONE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY BUILDING
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Senate approved $700,000 in federal funds for the Neighborhood House in St.  
 Paul to construct the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building. The funding, secured by Dayton, is part of the FY2005 VA-HUD Appropriations bill. 
   "Paul and Sheila Wellstone had a close connection to the Neighborhood House community and cared deeply about the organization's mission," said Dayton. "I am honored to have been able to deliver $700,000 in federal funds to help build the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building in St. Paul. And I am proud that Congress is keeping its commitment to fund a project Paul and Sheila championed - it is a fitting tribute to Paul and his family."
   Neighborhood House is a multicultural, multilingual community center which provides programming and services to individuals and families. The federal funding would be used to expand and build a new state-of-the-art facility which would offer meeting and gathering space for people of all ages and cultural and economic backgrounds. The 93,000-square-foot facility will consist of a 300-seat auditorium, classrooms, gymnasiums, computer labs, a youth center, a caf?, and an exercise room. 
   The FY2005 VA-HUD Appropriations bill will now move to the full Senate for passage to the Conference Committee, where Congressional negotiators will reconcile the differences between the Senate and House versions.
