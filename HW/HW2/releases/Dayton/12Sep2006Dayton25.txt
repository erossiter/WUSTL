SEN. DAYTON: $400K COMING TO UPPER SIOUX COMMUNITY
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Upper Sioux Community, located in Yellow Medicine county, will receive a $400,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development's Community Facility Grant Economic Impact Initiative program. Funding will be used to help improve telecommunications operations in Yellow Medicine county. 
   "In a 21st Century global economy, the ability to communicate is essential to the survival and growth of all businesses," said Dayton. "This funding will equip the residents of Yellow Medicine with a telecommunications network to help foster new economic growth." 
   The grant will be used to build a new telecommunications switching and administration building on the Upper Sioux Community. This building will house the community's new telecommunications system that will be installed by the end of 2006. This system will help businesses communicate with updated equipment and support the educational, cultural, and medical needs for the Upper Sioux Community.
