SEN. DAYTON: MINNESOTA TRIBAL POLICE AGENCIES TO RECEIVE OVER $1 MILLION IN COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES FUNDING
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that six Minnesota Tribal communities have been awarded $1,100,154 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), to improve the law enforcement infrastructure of Tribal police agencies. The COPS program provides critical financial support for local law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and to protect local communities from crime.  
   "Minnesota's state and local law enforcement officers work hard every day to provide indispensable services to our communities," said Dayton. "These COPS grants will increase the number of officers patrolling the streets of these Tribal communities, helping to make sure that our neighborhoods are crime free." 
   Since 1994, the COPS program has awarded over $124 million in grants to Minnesota and put over 1,400 new police officers on Minnesota streets. Dayton has been a longtime supporter of the COPS program, offering and supporting numerous amendments to increase its funding. 
   Funding will be delivered to the following Minnesota communities: 
   * $98,145 for Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa -$300,000 for Leech Lake Tribal Council -$81,000 for Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Indians -$354,780 for Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians -$116,231 for Upper Sioux Indian Community -$149,998 for White Earth Reservation Tribal Council.
