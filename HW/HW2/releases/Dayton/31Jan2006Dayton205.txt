SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. Mark Dayton tonight released the following statement in reaction to President Bush's State of the Union Address: 
   "President Bush stated general goals that everyone can support such as freedom and democracy around the world, supporting our troops, more affordable healthcare, and energy independence. 
   "We will find out when we receive his budget next week whether these are platitudes or promises. My mother taught me when I was growing up that actions speak louder than words. Tonight was a night for words. We'll see if the actions follow those words."
