SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES $230,000 FOR PROGRAM THAT HELPS TWIN CITIES LOW INCOME FAMILIES SAVE FOR EDUCATION, FIRST HOME OR SMALL BUSINESS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that West Central Minnesota Communities Action, Inc. will receive $230,000 for the Assets for Independence Demonstration program (AFI). Participants in the program invest earned income in Individual Savings Account, and the program combines federal grant money with state funding to match their savings. IDA savings may be used to: purchase or build a first home, create a small business, and/or pay for post-secondary education. The program also teaches valuable financial skills, such as how to establish credit and tips for buying a home. The grant was awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Community Services.  
   "Assets for Independence Demonstration is an invaluable program that offers low income Minnesotans the tools for financial independence and the knowledge to achieve it," said Dayton. "I am delighted that it will receive federal support." 
   Stephen Nagle of West Central Minnesota Communities Action said: "Individual Development Accounts are perhaps the best opportunity for working poor families to escape poverty. West Central Minnesota Communities Action is excited to be partnering with Twin Cities United Way to help families save for post secondary education small business investment and home purchase."
