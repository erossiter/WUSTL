SEN. DAYTON DISGUSTED BY CONGRESS' FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY FUND VETERANS' HEALTH CARE IN OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Mark Dayton today blasted Congress and the Administration for failing to include adequate funding for veterans' health care in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which recently received Senate approval.  
 Amvets, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the VFW all advocated for $3.2 billion in additional funding for the Veterans Health Administration, an amount which they say is based on existing need. However, the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill provided only $1.9 billion in additional funding. 
   "Some may say that half a loaf is better than none," said Dayton. "Thank goodness the veterans, to whom our government promised these benefits, did not take the same attitude when they were called upon to serve their country.
   "It is appalling that as more and more brave service members join the ranks of injured and disabled veterans, our government wavers rather than measures up in meeting its obligations."
   Earlier this year, Dayton cosponsored an amendment that would have made funding for veterans' health care coverage mandatory.
   "This amendment came within a few votes of a majority, nearly fulfilling the promise that America made to its veterans," said Dayton. "It is disgraceful that Congress and this Administration continue to deny adequate funding for health care to those brave men and women of our armed forces, who have so honorably defended this great nation."
