OVER $1 MILLION TO REHABILITATE HUMPHREY APRON AT MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport will receive a total of $1,020,718 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
   "This federal funding ensures that the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport remains a first class transportation hub," said Dayton. "An efficient and well-maintained airport attracts business and tourism, which strengthens our state's economy."
   Funding will be used to rehabilitate the Humphrey Apron, restoring structural integrity to the pavement and maximizing space.
   This funding is part of Minneapolis-St. Paul's yearly allocation ($520,718). An additional $500,000 was awarded through the FAA's competitive Airport Improvement Program.
