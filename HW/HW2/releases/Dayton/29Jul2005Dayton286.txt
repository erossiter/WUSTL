SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF $1.5 BILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDS FOR VETERANS' HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced the passage of $1.5 billion in emergency funding for health care provided through the Department of Veterans' Affairs.  
 Last month, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson finally conceded that the VA is billions of dollars short, for both this year and next, making it impossible for the Department to meet the health care needs of the nation's veterans. The funding passed today, as part of the final FY2006 Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 2361). The Conference Committee Report will soon be sent to the President to be signed into law. 
   "This legislation will guarantee that those neglected by the current system will receive the benefits and quality care they deserve," Dayton said. "It is unacceptable that the men and women who sacrificed to serve and protect our country are receiving insufficient health care. We have the resources to ensure satisfactory health care for all our nation's veterans, and it is time we provided it." 
   This funding is a result of an amendment offered by Senate Democrats, including Dayton, to the Interior Appropriations bill in June. That amendment passed 96-0. Democrats had offered a similar amendment to the 2005 Supplemental Appropriations bill in April, but it was rejected by the Senate's Republican Majority and opposed by the Administration. 
   As of April, both the Minneapolis VA Medical Center and the St. Cloud VA Medical Center are running budget shortfalls of nearly $7 million and $4 million, respectively.
