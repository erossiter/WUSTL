SEN. DAYTON URGES SUPPORT FOR $1.5 MILLION IN FUNDING TO PROTECT MINNESOTA'S WATERWAYS FROM ASIAN CARP
  Sen. Mark Dayton today urged Senate appropriators to support $1.5 million in funding for invasive species barriers in the FY 2005 Appropriations bill.  
 Asian carp are currently invading the Upper Mississippi River as far north as Pool 18 in Iowa, and threaten to spread further northward into Minnesota if barriers are not established.
   "Unless we take immediate action, Asian carp will establish self-sustaining and expanding populations in Minnesota and Wisconsin within the next two years," said Dayton. "I urge my Senate colleagues to support the funding necessary to install bubble fences which will prevent these fish from invading Minnesota's waterways. This invasive species would permanently harm our lakes and rivers, and potentially eliminate recreational fishing in our state."
   Dayton supports funding for the installation of two bubble fence barriers in the Mississippi River which would inhibit Asian carp from moving further upstream and invading connected waterways. The introduction of Asian carp into Minnesota's lakes and rivers is potentially devastating, because the species is known to dominate water systems and eliminate competing species.
