SENATE PASSES BILL TO PROTECT WORKER PENSIONS
  Sen. Mark Dayton commends today's passage of the Pension Security and Transparency Act (S. 1783), recognizing that, while there is room for improvement, this is a much needed first step in protecting American workers and retirees.  
 This bill will require companies, such as Northwest Airlines, to fund pension promises by strengthening rules regulating pension plans, thus preventing future pension failures, while making plan funding more transparent and protecting workers. 
   "I commend the Senate's bipartisan action to pass legislation that will help Northwest and other airlines to fund their pension plans," said Dayton. "The bill is not perfect, but it is a step in the right direction, toward ensuring that companies will be able to meet their pension obligations, re-establish workers' retirement security, and restore confidence in our country's private pension system." 
   Additionally, the bill was improved by an amendment designed to avoid pension plan terminations by airlines, which will extend the time they are allowed to fund their plans from 14 years to a much more manageable 20 years-a measure Dayton supported. 
   Dayton expressed concern with some provisions of the bill, including its changes to the single-employer pension funding rules, which will institute new restrictions on benefit increases and freezes on benefit accruals, as well as cut federal pension guarantees. There are more than 700,000 retirees in 80 single-employer pension plans in Minnesota, including Northwest Airlines. The legislation also links plans' funding requirements to the employer's credit rating, a measure Dayton does not support.
