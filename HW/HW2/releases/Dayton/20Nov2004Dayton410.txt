SEN. DAYTON SECURES $900,000 TO PROTECT MINNEAPOLIS RESIDENCES, MISSISSIPPI RIVER FROM SEWAGE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY 2005, which is expected to pass the Senate today, includes $900,000 to prevent the discharge of untreated human and industrial waste into the Mississippi River and, in extreme cases, into residents' basements.  
 The funding, secured by Dayton, will help further efforts to improve water quality and public health by disconnecting unauthorized sources from using the public sanitary system.
   "Clean water is vital to our way of life in Minnesota," said Dayton. "I am pleased this funding will aid efforts by the City of Minneapolis to prevent an overloaded sanitary system from contaminating our waterways and, in extreme cases, residents' basements."
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
