SEN. DAYTON URGES MINNESOTA SENIORS TO RIDE 'RX EXPRESS' TO BUY CHEAPER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN CANADA
  Sen. Mark Dayton today joined with the Minnesota Senior Federation in inviting seniors to reserve a seat on the next two-day bus trip to Canada, where seniors can purchase cheaper prescription drugs than available in the United States.  
 The trip will depart for Canada from Minnesota on Tuesday, September 7th, returning Wednesday, September 8th. The trips, funded by Dayton's donated U.S. Senate salary, have so far provided 600 Minnesota seniors with an all-expenses paid trip to Winnipeg, Manitoba. This is the fourth year in which Dayton has donated his U.S. Senate salary to finance the trips, and he will continue to do so until Congress passes a reasonable prescription drug bill.
   The September 7th bus trip is scheduled to pick up seniors in Duluth and Virginia. If there is interest, additional stops will be made in communities such as Grand Rapids, Bemidji, and Crookston, located along U.S. Highway 2 en route to Winnipeg.
   The registration deadline for this trip is Tuesday, August 31st. The trip is free, but seniors are required to provide a refundable deposit of $50 to guarantee a seat.

   What: Free bus trip to Canada for purchasing cheaper prescription drugs
   When: Tuesday, September 7th - Wednesday, September 8th
