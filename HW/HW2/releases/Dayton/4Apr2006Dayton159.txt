SEN. DAYTON: AGRICULTURE DISASTER AID ADVANCES IN SENATE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved legislation to provide disaster assistance to farmers nationwide. The measure will now be included as part of the FY2006 Supplemental Appropriations bill, which the Senate will consider later this month. Dayton is a cosponsor of the legislation, originally introduced as a separate bill by Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND), which would compensate farmers for losses due to Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters in 2005. 
   "I am thrilled that Senator Conrad's agriculture disaster assistance bill, of which I am a cosponsor, was added to the Senate's Emergency Supplemental Funding bill today," said Dayton. "I will do everything possible to preserve this funding, when the full Senate votes on the legislation later this month."
   The measure would compensate farmers for a percentage of crop losses for the 2005 crop year. To offset the high cost of energy, fertilizer, and feed, the amendment would provide an increase in farm bill program payments. The measure also includes a livestock assistance program and would provide block grants to states, to provide assistance for dairy and specialty crops which are not covered by the farm bill.
   In September, Dayton offered the Permanent Emergency Agricultural Assistance Act (S. 1776), introduced by Representative Colin Peterson in the House, which would create a standing program of agriculture disaster assistance.
