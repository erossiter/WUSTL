SEN. DAYTON: MOWER COUNTY TO RECEIVE $120,000 TO HELP VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the Safe Havens for Children Program of Mower County will receive $120,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Domestic Violence Against Women. The grant will help fund the supervised visits and safe exchanges of children in situations involving domestic and dating violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and stalking. Currently, no coordinated system exists, leaving children and victims of domestic violence at future risk.  
   "This funding will help our state to continue to respond to the needs of domestic violence victims," said Dayton. "Domestic violence and child abuse are a threat to every community in Minnesota. It's crucial that we provide the support these victims need to feel safe, to avoid future violence, and to rebuild their lives." 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 created the Safe Havens for Children Program to protect children, parents, and caretakers from witnessing domestic violence, experiencing sexual assault, experiencing abduction, injury or death during parent and child visitation exchanges. Grants are available to states, Indian tribal governments, and local governments that agree to carry out the provisions of the Safe Havens for Children Program. Mower County will be working with the Parenting Resource Center, Inc., a non-profit organization with its roots in the community to develop our plan. The PRC is a leader in child development, chemical abuse prevention, parent education, child care and the development of community solutions for families. 
   "We would like to extend our thanks to the grantors and to those involved in supporting our application. If successful, our network will assure a much higher level of safety for victims of domestic violence and their children," said Bruce Henricks, Director of Human Services for Mower County.
