  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced his support for a Senate resolution honoring Montevideo, Minnesota, one of only ten cities nationwide to receive the National Civic League 2004 All-America City Award.  
 The prestigious All-America City Award is presented annually to communities in which local residents, elected officials, businesses, and nonprofit organizations work together to address critical local issues.
   "Congratulations to Montevideo for being recognized as a truly great place to live, work, and visit," said Dayton. "I am proud that the Senate is honoring an outstanding Minnesota community for its demonstrated excellence and problem solving."
   "We're incredibly happy to be recognized by Congress for this great award," said Montevideo Mayor, Jim Curtiss. "Our city has really come together and worked hard to improve the community. It's nice to see we're getting recognition for it."
   The National Civic League, founded in 1894 by Theodore Roosevelt, presents the All-America City Award each year to communities that demonstrate an extraordinary commitment to civic excellence and community improvement.
