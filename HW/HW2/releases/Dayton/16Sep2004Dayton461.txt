SEN. DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
  Each year, from September 15th to October 15th, communities across America gather together to recognize the history and culture of Hispanics and the many wonderful contributions which Hispanics have made to our country.  
 As we embark on the month-long festivities, I am proud to take this opportunity to celebrate the amazing and growing diversity of America which the Hispanic community embodies. 
   Hispanics in Minnesota come from many countries throughout the Western Hemisphere: Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. Of the more than 35 million persons of Hispanic heritage who live in the United States, over 143,000 people call Minnesota their home.
   Today, the Hispanic community is flourishing in Minnesota and across the country. Hispanic Americans are vital contributors to our nation's future. They are creating jobs by starting their own businesses. They are protecting our nation by serving in the Armed Forces. And they are representing the interests of our communities as elected public servants at the local, state, and federal levels. Each of these forms of service and achievement is cause for celebration. 
   America is a more dynamic, innovative country because of the music, language, tradition and vitality of the Hispanic community.
   As Congressional leaders, we must pay tribute to the richness of their culture and contributions today and every day. We must ensure that all Hispanics, indeed, all Americans, are given the opportunity to succeed and achieve the American dream.
