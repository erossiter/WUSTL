SEN. DAYTON: NEARLY $1.7 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that the National Handicap Housing Institute of St. Paul will receive $1,675,800 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build affordable housing for adults with physical disabilities.  
   "During my time in the Senate, I have strongly advocated equal access for people with disabilities," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this funding will help to serve their needs." 
   The award will fund the construction of affordable, handicapped-accessible housing and will subsidize rent within the housing for the first three years of operation. 
   The funding is administered under HUD's Section 811 program, which helps adults with disabilities to live as independently as possible by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services within the community. The award is interest-free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income, elderly persons or adults with disabilities for at least 40 years.
