SEN. DAYTON: $225K COMING TO MINNESOTA METH PREVENTION PROGRAM
  The state of Minnesota will soon receive a $225,000 federal grant to help eliminate the use of methamphetamine in its communities. The grant, which Sen. Mark Dayton helped secure in a 2006 Commerce Justice and Science spending bill, will be administered under the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.  
   "Methamphetamine is a highly addictive, dangerous drug that is a growing threat to communities throughout Minnesota," said Dayton. "This critical funding prevents the production and addiction of methamphetamine, keeping our citizens and communities safer." 
   The state anti-meth education initiative has been an ongoing effort that assists in teaching communities how to prevent the production of methamphetamine and user addiction. The initiative also helps to ensure strategic and safe responses to meth lab seizures; provides resources to prosecute meth "cooks" and abusers; and expands options for meth addiction treatment in the corrections system.
