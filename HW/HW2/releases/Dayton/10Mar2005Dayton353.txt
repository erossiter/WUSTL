SEN. DAYTON JOINS IN INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO COMBAT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
  Today, Sen. Mark Dayton joined with Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Kit Bond (R-MO) to introduce the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2005, to help the millions of Americans affected by Alzheimer's Disease.  
 The bipartisan legislation would double the funding for Alzheimer's research at the National Institutes of Health, from $700 million to $1.4 billion. It would also provide critical support to caregivers and launch a public education campaign on the latest advances in research and prevention. 
   "Alzheimer's is a devastating disease which impacts millions of Americans and their families," said Dayton. "It is critical that we continue making investments in research to soon find a cure. 
   "As a tribute to the life and legacy of President Ronald Reagan, this legislation will accelerate new research on how to detect, prevent, and treat Alzheimer's, and will help families caring for loved ones with the disease." 
   Mary J. Birchard, Executive Director Alzheimer's Association - Minnesota-North Dakota, "Over 90,000 Minnesotans are currently struggling with Alzheimer's Disease. This important legislation would help those individuals and their families today, and provide hope for finding a cure, tomorrow." 
   An estimated 4.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's Disease, 90,000 of whom live in Minnesota. As the Baby Boom generation ages, the number of people affected by Alzheimer's is expected to skyrocket. By 2025, it is estimated that 110,000 Minnesotans will have Alzheimer's Disease, a 25 percent increase since 2000.
