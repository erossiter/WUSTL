SEN.DAYTON ISSUES STATEMENT ON FAILURE OF HOUSE TO PASS 'DRU'S LAW'
  "It is disgraceful that House Republicans failed to take up this important legislation. As we near the anniversary of Dru Sjodin's tragic abduction and murder, we are reminded of how important it is for a national sex offender registry to be created, so that our communities have access to the information they need to keep our neighborhoods safe. My heartfelt condolences go out to the Sjodin family for their incomprehensible loss. I will continue to fight for passage of Dru's law."
