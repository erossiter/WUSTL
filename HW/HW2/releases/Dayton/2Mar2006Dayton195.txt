SEN. DAYTON: MINNESOTA SHORTCHANGED BY SLASHES TO BYRNE GRANT PROGRAM
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that state and local law enforcement agencies throughout Minnesota will collectively receive $3,061,831 from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program - a 36 percent cut from what the state received last year. The grants, provided by the U.S. Department of Justice, fund regional drug task forces, officer training, and the purchase of new equipment to target methamphetamine and other illegal drugs. In 2005, Minnesota received $4.8 million in Byrne grants.  
   "It's disgraceful that as Congress and the Administration demand more from local law enforcement - from national security to the war on drugs - we have failed to give them the resources they need to do it," said Dayton. "Repeated cuts to the Byrne program are a real blow to Minnesota law enforcement, which has a battle on its hands to rid our state of criminals and their crimes." 
   In September, Dayton and Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) tried to restore funding for the Byrne program, to the FY 2003 level of $900 million. Although that amendment passed the Senate unanimously, the provision was taken out of the final conference bill. 
   Since 2003, funding for the Byrne grant program has been repeatedly slashed: 
   * FY 2006 - $416 million, a 54 percent cut from FY 2003 
   * FY 2005 - $634 million 
   * FY 2004 - $725 million 
   * FY 2003 - $900 million 
   The President's FY 2007 budget proposal includes zero money for Byrne grants. 
   The Byrne Grant program provides critical funding to Minnesota's 21 regional drug task forces, which combat the epidemic of meth trafficking and production. Rural communities are especially dependent upon Byrne Grants to stop the illegal use and production of methamphetamine; over 75 percent of all meth labs in Minnesota are located in rural or semi-rural areas.
