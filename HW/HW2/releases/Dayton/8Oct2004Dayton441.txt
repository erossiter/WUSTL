SEN. DAYTON SUPPORTS SENATE CORPORATE TAX BILL; PROVIDES EXTENSIVE ETHANOL, BIODIESEL BENEFITS TO MINNESOTA FARMERS
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton announced his support for the Conference report on the corporate tax legislation.  
 The bill includes comprehensive ethanol and biodiesel provisions which will benefit Minnesota farmers. Specifically, the bill provides that Minnesota will receive an additional $2.4 billion over a six-year period through a tax credit for each gallon of alcohol used in ethanol-gasoline blended fuel. It also includes a provision for biodiesel which provides a 50 cent-per-gallon income tax credit through 2006 for each gallon of biodiesel used or sold as fuel.
   "Ethanol and biodiesel are home-grown, renewable fuels that will reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil; increase demand for farm products, thus boosting their market prices; and provide for a cleaner environment," Dayton said. "Unfortunately, the benefits of these renewable rules are still relatively unknown. The tax credits included in this bill will help support renewable energy's future."
   "We need to do all that we can to move us closer to our goal of energy independence and developing technologies that can reliably transform renewable raw material into clean and efficient energy sources."
