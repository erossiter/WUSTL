SEN. DAYTON SUPPORTS MOROCCO FREE TRADE BILL
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton voted in favor of the free trade agreement with Morocco. The bill would create duty-free treatment for U.S. goods, which now currently carry an average tariff of 20 percent in Morocco. The bill passed today with a vote of 85-13.
   "Most Minnesota farmers believe they will benefit from this agreement, particularly our grain and cattle farmers," said Dayton. "I am in favor of fair trade agreements whose benefits to U.S. producers outweigh the costs. The Morocco agreement appears to be one of those agreements."
