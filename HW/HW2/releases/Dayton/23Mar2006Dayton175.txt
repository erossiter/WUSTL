SEN. DAYTON: $1 BILLION IN ADDITIONAL LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDING TO RELEASE ON MARCH 23TH
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Department of Health and Human Services will today release an additional $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), for FY2006. Though pleased that both the Senate and House approved the funding earlier this month, Dayton expressed disappointment that it will not be enough to cover every eligible Minnesotan. 
   "Though it falls far short of our state's overall needs, I am pleased that Congress approved $1 billion in additional LIHEAP funding," said Dayton. "This aid will help Minnesota's neediest families and seniors cope with their bills and get through the rest of the season."
   So far, in FY2006, only 145,859 of Minnesota's 450,000 eligible households have received heating assistance from LIHEAP-less than 1/3. Minnesota has received $81.6 million LIHEAP funding in FY2006.
   The additional $1 billion brings total LIHEAP funding to $3.16 billion for FY2006-nearly $2 billion below the federally authorized level. Dayton has cosponsored four amendments to fully fund LIHEAP at the authorized level of $5.1 billion, but all were defeated by the Republican-controlled Congress. In his FY2007 budget proposal, President Bush allocates only $1.78 billion for LIHEAP.
