SEN. DAYTON URGES USDA TO IMMEDIATELY PUBLISH DETAILS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY ELIGIBILITY
  Sen. Mark Dayton joined with several of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, urging that her Department expedite publication of a new rule outlining eligibility requirements for the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program.  
 The program, established under the 2002 Farm Bill, provides grants and loans to farmers, ranchers, and small businesses in rural America to purchase renewable energy systems and to implement energy efficiency improvements. Currently, USDA provides very broad, temporary guidelines.
   "The Department of Agriculture has been dragging its feet far too long on completing this important rule," said Dayton. "Minnesota's farmers and rural businesses do not have a clear explanation of who can apply for this program and how they can take advantage of the funds available. Instead of encouraging Americans to invest in renewable energy and efficiency programs, we are frustrating them.
   "I urge Secretary Veneman to move this project along immediately, so that rural Minnesotans who want to invest in renewable energy can do so."
   Last year, 21 projects in Minnesota received $4.67 million in funding through the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program. Although these projects have fared well, the lack of details about eligibility requirements has kept many other Minnesotans from applying.
