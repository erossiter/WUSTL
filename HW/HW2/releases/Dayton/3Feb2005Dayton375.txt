SEN. DAYTON RECEIVES AWARD FOR PERFECT VOTING RECORD IN PROTECTING AMERICA'S NATIONAL PARKS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today was awarded the "Friend of the National Parks" award by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), for his support of legislation during the 108th Congress to protect and enhance America's 388 National Parks. Sen.  
 Dayton scored 100 percent from NPCA for his votes in support of five National Park-related bills, including legislation to increase funding for environmental protection and conservation programs, to stop the outsourcing of National Park Service jobs, and for his support of the Climate Stewardship Act, which accelerates the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 
   "It is truly an honor to receive this award," said Dayton. "Our 388 National Parks, including Grand Portage National Monument, Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, Pipestone National Monument, and Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, are places of pristine landscapes and wonderful wildlife. I will continue to support legislation and policies that protects these treasures for future generations." 
   For 85 years, NPCA has been at the forefront of the effort to protect, preserve, and enhance America's National Park System. The organization, located in Washington, D.C., has 300,000 members.
