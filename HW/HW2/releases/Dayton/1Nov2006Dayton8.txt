SEN. DAYTON: $2.5 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ALBERT LEA
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that Accessible Space, Inc. (ASI) of St. Paul will receive $2,576,600 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build affordable housing for the elderly in Albert Lea.  
   "Affordable housing is far too scarce, especially for older Americans," said Dayton. "I am delighted that this funding will help meet the needs of seniors in Albert Lea." 
   The award will fund the construction of a 23-unit affordable housing complex on land donated by the City of Albert Lea and will subsidize rent within the complex for the first three years of operation. Very low-income seniors, age 62 years and older, will qualify for housing. 
   Because additional monies have yet to be raised, the date that construction will begin has not been set. However, Stephen Vander Schaaf, President and CEO of ASI, is hopeful that construction will be underway within the next two years. 
   The funding for the housing project is administered under HUD's Section 202 program. The award is interest-free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for very low-income, elderly persons for at least 40 years. 
   ASI, a Minnesota-based nonprofit organization, has completed 125 HUD-funded developments in 28 states since it was founded in 1978.
