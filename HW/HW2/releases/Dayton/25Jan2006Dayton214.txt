SEN. DAYTON: BELTRAMI, CASS COUNTIES RECEIVE $400,000 TO HELP AT-RISK YOUTH BUILD HOMES, LEARN JOB SKILLS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Bi-County Community Action Program, which serves the counties of Beltrami and Cass, will receive a $400,000 grant for the YouthBuild program. YouthBuild is a national program that enables young adults to simultaneously complete their high school educations and achieve on-the-job training in construction. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provided the grant and operates the program.  
   "YouthBuild is win-win for Minnesota," said Dayton. "The program builds affordable homes for people who need them, and builds new lives for students who have dropped out of school." 
   The YouthBuild program serves young adults, ages 16 to 24, who have left the traditional school system. Participants alternate weekly between 32 hours of academic and leadership-building activities and 32 hours of construction training. Students build or renovate single-family homes and apartment buildings, which are sold at affordable prices, to low-income and homeless families. 
   In Beltrami and Cass counties, the YouthBuild program is also devoted to preparing students for more advanced technical training and college. 
   Lucille Moe, Executive Director of the Bi-County Community Action Program, said, "We have updated our educational model, with a push towards postsecondary training for our 'at-risk' youth, with great success! A recent graduate attained a GPA of 3.5 in the first university semester."
