  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that four Minnesota fire departments have been awarded a total of over $450,000 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
 The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used for the acquisition of new firefighting vehicles. 
   "Improving the safety and security of Minnesotans is one of my top priorities," said Dayton. "We are making great strides in providing our firefighters with the resources they need to do their job and keep their communities safe, by supplying them with this much-needed funding. 
   "I am pleased that this funding will help our firefighters acquire new fire vehicles and therefore, respond more safely and effectively to any emergency." 
   Administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program teams with the U.S. Fire Administration to provide direct assistance to local fire departments for general firefighter and first-responder operations.
