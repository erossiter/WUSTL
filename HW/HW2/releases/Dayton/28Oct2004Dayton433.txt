SEN. DAYTON: OVER $2.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING AWARDED TO 32 MINNESOTA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that 32 Minnesota fire departments have been awarded over $2.5 million in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The funding, provided through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will be used to purchase new fire trucks and equipment, install smoke alarms and fire suppression systems, promote fire prevention awareness, and support firefighter training programs.  
   "Our firefighters work tirelessly to keep our communities safe and to educate Minnesotan's about fire prevention," said Dayton. "I am pleased that this funding will help many of our local fire departments introduce training programs and purchase the vehicles and equipment that they otherwise couldn't afford." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration, helps rural, urban, and suburban fire departments throughout the United States to prepare for emergencies and acts of terrorism. This is the nineteenth round of awards for fiscal year 2004.
