SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE REFORM ACT
  Sen. Mark Dayton, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, today voted for Senate passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which reorganizes the nation's intelligence efforts and improves northern border security. This landmark legislation, based on the findings of the 9/11 Commission, received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate and will now proceed to the President to be signed into law. 
   "I salute Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for reaching an agreement on this important bill and placing the safety and security of Americans ahead of partisan politics," said Dayton. "This legislation includes the most important recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and it retains the key factors of the Senate bill, which were forged in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee of which I am a member."
   Key provisions of the Intelligence Reform Act include: creation of a Director for National Intelligence (DNI) to oversee all intelligence operations, formation of a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) to coordinate the nation's efforts against terrorism, and establishment of a civil liberties board to protect citizens' rights and monitor the newly created intelligence system. The bill also improves aviation, air cargo, and maritime security, and it increases the number of border guards and immigration agents assigned to protect Minnesota's and the rest of the nation's northern border.
   "The additional border guards and immigration agents will be extremely important to improving the security along Minnesota's northern border," said Dayton. "I have already informed Bernard Kerik, the President's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, that I want assurances that Minnesota's homeland security funding will not be cut, before the Senate proceeds with his confirmation."
