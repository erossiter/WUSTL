SEN. DAYTON LAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Mark Dayton praised Senate passage of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act (S.2611), which was approved today by a vote of 62 to 36. The legislation tightens U.S. border security, by adding 14,000 border patrol agents, constructing 500 miles of vehicle barriers, and creating a virtual "fence" using advanced surveillance technology. The bill also creates a mandatory system for employers to verify the legal status of their employees, and creates a temporary worker program to help businesses fill the gaps when American labor is not available. Today's bill also establishes a path for illegal immigrants, who meet all the necessary criteria, including working for six years and paying a $3,250 fine, to become U.S. citizens. 
   Below is Dayton's statement on the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act.
   "I voted for the Senate's immigration bill today, despite its imperfections. The bill strengthens our border security, to keep illegal immigrants out, with both real and electronic fences and increased border patrols. It requires everyone to be in this country legally, in order to be hired; and it imposes stiff penalties on employers who hire future illegal immigrants. It creates a path to earned citizenship for the estimated 12 million undocumented workers now in this country-contingent upon their learning English, passing criminal background checks, paying any back taxes, and holding steady jobs.
   "We will need those productive employees to keep our economy growing and to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits for future retirees. It is imperative, however, that they be in this country legally. This bill is a long overdue step in that direction."
