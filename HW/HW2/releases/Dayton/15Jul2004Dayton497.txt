SEN. DAYTON SECURES NEARLY $5 MILLION FOR MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL AIRPORT IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $4.95 million in federal funds for a new Joint Security Forces Operations Center at the Minneapolis-St.  
 Paul International Airport Reserve Station. Dayton worked to secure these funds, which are needed to build the new Center. Once complete, the facility will serve as headquarters for all security operations for Minnesota's Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, and Naval Reserve personnel.
   "This is great news for Minnesota!" said Dayton. "As a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I fought hard to secure these funds to build a central facility, which is essential for our military to perform effectively and efficiently."
   "It is unacceptable that many of Minnesota's military forces have been coping with inadequate and deteriorating work space. This funding will facilitate efficiency and recognize the vital importance of joint military operations."
   Once complete, the Center will house security operations for all military services in the Twin Cities area. This includes security forces, law enforcement, and combat arms for Minnesota's Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, and Naval Reserve personnel.
