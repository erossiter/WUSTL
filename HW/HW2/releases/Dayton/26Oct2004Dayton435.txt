SEN. DAYTON EARNS 100 PERCENT SCORE FROM HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN
  Sen. Mark Dayton received a perfect voting score from the Human Rights Campaign on its Congressional Scorecard for the 108th Congress.  
 The national organization graded all Members of Congress based on seven key votes relating to the civil rights and well-being of America's GLBT community. 
   "I am proud that my voting record demonstrates my strong commitment to civil rights for all Americans," said Dayton. "I will continue to urge my colleagues in Congress to actively support the basic rights and freedoms to which all citizens are entitled."
   "Senator Dayton is fulfilling the great Minnesota tradition of supporting fairness and equality for everyone," said Steven Fisher, Communications Director for the Human Rights Campaign.
   In 2003, Dayton garnered perfect scores on Congressional scorecards compiled by several civil and human rights organizations, including: the NAACP's Federal Legislative Report Card, the Children's Defense Fund Action Council's Nonpartisan Congressional Scorecard, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR) Civil Rights Voting Record on key civil rights votes.
