SEN. DAYTON SECURES MILLIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton applauded the inclusion of millions in federal dollars for Minnesota transportation projects in the House-Senate Highway bill, which passed the Senate today. Dayton secured funding for projects to improve road safety statewide and for a major highway in northwest Minnesota. Additionally, $80 million for Northstar Corridor and $50 million for Union Depot in St. Paul were included in the bill. The bill is expected to pass the Senate today and will then be sent to the President's desk for his signature.  
   "This is a long-overdue bill and much less than the Senate passed over a year ago," said Dayton. "Unfortunately, the White House killed the Senate bill and insisted on this one, which provides for less money than needed for Minnesota's transportation infrastructure. Both the state and federal governments have failed badly to provide the financing necessary for Minnesota's highways and mass transit. The deterioration of those systems will imperil our state's future. This bill is an inadequate measure, given the severity of our transportation crisis." 
   "Highway 11 has always been our access to the rest of the country for manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism," said Bob Marvin, Vice President of Transportation for Marvin Windows in Warroad, MN. "Any enhancement or improvement to the highway will only improve the economic vitality of the entire region." 
   Dayton secured funds for the following projects in the bill: 
   * $3 million for the Township Sign Replacement Project, which would enable hundreds of townships across Minnesota to update and replace road signs that are deficient. There are over 1,700 townships in Minnesota, where over 900,000 people reside. 
   * $3.5 million for improvements to State Highway 11 which runs along the Canadian border from Warroad to International Falls. 
   * $4,000,000 for the City of Moorhead for an interchange at 34th Street and I-94. This project relocates an interchange away from a railroad crossing, which will greatly improve public safety. 
   * $3,000,000 to connect the Phalen Corridor to I-35E in Saint Paul. 
   * $2,000,000 to connect Victory Drive to Highway 14 in Mankato. 
   * $8,000,000 to help complete Trunk Highway 610, which will run from Highway 169 to Interstate 94, just north of the Twin Cities. Funding will be used to help complete the remaining 5 miles. 
   * $4,000,000 for construction of Trunk Highway 14 from one mile west of Waseca to Owatonna. 
   * $2,000,000 for construction of 8th Street North, from Stearns County Road 120 to Trunk Highway 15, in St. Cloud. 
   * $2,000,000 for the design and construction of improvements to Trunk Highway 65 in Blaine. 
   * $2,500,000 for the design, construction, and expansion of Trunk Highway 241 in the City of St. Michael. 
   * $1,000,000 for construction of a four-lane bypass on Trunk Highway 23 in Paynesville. 
   Additionally, the bill included $80 million for the Northstar corridor, which would run on an 80-mile segment of existing track from Minneapolis to Big Lake and $50 million for Union Depot, the former railroad depot and multimodal transit facility in St. Paul.
