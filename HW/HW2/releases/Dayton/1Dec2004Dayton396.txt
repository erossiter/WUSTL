SEN. DAYTON TO VISIT MINNESOTA TROOPS OVERSEAS DURING HOLIDAY SEASON
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that he will travel to Iraq during the holidays to visit American troops serving overseas.  
 As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Dayton traveled to Iraq in July, 2003. Dayton will also visit Israel and Jordan, where he will meet with government officials.
   "Senator Dayton is anxious to see the troops over the holidays so that he can thank them in person for their dedicated service to our country and reassure them that he continues to do everything possible to make sure they are home with their families for the holidays next year," said Chris Lisi, Dayton's Communications Director. "Senator Dayton is very appreciative to Senator Lieberman for including him on this important trip." 
   While in Iraq, Dayton will meet with Minnesotans serving there and will sit down with government officials to discuss approaching elections in January. He also plans to meet with military leaders to learn about the progress in training Iraqi forces and when they can realistically assume responsibility for securing their country so that U.S. troops can return home. 
   Additionally, Dayton anticipates meeting with government officials in Israel and Jordan during his brief stops in those countries.
