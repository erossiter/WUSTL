SEN. DAYTON: ST. PAUL'S AMES LAKE NEIGHBORHOOD TO RECEIVE $250,000 FOR RENOVATION EFFORTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced that $250,000 in federal funds for the City of St.  
 Paul's Ames Lake Neighborhood renovation efforts was included in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass the Senate later today. The funding, secured by Dayton, will be used for neighborhood rehabilitation and public infrastructure improvements, such as the construction of new housing units and areas of green space. 
   "I'm pleased that the Ames Lake Neighborhood will have the funding necessary to continue its very productive revitalization efforts and will target 34 apartment buildings for rehabilitation," said Dayton. "This diverse neighborhood is on the move, and Minnesota's families will find it a much more welcoming place to live after completion of these important improvements." 
   Since being elected to the Senate in 2002, Dayton has secured over $1.8 million in funding for renovation efforts in the Ames Lake Neighborhood. This includes: $250,000 in FY05, $187,500 in FY04, $670,612 in FY03, and $750,000 in FY02. 
   Following Senate passage of the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, the legislation will proceed to the President to be signed into law.
