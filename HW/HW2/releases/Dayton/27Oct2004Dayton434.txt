SEN. DAYTON CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE HEARINGS TO INVESTIGATE MISSING 380 TONS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES IN IRAQ
  Today Sen. Mark Dayton issued a formal request to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Senator John Warner, to immediately hold oversight hearings when the Senate reconvenes on November 16th to investigate recent news accounts that 380 tons of high explosives have disappeared from Iraq.  
 Also, Dayton joined his Democratic colleagues in urging President Bush to brief Senators regarding the status of the urgent matter at once. 
   "Conflicting statements from the Bush Administration in the media have only led to more confusion regarding this urgent matter," said Dayton. "The President owes the American people an explanation. 
   "We need to know what happened to those materials and whether or not they are in the hands of those who would use them harmfully against American troops in Iraq and Americans around the world."
   The Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology has reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that nearly 400 tons of explosives, which included HMX and RDX - key components in plastic explosives which have been used repeatedly against American troops in Iraq, were removed as a result of "theft and looting ... due to lack of security."
