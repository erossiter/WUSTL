  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will receive $250,000 in federal funds for construction and renovations at Veterans Park in Eveleth. The grant, provided by the National Park Service's Land and Water Conservation Fund, will be used to expand the park's campgrounds, as well as to construct a fishing pier, a playground, and new restroom and shower facilities. Funds will also be used to landscape the park's beach and picnic areas.  
   "Each year, thousands of Americans enjoy all of the activities and scenic beauty that Veterans Park has to offer," said Dayton. "I am delighted that the National Park Service's funding will expand and improve the park for more Minnesotans and visitors to our great state." 
   Veterans Park is located directly on Ely Lake, in Eveleth. It features 22 campsites, a swimming beach, hiking and cross-country ski trails, and a bicycle path that connects to downtown Eveleth.
