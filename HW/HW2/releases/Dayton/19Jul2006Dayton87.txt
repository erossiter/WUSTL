SEN. DAYTON: FOUR AMERICAN INDIAN RESERVATIONS IN MINNESOTA TO RECEIVE OVER $5.2MILLION IN HOUSING ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Mark Dayton announced today that four American Indian reservations in Minnesota will receive $5,295,062 in federal funding to provide increased access to affordable housing. The recipients, Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa ($3,384,658), Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe ($1,352,414), Upper Sioux Indian Community ($291,859) and the Grand Portage Reservation ($266,131), have been approved under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) of 1996 to receive funding under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program.  
   "The availability of safe, affordable housing is critically important to the quality of life for all communities," Dayton said. 
   The Indian Housing Block Grant Program provides direct grants to tribal governments to provide affordable housing for American Indian communities. The IHBG funds can be used for a variety of eligible affordable housing activities, such as modernization and operating assistance for low income housing, new construction, housing services, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that present creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems.
