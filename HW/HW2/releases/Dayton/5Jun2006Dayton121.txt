SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $1.6 MILLION FOR CHISHOLM-HIBBING AIRPORT
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Chisholm-Hibbing Airport Authority will receive $1,629,500 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation Administration, for necessary safety enhancements and expansion projects.  
   "I am delighted that this FAA grant will improve the safety and reliability of the Chisholm-Hibbing Airport," said Dayton. "Investment in the infrastructure of our airports, both large and small, is critical to ensuring passenger safety and to promoting travel in Minnesota." 
   The funding will be used to acquire a sand spreader, to improve airplanes' braking action on the runway during snowy and icy conditions. With the grant, the airport will also acquire new snow removal equipment and construct a storage building, to ensure the equipment is protected and available when needed. Funding will also be used to remove obstructions and acquire new land for the Runway 13 approach.
