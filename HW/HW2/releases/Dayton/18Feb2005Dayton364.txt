SEN. DAYTON'S WEBSITE LAUNCHES SOCIAL INSECURITY CALCULATOR, REVEALING HOW AVERAGE AMERICANS WILL LOSE BENEFITS UNDER BUSH PRIVATIZATION PLAN
  Sen. Mark Dayton today unveiled a new "Social InSecurity calculator" on his web site, illustrating the cuts to their Social Security benefits that Americans would experience under the Bush Privatization Plan. The calculator, which can be accessed by visiting Dayton's web site, www.dayton.senate.gov, allows users to simply enter their average annual income and their birth date in order to view a side-by-side comparison of benefits under the Bush Privatization Plan versus those under the current Social Security system. 
   "The fine print in the President's Social Security proposal is that all present and future workers under age 55 will have their promised retirement benefits cut," said Dayton. "To see how much of a cut you would suffer, visit my web site at http://dayton.senate.gov/, and use the "Social Insecurity Calculator." It will show you why the President's plan is a bad deal for you." 
   All numbers used for the calculator on Dayton's website are annual benefits adjusted for inflation. Calculations are based on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's economic assumptions.
