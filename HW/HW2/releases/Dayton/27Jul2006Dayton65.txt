SEN. DAYTON APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE OF SEX OFFENDER BILL THAT INCLUDES 'DRU'S LAW'
  On the 25th anniversary of the disappearance of Adam Walsh, Sen. Mark Dayton today applauded the President's signing of the "Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act." Adam Walsh, son of "America's Most Wanted" host John Walsh, was abducted and murdered at age six. Today's law incorporates sex offender database legislation known as "Dru's Law," named for Pequot Lakes-native Dru Sjodin, who was also abducted and murdered, three years ago by a convicted sex offender. 
   "This is one of the most important child protection laws to be enacted in our country," said Dayton. "I applaud the President for signing this bill, which honors the memory of Dru Sjodin and other young victims of violent crimes, and which will help to prevent such heinous tragedies from occurring again."
   The law creates a national database and requires convicted sex offenders to register their whereabouts every month, in person. Failure to comply is a felony. Existing sex offender sites are managed from state to state, and do not correspond with each other. Under current law, convicts are required to register usually only once per year, by mail, and failure to comply is only a misdemeanor.
   Additionally, the law authorizes funding for tracking devices for the worst sex offenders. The measure also increases minimum prison sentences for sexual offenses against children, trafficking of children, and violent crimes against children, and provides grants to combat sexual abuse of children and for a national sexual assault hotline.
