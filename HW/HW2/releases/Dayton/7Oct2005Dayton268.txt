SEN. DAYTON SECURES OVER $71.1 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Senate has approved $71.1 million for Minnesota defense-related projects and programs. Dayton, a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, pushed for the funding as part of the $440 billion FY 2006 defense spending bill (H.R. 2863), which passed the Senate today by a vote of 97 to 0.  
   "The announcement of over $71 million in funds designated for defense project work by Minnesota companies means more jobs for our great state," said Dayton. "Minnesota companies are proud to be able to contribute in some way to the hard work our troops are doing overseas. These funds enable Minnesota companies to continue their strong involvement in supporting our troops."
