SEN. DAYTON ANNOUNCES OVER $4.3 MILLION IN HIV TREATMENT, SOCIAL SERVICES FOR UNDERSERVED MINNESOTANS
  Sen. Mark Dayton today announced that the Minnesota State Department of Human Services will receive $4,318,987 in federal funding to support state and local care programs for low-income, HIV-infected Minnesotans with little or no coverage. The funding was made available through Title II of the Ryan White CARE ACT, and was awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services.  
   "The Ryan White CARE Act has helped thousands of HIV-positive patients to obtain life-saving care," said Dayton. "I am delighted that Minnesota will receive more than $4 million for this critically important program." 
   The grant supports a wide range of services to HIV-infected persons, including medical and dental care, drug treatments, home health care and substance abuse treatment. The Ryan White Act requires that care be directed primarily to low-income and underserved people who do not have insurance and are not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or state-funded programs. The grant is awarded to states based on a formula that takes into account the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS in each state. 
   Currently, more than 5,100 Minnesotans live with HIV. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, about 41 percent of Minnesotans who were aware of their HIV status in 2003 did not receive medical care for their disease. Since 1990, the number of people in Hennepin County living with HIV has increased by six or seven percent, annually. During the same time, the number of AIDS-related deaths has decreased, which public health officials attribute, in part, to more effective treatment options.
