SEN. DAYTON LENDS HAND TO BURNSVILLE FAMILY SEEKING TO ADOPT SIERRA LEONE ORPHAN
  Sen. Mark Dayton today sent a letter to his Excellency Ibrahim Kamara, Ambassador of the Republic of Sierra Leone to the U.S., requesting his assistance in completing a Burnsville family's adoption of an 11 year-old orphan.  
 For the last six months, James and Kae Benda have been waiting in limbo to adopt a little boy named Samuel, after their application was put on hold due to recent changes in Sierra Leone's international adoption laws. The new laws require the family to relocate to the country for six months in order for the adoption to be finalized. 
   In his letter, Dayton requested that the government of Sierra Leone allow the adoption to proceed, as the Benda family initiated the adoption process long before the new requirements were put in place. 
   "The Benda family deserves to adopt Samuel," said Dayton. "They love him, can give him a good home and a future. I will continue to do everything I can to help them complete this adoption." 
   Determined to make Samuel part of their family, James and Kae Benda even took out a second mortgage on their home and photography business, before contacting Dayton for help. 
   Said James Benda, "We don't often ask for help, but we really need a hand in bringing Samuel home to Minnesota. We thank Senator Dayton from the bottom of our heart." 
   Dayton has intervened in several international adoption cases on behalf of Minnesota families. Most recently, the Senator worked with the Chinese government to allow Rochester residents Rob and Carol Nassif, to complete the adoption of their son Luke.
