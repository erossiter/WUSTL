SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $50,000 IN GRANTS FOR HARWINTON FIREFIGHTERS
  Harwinton Volunteer Fire Department will receive a federal grant totaling $52,345 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. 
   "Cities and towns throughout Connecticut are in desperate need of resources and equipment to help their firefighters better do their jobs and keep families safe," said Dodd. "This funding is a step in the right direction toward getting life-saving equipment to our first responders, but the Administration needs to do more to get critically important resources into the hands of fire departments in Connecticut and throughout the country. We cannot put a price tag on their safety." 
   "Fire fighters who are on the front lines risking their lives to make our communities more secure deserve more support," Lieberman said. "These funds will help make sure that Connecticut fire fighters are better prepared to keep citizens safe." 
   The award was made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 315 grants for a total of more than $31.1 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
