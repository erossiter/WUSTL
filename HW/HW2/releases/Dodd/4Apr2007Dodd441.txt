SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CIRCUIT CITY'S FIRING OF 3,400 EMPLOYEES
  "Circuit City's decision to fire these employees based solely on what they earn greatly alarms me. I believe this sets a dangerous precedent that conflicts directly with the deeply held American belief that with hard work comes opportunity and prosperity. We are not talking about executives making millions here - these are earnest workers that need their modest incomes in order to support their families. We must speak out against the injustice of this decision, as it may have grave implications for the middle class and the future of the American dream."
