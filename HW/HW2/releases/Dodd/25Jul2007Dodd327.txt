SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER EMPOWERMENT ACT
  Statement of Senator Dodd at the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs Hearing:
   Today I am pleased to convene the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps and Narcotics Affairs. I would like to welcome my Ranking Member, Senator Corker, who has joined me at this morning's hearing to receive testimony and ask questions on a very important topic - the Peace Corps.
   Since its establishment in 1961 the Peace Corps has been held in high regard by the Congress, the American people and the global community. That has been the case because it has always been non-partisan and apolitical - able to stay out of the political maelstrom of the moment - at home or abroad. That remains the case today. 
   The mission of the Peace Corps has always been clear and straight forward, namely to promote world peace and friendship. Central to the mission of the Peace Corps has been the volunteer - the 187,000 of them who have served in more than 139 countries since 1961 and the 7,700 who are currently serving in more than 70 countries today.
   I have the honor and privilege of being a member of the Peace Corps Alumni having served as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic from 1966-68. Peace Corps service for me was a life changing experience that cemented my belief and commitment to public service. I am certain that many of the witnesses who will testify this morning - a number of them with Peace Corps experiences of their own - share my belief that the volunteer experience has a profound impact on life decisions to follow, not to mention one's world view.
   Since 1961 successive generations of Peace Corps volunteers have been challenged to strive to accomplish three goals: to help others help themselves, to help others understand America, and to help America understand others.
   I am convinced that today more than ever before the importance and necessity for Peace Corps to promote global understanding and friendship could not be greater.
   Bad policy choices and neglected opportunities have tarnished our nation's reputation and weakened our alliances at a moment in history when both are critical to promoting and protecting our national interests and security.
   In order to ensure that the Peace Corps is well prepared to carry out its mission in the 21st century, it's important from time to time to assess how effectively Peace Corps management and staff are recruiting, training and serving volunteers as they carry out the core missions of the agency. It also means exploring ideas and suggestions for changing the way the Peace Corps operates, if that will enhance the ability of volunteers to carry out the goals they are charged with in statute. And it means finding ways to expand the reach of the Peace Corps at home and abroad by providing additional resources and doubling the number of volunteers to give it more fire power to do so.
   S. 732 - The Peace Corps Volunteer Empowerment Act, which I introduced on March 1 after extensive consultation with the volunteer and returned volunteer communities, is an effort to begin that brainstorming process.
   Key provisions of the bill would -
   * Designate a small portion of the annual Peace Corps budget for use as seed monies for active Peace Corps volunteers for demonstration projects at their sites;
   * Authorize $10 million in additional annual appropriations to be distributed by the Peace Corps as grants to returned Peace Corps volunteers interested in undertaking "third goal" projects in their local communities;
   * Authorize active Peace Corps volunteers to accept, under certain carefully defined circumstances, private donations to support their development projects;
   * Establish mechanisms for more volunteer input into the Peace Corps operations, including staffing decisions, site selection, language training and country programs;
   * Bring the Peace Corps into the digital age by establishing websites and email links for use by volunteers in-country;
   * Authorize active recruitment from the 185,000 returned Peace Corps volunteer community for second tours as volunteers and as participants in third goal activities in the United States;
   * Remove certain medical, healthcare and other impediments that discourage older individuals from becoming Peace Corps volunteers;
   * Create more transparency in the medical screening and appeals process.
   * Require a report on costs associated with extending post-service health coverage from one month to six months;
   * Protect certain rights of Peace Corps volunteers with respect to termination of service and whistleblower protection; and most important
   * Include annual authorizations for fiscal years 2008-11 consistent with the goal of doubling the number of volunteers to 15,000 by 2011.
   This bill set out a very ambitious list of issues to begin to explore ways to strengthen the volunteer experience. I stress the word "begin," because this bill is meant as the jumping off point for discussing how the Peace Corps can do better, not the finish line. I am somewhat disappointed that the testimony by the Director doesn't seem to reflect that understanding. I would also have to say that I believe that no matter how well an agency or program is functioning, there should always be an open mind to how it can be made more effective. I hope over the course of this morning's hearing that is the mindset we will allow adopt.
   I want to welcome and thank all of the witnesses who are here this morning. Director Ron Tschetter, Former Peace Corps Director and returned volunteer Mark Schneider, Peace Corps Inspector General David Kotz - Welcome.
   I would also offer special recognition and thanks to Chuck Ludlam and his wife, Paula Hirschoff, who are currently on their second tour as volunteers in Senegal, and who on their own time and expense have come from Senegal to testify this morning. Your input into the development of the bill has been very helpful and I look forward to your testimony later this morning.
   With that I will turn to Senator Corker for any opening remarks he wishes to make before hearing from our witnesses.
