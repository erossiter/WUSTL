SEN. DODD EXPRESSES DISAPPOINTMENT IN CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE MUKASEY FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today expressed deep disappointment in the Senate's vote late last night to confirm Judge Michael Mukasey as Attorney General. Dodd, who was the first Democratic Senator to oppose the nomination, does not believe Judge Mukasey will adequately restore the Department of Justice's ability to impartially enforce the rule of law. The Senate confirmed the nomination by a 53-40 vote. 
   "I am deeply troubled that the Senate has voted to confirm Judge Mukasey as Attorney General," said Dodd. "Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped Judge Mukasey would bring about a new era to a Justice Department that has been badly damaged by the partisan politics practiced under former Attorney General Gonzales. Unfortunately, I do not believe Judge Mukasey can implement the type of change that is so desperately needed during this critical time in our nation's history. Our next Attorney General must bring respect and credibility back to a Justice Department tainted by scandal. Judge Mukasey has not demonstrated that he possess the independent voice so badly needed by the Justice Department."
   Senator Dodd finds alarming several positions taken by Judge Mukasey, such as stating that that "the authority of the president to defend the country" gives him the power to disregard the law. Dodd believes this interpretation sets a dangerous precedent and undermines our nation's system of checks and balances as well as 200 years of legal tradition. Dodd also finds Judge Mukasey's refusal to classify waterboarding, an interrogation used to simulate the drowning of suspects as torture, unacceptable and beneath the moral standard our nation's chief law enforcement official should set.
