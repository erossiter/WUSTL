SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON BRAC COMMISSION SUBMISSION TO PRESIDENT
  Statement of Senator Dodd on BRAC Commission Submission to President 
   "We crossed a major hurdle when it comes to Sub Base New London. Getting the BRAC Commission to save this military facility from the scrap heap was a tremendous victory for our national security, our state and our citizens. But this process is far from over. We simply can't afford to take anything for granted. The President has stated that he'll approve the BRAC Commission recommendations and I take him at his word. But much more work remains to be done. Our state will continue to fight on all fronts, including efforts by the Pentagon to gut our state's National Guard. The National Guard as we've seen all too vividly in recent weeks has a tremendously important role to play in times of national emergencies. The last thing we should be doing is chipping away at their critically important mission."
