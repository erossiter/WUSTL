SEN. DODD PRAISES PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION WHICH REAUTHORIZES AND STRENGTHENS HEAD START
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today praised the passage of the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007. The bill, which will expand eligibility, improve accountability, strengthen school readiness and enhance teacher quality, will also bolster resources to Indian Head Start, Migrant and Seasonal Head Start and Early Head Start. The legislation passed unanimously. 
   "For more than 40 years, Head Start has provided early childhood development services to low-income children and I am pleased Congress has reauthorized this critically important program," said Dodd. "With more than 900,000 children enrolled in Head Start centers throughout the country, it is critical that these programs receive proper support so our children can access the comprehensive services that advance their readiness for school and healthy development." 
   Head Start aids in the social, emotional, physical and cognitive development of low-income children and successfully addresses the needs of the specific communities it serves. The legislation will allow more low-income children to get a head start by increasing eligibility standards, expanding access for infants and toddlers, strengthening the role of parents and improving educational standards for Head Start teachers. Research shows that a child's educational success is directly related to the quality of the teachers and professionals who work with them on a daily basis. 
   Throughout his career, Senator Dodd has been a tireless advocate for our nation's children. Dodd has consistently fought to expand and improve Head Start and was honored as the national Head Start "Senator of the Decade" for his efforts. Dodd has also worked to create after-school initiatives designed to keep children out of trouble and on the road to success, and has helped author measures to make higher education more affordable for working families.
