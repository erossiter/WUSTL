SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BOLTON COMMENTS AT UNITED NATIONS
  "Clearly the speech I read is not the one Mr. Bolton read. I believe the remarks by the UN Deputy Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown were constructive and meant to build support for reform. They were not an attack on the United States. Mr. Bolton falls back on bullying and threats rather than constructively engaging other delegates to move reform forward. That isn't constructive and does a disservice to United States interests at the UN."
