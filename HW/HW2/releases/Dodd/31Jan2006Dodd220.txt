SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  "I offer my deepest sympathies to the King family as the nation joins them in mourning the loss of this remarkable civil rights leader.  
 Coretta Scott King stood proudly with her husband in his fight for civil rights for all Americans and courageously continued his legacy after his tragic death while also raising four children. Mrs. King lived to see many of her husband's dreams become reality but there is still much more work to be done. As we pause to reflect on the life and legacy of Coretta Scott King,it is important to remember the inequalities that many Americans still face and renew our commitment to building a society that is truly just and free."
