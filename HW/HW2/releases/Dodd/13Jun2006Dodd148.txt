SEN. DODD SPEAKS IN FAVOR OF STRENGTHENING OCEAN POLICY
  Sen. Chris Dodd today spoke in favor of strengthening our country's ocean policy, while at the same time ensuring that our oceans and fisheries continue to thrive. Sen. Dodd joined his Senate colleagues at the unveiling of the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative's (JOCI) report, "From Sea to Shining Sea: Priorities for Ocean Policy Reform." "Our oceans support numerous species, affect nearly 80 percent of the world's commerce and impact our international politics and law. And as more people migrate to the coasts to live, work and vacation, the demands of industrialization and recreation are impacting our oceans in new and profound ways. Dodd said. "Unless we take steps to engage our federal, state, local and international leaders now, we will not adequately solve our ocean and coastal-related problems in the future." The report includes 10 recommendations for Congress:  
   * Adopt a statement of national ocean policy; 
  * Establish NOAA in law - it was created by Executive Order; 
  * Foster ecosystem-based regional governance; 
  * Reauthorize an improved Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act; 
  * Ensure that ocean-related research is incorporated in innovation legislation; 
  * Authorize and fund the Integrated Ocean Observing System; 
  * Accede to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; 
  * Establish an Ocean Trust Fund; 
  * Increase base funding for core ocean and coastal programs; and 
  * Enact ocean and coastal legislation that has already progressed significantly in the 109th Congress. 
   The report was commissioned at the behest of Senator Dodd and nine of his colleagues after the Senate reviewed the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission.
