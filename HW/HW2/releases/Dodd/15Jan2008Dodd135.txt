SEN. DODD REACTS TO SUPREME COURT RULING IN STONERIDGE CASE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, today responded to the Supreme Court's 5-3 ruling that investors seeking monetary relief from third parties over corporate fraud can't bring private lawsuits unless the investors relied on actions by those parties when making investment decisions. 
   "As the author of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, I stand second to none in my commitment to protect American businesses from frivolous litigation. But today's decision goes beyond that common-sense law. Instead of protecting innocent businesses, it would protect wrongdoers from the consequences of their actions. Such a misguided standard will do nothing to strengthen the competitive position of America's businesses and capital markets."
   Chairman Dodd previously sent letters to President Bush and Solicitor General Paul Clement to convey his disappointment that the Solicitor General chose not to file a brief with the Supreme Court expressing the views recommended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the case. Dodd wrote to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox in May of last year to inquire whether the SEC would continue its support of "scheme liability" in the Stoneridge case, and to voice his endorsement of the SEC's position.
