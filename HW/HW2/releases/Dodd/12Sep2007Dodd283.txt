SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MAJOR FUNDING FOR CONNECTICUT'S DEFENSE, SUBMARINE INDUSTRY
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) today announced the approval of the 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill by a key Senate panel which includes substantial funding for Connecticut's defense industry. This bill, which was unanimously approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, contained significant additional funds that will increase submarine production to two submarines per year by 2010 - two years earlier than originally planned by the Navy. This funding impacts thousands of jobs throughout Connecticut, especially in the southeast region of the state. The bill also includes substantial investments in current defense systems and research and development activities to ensure U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are outfitted with the quality resources they need to perform their missions
   "This bill marks the culmination of years of effort to save our nation's submarine fleet," said Dodd. "Congress has finally decided to stand up to this administration, plot a new course for our defense priorities, and invest in America's critical manufacturing industries. This bill highlights the confidence that our nation's leaders have in Connecticut workers and promotes investments in technologies essential to our national security." 
   "Preserving the submarine industrial base in the United States is a matter of national security and economic stability," said Lieberman. "This bill marks long-awaited progress toward maintaining a robust submarine force in the United States - one that can readily meet all of the challenges of warfighting, reconnaissance, and joint support placed upon it."
   Funding in the Defense Appropriations bill will be used to provide military equipment, ranging from ground vehicles, aircraft, and naval ships, and to support various advances in technology development and troop protection.
