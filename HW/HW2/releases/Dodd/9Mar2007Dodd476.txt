SEN. DODD INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP DEVELOP SAFER MEDICAL DEVICES FOR CHILDREN
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) introduced legislation yesterday to ensure that the safety of children is not compromised by medical devices developed with adult patients in mind. Reps. Ed Markey (D-MA-7) and Mike Rogers (R-MI-8) will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 improves incentives for the development of devices for children - while still preserving the ability to ensure the safety of new products once on the market. According to pediatricians, the development of new medical devices suitable for children's smaller and growing bodies can lag 5 or 10 years behind those for adults, leaving doctors no choice but to use equipment essential to medical diagnosis and treatment which are not designed or sized for children. 
   For example, physicians have had to resort to invasive procedures when a baby needs assistance breathing because even the smallest nasal masks on the market in the U.S. today are not designed to fit infants. Children needing heart transplants die at a disproportionate rate, but a device called a Berlin Heart which has shown great promise helping young children and newborns while they recover or wait for heart transplants can only be obtained today in the U.S. on a case by case basis and must be shipped from Germany.
   "While we all know that children are not simply small adults and should not be treated as such, because the pediatric market is so small and pediatric diseases relatively rare, there has been little incentive for medical device manufacturers to focus their attention on children," said Dodd. "This legislation ensures that our nation's children are receiving the best possible medical treatment and care at a critical time in their development."
   Senators Dodd's bill will provide assistance to innovators, streamline regulatory processes, and elevate pediatric device issues at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
   Specifically, the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act will:
   * Modify the existing humanitarian device exemption (HDE) for medical devices to allow profit for HDE-approved devices specifically designed to meet a pediatric need. Maintains existing requirement that a humanitarian use device is limited to one that treats and diagnoses diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. No profit will be allowed for a device used in more than 4,000 individuals. The HDE modification sunsets in 2013 and a GAO report assessing the HDE modification and its impact on patients and manufacturers is required. 
   * Establish a mechanism to allow the FDA to track the number and types of devices approved specifically for children or for conditions that occur in children, as well as the approval times for premarket applications and HDEs. 
   * Require the NIH to designate a contact point or office to help innovators and physicians access existing funding for pediatric medical device development and directs the NIH, the FDA, and the AHRQ to submit a plan for pediatric medical device research that identifies gaps and proposes a research agenda for addressing them. 
   * Establish demonstration grants for non-profit consortia to promote pediatric device development, including "matchmaking" between inventors and manufacturers and connecting innovators and physicians to existing Federal resources, including FDA, NIH, the Small Business Administration, VA and others. 
   * Grant explicit authority to the FDA's Pediatric Advisory Committee to monitor pediatric devices and make recommendations for improving their availability and safety. 
   * Incorporate several recommendations of the Institute of Medicine including improving the postmarket surveillance of medical devices used in children and expanding public access to postmarket studies of pediatric medical devices.
