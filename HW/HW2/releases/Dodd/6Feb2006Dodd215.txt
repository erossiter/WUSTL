SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED DEFENSE BUDGET
  "Many of our nation's critical defense programs are made in Connecticut and this budget reflects their importance in our national defense.  
 After initial review, funding for the F-22, Joint Strike Fighter and Blackhawk Helicopters seem encouraging. I plan to consult with Armed Forces leaders to ensure that the funding levels are adequate to meet our military's needs. I remain concerned that the current budget does not lay the groundwork to produce two submarines a year. As other nations are building up their own submarine fleets, it is essential that we make critical investments to ramp up our own submarine production to maintain the United States' naval superiority throughout the world."
