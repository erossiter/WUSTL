SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR SITUATION
  "The latest news about North Korea testing a nuclear weapon brings them one step closer to a full-blown nuclear weapons program. This is an extremely dangerous development. The Bush Administration has wasted the last 5-plus years sitting on the sidelines, and it's now time for them to get serious and use the United States' influence with China and South Korea to bring North Korea to the table. The United States must be prepared to discuss all issues of concern to both sides in order to dismantle this increasingly serious situation."
