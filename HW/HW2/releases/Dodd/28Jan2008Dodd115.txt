SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF MORMON CHURCH PRESIDENT HINCKLEY: MAN I RESPECTED, ADMIRED GREATLY
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) issued the following statement today after it was announced that The Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Church President Gordon B. Hinckley died yesterday at the age of 97 in Salt Lake City, UT.  
   "President Gordon B. Hinckley was a man I respected and admired greatly. Over the years, I had the opportunity to get to know him and my wife Jackie came to know him beginning in the 1980s when she worked for then-Utah Senator Jake Garn. As the Church's 15th president in its 177-year history, President Hinckley served for nearly 13 years. His life was marked by his dedication to service, his leadership on humanitarian work throughout the world, and his desire to reach out to those of other faiths. President Hinckley had a delightful disposition and his gentle kindness, sense of humor and, of course, his leadership, will be sorely missed."
