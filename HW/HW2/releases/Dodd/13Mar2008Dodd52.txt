SEN. DODD ASKS FOR ANSWERS FROM HUD SECRETARY JACKSON ON ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETY
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, yesterday voiced his deep concerns about allegations that Alphonso Jackson, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has acted improperly in granting federal contracts. After raising the issue with Secretary Jackson at a HUD oversight hearing, the Chairman outlined his concerns and questions in a letter sent yesterday. 
   "The Banking Committee takes seriously its responsibility to provide effective oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development," the letter states. "It is incumbent upon us to ensure that taxpayer funds are used properly and legally by the Department. Unfortunately, allegations over the last two years, in addition to findings by the Inspector General of HUD, raise troubling questions about whether the Department has abused taxpayer funds and acted improperly in federal contracting."
   The letter continues: "It is extremely important that the duties of the Department be carried out effectively and within the limits of the law. These allegations, if true, indicate a serious and systemic problem at the senior staff level in effectively and properly carrying out the Department's mission."
