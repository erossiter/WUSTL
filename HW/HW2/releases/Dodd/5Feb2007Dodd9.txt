SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONNECTICUT IMPACT OF BUSH'S PROPOSED BUDGET
  "From Black Hawk helicopters to fighter jet engines, this budget reflects the critically important contributions that Connecticut's manufacturers make to our national security. But the Administration needs to make improving our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities a higher priority - and that means supporting our undersea fleet with the production of two additional submarines per year. This allocation is critical both to Connecticut's defense industry and our nation's security."
