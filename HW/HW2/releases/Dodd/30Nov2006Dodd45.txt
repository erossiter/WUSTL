SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S 'REQUEST FOR INFORMATION' ON FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
"As the author of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), I am concerned about the Department of Labor's 'Request for Information.' Since it's enactment in 1993, FMLA has helped ensure that the more than 50 million Americans who have taken advantage of the program do not have to choose between the family they love and the job they need. The significance of this law and its impact on employees and employers has been documented in the Department of Labor's own surveys. New data is essential and I welcome an opportunity to work with all stakeholders to ensure that the needs of our nation's families are met and the integrity of the Family and Medical Leave Act and it's vital protections are maintained. Any attempt to scale back the protections of FMLA would be a step in the wrong direction for America's families and for America's businesses. It is time to do more for working families - not less."
