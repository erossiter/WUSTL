SEN. DODD REACTS TO NEW LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDING FOR CONNECTICUT
  "As Connecticut is blanketed with more snow and inclement weather, I'm pleased to announce more than $3 million in funding will be awarded through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), to help elderly and low income residents in the state pay their home heating bills. Although it's the end of February, we can expect months more of cold weather and this assistance will help ensure that Connecticut families have the ability to stay warm and safe. However, this funding is still not enough to cover the increased requests for assistance due to record high fuel prices. No family should be forced to brave the cold or make the dangerous choice between food and medicine or heat for lack of financial resources." 
   Dodd, a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and Chairman of its subcommittee on Children and Families, will chair a hearing on March 5 entitled: The Climbing Costs of Heating Homes: Why LIHEAP is Essential.
