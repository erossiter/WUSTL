SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. TALKS WITH IRAN, SYRIA
  "This development is long over due. I hope this is the first step in a more comprehensive diplomatic effort by the Bush Administration to begin to bring all countries in the region together to help stabilize Iraq and begin redeployment out of that country. I'm disheartened to hear, however, that these talks will be strictly about Iraq and not other critical issues, such as terrorism and nuclear weapons programs, which must be addressed and resolved as quickly as possible."
