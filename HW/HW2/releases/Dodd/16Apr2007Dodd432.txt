SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY
  Today's events at Virginia Tech mark a very sad day in American history. My prayers are with the families who lost loved ones.

I am deeply saddened by this unnecessary loss of life, but I believe our nation will find the strength to support those touched by this tragedy."
