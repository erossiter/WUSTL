SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON GAO'S REJECTION OF AIR FORCE'S POSITION IN COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER CONTRACT SELECTION
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) made the following statement in reaction to today's report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that ruled against the Air Force in the contract selection case for the Combat Search and Rescue Helicopter (CSAR-X).  
   "GAO's recent finding to uphold Sikorsky's protest concerning the CSAR-X competition confirms that the process has been flawed from the very beginning. The Air Force's initial estimates for evaluating long term costs have repeatedly been proven wrong by the GAO. It is therefore justifiable that the Air Force now consider Sikorsky's re-submitted bid, based on new evaluation criteria. At this point, the Air Force should simply cancel the earlier contract award and re-bid the entire contract. The workers at Sikorsky build the best helicopters in the world, and they should be allowed to compete fairly under accurate conditions."
