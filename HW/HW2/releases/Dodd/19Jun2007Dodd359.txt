SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINANCE COMMITTEE ADOPTION OF FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLE TAX CREDITS
  Statement of Senator Dodd on Finance Committee Adoption of Fuel-Efficient Vehicle Tax Credits: 
  "Strengthening America's energy security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and addressing the threat of global climate change will require transforming our transportation sector. Promoting a new generation of fuel-efficient vehicles is critical to this effort. Toward that end, I wrote last week to Chairman Baucus requesting that the Senate Finance Committee extend the alternative motor vehicle tax credits. That is why I am pleased that the Finance Committee acted today to support additional tax credits for fuel-efficient alternative motor vehicles and plug-in hybrids. I commend Chairman Baucus and the other members of the Committee for recognizing the importance of encouraging manufacturers to continue investing in innovative technologies, and for enabling Americans to make cleaner, greener choices that advance our nation's economic, energy, and environmental interests. I am hopeful these important alternative vehicle tax incentives will be retained throughout the legislative process, and ultimately enacted into law. I will continue to press to ensure that result."
