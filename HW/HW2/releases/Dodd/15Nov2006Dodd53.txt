SEN. DODD EXPRESSES NEED FOR BIPARTISAN AGENDA, WELCOMES BANKING COMMITTEE OF 110TH CONGRESS
After initiating a meeting yesterday with current Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), to pledge his commitment to working in a bipartisan fashion during the 110th Congress to help solve America's pressing problems, incoming Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today welcomed new committee members to the panel. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced that Sen. Dodd will become Chairman of the Committee when Democrats assume leadership of the Senate in January and the new committee assignments.  
 "I intend to try to work in a bipartisan way to make our nation more prosperous and more secure," said Dodd. "This is a tremendously important committee and I look forward to working with these new members and all of the Republicans on the committee to move our nation forward. I also commend Senator Shelby and out-going Senator Sarbanes for their leadership on the committee."
 The meeting yesterday between an outgoing current Republican Chairman and incoming Democratic Chairman was one of the first since the November 7th Election. 
 New Democratic appointees to the Banking Committee include Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Senator-Elect Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Senator-Elect Bob Casey (D-PA), and Senator-Elect Jon Tester (D-MT).
