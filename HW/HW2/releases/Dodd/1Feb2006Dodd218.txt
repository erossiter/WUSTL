SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE $12,500 FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY INITIATIVES AT EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY
  Eastern Connecticut State University (ECSU) will receive $12,565 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The funding will be used for fire prevention and safety initiatives. 
   "The best way to protect people from the devastating effects of fire is to prevent them from occurring in the first place," said Dodd. "This assistance will help keep students, faculty, and firefighters at ECSU safer. The Bush Administration needs to do more to ensure fire prevention and safety assistance reaches all those who need it." 
   "This funding is essential to the preparedness of the University so that it will be able to deal with any catastrophes that may strike, whether natural or man-made. First responders are our first line of defense against catastrophes, and we need to ensure they are fully equipped and trained," said Senator Joe Lieberman.
   This award was made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 331 grants for a total of more than $32.5 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
