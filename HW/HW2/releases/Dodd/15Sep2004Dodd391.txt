SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $250,000 IN GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Four Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $246,748 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  
   "We already know that firefighters are well-equipped with bravery. We see it each and every day, and we remember and honor the gallant heroism on 9/11 that no amount of fire or destruction could destroy that terrible day," said Dodd. "However, we need to ensure that firefighters have the equipment and training needed to ensure their own safety and the safety of communities. These grants are a small step in the right direction but I intend to fight tooth and nail to ensure that the Administration does more to adequately address our firefighters' needs."
   "As we mourn those who were lost on September 11 three years ago, let us not forget the extraordinarily courageous performance of firefighters on that terrible day," Lieberman said. "But let us also not forget that firefighters risk their lives every day to ensure the safety of all Connecticuters. We must reciprocate by providing these brave first responders with the resources, training and equipment they need to protect our communities. This funding is a step in the right direction."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   * South End Volunteer Fire Department: $76,464
  * Falls Village Volunteer Fire Dept. & Ambulance Service: $133,965 
  * Sherman Volunteer Fire Department: $7,799
  * Thompson Ind. Fire Association No. 1 Inc.: $28,520 
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed close to 194 grants for a total of more than $18.3 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
