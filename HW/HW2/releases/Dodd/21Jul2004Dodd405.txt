CONFERENCE COMMITTEE APPROVES FINAL DOLLARS FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
  The House and Senate's Conference Committee gave final approval to Defense Appropriations Bill today, which will help ensure that U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are outfitted with the quality resources they need to perform their missions while reinforcing Connecticut workers' role in our nation's defense. The bill is expected to be approved by the House and Senate and sent to the President for signature by the end of this week. 
   "We already know that our troops and sailors are the best in the world. This measure will continue to ensure that their weaponry - which in no small way is made in Connecticut - is second to none," said Dodd. "And though this measure may not be perfect, it helps ensure that our service men and women have the military muscle to prevail in any conflict and reinforces the critically important role that Connecticut defense workers play in our national defense."
   "This bill gives Connecticut's military men and women, and their families, the resources they need and deserve for cutting-edge equipment and a good quality of life, today and tomorrow," Lieberman said. "We are proud of the members of our armed forces serving on the front lines in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world - including our reservists and National Guard. We can also be proud of this legislation, which sends a strong message of support to our service men and women who continue to keep us safe."
