SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL GRANT FOR SOUTH WINDHAM FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. announced today that the South Windham Fire Company will receive $68,950 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for operations and safety programs. 
   "South Windham is fortunate to have such a dedicated fire department to prevent fires from occurring and to protect the citizens of this small town from danger," said Dodd. "These individuals put their lives on the line for their communities, and it is of the utmost importance that they have the tools and funding necessary to perform these noble and important jobs." 
   "Our communities rely on fire fighters to protect them in times of crisis, and our first responders rely on the federal government to provide them with the equipment and training they need to safely and effectively do their jobs," Lieberman said. "The fire safety grants announced today will give South Windham fire fighters a leg up in obtaining the resources necessary to protect the citizens of their community." 
   These awards were made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to reduce critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER Act and FIRE Act were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 349 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
