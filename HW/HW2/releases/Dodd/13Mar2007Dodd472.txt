SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FORECLOSURES AND PREDATORY LENDING
  "Due to predatory lenders and regulatory failures, large numbers of American homeowners are facing the terrible prospect of foreclosure and the loss of their homes. The Federal government has a dual obligation both to protect consumers from abusive lending practices going forward and to work to ensure that Americans who have been victimized by abusive products and practices are able to keep their homes and with them, their piece of the American dream. I am considering a number of options, including legislation, to accomplish both of these objectives."
