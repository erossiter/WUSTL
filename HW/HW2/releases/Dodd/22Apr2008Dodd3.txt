SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CELEBRATION OF EARTH DAY
  "Our beautiful and diverse planet is the greatest gift we can give to future generations, and Earth Day should serve as a reminder to each and every one of us that we all have a part to play in preserving and protecting this treasure. There are countless simple steps, such as turning off the lights when leaving a room, switching to compact fluorescent bulbs in your home, and choosing energy-efficient models when replacing old home appliances, that we can all take in our daily lives to make sure we leave our world in better shape than we found it. 
   "Some steps won't be as simple, but they are critically important. For the sake of not only our environment, but also our economy and our national security, we must put an end to our dependence on foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable energy sources that we can cultivate here at home using the skills of talented American workers."
