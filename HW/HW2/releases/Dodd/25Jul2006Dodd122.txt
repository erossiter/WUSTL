SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN SEEK TO PROTECT EIGHTMILE RIVER
  Acknowledging the importance of preserving and protecting southeastern Connecticut's Eightmile River, Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) today announced that they have proposed legislation which would assign the federal Wild and Scenic status to the river. The bill asks the Secretary of the Interior to designate Eightmile River as Wild and Scenic, following a comprehensive study highlighting the river's intrinsic and environmental value. A similar measure was proposed in the House by Rep. Rob Simmons (CT-2).  
   "The Eightmile River is a wonderful environmental treasure," said Dodd. "This measure can help ensure that its lasting beauty and rich history are protected and preserved for generations to come."
   "This is good news for Connecticut's past and it's future," said Lieberman. "By preserving this scenic waterway we will assure that more of Connecticut's natural beauty will be around for future generations to enjoy." 
   Designation as a Wild and Scenic river would preserve one of the most diverse and thriving ecosystems in the lower Connecticut River Valley, as well as protect the free flow of the river. In considering Wild and Scenic status, the Secretary of Interior has reviewed the river's ecological, scenic, and historical contribution, as well as the long-term dedication of the community to continue preservation efforts. Local towns including Salem, East Haddam, and Lyme have developed and voted in favor of a plan to manage the continued conservation of the river.
