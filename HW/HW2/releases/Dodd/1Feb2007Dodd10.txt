SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON OPPOSITION TO WARNER-LEVIN LEGISLATION
  "I strongly oppose the Warner-Levin legislation; it is essentially an endorsement of the status quo, an endorsement I simply cannot make in light of the dire circumstances in Iraq, and the need for meaningful action now. 
   "The Warner-Levin legislation does not explicitly oppose the escalation, it doesn't contemplate the phased redeployment from Iraq and all but gives the 'power of the purse' to the Executive Branch. 
   "And in refusing to endorse one of the most critical elements of the Baker Hamilton plan - namely the engagement of all of Iraq's neighbors in a regional effort to bring peace and stability to Iraq - the Warner-Levin approach ignores the important diplomatic efforts that must be made to bring stability to the region.
   "These aren't just minor quibbles over words, but a fundamental difference between what the legislation proposes and what I believe needs to be done to fundamentally change the flawed policy that the President continues to cling to. This is not the time for Senators to express our opinions only; this is the time for meaningful action."
