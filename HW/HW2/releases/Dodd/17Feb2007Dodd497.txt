SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING CLOTURE VOTE
  "It is time that this Congress moves beyond debating non-binding resolutions about the surge. It is time for the Congress to debate how much longer and under what circumstances we are prepared to support funding for a continued U.S. presence in Iraq.
   "That is the debate the American people want to hear, that is the debate our courageous and dedicated troops deserve."
