SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR TWO CONNECTICUT FIRE DEPARTMENTS
Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today that the Canterbury and Killingworth Volunteer Fire Companies will receive $106,799 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funding will be used for operations and safety.  
 "The volunteer fire departments in Canterbury and Killingworth are crucial elements of these small towns," said Dodd. "Volunteers in these departments work to protect their communities from fire and other dangers, and we should provide them the resources necessary to continue their honorable and critical work." 
 "The fire safety grants announced today will greatly benefit the citizens of Canterbury and Killingworth by providing their first responders with the resources they need to protect their communities and educate the public on important safety measures," Lieberman said.
 The Canterbury Volunteer Fire Company will receive $44,555 and the Killingworth Volunteer Fire Company will receive $62,244. 
 These awards were made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
 Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to reduce critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER Act and FIRE Act were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 349 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
