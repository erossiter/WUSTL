SEN. DODD TO CO-SPONSOR INTERNET FREEDOM PRESERVATION ACT
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Net Neutrality and the Internet Freedom Preservation Act: 
   "There is no denying that the internet has revolutionized the way that Americans work, communicate, and access information. With more Americans accessing broadband and other high speed technology, the internet will certainly continue to serve as an important tool for technological innovation. 
   "Unfortunately, in 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) eliminated regulations that preserve openness on the Internet. I disagree with that action; I support the principle of "net neutrality." Since its inception, the internet has been an open system and this openness has proved to be an effective facilitator of market innovations and economic growth. Limiting or restricting access may sacrifice future opportunities for further innovation.
   "Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) have introduced S. 2917, the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, a bill that preserves network neutrality. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation."
