SEN. DODD ASKS PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION TO LOOK INTO AMERICAN VELVET MATTER IMMEDIATELY
  After learning today that American Velvet Company is seeking to terminate its pension plan for former employees, Sen. Dodd today wrote to the executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requesting that the matter be looked into immediately. 
   The text of the letter follows.
   April 25, 2006
   Mr. Bradley D. Belt
  Executive Director
  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
  1220 K Street
  Washington, D.C. 20005-4026
   Dear Mr. Belt:
   I am writing to you about the news today in Stonington, Connecticut, that the American Velvet Company is seeking to terminate the pension plan for over one thousand of its former employees as of June 30, 2006. A published report indicated that the company is now in the process of turning the pension plan over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).
   This is a very troubling and shocking development for many of my constituents in Connecticut. While I understand American Velvet has informed former employees that the company is no longer able to fund their pension plan, these former employees are justifiably very concerned about maintaining their current benefit levels under any new scenario. Some current employees are also concerned about their ability to accrue benefits after June 30, 2006.
   I ask that the PBGC look into this matter immediately. I want to make sure my constituents are being treated fairly--and will continue to be treated fairly--during this process. I will also appreciate the PBGC making sure that all those affected at the American Velvet Company receive an accurate, detailed, and prompt account of their pension plan benefits.
   Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter. I look forward to your early response.
   Sincerely,
   CHRISTOPHER J. DODD
  United States Senator
