SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $300,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Fire Departments in Morris and Wallingford will receive a total of $318,738 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Thursday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
   "Cities and towns throughout Connecticut are in desperate need of resources and equipment to help their firefighters better do their jobs and keep families safe," said Dodd. "This funding is a step in the right direction toward getting life-saving equipment to our first responders, but the Administration needs to do more to get critically important resources into the hands of fire departments in Connecticut and throughout the country. We cannot put a price tag on their safety."
   "Connecticut firefighters are part of the brave cadre of first responders who put their own lives on the line every day to protect our communities," Lieberman said. "We must continue to do all we can to provide them with adequate resources, training and equipment so that they have tools they need to carry out their critical responsibilities."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   * Morris Volunteer Fire Department Inc. $ 93,648
  * Wallingford Department of Fire & Emergency Service $ 225,090
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 203 grants for a total of more than $19.3 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
