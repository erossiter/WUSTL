SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIRING OF EIGHT U.S. ATTORNEYS GENERAL
  "If the allegations are proven true that the firing of eight U.S. attorneys was motivated by political considerations, I find that unacceptable."
   "The Congress needs to fully exercise its oversight authority and look into these allegations. Time and again, the Administration has demonstrated that they will not hesitate to put politics over principle. 
    "Anyone found responsible for these egregious lapses in judgment should be immediately dismissed. The time for excuses is over. It is time for responsibility and accountability to return to the White House."
