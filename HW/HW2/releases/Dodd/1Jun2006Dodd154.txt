SEN. DODD SPEAKS OUT ON IRANIAN NUCLEAR CRISIS
  "For more than three years the Bush administration has refused to directly engage Iran on this and other foreign policy concerns posed by Iranian behavior and intentions. Secretary Rice's offer to negotiate as part of the EU-3 effort is long overdue. While I welcome that gesture, it is much too narrowly focused to produce the major diplomatic breakthrough that is called for if the international community is to defuse the challenges that Iran poses for regional peace and stability relative to its nuclear weapons ambitions, Iraq, and support for international terrorism. If the Administration feels the sense of urgency that this matter deserves, then it ought to make a more serious proposal that will get both parties to the table as soon as possible. The alternative is that we will continue to remain at this same impasse. Every day that goes by without resolving the Iranian nuclear impasse is a day closer to Iran developing nuclear weapons capabilities. That is deeply disturbing."
