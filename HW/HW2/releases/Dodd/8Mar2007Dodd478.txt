SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that more than $235,000 dollars in federal grants were awarded to Connecticut fire departments. The grants were made possible through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   "Firefighters can be counted on whenever our communities are in danger," said Dodd. "These dedicated men and women must be able to depend on their equipment and their training to complete each mission, and it is our duty to provide them with the necessary funding to make this possible." 
   "Our communities rely on first responders for basic protection against emergencies large and small," said Lieberman. "These grants will help train and equip the men and women who keep us safe from harm on a daily basis and who are also on the front lines of the war against terrorism here at home."
   The following fire departments were awarded federal grants:
   Crystal Lake - $36,337
   Watertown - $9,000
   City of Danbury - $190,400
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 359 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
