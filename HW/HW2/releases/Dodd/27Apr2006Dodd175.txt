SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON INTRODUCTION OF UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT
  "Our nation stands for the principle of equal justice for all. Yet for far too long, many Americans have been denied equal justice - and many despicable criminals have not been held accountable," said Sen. Chris Dodd. "I'm hopeful this measure will help bring to justice people who perpetrated heinous crimes sometimes because of racial hatred. It cannot bring back and make whole those who suffered and died by a racist's criminal hand. But it can at least reaffirm our nation's commitment to seek the truth and make equal justice a reality."
