SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES DETAILS OF MEASURE AIMED AT PROTECTING CONNECTICUT COMMUTERS
  In the wake of recent terrorist bombings on the public transit system in Madrid and the need to better secure Connecticut and our nation's own transit systems, Sen.  
 Dodd today announced details of a new measure aimed at improving public transportation security. Nearly 140,000 people travel to and from New York City on the New Haven Line each day and 40,000 board the Metro-North each day in Stamford to go to work in New York City. 
   "It's vitally important that we put the safety of Connecticut commuters on the right track," said Dodd. "In many ways, the impact of a terrorist attack on a mass transit system strikes at the very essence of the freedoms which all of us hold dear. Inherent in the idea of public transportation are notions of openness, accessibility, safety, mobility, and opportunity. I intend to continue to fight to make our transit and transportation infrastructure more secure."
   Dodd is a cosponsor of the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention (PTTP) Act, which passed the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee last Thursday. The PTTP Act would authorize $5.2 billion for public transit security grants. The measure would create a needs-based grant program within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to identify risks and vulnerabilities within transit systems across the country. 
   The PTTP Act would require DHS to determine security improvement priorities for each individual transit system which is at risk for terrorist attack and then provide grants to those systems with the greatest needs. The bill also provides funding for security training for employees, public awareness campaigns, canine patrols, tunnel security upgrades, and chemical and explosive detection systems.
