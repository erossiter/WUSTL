SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DISMISSAL OF KHADR CASE
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on dismissal of Khadr case: 
   "This decision demonstrates the egregious flaws of the Military Commissions Act, and makes the point once again that Congress must act immediately to change this law. The current system of prosecuting enemy combatants is not only inefficient and ineffective, it is also hurting America's moral standing in the world and corroding the foundation of freedom upon which our nation was built. There is too much at stake - our nation's security and standing in the world - for us to wait for another one of these poorly executed cases to make the necessary changes to this system. I hope my colleagues in Congress will join me now in the fight to restore America's moral authority in developing a tough but fair system of bringing terrorists to justice."
