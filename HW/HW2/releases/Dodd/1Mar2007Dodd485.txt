SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT IN HONOR OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH
  "The United States would not be the great nation it is today were it not for the contributions of countless women throughout our history.  
   The influence of these trailblazers can be seen everywhere around us, from Capitol Hill to corporate boardrooms; from operating rooms to classrooms; and from playing fields to performance halls. It is only right that we honor the achievements of women by celebrating Women's History Month.
   We must never forget the sacrifices women have made to strengthen our nation for all, often in the face of great adversity. I encourage all Americans to take time this month to honor the women who have changed the course of our nation's history so that their accomplishments may continue to inspire future generations."
