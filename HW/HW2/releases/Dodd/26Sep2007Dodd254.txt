SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON KYL-LIEBERMAN AMENDMENT
  "I cannot support the Kyl-Lieberman amendment on Iran. To do so could give this president a green light to act recklessly and endanger US national security. We learned in the run up to the Iraq war that seemingly nonbinding language passed by this Senate can have profound consequences. We need the president to use robust diplomacy to address concerns with Iran, not the language in this amendment that the president can point to if he decides to draw this country into another disastrous war of choice."
