SENS. DODD, MCCONNELL RESOLUTION TO HONOR ROSA PARKS WITH STATUE IN U.S. CAPITOL PASSES
  Sens. Christopher Dodd and Mitch McConnell announced today that their resolution to honor Rosa Parks with the creation and placement of a statue in the United States Capitol passed the Senate today by unanimous consent.  
   Rosa Parks will be the first African American to be honored with a statue in the nation's Capitol if the measure is enacted. 
   "Placing a statue in the U.S. Capitol is a fitting tribute to one of America's great heroes," said McConnell. "Rosa Parks' act of civil disobedience was the spark that ignited the modern civil-rights movement. This statue will immortalize her life and will enable future generations to remember this brave woman and the role she played in changing the course of history. I am honored to have worked with my colleagues to make this happen." 
   "Rosa Parks was an extraordinary woman. By her solitary action, she proved that one person, through non-violent actions, can change the course of history," said Dodd. "It is important that we preserve and honor her legacy for future generations of Americans. I would hope that this overwhelming Senate vote will spur the House to enact this resolution quickly."
