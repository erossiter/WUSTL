SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON OSAMA BIN LADEN TAPE
  "Osama bin Laden is a ruthless murderer and the U.S. must not rest until he is either captured or killed. This tape doesn't change that. It merely proves, yet again, that the Bush administration's preoccupation with Iraq has diverted our attention from what it claims is our primary focus, namely to combat terrorist threats to the US."
