SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $3.5 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT EDUCATION INITIATIVES
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today announced that the Connecticut Department of Higher Education and the University of Connecticut will receive more than $3.5 million in Gear-Up Project grants to help prepare students for college.  
 The Connecticut Department of Higher Education will receive $3 million to assist struggling schools improve their state assessment test scores. The University of Connecticut will receive $543,960 in funding to partner with the New Haven School District to yield higher graduation rates and to increase access to post-secondary education. 
   "Education - like a bridge - can help students access greater opportunities and success," said Dodd. "This assistance can hopefully ensure that more Connecticut students attain the benefits of higher education." 
   "These Gear-Up Projects will allow Connecticut schools to provide the necessary tools for their students to succeed in a fast-paced, competitive work world filled with cutting-edge technologies," Lieberman said. "Programs investing in secondary education will pay in dividends, as they allow many more students to benefit from all that higher education has to offer." 
   The Gear-Up Project Grants, distributed by the Department of Education, initially focused on mathematics education due to research suggesting that students who complete upper-level math courses at the high school level are better prepared for post-secondary education and are more likely to graduate from college. The current initiative will continue to emphasize the importance of math, but will also expand its focus for the purpose of improving overall academic achievement. Gear-Up initiatives will work with schools that have had low student performance levels in order to cultivate an environment for students, parents, and teachers that promotes college education.
