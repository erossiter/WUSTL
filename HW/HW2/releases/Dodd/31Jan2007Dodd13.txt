SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL GRANT FOR WARREN FIREFIGHTERS
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) announced today that the Warren Fire Department was awarded a federal grant of $29,126 to improve operations and firefighter safety. This award was made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration.  
   "The Warren Fire Department plays a crucial role in the safety of the community," said Dodd. "First responders bear great responsibility and risk, and it is our duty to make sure that they have the means and equipment necessary to perform their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
   "Firefighters are the first line of defense in times of emergency, and we must ensure that they are properly prepared to respond to any incident. This grant represents a continued effort to give our first responders the tools they need to protect our communities, including the town of Warren," said Lieberman.
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 356 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities. Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been tireless advocates for increasing federal funding for first responders.
