SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DUBAI PORT ANNOUNCEMENT
  "I want to see the fine print and details of this announcement. But if in fact, it turns out to be true, it is good news. The Bush Administration was clearly asleep at the switch and never fully and adequately examined the security implications of this deal. The fact that they've so badly bungled the oversight of this deal should hammer home the need to refocus our energy and attention on better protecting our nation's ports. The Administration also needs to involve the Congress at the beginning of the process and not as an after thought. They have paid a heavy price because they blind sided the Congress and the American people.  
   "I have introduced a bill that will help ensure this doesn't occur in the future. Among other things it will help correct current problems by increasing accountability and transparency and by creating a role for the intelligence community in national security decision making. Neither the CIA Director nor the Director of National Intelligence was part of the entity that rubber stamped this deal. That needs to change. My bill also requires that the Congress be kept informed every step of the way.
   "It goes without saying that I also intend to continue to fight to ensure that more resources go toward the security of our nation's ports. I hope this debacle spurs the Bush Administration to provide more resources, attention, and oversight when it comes to our nation's ports. The American public deserves no less."
