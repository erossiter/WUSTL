SEN. DODD ENCOURAGES ROBUST DIPLOMACY AT ANNAPOLIS CONFERENCE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following remarks in anticipation of tomorrow's Middle East peace summit in Annapolis, Maryland.  
   "Despite coming nearly six years late, it is my hope that tomorrow's summit in Annapolis can bring us one step closer towards Arab-Israeli peace. A safe and secure Jewish state, recognized by all of its Arab neighbors, alongside a viable and independent Palestinian state is the only solution to this conflict. I strongly encourage all those attending tomorrow's conference to vigorously engage with one another to begin the process of seeking a final settlement to this seemingly intractable conflict, and to end the suffering of millions of people."
