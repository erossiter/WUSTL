SEN. DODD CELEBRATES RED SOX WORLD SERIES VICTORY AT WHITE HOUSE CEREMONY
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today honored the Red Sox for their 2007 World Series championship at a White House ceremony along with President Bush and other members of Congress.  
   "Today is a proud day for the members of Red Sox Nation. As a native New Englander and a lifelong Red Sox fan, I didn't think things could get any better after the 2004 championship, but the team certainly proved me wrong last October! I was honored to join the Red Sox organization for today's ceremony at the White House, and I hope we'll all meet there again at this time next year to celebrate another Red Sox World Series victory."
