SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF WAR IN IRAQ
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today released the following statement on the fifth anniversary of the War in Iraq: 
   "On the 5th Anniversary of the War in Iraq, all Americans, regardless of their feelings about this war, can be proud of the brave men and women who have served our country honorably, many of whom have made the ultimate sacrifice. We owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude, and their service will never be forgotten.
   "It is unfair - even unconscionable - to continue to call on their service without a clear plan for Iraq. The question now is, 'where do we go from here?'
   "The President's approach has brought almost no political progress. As the 'surge' comes to an end, and with Afghanistan posing a serious threat to national security, we are still left with no strategy for how to move forward in Iraq. It is time to develop a responsible and comprehensive strategy for how to move forward in Iraq and address our other pressing national security concerns around the world."
