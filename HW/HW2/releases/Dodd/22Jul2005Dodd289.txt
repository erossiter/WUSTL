SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN HAIL COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that Connecticut could share in more than $22 million in new federal funds to help improve rail transit and promote affordable housing and community development in Connecticut and across the country. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the funds today as part of the annual appropriations bill that covers the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2006.  
   Included in the spending package is $3.77 billion for Community Development Block Grants to states. The CDBG program, which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was created in 1974. CDBG provides resources for community development projects that benefit low- and moderate-income residents including support for local health and senior services, housing rehabilitation, and improvements to parks and public facilities. President Bush announced earlier this year that he had plans to eliminate funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program in his FY 06 budget and fold it into a new block grant, called 'Strengthening America's Communities,' within the Commerce Department. Sens. Dodd and Lieberman, along with other congressional colleagues, successfully fought to keep the CDBG program alive. 
   "Connecticut has some of the best housing, transit and community development efforts in the country and this funding will give them an opportunity to grow, improve and help more people," said Sen. Chris Dodd. "I'm pleased to have fought to keep this funding available to give communities a helping hand to improve neighborhoods, provide affordable housing and keep our parks and public spaces open for Connecticut families to enjoy. This funding will also modernize and improve our transit systems and eliminate congestion on our roads." 
   "The President's community development cuts are part of a plan he's called 'Strengthening America's Communities'" Lieberman said. "But, as you know all too well, these cuts would do just the opposite. By shortchanging and possibly bankrupting vital programs these cuts would weaken our communities, stunting the growth of Connecticut's cities, and that's why I will continue to work to increase funding for the CDGB program. I am pleased that through restoring community development funds and funding other key state projects this bill helps support diverse and significant redevelopment and modernization initiatives. Projects like these will help to keep our commuters on the railways, and our communities a strong and vital part of Connecticut's character."
