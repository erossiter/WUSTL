SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY
  Dr. Martin Luther King's leadership inspired equality, change and peace at a time when our nation was in grave need of a strong moral compass to guide us. While we take today to formally commemorate his contributions to our country and the world, Dr. King's legacy touches American lives each and every day and lives on in our continual effort to ensure that this nation is a land of liberty and opportunity for all. I hope that all Americans work to build upon this legacy in order to honor Dr. King's vision and dream for America.
