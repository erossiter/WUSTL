SEN. DODD ON WHITE HOUSE ASSERTION DEEMING WATERBOARDING LEGAL: ALWAYS WRONG, ALWAYS ILLEGAL
  "The statement by a White House spokesperson yesterday asserting that waterboarding is legal and President Bush could authorize the CIA to continue using this technique demonstrates a staggering disregard for the rule of law. Let me be clear: there is no such thing as "simulated" drowning. When a person is strapped to a board and water is poured into their mouth and nose with no way to get air, that is drowning; that is torture. The President must repudiate this statement and make clear that all forms of torture--including waterboarding--are always wrong and always illegal."
