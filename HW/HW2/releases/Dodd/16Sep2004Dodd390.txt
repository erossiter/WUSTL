SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES CONNECTICUT WILL RECEIVE $13 MILLION TO PROTECT CONNECTICUT FROM THREAT OF BIOTERRORISM
  The Connecticut Department of Public Health will receive $13,337,305 for preparedness and response measures to bioterrorism, outbreaks of infectious disease, and other public health threats and emergencies, Sen.  
 Chris Dodd announced today at the South Fire Station in New London.
   "Our state tragically has felt the wounds of bioterrorism. And though the scars are slow to heal, it is clear that we need to constantly strive to better innoculate ourselves from future danger," said Dodd. "This assistance - like a shield - can help do exactly that by providing the people on the front lines in our state with the tools they need to better protect the people of Connecticut."
   The funds, allocated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will help promote better collaborative efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to respond to public health bioterrorism emergencies. Specifically, this grant will improve emergency preparedness coordination by ensuring first responders and health workers have the ability to communicate before, during, and after an emergency and are provided with the proper education and training. Emergency response agencies will also use this funding to develop a system that will help communicate with the public in the event of an emergency. In addition to ensuring seamless coordination efforts, portions of the funding will be directed to local health departments, and other health care agencies to adequately supply them with the necessary equipment, supplies, vaccines and other preventive agents needed for an appropriate emergency response.
