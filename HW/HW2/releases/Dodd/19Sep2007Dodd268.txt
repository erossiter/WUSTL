SEN. DODD CALLS ON HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE NOT TO SURRENDER ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH
  Today, Senator Dodd called on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to stay strong on children's health by ensuring that the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) maintains the compromise reached by House and Senate Democrats. The compromise called for reducing pediatric exclusivity from 6 months to 4.5 months.  
   "We've reached a terrific deal that balances costs to consumers and benefits to children," said Dodd. "The results of drug studies conducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act have been a tremendous benefit to millions of children and we must not jeopardize the future success of this program. The compromise reached between the House and Senate Democrats will ensure the continued success of this program. Similarly, proposals to reduce the length of exclusivity across-the-board for all drugs, not just for those drugs with extremely high sales, or blockbusters, must be rejected because it is children's health that will suffer from fewer drug studies being conducted." 
   Dodd has long fought for issues pertaining to children's health. Earlier this year, the Senate voted to maintain a reduction of exclusivity from 6 months to 3 months for blockbuster drugs and Senator Dodd spent the last several months brokering a compromise with House democrats of 4.5 months. Dodd believes it is essential that the Committee retain this compromise in its final bill as well as eliminate the sunset in the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Recent data has shown that drug companies received up to 73 times the amount they spent to conduct pediatric clinical trials with 6 months of exclusivity. For blockbuster drugs, that is simply too high a price for consumers to pay.
