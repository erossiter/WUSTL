SEN. DODD ENCOURAGES USE OF CLEANER, MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES IN LETTER TO FINANCE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) sent a letter today to Sens. Max Baucus (D-MT) and Charles Grassley (R-IA), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, urging the Committee to include an extension of the alternative motor vehicle tax credits when the Committee marks up the energy tax bill that the Senate is expected to consider next week. The tax credits will provide an incentive to consumers who purchase fuel cell, advanced lean burn, hybrid, or alternative fuel vehicles. Senator Dodd has been an outspoken advocate for higher fuel economy and reduction of the use of foreign oil. 
   "For our environment and national security, we must reduce our dependence on oil," said Dodd. "The tax credits for hybrids, fuel cell cars, and other efficient vehicles help assure manufacturers that investments in technologies to improve fuel economy make good business sense, and make it easier for American consumers to make choices that advance our economic and energy security and protect the environment."
