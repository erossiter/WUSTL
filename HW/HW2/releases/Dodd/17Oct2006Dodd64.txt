SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON KEEP CONNECTICUT MOVING SUMMIT
  "Keep Connecticut Moving and other conversations like these provide vital direction to the future development of Connecticut's transportation infrastructure, as well as the state's economy and quality of life. I remain committed to supporting transportation networks that achieve a safe and efficient balance between various modes of transportation. This balance is critical to reducing road congestion, improving transit service, and reducing transportation costs - three challenges that many parts of our country and particularly Connecticut face. Along with my colleagues in the delegation, I stand ready to work to ensure that Connecticut's entire transportation network - its highways, railways, transitways, airports, and seaports - receive adequate support from Congress. This support is essential so that not only does it meet expected rises in inflation and maintenance costs, but it also allows for vital new initiatives that make Connecticut's transportation network sounder, safer, and more efficient."
