SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FED INTEREST RATE DECISION
  Statement of Senator Dodd on Fed Interest Rate Decision: 
  "Americans have seen their financial security badly shaken by recent economic turmoil in the housing markets. Far too many have lost their homes, causing tremendous hardship for them, and increasing a sense of uncertainty in our financial markets. My hope is that today's decision and statement by the Fed can help provide stability in our economy. During my meeting last month with the Fed Chairman and Treasury Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke assured me that he'll use every tool at his disposal to act to keep our markets working and for businesses and consumers to have the funds necessary for them to prosper. It is vital that we remain vigilant in addressing this crisis."
