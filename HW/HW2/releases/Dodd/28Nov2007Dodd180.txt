SEN. DODD SAYS PAKISTANI PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF'S DECISION TO RESIGN FROM MILITARY POST RIGHT THING TO DO, URGES END TO EMERGENCY RULE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following statement on President Pervez Musharraf resigning as chief of army staff  
   "I am pleased President Musharraf has listened to the will of the Pakistani people and resigned his military post. This is a step forward in the direction of democracy and hopefully will help revive Pakistan's political progress. However, there are still many steps that must be made. Since emergency rule was declared earlier this month, thousands of political activists have been arrested and a media blackout has ensued. I urge President Musharraf to continue in the direction of democracy, end emergency rule, and holding fair and free elections."
