SEN. DODD URGES SENATE, HOUSE COLLEAGUES TO KEEP PROMISE TO SOLDIERS
  Sen. Dodd this week urged the Chairman and Ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sens.  
 John Warner (R-VA) and Carl Levin (D-MI), to protect the amendment he authored that would reimburse soldiers for critical equipment purchased with personal and private funds for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. In his letter, Dodd asked his colleagues to resist any efforts to weaken his amendment by giving the Defense Department the option of ignoring its mandate.
   "American troops are defending our nation's most priceless and treasured gift - freedom. It is absolutely unconscionable that this Administration would nickel and dime them by asking them to dig into their wallets to pay for adequate equipment and gear. It would simply be unacceptable for the Administration and congressional leaders to strip out or water down this important provision."
   The Senate and House have passed separate versions of national defense bills and are currently working out their differences. Dodd's letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member referenced reports that some soldiers have been forced to purchase their own personal body armor, hydration equipment, and even vehicle protection as they deployed to places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
   Those reports inspired Dodd to sponsor an amendment to the defense bill which was approved 91-0 despite Bush Administration objections. The bill would require the Department of Defense to reimburse soldiers who spend private funds to purchase bullet-proof vest and other items to protect them n the battlefield. Dodd's letter emphasized that a unanimous vote in June sent a strong message to the American people that the United States Congress would not stand by and have U.S. troops and their loved ones tap their own funds to purchase critical supplies.
