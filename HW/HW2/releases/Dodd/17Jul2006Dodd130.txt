SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ESCALATING SITUATION IN LEBANON
  "The situation in Lebanon continues to be dangerous and worrisome. I urge the international community to follow through on the decision taken by the G-8 leaders to bring about as quickly as possible and end to the conflict. In the interim, the State Department and U.S. Embassy in Lebanon must act quickly to put in place an evacuation plan to ensure that the thousands of American citizens who are visiting or reside in Lebanon can be safely evacuated out of harm's way.
