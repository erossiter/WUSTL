SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF VETERAN'S GRAVE MARKER BENEFIT
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on committee passage of Veteran's Grave Marker Benefit: 
   "Veterans who have bravely served their country deserve to have their sacrifices honored and remembered. For many years, we correctly granted the Department of Veterans' Affairs the power to provide grave markers to veterans' families commemorating their military service regardless of where they were laid to rest, and this bill will ensure that veterans who passed away in the 1990s are afforded the same benefit. I am very pleased that Chairman Akaka and my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs have passed this bill as part of a larger veterans' benefits package, and I look forward to its eventual passage by the full Senate and its enactment into law."
   Senator Dodd's legislation, S. 1334, would close a gap not addressed by previous legislation by allowing families of all veterans, including those who passed away between November 1, 1990 and September 10, 2001, to place official markers at their gravesites. The bill was passed today by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs as part of its consideration of S. 1163, the Blinded Veterans Paired Organ Act of 2007.
