SENS. IEBERMAN SECURE NEARLY $5.3 MILLION FOR CONNECTICUT INITIATIVES
  Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today praised the Senate's final adoption of the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill. Working with Senate colleagues on the appropriations committee, Dodd and Lieberman successfully secured almost $5.3 million for a variety of initiatives aimed at improving health care, education, employment, and the arts in Connecticut. The bill invests $150 million in education, college affordability, health care, biomedical research, and job training across the country.
   "The funding provided by this bill helps seed important projects that ultimately will bear fruit in years to come," said Dodd. "It helps provide needed resources to ultimately strengthen and improve the quality of life for people and families in the state of Connecticut and across the nation. Providing the residents of Connecticut with quality health care, education, and access to the arts is something we can all agree on. I hope President Bush shares this view and will not prevent this important bill from becoming law." 
   "These federal dollars reflect the critical needs of Connecticut residents, said Lieberman. "I am proud to support funding for educational programs, hospitals, and health care providers across our state. I urge the President to sign this important bill into law."
