SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON HURRICANE KATRINA
  Senator Dodd's Statement on Hurricane Katrina
   The people of Connecticut, along with all Americans, send their deepest condolences to the residents of the Gulf Coast, who continue to suffer the reverberating effects of Hurricane Katrina.  
 While we don't yet know the full extent of the devastation, it is clear that those Americans need the help of all Americans in the difficult days ahead. The President and the Congressional leadership must immediately provide additional disaster relief to the victims of this disaster. The aid package currently being developed is a good step. But much more needs to be done by our national government. As I press Congressional leadership to supply all necessary aid to affected areas, I encourage all those who can to donate to the relief effort.
