SEN. DODD INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN U.S. SECURITY MEASURES
  Sen. Chris Dodd today announced the introduction of legislation to correct problems with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that have recently come to light following the controversy over the DP World deal to obtain the right to operate in several U.S. ports. 
   "If there is a silver lining in the controversy surrounding DP World, it is that Congress and the American people are now aware that the approval process used by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is broken and are energized to fix it," said Dodd. "This legislation will significantly improve the committee by ensuring a role for our intelligence community in these important national security decisions and stronger requirements for these acquisitions."
   The U.S. National Security Protection Act will help correct current problems by increasing accountability and transparency and by creating a role for the intelligence community in national security decision making. Neither the CIA Director nor the Director of National Intelligence is currently a member of CFIUS - even though the objective of the committee is to protect U.S. national security interests. 
   Among other things the bill would: 
   * Add the Director of National Intelligence and CIA Director to CFIUS - making it 14 members instead of the current 12. 
   * Create an Intelligence Subcommittee to review all potential deals. 
   * Require congressional notification at every step of the CFIUS process. 
   * Clarify when a mandatory 45-day investigation must occur. 
   *Require foreign companies to notify the President or CFIUS of potential acquisitions or takeovers of U.S. critical infrastructure, which is currently voluntary. 
   In a February 16, letter to Secretary Snow, Dodd was one of the seven original lawmakers to express concern over the DP World deal to operate several major U.S. ports and called for "the Treasury Department to carefully review the new arrangement and scrutinize all security issues..."
