SEN. DODD RESOLUTION CELEBRATES NATIONAL AFTERSCHOOL INITIATIVES ON OCT. 12
  Today, October 12, 2006 is National Lights-On Afterschool Day in celebration of afterschool activities which help keep kids active and engaged. The day-long, annual celebration, designed to promote the critical importance of these initiatives in the lives of America's children, families, and communities, was commemorated by a resolution authored by Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), co-founder of the Senate's Afterschool Caucus.  
   "Quality afterschool initiatives keep kids safe, help working families, and improve academic achievement," Dodd said. "Children involved in these activities show greater interest in school, learn new skills, exhibit improved behavior and get better grades than their peers. Afterschool initiatives also build stronger communities by involving our students, parents, business leaders and adult volunteers in the lives of young people, thereby promoting positive relationships among children and adults."
   In America today, more than 28 million children have parents who work outside the home. As many as 15 million of these children have no place to go afterschool. Consequently, they are missing out on important opportunities to learn and grow.
