SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON AIR NATIONAL GUARD PROPOSAL
  "This is not a new proposal. The Connecticut delegation last month asked for answers regarding this proposal and we have yet to receive a response. Too much is riding on this to accept vague 'maybes' that may never happen. The one thing that isn't in question is the fact that Connecticut's National Guard has answered the call for years and it is unacceptable for our state not to have a vibrant and strong air guard there to meet any and all demands here at home and abroad."
