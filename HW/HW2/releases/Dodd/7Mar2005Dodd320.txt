SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN VOTE TO INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) today expressed disappointment at the defeat of an amendment they co-sponsored that would have raised the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour - an increase that would benefit 7.8 million Americans and will mean an additional $4300 for minimum wage earners to support their families. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), was offered as an amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill now being debated on the Senate floor and was defeated by a vote of 46 to 49. It needed 60 votes to pass.  
   "People who rely on the minimum wage are often having to work at multiple jobs - and even then - some are falling farther and farther behind," said Dodd. "This measure would have helped these workers by paying them a fair and decent wage. I intend to continue to fight to ensure that these workers are compensated fairly for their labor."
   "Among full-time, year-round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970s from about 1.3 million then to more than 2.6 million," Lieberman said. "No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty and an unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem. I am deeply disappointed that Congress did not take this opportunity to help solve that problem."
   The amendment would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in three steps: $5.85 60 days after enactment; $6.55 one year later; $7.25 one year after that. The last time Congress increased the minimum wage was in 1996.
   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 4.3 million since President Bush took office. Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn $10,700 a year, $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. Since the last increase in the minimum wage in 1997, the value has eroded by more than 15 percent.
   Today, the real value of the minimum wage is more than $3.50 below what it was in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be $8.70 an hour today, not $5.15. Nearly seven and a half million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase. More than eight million more will benefit indirectly. 
   History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs, employment, or inflation. In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades. More than 11 million new jobs were added, at a pace of 232,000 per month. There were ten million new service industry jobs, including more than one and a half million retail jobs, of which nearly 600,000 were restaurant jobs.
