SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN CALL FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF CRITICAL BATTLE SURVEILLANCE RADAR
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) yesterday sent a letter to Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Kenneth Krieg urging him to ensure that the Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) continue development of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP). The MP-RTIP, a critical piece of battle surveillance technology, is being developed to meet the U.S. military's increasingly evident need for an airborne radar surveillance system. The MP-RTIP is developed by workers at Norden Systems in Norwalk, Connecticut. Norden employs more than 500 Connecticut residents. 
   "The development of this radar system is critically important to protecting our nation today and in the future," said Dodd. "America maintains its status as a global military power by staying on the cutting edge of military technology, and the MP-RTIP offers the essential next step in battle surveillance radar. Discontinuing the development of this valuable technology would leave our nation woefully unprepared to deal with future military threats." 
   "Never have we more needed new defense innovations than in fighting the war against Islamist terrorism," said Lieberman. "I am proud of Norden Systems' efforts to ensure that America's military is operating with the highest quality technology possible. This is a crucial time for new ways of thinking, planning, and fighting, and the continued development of MP-RTIP will strengthen our strategy for success."
