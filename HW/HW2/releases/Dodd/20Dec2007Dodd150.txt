SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FIRST RESPONDER GRANTS
  Eighteen Connecticut cities and towns will receive equipment worth a total of $436,182 to help improve first responder capabilities, Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) announced today. The equipment will be provided through federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP). The initiative provides resources such as communications interoperability equipment, information sharing technology, chemical detection devices, sensors, personal protective equipment, and rescue tools. The CEDAP also provides first responders with training in how to use the equipment, devices, and technology. 
   "First responders play a critical role in maintaining Connecticut's security and we must ensure that they have the resources needed to do so," said Dodd. "These grants will supply our first responders with invaluable training and equipment that will allow them to continue their heroic efforts."
   "Connecticut police and firefighters put their lives on the line every day for their communities," said Lieberman. "The least we can do is make sure they have the necessary equipment they need to do their jobs properly. These grants will ensure that first responders are better prepared. I am pleased that these Connecticut towns are among the recipients of these awards."
