SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $4.4 MILLION FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN CONNECTICUT
  Connecticut Head Start initiatives will receive $4,472,918 in federal funds to boost education and child development for low-income children, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded 4 grants to education and childcare centers in Connecticut which administer Head Start initiatives locally.  
   "Providing our kids with the skills they'll need in school-not only preparing them for the academic challenges they'll face, but preparing them to work with other children, to listen, and to explore-helps ensure that they will get the most out of their education," Dodd said. "The early stages of a child's education have a major impact on that child's future. We need to continue to invest in America's future by fully funding Head Start."
   "The Head Start program provides critical education, health and social services that help children succeed later in life," Lieberman said. "This funding will help ensure that more children benefit from these valuable services during their pivotal early years and are encouraged to reach their full potential. These federal funds will provide a new head of steam to Head Start in Connecticut."
   The following non-profit organizations will receive grants:
   * New Opportunities for Waterbury, Inc. $1,981,009
  * Childcare Learning Centers, Inc. - Stamford $1,301,694
  * Education Connection - Litchfield $1,080,215
  * Child & Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut - Middletown $110,000
   Head Start provides comprehensive and innovative child development strategies that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. Head Start's child-focused services promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children. Grants support extensive child care and education efforts for children in low-income families including school readiness initiatives, disability services and literacy programs to help prepare children for school.
   Head Start is locally administered by community-based non-profit organizations and school systems. The initiative has helped more than 21 million children nationwide since it began in 1964.
