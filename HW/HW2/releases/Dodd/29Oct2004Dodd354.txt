SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $2.7 MILLION FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN BRIDGEPORT
  A Bridgeport Head Start initiative will receive $2,734,408 in federal funds to boost education and child development for low-income children, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a grant to Action for Bridgeport Community Development (ABCD) which administers a Head Start initiative locally.
   "Head Start works, ultimately making our children healthier and happier and their futures brighter," Dodd said. "This initiative will allow ABCD to continue to provide Bridgeport children the very high-quality care they deserve and improve their chances for academic success."
   "The Head Start program provides critical education, health and social services that help children succeed later in life," Lieberman said. "This funding will help ensure that more of Bridgeport's children benefit from these valuable services during their pivotal early years and are encouraged to reach their full potential, both socially and academically."
   Head Start provides comprehensive and innovative child development strategies that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. Head Start's child-focused services promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children. Grants support extensive child care and education efforts for children in low-income families including school readiness initiatives, disability services and literacy programs to help prepare children for school.
   Head Start is locally administered by community-based non-profit organizations and school systems. The initiative has helped more than 21 million children nationwide since it began in 1964.
