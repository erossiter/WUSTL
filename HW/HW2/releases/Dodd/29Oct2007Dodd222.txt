SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON RED SOX WORLD SERIES WIN
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today issued the following statement on the Red Sox World Series win. Senator Dodd also is an original cosponsor of a Senate resolution congratulating the Red Sox.
   "I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Boston Red Sox for sweeping the Colorado Rockies to become World Series champions last night. Their outstanding pitching, timely hitting, and rock-solid defense clearly demonstrated that they are the best team in baseball. As a native New Englander and lifelong Red Sox fan, I thought the 2004 championship was as good as it gets - but winning for the second time in four years is even better. Again, as a proud member of Red Sox Nation, I applaud the entire Red Sox organization for this historic championship."
