SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING SENATE PASSAGE OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
  "I am deeply disappointed in the Defense Authorization Act that was passed by the Senate tonight. Not only does it lack provisions to end this disastrous war, but it fails to provide even the simplest benefit to the families of our returning wounded warriors. The least we could have done for these families is protect their jobs for six months as they care for their injured loved ones, which is exactly what the amendment I filed a few weeks ago would have done. Unfortunately, my amendment was not included in the bill that passed tonight. While I am pleased that the Senate has finally acted to increase funding for some critical national defense initiatives, such as the $470 million provided for the production of an additional submarine per year, I cannot applaud the Senate for passing yet another piece of legislation that takes no steps to end this war and bring our troops home."
