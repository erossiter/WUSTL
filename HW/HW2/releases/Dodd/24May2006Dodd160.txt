SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $216,000 IN EQUIPMENT FOR CONNECTICUT FIRST RESPONDERS
  Thirteen Connecticut towns will receive equipment worth a total of $216,000 to help improve first responder capabilities, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The equipment will be provided through federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP). The initiative provides law enforcement and emergency responder agencies with equipment to improve communications between local first responders in order to increase efficiency in regional responses. 
   "Our first responders risk their lives each and every day to ensure the safety of Connecticut's residents. Clearly, they need the most advanced equipment and training to perform their critical duties safely and effectively," said Dodd. "With these resources, first responders in thirteen towns and cities across Connecticut will be able to better prepare for and respond to man-made and natural disasters." 
   "As the response to Katrina showed, first responders need to be equipped and trained in order to save lives when a disaster strikes," said Lieberman. "Neither the New Orleans Fire Department nor the Police Department had the boats they needed to rescue people in flooded neighborhoods. These grants will provide local agencies with needed equipment and training, and I am pleased that these Connecticut towns are among the recipients of these awards."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
