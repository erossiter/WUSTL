SEN. DODD WINS APPROVAL FOR HELP FOR FAMILIES AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS
  Noting that tragically more than 3,700 children under 13 currently live with HIV and AIDS, Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., successfully helped win committee approval to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act.  
   "When it comes to HIV prevention, research, care, and treatment, children and youth are not just small adults. To give them a chance for a healthy future, we must ensure that their unique needs are met," said Dodd. "This measure - like a life preserver - can help save lives and provide a brighter future for people in need."
   Dodd was instrumental in preserving the Title IV provisions of the Ryan White CARE Act, which provide comprehensive family-centered services to low income women and children who are living with HIV/AIDS. More than 53,000 women, children, and youth affected by HIV/AIDS are served annually by Title IV-funded projects. It is estimated that, of the approximately 40,000 Americans newly infected each year, more than half are under 25. 
   Earlier in this Congress, Senator Dodd introduced S.1051, the Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act, to strengthen and reauthorize the Title IV provisions of the Ryan White CARE Act. Provision of that bill were included as part of the bill that was overwhelmingly approved this week by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
