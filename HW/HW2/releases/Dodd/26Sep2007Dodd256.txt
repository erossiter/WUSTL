SEN. DODD LAUDS HHS GRANTS TO PROVIDE ENERGY ASSISTANCE TO CONNECTICUT
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today announced that he was pleased Connecticut will receive more than $7 million in energy assistance to help eligible low income homeowners and renters meet their home energy costs. The grants were announced today by Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt. 
   The Secretary released these emergency funds after over 50 Senators, including Dodd, sent a letter to the White House urging the Administration to release these funds before September 30th when the majority of the funding expires.
   "These grants will help ensure that low income homeowners will not be forced to suffer in the coming winter months," said Dodd. "No one should have to experience a Connecticut winter without proper heat and I am pleased that more than $7 million dollars in energy assistance will help those who need it most."
   Of the $131 million, $106 million will go to help individuals heat or cool their homes in all 50 states. Alaska, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont will share an additional $25 million under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) because they have large numbers of eligible households that use oil to heat their homes. Last year LIHEAP assisted more than 75,000 Connecticut residents, roughly 30% of which were seniors.
   The funds released today bring the total delivered under LIHEAP to approximately $2.16 billion this year.
