SENS. DODD, SNOWE CALL FOR 'SUMMIT' ON HEATING OIL CRISIS
  Concerned about the impact of rising heating oil prices on families in their home states as winter approaches, Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) have called on the U.S. Department of Energy to convene a "summit" where all stakeholders involved with heating oil public policy can meet and develop proactive strategies to address current issues and anticipate potential problems in the future.  
   "As the temperature drops, the need for heating oil goes up. That's why the Department of Energy can't afford to be 'asleep at the switch' at this crucial time," said Dodd. "We need to do everything in our power to ensure that oil supplies are adequate and that consumers and small businesses aren't gouged. This summit can help." 
   "With the cold winter months fast approaching, I believe that it is imperative that the Department of Energy bring together all vested parties - consumers, producers, lenders, distributors and policymakers - to forge solutions that will ease the burdens of rising heating oil costs," said Snowe. 
   In a letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Dodd and Snowe included a list of relevant topics that should be explored at the "summit":
   * Will current heating oil supplies be adequate to meet demand if this winter is colder than average?
   * Are policies governing the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve fully established and truly workable?
   * What steps can be taken to ease the heating oil cost burden on consumers?
   * How can homeowners be better prepared for higher prices?
   * Are Low Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding projections on target?
   * Can heating oil dealers secure necessary expanded credit from suppliers and lenders?
   * What can federal agencies do to help improve financing options for heating oil dealers, particularly those who are small business owners?
   * What role can commercial lending groups play?
   In October, Dodd and Snowe secured the approval of $5 million in fiscal year 2005 funding for the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) by the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, ensuring the safety net of a heating oil reserve will be maintained for Northeastern families and businesses in the face of growing prices and decreasing inventories. The funds will be used to keep the oil reserves filled and maintained, secure and viable for use should a national crisis arise.
