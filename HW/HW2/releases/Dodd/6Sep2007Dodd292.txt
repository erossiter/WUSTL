SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT FAA DECISION REGARDING FLIGHT PATTERNS OVER CONNECTICUT
  Statement of Senator Dodd on recent FAA decision regarding flight patterns over Connecticut: 
   "Yesterday's announcement by the FAA is very disappointing. The FAA has ignored repeated requests from me and my colleagues for information about how their proposed changes to regional flight patterns would impact the people of our state, and their decision yesterday demonstrates an utter disregard for the quality of life of residents of Connecticut who will be affected by the Integrated Airspace Alternative. I will continue to work to oppose this proposal."
