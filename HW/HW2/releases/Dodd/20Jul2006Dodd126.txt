SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON REAUTHORIZATION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act:
  "The Voting Rights Act was enacted as a response to the pervasive and explicit evidence of disfranchisement of African-Americans and other voters. It was designed to protect and preserve the voting rights of all Americans. Since 1965, the VRA has been the cornerstone of voting rights in America and its success is a tribute to those who labored so hard to create it. And while progress has certainly been made, we still have many more obstacles to overcome. Progress cannot be left to serendipity. It must be guided by the rule of law. A little more than five years ago we had an election in this country that forced us to confront the harsh reality that millions of Americans continue to be systematically denied their constitutional right to vote. Every citizen deserves to have his or her vote counted. 
   I'm proud that I helped author and enact the Help America Vote Act in 2002, which provided critically important new rights and protections for voters, but I believe that we should always be working to improve our election laws. That is why this measure must be approved. And why I introduced new legislation to further strengthen our election laws. Sadly, there are still legal barriers, administrative irregularities and access impediments to the right to vote which adversely and disproportionately impact voters according to their color, economic class, age, gender, disability, language, party, and precinct. This is wrong. This is unacceptable. This is un-American. Of all of the values which underpin a democracy, none is more essential than the right of a citizen to participate in the election of those who will govern them."
