SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON LIHEAP
  "When it is bitterly cold or terribly hot, people in dire need should know that they'll be able to stay safe. Yesterday, the Senate passed legislation to help provide people with the resources they need to heat or cool their homes. It was a fight up to the finish but I'm pleased to say that we were able to secure an additional $7 million to help Connecticut families in need. Additional funding will also be available if a state like Connecticut experiences particularly harsh weather. I will continue to remain vigilant so that this important assistance remains in the final bill and is passed by the full Congress."
