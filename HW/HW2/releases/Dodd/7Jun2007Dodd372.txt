SENATOR DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CLOSURE OF PROCTOR & GAMBLE'S STAMFORD FACILITY
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on the Closure of Proctor & Gamble's Stamford facility:  
   "I am deeply disappointed at the news that 615 people in Connecticut will be losing their jobs. While some of the Stamford employees may have an opportunity to work at other locations across the country, their lives and their families' lives will still be disrupted considerably. I will do whatever I can-as I hope Proctor & Gamble will do as well-to help these employees who have lost their jobs in securing any assistance for which they are eligible, such as job retraining or Trade Adjustment Assistance."
