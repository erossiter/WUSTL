SENS. DODD, REED REACT TO FDA'S PROPOSED SUNSCREEN LABELING RULE
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Jack Reed (D-RI) today reacted to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) announcement of a new proposed rule on sunscreen labeling that would require sunscreens to protect against UVA rays along with UVB. Under current standards, the FDA does not require that sunscreen protect against UVA rays, which are a major cause of skin cancer and premature aging.  
   "I am pleased the FDA has finally taken this first step toward finally protecting consumers from harmful UVA and UVB rays through proposed changes to sunscreen labeling," said Dodd. "While the proposed rule, if finalized, will go a long way to protecting consumers, I am discouraged at how long it took the FDA to come this far and I fear that another summer season will come and go before today's proposed changes go into effect."
   "Most Americas probably assume that their sunscreen protects them from the harmful rays that cause skin cancer. But unfortunately, all too often that isn't the case. The FDA needs stronger labeling regulations to ensure that consumers will know if the products they are buying will protect them from both UVA and UVB rays," said Senator Reed. "Today's announcement is certainly welcome news. I hope the FDA will act swiftly and decisively to finalize these requirements and help more Americans protect themselves from the harmful effects of the sun."
   Congress directed the FDA to incorporate UVA protection into its standard for sunscreen labeling by May 2006. After a year passed with no response and no action by the FDA, Senators Dodd and Reed wrote to Andrew von Eschenbach, the FDA Commissioner, on May 23, 2007 expressing their concern about the FDA's standards for sunscreen labeling and urging him to issue comprehensive labeling for sunscreen including UVA and UVB protection.
