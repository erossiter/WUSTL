SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON WITHDRAWL OF MIERS
  Statement of Senator Chris Dodd on the Withdrawl of Harriet Miers 
   "Harriet Miers deserved better treatment. Before she uttered a single word at her upcoming confirmation hearing, she was forced out by those in the Republican Party with a narrow and ultraconservative agenda. That doesn't serve the President, the Supreme Court, or our nation well. But it is imperative that the President now focus on the future, and not the past. 
   "The President should take his time to carefully consider this next nomination. He should immediately ask Sandra Day O'Connor to remain on the Court until a full and thorough search can be conducted and completed. These are lifetime appointments, and the person who will fill this seat on the highest court in the land will have a tremendous impact on the lives of millions of Americans, both now in and the future. We need someone with judicial experience and independence who can bridge divides and not further deepen chasms that separate our people and nation. Too much is riding on this nomination to fill it in haste."
