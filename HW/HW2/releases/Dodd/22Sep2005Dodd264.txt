  Fairfield, Middletown, and Waterbury will receive a total of $4,741,012 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today.

   \"This assistance can help improve the economic landscape for these towns and people in need,\" said Dodd. It provides a helping hand to those struggling economically and offers hope of a brighter future for them and the communities in which they live.\" 
   These HUD programs represent some of the most important work we do at the federal level, providing funds to help those most in need - the homeless, the hungry, the unemployed, the sick,\" said Lieberman. In lifting up our poorest neighborhoods, the state of Connecticut can help more of its residents find homes and achieve self-sufficiency, also providing a boost of hope to those families struggling to make ends meet.\"

   Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) - Waterbury $2,563,185

The CDBG initiative helps local governments and communities build and rehabilitate affordable housing and provides public support services such as transportation, job training, and daycare for the homeless, the elderly, children, and the mentally ill. The HOME grant will help expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low-income families. The ESG grant will help improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters.
