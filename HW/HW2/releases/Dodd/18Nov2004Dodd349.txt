SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $450,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Five Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $446,569 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Wednesday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
   "Connecticut firefighters often are the first on the scene of a catastrophe. They shouldn't be last when it comes to getting critically important resources," said Dodd. "Thankfully this assistance - while only a start - can begin to address those tremendous shortcomings and provide our firefighters with the help they need and deserve." 
   "First responders provide a tremendous community service by risking their own lives every day to protect our safety. It is imperative that we do whatever we can to make sure they have the training and equipment they need to react and respond to emergency situations," Lieberman said. "These grants will provide critical funding for education, training and equipment to help Connecticut firefighters save lives."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   * Thomaston Volunteer Fire Department $ 90,063
  * Willington Fire Department, Inc., No. 1 $ 45,635
  * Chester Hose Company, Inc. $ 85,050
  * Stafford Fire Department, Inc., No. 1 $ 118,197
  * Willimantic Fire Department $ 107,624
  * Total $ 446,569 
   The award was made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 221 grants for a total of more than $20.1 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
