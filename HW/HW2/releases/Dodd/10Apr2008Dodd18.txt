SEN. DODD RESPONDS TO HOUSE PASSAGE OF FOOD ALLERGY BILL
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the Chairman of its Subcommittee on Children and Families, and the sponsor of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2007, made the following statement on the food allergy legislation approved by the House Tuesday.  
   "The House could have taken a leap in the effort to protect children from foods that may cause severe, or even fatal, allergic reactions, but instead, they took a baby step. While providing schools with guidelines for implementing a food allergy management system is critically important, the bill that passed the House failed to include the grant program needed to ensure that schools have the resources to put such a system in place. Without the funds to implement the guidelines, many schools will simply not be able to make the changes needed to ensure children with food allergies are safe while they are in school. I will work to include this provision when we consider my legislation in the Senate, and plan to chair a hearing on the impact of food allergies and the rise in the number of children with food allergies in conjunction with Food Allergy Awareness Week this May."
