SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HANK PAULSON
  "The Secretary of the Treasury is a critically important position for our nation's economy and our markets. The next Secretary must be more than a salesman charged with attempting to convince the American people that this administration's economic policies have somehow helped them. 
   "I hope Hank Paulson will demonstrate the intelligence, experience, and independence necessary to help America confront the record budget deficits, record trade deficits, and widening income inequality that the current administration has so far chosen to ignore rather than constructively address. With his distinguished career on Wall Street and wealth of expertise in financial markets, he has an opportunity to be a positive force for change within the administration to help our nation get back on the right economic track."
