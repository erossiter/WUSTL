SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR PRESERVATION OF FLORENCE GRISWOLD MUSEUM
  The Florence Griswold Museum of Old Lyme will receive a grant of $510,772 from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Sen.  
 Chris Dodd announced today. The funding will be used to help preserve the Florence Griswold House, a National Historic Landmark. 
   "The Florence Griswold House is a national treasure that enriches our lives and provides important links to our past," Dodd said. "I am glad the NEH recognizes the importance of maintaining this historic landmark and is providing the needed assistance to preserve the collection so that future generations can have access to our rich culture and our history." 
   Senator Dodd played an instrumental role in helping to secure this grant through contact with Bruce Cole, Chairman of the Nation Endowment for the Humanities. This initiative will enable the property's museum to preserve its collection of art and cultural artifacts pertaining to the Lyme Art Colony by installing effective climate control, security, and fire prevention systems.
   The Museum houses a renowned collection of American art and artifacts and is known as the Home of American Impressionism. Its grounds are also home to one of nine historic garden sites within Connecticut.
