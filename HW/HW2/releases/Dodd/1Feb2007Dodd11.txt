SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINAL PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE VOTE
  "Today, by an overwhelming vote of 94-3, the Senate approved a $2.10 raise in the federal minimum wage, providing an additional $4,400 per year to the millions of hard-working men and women who are helping fuel our economy and keep our nation strong. With the rising costs of housing, food, energy, healthcare and education, this modest raise will allow millions of Americans a chance to provide a better life for themselves and their families."
