SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON ANNIVERSARY OF TROOP SURGE ANNOUNCEMENT
  Recognizing that 2007, the year of President Bush's "troop surge," was reportedly the deadliest year of the war for both U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following remarks on the one-year anniversary of the President's announcement that he would send an additional 30,000 American soldiers into Iraq.  
   "While the surge appears to have temporarily reduced soldier deaths in the last few months of the year, it has failed to bring about the political reconciliation promised by President Bush in his announcement one year ago. As long as our troops remain in Iraq, there is no incentive for Iraqi leaders to begin the difficult task of rebuilding their broken country. 
   "I am also gravely concerned about President Bush's strategy of arming Sunni militias and other Iraqi tribal leaders. While these groups have pledged to use the weapons against insurgents, let's not forget that it was not long ago that members of these very groups were killing American soldiers on the streets of Anbar."
