SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN HAIL OVER $6 MILLION IN HEATING ASSISTANCE FUNDS FOR COLDER MONTHS AHEAD
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) today hailed the release of $6,073,328 in assistance targeted for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which will help low income families in Connecticut afford to heat their homes in the colder months ahead. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released the funding as part of the $79.9 million contingency fund provided by last year's HHS appropriations bill. Sens. Dodd and Lieberman worked to include this emergency funding in the appropriations bill. 
   "As the temperature drops, the need for home heating increases," said Dodd. "The release of this emergency funding will be critically important in helping ensure that people don't have to choose between heating their homes or putting food on the table this fall and winter. It's a step in the right direction to make these resources available now, and I'll continue to work in the future to ensure adequate funding to meet crucial energy needs.
   "I am glad I could help get these vital funds released to Connecticut," Lieberman said. "I will not let the federal government leave low-income families in Connecticut out in the cold this winter."
   LIHEAP funding helps low-income individuals with their home energy bills, including energy emergencies such as cold temperatures in the winter, spikes in energy costs and extreme heat in the summer. HHS previously released $600 million in assistance to states this past winter to address record high heating fuel costs. The additional funds released today result in a total of approximately $3.1 billion made available under LIHEAP this year - including more than $71 million in Connecticut.
