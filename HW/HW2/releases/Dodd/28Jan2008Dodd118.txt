SEN. DODD, AUTHOR OF FMLA, REACTS TO NEW FMLA REGULATIONS
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today responded to reports that the Department of Labor has proposed new Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) regulations that may make it more difficult for Americans to utilize the law's protections. Senator Dodd is the author of the landmark legislation and is also the author of a bill which would allow the family of injured servicemembers to take up to six months of unpaid leave to care for their loved one. That measure is currently awaiting President Bush's signature. 
   "I am concerned by the reports that the Department of Labor may impose new regulations that will make it more difficult for workers to take advantage of the leave FMLA provides. Over the past 15 years, FMLA has helped more than 50 million families during critical moments in their lives, and any effort to scale back these protections is simply unacceptable.
   "As I have said time and time again, if there is any problem with FMLA, it is that it doesn't go far enough. That is why I support new ways to expand this legislation so more Americans can benefit from its provisions. Most recently, I authored a provision to expand FMLA benefits for up to six months for family members of wounded military personnel. As this disastrous war drags on with no end in sight, it is critically important that we ensure that the brave men and women of our armed forces receive the care and support they need when they return home. Allowing their family to be there during the often lengthy rehabilitation process without the constant fear of losing their job is one of the best things we can do for our troops. I hope the Department of Labor keeps these concerns at the forefront as they draft their new regulations."
