SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON OFHEO ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GSE'S
  "This is a balanced agreement because it allows Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to play an immediate role in restoring liquidity and confidence to the mortgage markets, while ensuring they will be able to sustain the effort in the longer run by requiring them to raise additional capital. I expect the two companies to use the capital not only to help the markets generally, but also to help subprime borrowers in a much more focused manner."
