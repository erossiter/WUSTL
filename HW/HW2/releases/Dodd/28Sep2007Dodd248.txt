SEN. DODD: DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES OF RETURNING WOUNDED WARRIORS
  Today Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) explained why he voted against ending debate on the Defense Authorization bill late last night. 
   "I voted against ending the debate on the Defense Authorization bill for two simple reasons-- First, this bill doesn't do anything to end the war; and second, it doesn't provide adequate support for the families of our returning wounded warriors.
   "A few weeks ago, I filed an amendment based on a key recommendation of the Dole-Shalala Wounded Warriors Commission-- to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow the families of wounded military personnel to take up to 6 months of unpaid leave to care for their loved ones. While I am pleased that my proposal was passed as an amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program that Senate approved last night, there is every indication that the President intends to veto this bill.
   "It was my hope that as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act, my proposal would be approved quickly so our troops and their families could begin taking advantage of this needed benefit. Now, because the Senate voted to shut off debate, this critically important amendment will not be considered. I will keep fighting to find a vehicle to get this legislation passed."
