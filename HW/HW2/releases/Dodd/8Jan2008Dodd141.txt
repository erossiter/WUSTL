SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DODD NAMES AMY FRIEND MAJORITY CHIEF COUNSEL
  Senator Chris Dodd, D-CT., Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, has named Amy Friend Chief Counsel for the Committee. Friend currently serves as Assistant Chief Counsel at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). 
   "Amy's experience, knowledge, and expertise make her a wonderful addition to the Banking Committee staff, said Dodd. "Her talents and the wealth of private and public experience she possesses will be of enormous benefit to the Committee as we address important issues that impact our nation's economy, our markets, consumers and investors."
   "Amy Friend is an outstanding lawyer with a keen understanding of banking and consumer protection law and the legislative process," said Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan. "I know that Senator Dodd and the entire Senate Banking Committee will benefit from her knowledge and counsel. She's been a vital member of the OCC legal team for the past ten years, and she'll be greatly missed."
   Before joining the Comptroller's office, Friend spent the previous decade working on Capitol Hill, most recently as Minority General Counsel for the then-House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs (now the House Committee on Financial Services). In her previous Hill stint, Friend also served as General Counsel for the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs and Coinage, Legislative Director for Representative Rosa Delauro of Connecticut, and Counsel for the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Legislative Assistant to then Representative Chuck Schumer of New York. Friend received her J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center and did her undergraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated magna cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
