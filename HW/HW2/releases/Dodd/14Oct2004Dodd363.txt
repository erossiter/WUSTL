SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $2.2 MILLION FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN CONNECTICUT
  Two Connecticut Head Start initiatives will receive more than $2.2 million in federal funds to boost education and child development for low-income children, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded grants to the Connecticut Resource Development Corporation in Danbury and the New Haven Public Schools, both of which administer Head Start initiatives locally.
   "Education is a life-long journey, and Head Start is the map that helps put children on the road to success," said Dodd. "This assistance can help ensure that more Connecticut children start down that road, and live brighter, happier, and more successful lives."
   "The Head Start program provides critical education, health and social services that help children succeed later in life," Lieberman said. "This funding will help ensure that more children benefit from these valuable services during their pivotal early years and are encouraged to reach their full potential, both socially and academically."
   Head Start provides comprehensive and innovative child development strategies that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. Head Start's child-focused services promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children. Grants support extensive child care and education efforts for children in low-income families including school readiness initiatives, disability services and literacy programs to help prepare children for school.
   Grants were provided to the Connecticut Resource Development Corporation in Danbury for $1,060,522 and to the New Haven Public Schools $1,225,617.
   Head Start is locally administered by community-based non-profit organizations and school systems. The initiative has helped more than 21 million children nationwide since it began in 1964.
