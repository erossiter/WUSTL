SEN. DODD HONORED BY CONGRESSIONAL FIRE SERVICES INSTITUTE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) was today presented with an honorary fire helmet by the Congressional Fire Services Institute (CFSI) to commemorate his appointment as a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. Earlier this year, Dodd was made an honorary member of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). He is only the fourth non-fire fighter and the first elected official to receive this honor in the IAFF's 90-year history. 
   "I am honored to receive this award from the Congressional Fire Services Institute, and proud to serve as co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus," said Dodd. "Our job in Congress is to ensure that our nation's fire fighters have the tools and equipment they need to keep our communities safe. I've been working to support fire fighters for the last three decades, and I look forward to continuing that work on the Fire Services Caucus."
   Senator Dodd is a long time advocate for fire fighters and fire departments across the country. In 2000, Dodd authored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. Three years later, Dodd authored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to reduce critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since their inception, FIRE and SAFER grants have distributed nearly $3 billion in resources through 30,000 grant awards.
