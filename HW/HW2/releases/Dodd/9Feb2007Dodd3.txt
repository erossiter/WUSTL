SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CDC AUTISM STUDY
  "The CDC's recent study, which found that rates of autism among children in the U.S. are significantly higher than previously thought, is not only alarming, but also underscores the immediate need for more research into this condition. While this study is not exhaustive and does not represent the entire population, it does serve as a sharp warning that we must do more in this field in terms of research, funding, and awareness. I intend to do my part in Congress by fighting for more funding for this important issue and the millions of lives it affects."
