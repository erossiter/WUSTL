SEN. DODD RECOGNIZES WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), Chairman of its Subcommittee on Children and Families, and author of the Combating Autism Act, released the following statement in recognition of World Autism Awareness Day:  
   "At a time when the number of children and families living with autism has grown exponentially, it is important that we recognize the need to expand our federal commitment to combating this disability. Autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the United States, yet we are not committing enough of our federal resources to develop the type of scientific breakthroughs that are needed to combat autism. It is time to redouble our efforts and help the thousands of families who are raising children with autism."
   Dodd, along with former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA), authored the Combating Autism Act which was enacted into law in December of 2006. This initiative represented the largest federal expansion of funding and programs for children and families with autism. Additionally, the Senate recently passed an amendment authored by Dodd to the FY2009 Senate Budget Resolution that increases funding for autism research, education, and early detection by $197 million. This increase brings autism funding up to its authorized level and then provides for a doubling of funding for research into the causes of and treatments for autism. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) joined Dodd as the lead co-sponsor of the amendment. 
   Dodd is also the author of the Disability Savings Act of 2008, which would encourage individuals and families to save personal funds for individuals with disabilities, like autism, specifically for their unique disability-related needs, in Disability Savings Accounts (DSAs). This legislation is supported by Autism Speaks and Easter Seals.
