SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON WAL-MART'S ANNOUNCEMENT
  "While today's announcement by Wal-Mart ends the debate as to whether or not the company should be granted an ILC charter, it does not end the dialogue about broader policy implications and concerns regarding ILC ownership that were raised as a result of Wal-Mart's application. I intend to continue to examine this issue in a thoughtful and deliberate manner."
