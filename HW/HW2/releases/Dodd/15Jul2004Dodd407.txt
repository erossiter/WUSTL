BRISTOL RECEIVES MORE THAN $700,000 FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PUBLIC SERVICES
  The City of Bristol will receive more than $700,000 to rehabilitate low- and middle-income family housing, spur economic revitalization in local neighborhoods, and provide public services to the homeless, children, and the elderly, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. 
   "Connecticut's neediest deserve a roof over their heads, not a ceiling over their dreams," Dodd said. "This assistance will not only help build better, more affordable homes, but will provide the support these families need as they pursue home ownership - and, ultimately, a brighter future."
   "By supporting local projects that revitalize our neighborhoods, foster economic development and provide services for Connecticut's neediest residents, this funding will help to improve the quality of the life and the environment in our entire state," said Lieberman. 
   The funds were awarded as part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG), which helps local governments and communities build and rehabilitate affordable housing, as well as address other economic development needs. 
   The City of Bristol will use the community development funding for a broad range of initiatives, including housing rehabilitation and initiatives to increase home ownership among low- and middle-income families; residential and commercial neighborhood revitalization; and public support services such as transportation, job training, and daycare for the homeless, the elderly, children, and the mentally ill.
