SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $800,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Nine Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $798,006 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Wednesday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 
   "Cities and towns throughout Connecticut are in desperate need of resources and equipment to help their firefighters better do their jobs and keep families safe," said Dodd. "This funding is a step in the right direction toward getting life-saving equipment to our first responders, but the Administration needs to do more to get critically important resources into the hands of fire departments in Connecticut and throughout the country. We cannot put a price tag on their safety."
   "Connecticut firefighters risk their own lives every day to protect our communities. As we work to protect our nation from the threat of terrorism, it is critical that we also do all we can to ensure that first responders have the resources they need," Lieberman said. "These grants are a good first step toward providing vital funding for education, training and equipment to help them do their jobs."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   New Hope Fire Company $32,400
  Seymour Fire Department $70,200
  Pleasant Valley Fire Department $47,922
  Dayville Fire Company $32,400
  Water Witch Hose Co. No. 2 $25,650
  Ledyard Fire Company, District No. 1 $73,773 
  East Haven Fire Department $162,360
  Noank Fire District $98,403
  Newington Fire Department $254,898 
  Total $798,006
   The award was made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 213 grants for a total of more than $19.8 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
