SEN. DODD STANDS UP FOR AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES BY STOPPING SURVEILLANCE BILL
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) announced today that he will stop the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reform legislation from being considered by the full Senate and from receiving a vote on the Senate floor. Dodd will place a hold on the bill, a tool available to Senators to stop legislation from moving forward.  
   By granting immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in the President's terrorist surveillance program, even though such participation may have been illegal, the FISA reform bill sets a dangerous precedent by giving the President sweeping authorization to neglect the right to privacy that Americans are entitled to under the Constitution. 
    "The President has no right to secretly eavesdrop on the conversations and activities of law abiding American citizens and anyone who has aided and abetted him in these illegal activities should be held accountable," said Dodd. "It is unconscionable that such a basic right has been violated, and that the President is the perpetrator. I will do everything in my power to stop Congress from shielding this President's agenda of secrecy, deception, and blatant unlawfulness." 
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is considering the reform proposal in a markup session this afternoon. The legislation will then be referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for its consideration before being reported to the Senate floor.
