SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON WITHDRAWAL OF SAM FOX'S NOMINATION
  "The White House's withdrawal of Sam Fox's nomination to the post of Ambassador to Belgium is a wise decision, and one which I welcome. Mr. Fox's prior activities notwithstanding, his unwillingness to denounce the reprehensible activities of the Swift Boat organization and express regret for providing $50,000 to bankroll the organization convinced me that he would not be an acceptable candidate to represent the United States abroad. I encourage the White House to submit another candidate for this position - one who can represent the United States in the best possible light, and foster positive relations with a close ally."
