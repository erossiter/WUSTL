SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON HOUSE BRAC VOTE
  Statement of Senator Dodd on House BRAC Vote
   "We've officially crossed the finish line.  
 And Sub Base New London, the people of our state, and our nation's security are the clear winners. There are many people who made this day a reality, but most importantly, it was the people of our state who never gave up, never stopped fighting, and who believed in this base and its mission. Obviously we still have work to do on our state's Air National Guard, and that is a fight we'll continue to wage. We'll also need to continue to fight for every single dollar for submarines and this base to ensure that this base, and our nation's defense capabilities, are protected."
