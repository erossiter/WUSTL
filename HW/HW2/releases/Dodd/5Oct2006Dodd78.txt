SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTH KOREA'S PLEDGE TO PERFORM A NUCLEAR TEST
  "North Korea's declaration that it intends to conduct a nuclear test is an act of provocation designed to get the attention of the international community. While North Korea already claims to have nuclear weapons, testing would have devastating consequences for the non-proliferation system and international peace and security. Unfortunately, the six-party talks which were established to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis are continuing to falter because of a lack of leadership. As a result, when the Bush administration came to office, North Korea was estimated to have the capability to make one or two nuclear weapons. Now it is believed to be capable of making up to ten. It is critical that the Bush administration urgently assume a leadership role within the six-party talks and talk directly with North Korea so that a political solution can be reached to remove a threat that has only grown worse under its watch."
