SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEW FIRE GRANT FOR CONNECTICUT
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) today announced federal grants to the Waterbury Fire Department and the West Shore Fire District totaling $571,800 for vehicle acquisition and improving operations and firefighter safety. These awards were made possible as part of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) by the U.S. Fire Administration. In fiscal year 2007, the AFG program will award approximately $490 million to fire and EMS departments across America.  
   "Each and every day firefighters put their lives on the line," said Dodd. "I am pleased the Waterbury Fire Department is receiving these funds, which will help provide Connecticut's firefighters with the equipment they need, and allow them to continue their excellent work."
   "I am a strong advocate of federal, state, and local partnerships to ensure our first responders get the resources they need and deserve to protect our communities," said Lieberman. "These grants will help Waterbury and West Haven obtain the latest equipment and training for their courageous firefighters, and I will continue to fight for proper funding in the future."
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has distributed 414 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
