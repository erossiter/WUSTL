SEN. DODD'S WEBSITE WINS 2007 GOLDEN MOUSE AWARD GRANTED TO ONLY FOUR SENATE OFFICES
  U.S. Senator Chris Dodd's (D-CT) website was honored Monday by the Congressional Management Foundation (CMF), a non-profit, non-partisan research and consulting organization in Washington, D.C., for having one of the best websites in Congress. Analyzing 618 congressional websites, Dodd.Senate.Gov was one of only four personal offices in the Senate to receive the Golden Mouse Award in CMF's "2007 Gold Mouse Report: Lessons from the Best Web Sites on Capitol Hill." 
   "Sen. Dodd's website underscores his belief that the more people are involved and engaged in government and public policy, the better it is for our nation," said Dodd's Communications Director Colleen Flanagan. "In 2008, Sen. Dodd's website will continue to provide a window into his work for the residents of Connecticut and the nation."
   The 2007 Gold Mouse Award marks the second time that Senator Dodd's website has been recognized by the Congressional Management Foundation, having previously won the honor in 2003. Websites were graded on how well they incorporate five basic components: audience, content, usability, interactivity, and innovation. In 2007, CMF awarded 36 Gold, 34 Silver, and 34 Bronze Mouse Awards. The full copy of the report is available on the Congressional Management Foundation's website at www.cmfweb.org
