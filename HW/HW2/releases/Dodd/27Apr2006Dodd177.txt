SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE $400 MILLION AUTHORIZATION MEASURE FOR SUBMARINES
  "Our nation can't afford to wait - we need to immediately begin building at least two submarines per year. Our national security and our ability to protect our submarine industrial base depend upon it. And while this subcommittee approval doesn't actually provide the funding to do that, it is important because it puts people on record that submarines should be a priority and not an afterthought. But no one should have any illusions as to the tough road ahead. These fights aren't over until they are over. I intend to continue to fight for submarines and their increased production."
