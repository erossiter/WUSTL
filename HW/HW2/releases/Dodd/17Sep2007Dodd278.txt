SEN. DODD CALLS ON PRESIDENT BUSH TO EXPAND DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS IN IRAN
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today sent a letter to President Bush expressing his concern regarding the Administration's handling of matters related to Iran and requesting that the President appoint an experienced diplomat as a special envoy for Iran.  
   "To date there has been a total absence of any serious U.S. diplomatic efforts to dissuade Iran from continuing its ill conceived and destabilizing policies," the letter states. "I am extremely concerned that your administration's failure to employ robust diplomacy in dealing with the challenges posed by Iran could lead us down the same disastrous and ill-conceived path that has produced a failed policy in Iraq that has made us less secure."
