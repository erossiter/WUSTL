SEN. DODD URGES COLLEAGUES TO JOIN HIM IN STANDING UP FOR AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) yesterday sent a letter to every member of the Senate urging them to join him in his efforts to stop the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reform legislation, in its current form, from being considered by the full Senate and from receiving a vote on the Senate floor. Last week Dodd announced he has placed a hold on the bill, a tool available to Senators to stop legislation from moving forward. After the Intelligence Committee files the bill later this week, it will be referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration.  
   By granting immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in the President's terrorist surveillance program, even though such participation may have been illegal, the FISA reform bill sets a dangerous precedent by allowing companies to ignore their legal responsibilities to protect the privacy of their companies without any basis in law for doing so. 
   "I believe that it is extremely important that we allow the judicial branch to perform its vital role in determining whether or not any of these companies should be held criminally or civilly liable for their actions," Dodd said in his letter. "If we acquiesce to the Administration's demands, we will be complicit in the President's attempt to circumvent the rule of law and the Administration's continuing efforts to keep Americans in the dark."
