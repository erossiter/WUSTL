SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HUD SECRETARY NOMINEE STEVEN PRESTON
  "As our nation faces the biggest housing crisis in recent history, we need a strong leader at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who is dedicated to helping people keep their homes, restoring stability and confidence in the mortgage market, and creating more affordable housing opportunities. These priorities call for a leader with expertise in housing issues, yet the President's choice has no apparent housing background, which raises questions. Nevertheless, I look forward to learning more about Mr. Preston and his qualifications for this important job at this trying time in our nation's economy."
