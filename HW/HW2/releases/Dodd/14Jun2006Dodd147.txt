SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING FEMA KATRINA AID FRAUD ABUSE
  "This is unacceptable. People have now been victimized twice - Gulf Coast residents by Hurricane Katrina's devastating wrath, and now the American taxpayer by fraudulent con artists. Those who would fleece the American public should be held fully accountable for their unscrupulous deeds. That goes without saying. But the Bush Administration - which was so slow to act in helping alleviate the suffering of this region and people - should also be held responsible for mismanagement in allowing possibly more than $1 billion dollars of taxpayers' dollars to be wasted and lost. The Bush Administration needs to detail and explain how they allowed this to happen. There should also be an investigation of questionable activities like 'no-bid' contracts for companies with political connections to the Bush Administration. Taxpayers should know unconditionally that their hard earned money isn't lining con artists' pockets or corporate pockets."
