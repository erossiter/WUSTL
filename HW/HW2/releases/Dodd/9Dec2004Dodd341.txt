SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $400,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Five Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $446,403 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Thursday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security.  
   "We can and should do much more to protect families from the devastating effects of fire, and firefighters deserve to have the resources to provide that security," said Dodd. "After working hand-in-hand with firefighters for years to make this vision a reality, I'm pleased that these funds will be the first step in making sure these brave men and women have the training they need to keep our communities safe."
   "Every day, first responders put their own lives on the line to ensure our safety," Lieberman said. "The least we can do is make sure they have the tools to protect and serve their communities. These grants are a step in the right direction toward providing Connecticut firefighters with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs well." 
   The following localities will receive funding:
   * Windham Center Fire Department $56,745
   * Hebron Volunteer Fire Department $55,134
   * Cohanzie Fire Company Inc. # 5 $150,413
   * Griswold Volunteer Fire Department Inc $91,591
   * Middlefield Volunteer Fire Department $92,520 
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 235 grants for a total of more than $21.6 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
