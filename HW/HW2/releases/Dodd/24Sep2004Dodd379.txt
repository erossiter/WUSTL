SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR PLAINFIELD ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP
  After receiving a briefing on the Inter-Royal industrial site by municipal officials, Senator Chris Dodd today announced that he has helped secure $250,000 for the proper demolition and cleanup of the polluted and vacant property in Plainfield Center. 
   "If we clean up this crucial piece of property and market it for future commercial development, it will take on renewed importance in the economy and life of the town," said Dodd. "I have strong faith in the resiliency of this region of Connecticut, and I believe that the people who live and work here are some of the best in the world. I will fight to ensure that Congress and the President continue to fund this important initiative."
   The $250,000 in Federal assistance secured by Dodd would help the town implement its plan to demolish the InterRoyal facility and ultimately market the site as an attractive piece of property for future commercial development. The Town plans to use an expected $1,000,000 in past tax obligations on the site to compliment any Federal funding that is secured. This project, when complete, would provide a safe and potentially developable property - a property that promises to create more jobs within the municipality and spur economic growth.
   Dodd congratulated local officials, including Selectman Donald Gladding, for spearheading efforts to clear and develop the property which, as the turn of the century, employed thousands of people at its mill and produced such diverse products as fabric materials, hospital and office furniture, and military equipment.
   The funds are included in the VA-HUD Appropriations bill which was adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier this week. The legislation is next slated for consideration by the full Senate.
