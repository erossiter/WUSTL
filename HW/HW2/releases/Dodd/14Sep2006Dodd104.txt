SEN. DODD JOINS OTHERS TO SPEAK AGAINST 'SECRET HOLDS' ON LEGISLATION; URGES COMPREHENSIVE LOBBYING REFORMS
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) joined Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Trent Lott (R-MS) today to speak against the Senate's practice of 'secret holds', under which a single Senator can block legislation or a nominee without revealing his or her identity, and urged Congress to pass comprehensive lobbying reform legislation. 
   "We must make the legislative process fairer and more transparent. That's why I believe we ought to have enacted months ago comprehensive lobbying reform legislation at least as strong at that passed by the Senate, which included this provision banning secret holds," Dodd said. "Secret holds undermine the confidence of Americans in the process and ultimately in the laws we write. Simply requiring Senators to make public their concerns and objections to legislation or nominees would be a modest step toward greater accountability and transparency. Hopefully we can get this done yet this year as a part of comprehensive lobbying reform. But time's running out; Republican leaders must act now if we're to get comprehensive lobbying reform enacted this year." 
   The Senators announced that they would all push to ban secret holds before the end of this session in the lobby reform bill or, failing that, in other appropriate legislation that comes before the Senate. 
   Most recently, in March, the Senate voted 84-13 on a Wyden-Grassley amendment requiring Senators to announce their opposition to legislation or a nominee in the Congressional Record within three days. The provision was included in the Senate version of the lobbying reform bill.
