SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL GRANTS FOR THREE CONNECTICUT TOWNS
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that more than $125,000 in federal grants was awarded to Connecticut fire departments. The grants were made possible through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   "Firefighters work tirelessly to keep our neighborhoods safe, and they deserve the funding necessary to protect themselves in this dangerous line of work." said Dodd. "I am pleased to say that these grants will supply these fire departments with critical training and equipment that will allow them to continue their heroic efforts."
   "First responders all across the state put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our Connecticut communities," Lieberman said. "These grants will help to ensure that they have the necessary training, resources and equipment to carry out this immense and honorable responsibility."
   The following fire departments were awarded federal grants:
   * Noank - $24,225
   * Canaan - $55,758
   * Willington - $46,194
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has distributed 359 grants in Connecticut for a total of more than $35 million to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
