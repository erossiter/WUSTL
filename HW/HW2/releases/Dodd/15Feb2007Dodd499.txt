SENS. DODD, HATCH INTRODUCE BILL TO SCREEN NEWBORNS FOR DISORDERS THAT CAN CAUSE DEATH OR LONG-TERM DISABILITY
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) today introduced legislation to educate parents and health care providers about newborn screening, improve follow-up care for infants with an illness detected through newborn screening, and help states expand and improve their newborn screening programs.
   "There should be no higher priority than the health and well-being of our children. Thanks to incredible advances in medical technology, we are now equipped to better protect infants, the most vulnerable members of our society, by testing them for genetic and metabolic disorders that could lead to severe disability or death if left undetected," said Dodd. "While some newborn screening occurs in every state, fewer than half the states, including Connecticut, actually test for the full recommended panel of 29 disorders. This legislation will provide resources for states to expand their newborn screening programs - an initiative that will help ensure that every newborn child has the best possible opportunity to live a long, healthy and happy life."  
   "These screenings can literally mean life or death to a newborn," Hatch said. "Some life-threatening diseases can easily be cured if diagnosed right away. But they can't be diagnosed if the tests aren't available or if the parents don't know to ask for them. This bill will help states expand and improve their screening programs so they can reach more children before it's too late."
   An estimated 4,000 babies are identified and treated each year for conditions that could threaten their lives or health, often preventing death and long-term disability. Unfortunately, parents are often unaware that while nearly all babies born in the U.S. undergo some newborn screening, the number and quality of tests vary from state to state. As a result, a child with a given disorder will most likely receive successful diagnosis and treatment if born in a state that tests for that disorder, but may suffer irreversible injury or death if born in another state that does not require such testing.
   The bill is endorsed by the March of Dimes and the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
   The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act will: 
   * Authorize $15 million for grants to: 
   - Educate and train health care professionals and state laboratory personnel in newborn screening and relevant new technologies; 
   - Educate and inform parents, families, and patient advocacy and support groups about newborn screening; and 
   - Establish a coordinated system of follow-up care for newborns and their families after screening and diagnosis. 
   * Authorize $25 million to states to expand and improve their newborn screening programs and encourage states to test for the full panel of disorders recommended by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. 
   *Reauthorize and expand the role of the Advisory Committee to continuously revise and update the panel of recommended tests, as well as advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on other steps that can be taken to improve newborn screening programs as we learn more about these rare illnesses and as new treatments and technologies are developed. 
   * Require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure the quality of laboratories involved in newborn screening, so that tests are as accurate as possible and infants receive appropriate care. 
   * Require the CDC to develop a national contingency plan for newborn screening in the event of a public health emergency not later than 180 days after enactment. 
   * Authorize $15 million to establish a system for collecting and analyzing data from newborn screening programs, to help researchers develop a better understanding of the disorders detected by newborn screening, and how they might be better detected, prevented, treated, and cured. 
   Representatives Roybal-Allard (D-CA) and Simpson (R-ID) will soon offer companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
