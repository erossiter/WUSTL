SEN. DODD APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF LOBBY REFORM BILL
  Sen. Chris Dodd, ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee and a floor manager during the lobby reform debate, today praised Senate passage of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act (S. 2349). The bipartisan bill, which was co-authored by Dodd, was a result of the work of both the Senate Rules and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees. 
   "Today we underscore that there is not a 'for sale' sign on the front lawn of the Capitol," said Dodd. "We say that our basic values and democratic principles aren't going to be sold to the highest bidder. We say that the only special interest in Washington should be the interest of the American public. I strongly urge the House to pass a similarly strong bill so we can enact these important reforms." 
   The bill includes provisions to:
   * Ban all gifts and meals from lobbyists;
  * Require additional and more frequent disclosure of lobbying activities; 
  * Place tight new limitations, including Ethics Committee pre-approval, on Congressional travel funded by outside sources; 
  * Increase transparency of the earmark process;
  * Tighten "revolving door" provisions of Senate rules; 
  * Ban floor privileges for former Members of Congress who become lobbyists; 
  * Ban inappropriate attempts to influence hiring decisions by lobbying firms as was done by the "K Street Project"; 
  * Broaden disclosure requirements for massive grassroots lobbying efforts; 
  * Require that Conference Reports be available on the Internet before they are considered by the Senate; and 
  * Toughen conflict of interest rules for members and staff. 
   "I still fervently believe that we need to do more. If we're truly serious about getting to the core of the problem, we need to look not only at lobbying reform but at campaign finance reform, as well. The ultimate 'free lunch' isn't served up in restaurants, it comes in the form of large campaign contributions from special interests. That's why I intend to redouble my efforts to fight for real reform in the form of comprehensive campaign finance reform," Dodd concluded.
