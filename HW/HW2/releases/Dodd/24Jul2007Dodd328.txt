SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Statement of Senator Dodd on the minimum wage increase: 
   "While it took a ten-year battle in Congress, millions of hard-working men and women will finally get a raise today. Over the next two years, the minimum wage will be raised from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour, and workers will see their paychecks go up, starting today. Today's increase is the first since 1997--ten years in which the cost of living has steadily risen as the minimum wage has stagnated, leaving millions of Americans further and further behind. But today's increase will make a real difference in their lives: For a worker making minimum wage, it means an extra $4,400 each year. That's $4,400 more to put towards rent, groceries, utilities, childcare, health insurance, or tuition. This increase puts real dollars and cents in the hands of hardworking Americans. It was far too long in coming - but every American deserves a fair wage and a safe workplace."
