SENS. DODD, CLINTON ANNOUNCE INCLUSION OF THEIR LEGISLATION TO EXTEND FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) today announced the inclusion of their legislation, "The Support for Injured Servicemembers Act," in the Department of Defense (DOD) authorization conference report. The Dodd-Clinton amendment extends the benefits provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) by allowing the families of wounded military personnel to take up to six months of unpaid leave. The legislation, which still must be approved by the Senate, will implement a key recommendation of the Commission on the Care for Wounded Warriors, a panel led by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala. 
   The Dodd-Clinton legislation has received widespread, bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House. The Senate cosponsors of the bipartisan measure include Senators Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Ken Salazar (D-CO), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Joseph Lieberman (I-CT), Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Barack Obama (D-IL). The legislation is also supported by the National Partnership for Women and Families, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the National Military Families Association, the Military Officers Association of America, the National Guard Association of the United States, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, and the Reserve Officers Association.
   "Today, we take one step further toward ensuring that our nation's military heroes will receive all the care and support they deserve," said Dodd. "I spent more than 7 years fighting to ensure that the Family and Medical Leave Act became law and I will continue to fight to ensure it is expanded for the families of wounded soldiers. The brave men and women who serve our country and sacrifice so much deserve nothing less than knowing that when they return home their families will be able to provide them with the care they need without the fear that they will loss their jobs."
   "This is an important step toward achieving this critical expansion of family and medical leave. Our wounded servicemembers have sacrificed so much in service to this country, and we must do all we can to assist them and their families who face incredible challenges in bringing needed care to our injured troops. We owe a great debt to these brave men and women, and I look forward to this bill becoming law," said Senator Clinton.
   Senator Dodd is the author of the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which has allowed more than 50 million workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave if they are ill or if they need to care for a sick family member or new child. Dodd recently introduced the Family Leave Insurance Act of 2007, legislation that will provide paid leave to workers for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a child, spouse or parent with a serious illness or to care for their own serious illness. Senator Dodd has been a long-time advocate for the health and safety of U.S. troops. From leading the effort to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the safety equipment they need, to fighting to restore National Guard readiness, Dodd has worked tirelessly on behalf of American servicemen and women.
   Senator Clinton has been a champion of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped more than 50 million Americans since President Clinton signed it into law in 1993. Senator Clinton has worked to build on this landmark law, cosponsoring the Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the Healthy Families Act. She has also introduced legislation to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to flight attendants and pilots. As New York's first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform and their families have the healthcare and support they need.
