SEN. DODD: 'WE NEED MORE ACTION FROM POLICY MAKERS'
  "The economic downturn that we are facing, coupled with the sharp downturn in the global markets, is in large part due to the ongoing fallout from the problems in our housing market, specifically within the subprime market. While the Fed's inter-meeting rate cut, its first since right after the tragedy of September 11, is an immediate response, more action from policy makers is needed to help restore investor confidence and ease financial strains on homeowners. The stimulus package that Congress will shortly consider needs to include a component that will address the problems in the housing and credit markets. In addition, other steps are required to restore long-term growth and stability to the economy, including legislation to reform the FHA, end predatory lending, and strengthen the ability of the housing GSEs to safely and soundly promote affordable home ownership. These changes will require bipartisan cooperation. I plan to do everything in my power as Chairman, including meeting with Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke in the coming days, to see that through."
