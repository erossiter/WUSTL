SEN. DODD APPEARS ON GOOD MORNING AMERICA WITH MORE THAN 100 WORKING MOMS
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) appeared on Good Morning America to discuss his work on The Family Leave Insurance Act of 2007, which provides for up to 8 weeks of paid leave during life changing events, such as a serious family illness or the birth of a child. Appearing with more than 100 working mothers as part of Good Morning America's 'Take Control of Your Life Tour,' Dodd spoke about the importance of passing legislation that supports working families.  
   "No one should ever have to choose between the job they need and the family they love," said Dodd. "This legislation will ensure that employees receive compensation while on leave during life changing events, such as their own illness, the illness of a child, spouse, parent, or the birth or adoption of a child. The truth is, situations arise in each of our lives which require our undivided attention. Taking care of family obligations or providing for them financially should not be mutually exclusive." 
   The Family Leave Insurance Act will benefit both businesses and their employees by establishing a Family Leave Insurance Fund, through which employees, employers and the federal government share the cost of providing compensation during times of extended leave during life changing events.
   Senator Dodd has long fought for working families. He is the author of the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which has allowed more than 50 million workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave if they are ill or if they need to care for a sick family member or new child. Senator Dodd worked for seven years and through two Presidential vetoes to ensure that families could care for their loved ones in times of need.
