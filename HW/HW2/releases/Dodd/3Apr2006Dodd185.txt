SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIKORSKY STRIKE RESOLUTION
  "This has been a very difficult ordeal for the workers at Sikorsky. They have endured much and I know how tough it has been on them and their families. I'm pleased that this conflict has been settled but I would hope that Sikorsky management would continue to listen to the voices of these workers so this does not occur again in the future. This episode underscores the urgent need to address the desperate lack of decent, affordable health care for America's working men and women and their children."
