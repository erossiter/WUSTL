SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $1.9 MILLION FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN CONNECTICUT
  An eastern Connecticut Head Start initiative will receive $1,873,474 in federal funds to boost education and child development for low-income children, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded Eastern Connecticut Regional Educational Service Center (EASTCONN) in Hampton a grant to help administer Head Start initiatives to 36 towns and school boards throughout eastern Connecticut. 
   "Head Start provides Connecticut children with the necessary skills to begin the life-long journey of education," Dodd said. "By providing them with the right start we ensure that our youth grow up in a healthy environment and with the possibility of unlimited opportunity. We need to continue to invest in America's future by fully funding Head Start." 
   "This funding is good news for Connecticut's future," Lieberman said. "Programs like Head Start are a critical part of our efforts to give Connecticut children a healthy beginning. Through these grassroots initiatives, we can reach at-risk kids and expand opportunities. Parents, communities, and children - everyone benefits from this." 
   Head Start provides comprehensive and innovative child development strategies that serve children from birth to age five, pregnant women, and their families. Head Start's child-focused services promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children. Grants support extensive child care and education efforts for children in low-income families including school readiness initiatives, disability services and literacy programs to help prepare children for school. 
   Head Start is locally administered by community-based non-profit organizations and school systems. The initiative has helped more than 21 million children nationwide since it began in 1964.
