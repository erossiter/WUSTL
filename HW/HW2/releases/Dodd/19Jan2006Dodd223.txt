SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NAVY SECRETARY WINTER'S VISIT
  "Sub Base New London and Electric Boat's workforce provide 'one stop shopping' for our nation when it comes to submarines.  
 It's critically important that both remain vibrant and viable in the 21st century. Our nation's security depends upon it. So I commend the Secretary of the Navy for coming to Southeastern Connecticut to see how both act in concert to fulfill our nation's submarine needs. But this should be considered a first step, and not the last. I intend to continue to press the Bush Administration and the Navy to immediately increase submarine production because it is clear that our nation needs more submarines - and not less. We simply can't afford to continue to allow our submarine industrial base - which are the skilled workers at Electric Boat - to be lost."
