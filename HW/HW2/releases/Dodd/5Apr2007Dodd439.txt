CONNECTICUT'S RELIGIOUS LEADERS RALLY TO SUPPORT SEN. DODD'S RESTORING CONSTITUTION ACT
  Today, an interfaith group comprised of many of Connecticut's top religious leaders held a press conference in Hartford to express support for the Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007, legislation Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) introduced in February which would restore Habeas Corpus rights, bar evidence gained through torture or coercion and reinstate U.S. adherence to the Geneva Conventions. The bill is also supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, the Center for Victims of Torture, Open Society Institute, and Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International. 
   "Righting the wrongs of the Military Commission Act becomes more critical with each passing day, and consequently the Restoring the Constitution Act is becoming an increasingly crucial piece of legislation," said Dodd. "I am greatly heartened by the support and commitment to this important issue shown by people across the country, especially here in Connecticut, and I am hopeful that we can continue to work together to enact the Restoring the Constitution Act into law."  
   "I take a backseat to no one when it comes to protecting this country from terrorists," Dodd continued. "But there is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this. It's clear the people who perpetrated horrendous crimes against our country and our people have no moral compass and deserve to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But in taking away their legal rights, the rights first codified in our country's Constitution, we're taking away our own moral compass, as well."
   The event, which was organized by Reclaiming the Prophetic Voice, was attended by Reverend Dr. Davida Foy Crabtree, Conference Minister of the Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ; the Most Reverend Peter Rosazza, Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford; Doctor Ingrid Mattson, President of the Islamic Society of North America and Professor of Islamic Studies at Hartford Seminary; Rabbi Dr. Herbert Brockman, Congregation Mishkan Israel in Hamden; and Reverend Dr. Alvan Johnson, Bethel AME Church in Bloomfield, along with several other religious leaders. A senior member of Senator Dodd's staff was also in attendance, and delivered a letter from Senator Dodd. 
   The full text of the letter is below:
   Dear Friends:
   I am pleased to support Members of the Connecticut Congressional delegation, religious leaders, and Reclaiming the Prophetic Voice in standing against President Bush's misguided policy on military commissions. Although I unfortunately cannot attend today's event, I believe we are taking a critical step in reasserting American values and our commitment to the rule of law. 
   The Military Commissions Act of 2006 has severely weakened our nation's standing throughout the world and placed the system designed to prosecute enemy combatants under a cloud of legal uncertainty. In order to undo the damage done by the Military Commissions Act, I introduced the Restoring the Constitution Act on February 13, 2007. 
   Specifically, this legislation will overturn many of the provisions of the Military Commissions Act, by:
   * Restoring the writ of habeas corpus for individuals held in U.S. custody;
   * Narrowing the definition of unlawful enemy combatant to individuals who directly participate in hostilities against the United States in a zone of active combat, who are not lawful combatants; 
   * Requiring that the United States live up to its Geneva Convention obligations by deleting a prohibition in the law that bars detainees from invoking the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights at trial; 
   * Permitting the accused to retain qualified civilian attorneys to represent them at trial; 
   * Preventing the use of evidence in court gained through the unreliable and immoral practices of torture and coercion; 
   * Charging the military judge with the responsibility for ensuring that the jury is appropriately informed as to the sources, methods and activities associated with developing out of court statements proposed to be introduced at trial, or alternatively that the statement is not introduced; 
   * Empowering military judges to exclude hearsay evidence they deem to be unreliable; 
   * Authorizing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to review decisions by the military commissions; 
   * Limiting the authority of the President to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions and makes that authority subject to congressional and judicial oversight; 
   * Clarifying the definition of war crimes in statute to include certain violations of the Geneva Conventions; and 
   * Providing for expedited judicial review of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to determine the constitutionally of its provisions. 
   The Restoring the Constitution Act will remedy much of the damage done by the ill-considered and dangerous Military Commissions Act. I am greatly heartened by the support and commitment to this important issue shown by the distinguished Members of Congress, religious leaders, and citizens of Connecticut gathered here today. I thank Reclaiming the Prophetic Voice for organizing today's event and I look forward to working with everyone here to enact the Restoring the Constitution Act.
