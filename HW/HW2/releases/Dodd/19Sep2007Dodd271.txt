SEN. DODD EXPRESSES FRUSTRATION THAT AMENDMENT PROVIDING TROOPS MORE TIME AT HOME IS DEFEATED
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) expressed frustration that an amendment which would have provided members of the Armed Forces who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan the same amount of time at home before being redeployed, was unable to go to vote. The Webb-Hagel Amendment stated that no unit or member of a reserve component, including the National Guard, could be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment.  
   "Since this war's beginning I have tried to advance initiatives that would reverse this Administration's irresponsible defense policies, so that our troops would be prepared and protected in combat and our country made safer," said Dodd. "I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues continue to support this Administration's failed polices at the expense of our troops by blocking legislation which would have allowed our brave men and women to spend the same amount of time at home as they have overseas. Republicans constantly say they 'support our troops,' but I must ask, where is their support now?" 
   Senator Dodd has long called for a change of course in Iraq. Yesterday, Dodd filed an amendment which calls for a firm and enforceable timetable for all combat forces to redeploy out from Iraq by April 30, 2008. The amendment also sets an interim deadline of January 31, 2008 when at least 50,000 US troops must be redeployed out of Iraq. Failure to meet the interim deadline would result in temporarily withholding funding.
