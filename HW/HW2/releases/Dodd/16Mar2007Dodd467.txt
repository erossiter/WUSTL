SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL GRANTS FOR THREE CONNECTICUT FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today awards totaling more than $150,000 for three Connecticut fire departments. The grants were made possible through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   "We owe our firefighters our deepest gratitude for the work they do, but they also deserve our utmost support." said Dodd. "These grants will help to provide the equipment and training necessary to protect our firefighters and help them continue to keep their communities safe."
   The following fire departments were awarded federal grants:
   Newington Volunteer Fire Department - $82,275
   Attawaugan Fire Department (Dayville) - $28,975
   Newtown Hook & Ladder - $42,812
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have long been outspoken advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which supports local fire departments in purchasing new equipment and initiating education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of the Department of Homeland Security, has distributed 360 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
