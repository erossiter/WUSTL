SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTHERN IRELAND
  "Today marks a historic and positive step towards establishing a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party, under the leadership of Reverend Ian Paisley and Sinn Fein, under the leadership of Gerry Adams, reached a momentous power-sharing agreement for Northern Ireland, scheduled to come into effect on May 8. I strongly agree with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern who remarked that today's developments were "unprecedented and very positive."  
   "This agreement represents a beacon of hope for all of Northern Ireland's citizens, and as well as of those who have long worked to bring both nationalists and unionists together in a coalition government. Moreover, today's agreement should serve as a positive beacon for the world, demonstrating that reconciliation and power-sharing is possible, even after years of overwhelming sectarian division and violence.
   "It is my hope that all parties will continue down this path of peace and collaboration for the current and future generations of Northern Ireland."
