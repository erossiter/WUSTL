SENS. DODD, GRASSLEY INTRODUCE MEASURE CREATING MEMORIAL TO HONOR AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT IN REVOLUTIONARY WAR
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) today introduced legislation creating a memorial to honor the role both freed and enslaved African Americans played in fighting for our nation's independence during the American Revolution. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Donald Payne (D-NJ).  
   "The depth and breadth of patriotic contributions by African Americans in the Revolutionary War have gone practically unacknowledged," Dodd said. "Historians now estimate that 5,000 slaves and free blacks fought in the armed services during that harrowing time. They served and struggled in major battles from Lexington and Concord to Yorktown and made significant contributions to the revolutionary effort. It is time for us to recognize their sacrifice and their impact."
   "A national memorial is long overdue for African-Americans, like Iowan Cato Mead, who fought for our nation's independence during the American Revolution. It will be a great help to broaden Americans' understanding of the diversity of the patriots of the Revolutionary War," Grassley said.
   Originally passed in 1986, the legislation authorized the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation to raise money for the creation of the memorial, since federal funds are not used for any memorials on the National Mall. The legislation introduced by Senators Dodd and Grassley would authorize the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to raise funds instead. The memorial will be located at Constitution Gardens on the National Mall.
