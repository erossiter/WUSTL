SEN. DODD CO-SPONSORS 'NET NEUTRALITY' ACT
  Sen. Chris Dodd has signed on as a co-sponsor of the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, S.2917. The bill will help encourage the development of new technology and help ensure that all Americans have uninhibited access to content on the Internet, regardless of the service they choose to utilize - so-called "net neutrality." 
   "There is no denying that the internet has revolutionized the way that Americans work, communicate, and access information. With more Americans accessing broadband and other high speed technology, the Internet will certainly continue to serve as an important tool for technological innovation," Dodd said. "It's imperative that Congress helps to continue and expand the free flow of information on the Internet to ensure that access providers do not pick and choose which sites to give priority to."
