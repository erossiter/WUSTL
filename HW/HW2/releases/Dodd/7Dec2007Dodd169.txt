SEN. DODD MEETS WITH MINISTER, DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND
  Today, U.S. Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) had a historic meeting with Reverend Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively, of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Dodd meet with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to hear firsthand what the United States should do to support Northern Ireland's path toward irreversible peace. 
   Dodd has been a longtime supporter of the Irish Peace Process. In 1993, Dodd convinced President Clinton to permit Gerry Adams to visit the United States to begin the Northern Ireland Peace Process, a decision which helped culminate in the 1998 Good Friday Accords. Dodd has worked tirelessly with colleagues Senator Ted Kennedy and former Senator George Mitchell to support the Clinton and Bush administration's efforts to help establish a new chapter for the people of Northern Ireland.
