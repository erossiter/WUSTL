SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $36 MILLION IN GRANTS TO PROVIDE BETTER HOUSING FOR CONNECTICUT'S LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS
  Bridgeport and the State of Connecticut will receive $36,738,023 to provide resources for low-income family housing, spur economic revitalization in local low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and provide public services to the homeless and low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today.  
   "Connecticut's neediest deserve a roof over their heads, not a ceiling over their dreams," Dodd said. "This assistance will not only help build better, more affordable homes, but will provide the support these families and individuals need as they pursue home ownership - and, ultimately, a brighter future."
   "By supporting local projects that revitalize our neighborhoods, increase the supply of affordable housing, foster economic development and provide services for Connecticut's neediest residents, this funding will help to improve the quality of the lives and environment of our entire state," said Lieberman. 
   The following Grants were allocated:
   * Community Development Block Grant - Bridgeport $3,946,000
   * Emergency Shelter Grant - Bridgeport $146,757
   * Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS grant - Bridgeport $779,000

   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated five types of grants to help provide families and individuals in Connecticut with adequate affordable housing in safe neighborhoods. The Community Development Block Grant initiative helps local governments and communities build and rehabilitate affordable housing, as well as address other economic development needs. 
   American Dreams Downpayment Initiative grants, provided under the HOME initiative, will help low-income minorities with homeownership by providing necessary resources for down payment and closing cost associated with the purchase of a new home. Other HOME grants will help expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low- and very low-income families. 
   The last two types of grants for Connecticut and Bridgeport are Emergency Shelters Grants and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS grants. The Emergency Shelters Grants will help improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters. Lastly, the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS grants will administer resources for supportive services for low-income persons medically diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and their families.
