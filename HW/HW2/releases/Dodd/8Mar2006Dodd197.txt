SEN. DODD'S LEGISLATION TO BAN MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Dodd today introduced an amendment to the lobbying reform bill (S. 2349, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act) to ban Senators and staff from accepting meals from registered lobbyists. The measure passed unanimously. 
   "We must restore the public's faith in this government and banning free meals, while only one of many steps, can go a long way in demonstrating our commitment to reform. The only 'special interest' in Washington should be the public's interest."
