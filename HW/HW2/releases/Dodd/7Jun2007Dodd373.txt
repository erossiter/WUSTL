SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JAMES HOLSINGER
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on the nomination of James Holsinger: 
   "The nomination of James Holsinger demonstrates yet again how this Administration puts politics above the health and well-being of our nation's citizens. I fear that Dr. Holsinger's previous comments and actions will prevent him from representing each and every individual - the job of the Surgeon General. The upcoming nomination hearing process will be an opportunity to formally place Dr. Holsinger's views on the record. The Bush Administration should use the position of the Surgeon General to improve and promote the Nation's public health not to polarize it."
