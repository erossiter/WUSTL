SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT
  Statement of Senator Dodd on the passage of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act: 
   "Today's passage of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act is a long overdue investment in the future of the United States. At a time when our world is growing more complex and interconnected, it is essential that higher education remains within reach of every American so that all of our students are prepared to compete in the global marketplace. We live in a time when far too many students and their families are getting priced out of college and the American dream. 
   "While I applaud my colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their tireless dedication to this legislation, which will help make college more affordable for middle class families feeling the financial squeeze, there is still more to be done. I would urge my colleagues that in the future we consider requiring the entire student loan volume to be converted to a federally-run auction system. Ending today's outdated system of excessive corporate subsidies will generate a minimum of $18 billion in taxpayer savings over four years - savings that can be used to provide additional aid to students who need it most. 
   "I will also continue to work with my colleagues on the Banking Committee to help make sure that private student lending practices are more affordable, fair, and transparent so the public can be confident that students and families are obtaining the most competitive and affordable student loans with the fairest terms. If our children are to achieve their highest aspirations, and if our nation's economic backbone is to continue to grow strong, then we must ensure that the financial doors of higher education remain open for all who have the desire and ability to walk through them."
