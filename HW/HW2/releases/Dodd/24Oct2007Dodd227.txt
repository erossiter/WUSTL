SEN. DODD: NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF FAILED CUBA POLICY MUST END
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today reacted to President Bush's remarks on the Cuban government. 
   "Once again President Bush keeps the United States on the sidelines as a transition in Cuba is already underway, and I think that the President's remarks about the Cuban military were dangerous and inflammatory.
   We have an opportunity to help and support the peaceful transition to democracy by restoring American citizens' right to travel to Cuba and be the citizen diplomats who can help pave the way to freedom and democracy in Cuba. Instead the President continues to allow his fixation with the Castro brothers to stand in the way of a sensible policy with respect to Cuba. Nearly fifty years of a failed Cuba policy must end."
