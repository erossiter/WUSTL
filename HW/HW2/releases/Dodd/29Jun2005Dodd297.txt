SENS. DODD, TALENT ANNOUNCE UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jim Talent (R-Mo.) today announced their bipartisan plan to create an office within the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Civil Rights-era murders like the Emmett Till case. Talent and Dodd this week will introduce the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act which would establish a special section within the DOJ to unearth the truth in these cases and when possible bring the guilty to justice.  
   "Our Nation stands for the principle of equal justice for all. Yet for far too long, many Americans have been denied equal justice - and many despicable criminals have not been held accountable," said U.S. Senator Chris Dodd. "This legislation seeks to right the wrongs of the past and bring to justice people who perpetrated heinous crimes because of racial hatred. It cannot bring back and make whole those who suffered and died by a racist's criminal hand. But it can at least reaffirm our Nation's commitment to seek the truth and make equal justice a reality."
   "The blatant failure for decades to bring Emmett Till's murderers to justice was and is a national disgrace," said U.S. Senator Jim Talent. "The idea for this legislation grew out of the Emmett Till case and discussions I had with Alvin Sykes, a Civil Rights leader in Kansas City and President of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign. It became clear that we needed to create an office to investigate unsolved murders that occurred in the era before there was vigorous enforcement of federal law. Last week's conviction of Edgar Ray Killen was a step in the right direction, but we believe there should be a special section within the Department of Justice to give older cases the attention they deserve. We need to unearth the truth and do justice because there can not be healing without the truth."
   The Talent-Dodd proposal would create the Unsolved Crimes Section, an office within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to focus specifically on unsolved Civil Rights era murders. The bill would authorize up to $5 million annually for the new Section.
   The Unsolved Crimes Section will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting pre-1970 cases that resulted in death and still remain unsolved in coordination with state and local law enforcement officials. The Section Chief would be responsible for prosecuting these cases and would be required to report to Congress and the American people on their actions.
   If a crime other than murder is discovered during the course of an investigation it will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement officials. The Section would report its findings to Congress annually on September 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.
   Key Components of the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act:
   * NEW OFFICE FOCUSED ON UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS MURDERS - The Unsolved Crimes Section will specifically target "cold case" murders from the Civil Rights-era. The bill would authorize up to $5 million annually for the new office.
   * SEEKING THE TRUTH - Through aggressive investigation, prosecution and reporting, the new Unsolved Crimes Section will shed light on the unsolved deaths from the civil rights era, allowing victims' families to rest easier knowing the truth. 
   * PROSECUTE CRIMINALS - The mission of the Unsolved Crimes Section is to aggressively investigate and prosecute criminals in coordination with state and local law enforcement officials.
   * REFERAL OF OTHER UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS - If during the course of an investigation a crime other than murder is discovered, it will be promptly referred to the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.
   * ACCOUNTABILITY TO CONGRESS - The Unsolved Crimes Section Chief will provide a report on its activities to Congress annually on September 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.
