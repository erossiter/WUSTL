SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON LEGACY OF PARKS
  Statement of Sen. Chris Dodd on the Legacy of Rosa Parks 
   "Fifty years ago, through a simple but brave act of defiance, Rosa Parks became the guiding light for the Montgomery bus boycott and a catalyst for a major chapter in the civil rights movement. Since that time, our nation has taken some major steps toward racial equality, but, clearly, the work is not yet complete. As we pause to reflect on the life and legacy of Rosa Parks, it is important that we remember the inequities that many Americans still face. The best way we can honor her memory is to ensure that laws such as the Voting Rights Act and the Help America Vote Act are extended and enforced so that every American has an equal opportunity to shape the future of our nation and build a society that is truly just and free."
