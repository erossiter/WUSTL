SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT AMENDMENT
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) announced his intention to introduce an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill which would set an enforceable deadline for completing the redeployment of US combat troops from Iraq by April 30, 2008. The amendment calls for ending the financing of US combat operations and mandates a phased redeployment of US troops. The amendment also proposes redirecting any savings from a reduced military presence in Iraq to our war-battered National Guard and armed services.  
   "None of our choices are easy, but they are clear," said Dodd. "We must choose the policy that is best for our nation, even in the face of extreme difficulty. Every additional day we "stay the course" in Iraq our nation is less safe and the people of Iraq get further away from coming together to fashion a political and diplomatic solution to their civil conflict. Our men and women in uniform have served this nation valiantly in Iraq and they will continue do so until our political leaders see the error of their ways and begin the process of drawing down the US troop presence. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for an enforceable date to begin redeploying US troops. We must end this disastrous war now." 
   Dodd's amendment calls for a specific timetable for all combat forces to redeploy out from Iraq by April 30, 2008. The amendment also sets an interim deadline of January 31, 2008 when at least 50,000 US troops must be redeployed out of Iraq. Failure to meet the interim deadline would result in temporarily withholding funding.
   Senator Dodd has long called for the President to change course in Iraq. Dodd believes Iraq cannot be won militarily and that in order for Iraq to stabilize and obtain lasting peace, there must be political reconciliation. Dodd believes Iraq is not a military failure, but a political one.
