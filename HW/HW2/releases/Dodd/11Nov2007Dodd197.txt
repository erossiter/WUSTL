SEN. DODD RESPONDS TO FREDDIE MAC'S THIRD QUARTER LOSSES
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, made the following remarks in reaction to Freddie Mac's announced $2 billion loss in the third quarter. Freddie Mac is America's 2nd largest buyer and guarantor of home loans. 
   "Today's announcement by Freddie Mac, like the recent announcements of other financial firms over the past several weeks, underscores exactly how abusive home lending has created serious instability in the housing and credit markets as a whole, and thereby in the broader economy. We must continue to pursue both strong regulatory and legislative responses to the crisis, both to protect homeowners and to create a set of standards so that homebuyers, investors, and lenders can safely re-enter the mortgage markets."
