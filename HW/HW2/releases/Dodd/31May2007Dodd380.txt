SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON EXECUTIVE PAY
  Statement of Chairman Dodd on Executive Pay 
   "I look forward to reviewing Sen. Obama's request. As with all issues under the Banking Committee's jurisdiction, I welcome the input of my colleagues on the Committee and other members of Congress. Earlier this year, I voiced concern about executive compensation levels. As I have said in the past, this issue speaks to deeper problems with our nation's economy and, specifically, the growing gap between rich and poor. Incomes for working families have leveled off even though the costs of daily necessities have increased. This discrepancy conflicts with the fundamental American belief that with hard work come opportunities to fulfill the American dream such as homeownership and sending one's children to college. As Chairman, I am examining several options to address this issue, and am having conversations with Sen. Shelby and others. I will seek to find an appropriate time to address this very important issue."
