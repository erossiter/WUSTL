SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN PRAISE FINAL SENATE PASSAGE OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) secured $45 million in authorized spending for Connecticut water resource projects within The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 Conference Report, a bill that the Senate passed last night. The legislation gives the Army Corps of Engineers authority to undertake essential water resource studies and to construct and modify water resource projects that will help Connecticut communities ensure the safety and cleanliness of their water supplies, restore marine habitats, and improve navigation in working harbors. The conference report was passed by the House of Representatives last month and will now be sent to the President's desk for his signature.  
    "Connecticut's economic vitality - and that of every state - is based on sound infrastructure," said Dodd. "I am pleased that Congress has finally passed the Water Resources Development Act, enabling economic development and investment in clean water for Connecticut towns and shellfish habitat restoration in Long Island Sound. Congress has done its part. Now it is up to President Bush to quickly sign the bill so it can become law."
   "I commend the passage of this essential and long overdue legislation" Lieberman said. "This is an important step to guarantee that safe drinking water is available to everyone in Connecticut. I have been a strong advocate for the restoration of Long Island Sound, and I am concerned that Connecticut's oyster population has decreased rapidly in recent years. Funding for these projects will enable the careful maintenance and preservation of the environment in our state."

   * $25,000,000 for the restoration of oyster and other shellfish habitat in Long Island Sound.
