SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF QUINEBAUG AND SHETUCKET RIVERS VALLEY NATIONAL HERITAGE CORRIDOR AMENDMENT
  Statement of Senator Dodd on Committee Passage of the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor Amendment: 
   "Today we are another step closer to ensuring that the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor will be preserved and enjoyed for years to come. 'The Last Green Valley,' as the corridor is often called, is one of the most extraordinary rural landscapes in the Northeast, and I commend my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for recognizing its value and approving legislation to extend its designation as a National Heritage Corridor. I take great pride in supporting efforts to make this region a self-sustaining heritage area, and will continue to work toward passage of this legislation in the full Senate."
