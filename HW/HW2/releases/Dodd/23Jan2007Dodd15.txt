SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON 2007 STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH
  "I'm heartened to hear the President speak about creating a sustainable energy independence plan, expanding health care access for the millions of Americans who are uninsured, tackling comprehensive immigration reform and ensuring educational success for all Americans.  
   "But we all know actions speak louder than words. I urge the President to meet with Republicans and Democrats, all of whom have much to bring to the table concerning these issues, and demonstrate his willingness and desire to work to address these critical issues in a bipartisan manner. 
   "I remain steadfastly opposed to the President's plan for Iraq, sending thousands more of our nation's men and women into harm's way in a country in the midst of a civil war. The nation has overwhelmingly rejected the direction this war has gone in, and the direction the President seems insistent on moving forward with. Tomorrow in the Foreign Relations Committee, I will offer the legislation I introduced last week which limits troop levels in Iraq without new authorization by Congress in advance. The war in Iraq is too serious for Congress to simply express its opinion, this is the time to take meaningful action to stop this escalation now."
