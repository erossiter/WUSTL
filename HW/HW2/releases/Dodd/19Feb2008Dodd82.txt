SEN. DODD ON FIDEL CASTRO'S RESIGNATION: AMERICA CAN TURN NEW PAGE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, today issued the following statement in reaction to Fidel Castro's resignation: 
   "The United States' embargo on Cuba is one of the most backward and ineffective foreign policies in history. Today, America has an opportunity to finally turn a new page. We must begin the process of opening up diplomatic and commercial relations with Havana, and help Cuba and the United States transition to a new era and relationship - one of freedom, democracy, and prosperity for the Cuban people, and one of mutual respect between our two nations."
