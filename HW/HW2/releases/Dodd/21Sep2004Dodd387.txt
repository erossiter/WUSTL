SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN HAIL COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that Connecticut could share in more than $40.5 billion in new federal funds to help fight crime develop the manufacturing sector in Connecticut and across the country. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the funds last Wednesday, September 15 as part of the appropriations bill that covers the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State. 
   "This measure can help fuel a number of critically important initiatives in Connecticut," said Dodd. "It provides vital resources to help make our state safer, stronger, and cleaner."
   "This bill will help protect Connecticut's families by strengthening our crime-fighting campaign," Lieberman said. "It's also important that the federal government will be able to support such a diverse and significant group of research, education and environmental initiatives. Projects like these will help to protect the oceans, rivers and maritime industries that make up a critical part of Connecticut's character."
   Included in the spending package is $112 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a network of not-for-profit centers in over 400 locations nationwide, whose sole purpose is to provide small and medium-sized manufacturers with the help they need in implementing the most advanced manufacturing technologies and processes to succeed as we compete with low wage countries, such as China. Lieberman, Co-Chair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, and Dodd, also a member of the Task Force, have fought to have this critical funding included in the bill.
   The bill now goes to the Senate floor for a vote, and then final details on the bill will be negotiated in a House-Senate conference committee later this year. A breakdown of Senate-approved funding for specific Connecticut projects is listed below.
   * $200,000 for the Women's Business Development Center in Stamford, which provides entrepreneurial education and professional development services to low- and moderate-income women in Fairfield and New Haven Counties.
   * $300,000 for Family Re-Entry, Inc. for a prisoner re-entry pilot program in Bridgeport. The pilot project will provide a range of counseling and educational services to former inmates of Connecticut correctional facilities, thereby facilitating their successful re-entry into society and significantly reducing recidivism.
   * $200,000 for Central Connecticut State University's Institute of Technology and Business Development. The Institute will increase the competitiveness of Connecticut's manufacturing industry by transferring the latest computer and design technology to area businesses and by helping to train a skilled manufacturing workforce.
   * $750,000 for the University of Connecticut Health Center's "Breaking the Cycle of Behavioral Health Problems and Crime" program. Poor health in early childhood foreshadows not only a costly long-term susceptibility to illness, but can also, in some cases, lead to a higher risk of criminal behavior. UCONN's behavioral health study will evaluate a prevention program aimed at reducing criminal involvement in at-risk and incarcerated parents and their children.
   * $500,000 for Amistad America youth development programs aboard the Freedom Schooner Amistad. With these funds, AMISTAD America will continue a program designed to bring youth and their adult mentors into the field to view first-hand a reconstruction of La Amistad.
   * $1,000,000 for the City for Stamford to upgrade its system for emergency responder communications. Because of its close proximity to New York City, Stamford is clearly a critical regional center of commerce and transportation, and these funds will help the City prevent and respond to the threat of emergencies.
   * $1,000,000 for the University of Connecticut's "Long Island Sound Integrated Coastal Observing System" (LISICOS). With more than 14 million residents within its drainage basin and 5 million residents within 15 miles of its coast, the Long Island Sound is one of the nation's most important urban estuaries. By allowing the University to monitor the environmental quality of the Sound, LISICOS allows researchers to help to address the complex and poorly understood processes contributing to the productivity and health of the Sound.
