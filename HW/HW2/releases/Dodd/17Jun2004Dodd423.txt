SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR CONNECTICUT SNOW REMOVAL
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today announced the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will reimburse Connecticut's Department of Transportation for costs incurred as a direct result of the record snowstorm on December 5-6, 2003.  
 The $1 million Public Assistance grant reimburses Connecticut's Department of Transportation for snow removal costs in seven counties. The counties include Fairfield, Hartford, Litchfield, New Haven, Tolland, Windham, and New London. 
   "Snow may magically melt away but the bills from the winter don't," said Dodd. "Thankfully, this assistance can help alleviate some of financial burden for communities in our state."
   "I'm thankful to FEMA for helping Connecticut dig out from under the avalanche of costs created by December's snow emergency," Lieberman said. "This is a great example of what can be accomplished when federal, state, and local government agencies work together to improve people's lives."
   The Public Assistance program is administered by the state of Connecticut. Eligible emergency related costs are reimbursed to state and local governments and certain non-profit organizations that provide essential governmental services.
   To date FEMA has obligated over $8.4 million to 207 applicants in Connecticut.
