SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE $365,000 FOR RUNAWAY YOUTH IN CONNECTICUT
  Three Connecticut non-profit organizations will receive a total of $365,000 in grants to help support Connecticut's runaway and homeless youth, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The resources will provide needed food, clothing, shelter, and counseling to runaway and homeless youth in Connecticut. 
   "This funding will help provide Connecticut's youth a place to turn to when they have nowhere else to go," said Dodd. "These youth are our future, and we need to make sure they get back on the right path in order to reach their full potential."
   "When children run away from home, they are at great risk of falling prey to a life on the street," said Lieberman. "These grants will help provide runaway children with the necessary food, clothing, and shelter to protect them from the dangers they face."
   Grants have been awarded to the following non-profit agencies:
   * The Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport, Inc. - $140,000
  * Youth Continuum Inc. - New Haven $100,000
  * Kids in Crisis, Inc. - Cos Cob $125,000
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Family and Youth Services Bureau allocated two Basic Center Program grants and one Street Outreach Program grant in Connecticut. Kids in Crisis, Inc. in Cos Cob and The Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport, Inc. will both receive Basic Center Program grants to provide a system of care for youth runaways outside the traditional child protective services, law enforcement, or juvenile justice agencies. The resources will be primarily used to provide these youth with emergency shelter, food, clothing, counseling, and referrals for health care.
   The third grant, a Street Outreach Program grant for the Youth Continuum Inc., in New Haven, is designed to protect and treat young people who have been, or are at risk of being sexually abused and help them leave the streets. Funds are used to provide access to emergency shelter, treatment and counseling, prevention and education activities, crisis intervention, and follow-up support.
