SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PAKISTAN
  "The foundations of this most recent turmoil in Pakistan are rooted in the Bush Administration's failed foreign policy and the disastrous decision to pull out of Afghanistan before the job was done. President Bush, with his sole focus on invading Iraq, expected far too much from President Musharraf. Secretary Rice has only made matters worse by publicly pressuring the Pakistani government instead of quietly examining the possibility of a coalition government. The events unfolding in Pakistan are yet another example of how our nation, and indeed the world, is less safe thanks to President Bush."
