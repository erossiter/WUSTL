NORWICH RECEIVES MORE THAN $1.2 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PUBLIC SERVICES
  Norwich will receive $1,215,000 to rehabilitate low- and middle-income family housing, spur economic revitalization in local neighborhoods, and provide public services to the homeless, children, and the elderly, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today.
   "This assistance will replace dim economic prospects with a brighter future for people in Norwich," said Dodd. "It can help people find work and give families a place to live - two major priorities that desperately need attention during times of economic distress."
   "By supporting local projects that revitalize our neighborhoods, foster economic development and provide services for Connecticut's neediest residents, this funding will help to improve the quality of the life and the environment in our entire state," said Lieberman.
   The funds were awarded as part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG), which helps local governments and communities build and rehabilitate affordable housing, as well as address other economic development needs.
   Norwich will use the community development funding for a broad range of initiatives including residential and commercial neighborhood revitalization; improvements to community facilities, assistance for the Norwich Housing Authority, and child development activities.
