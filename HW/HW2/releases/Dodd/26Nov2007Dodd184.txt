SEN. DODD JOINS EFFORT TO HALT CONSOLIDATION OF MEDIA OWNERSHIP
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today announced his intention to cosponsor a bill that would help ensure that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maintain rules that encourage diversity in media ownership. The legislation, which was introduced by Senators Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Trent Lott (R-MS), would require 90 days for the public to comment on any new media ownership rules proposed by the FCC. It would also establish an independent panel to study the representation of women and minorities in broadcast media ownership.  
   "Diversity in the media is a critical component to maintaining a healthy democracy," said Dodd. "I'm very worried that we are moving in a direction where too much power is being held in the hands of too few corporations. The FCC needs to ensure that minority and women-owned media outlets are not reduced further in favor of major conglomerations. A free, vibrant press is at its best when diverse views are represented. I look forward to continuing to work to enact this critically important legislation into law."
