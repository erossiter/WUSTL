SEN. DODD INTRODUCES MOTHER AND CHILD PROTECTION BILL
  Responding to a new, deeply troubling report by Save the Children estimating that about 2 million babies die within the first 24 hours of life and a total of 4 million die within the first month of life, Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., today introduced legislation to provide a national strategy and resources to address this worldwide crisis. "If these staggering and almost unfathomable numbers were associated with an earthquake or hurricane, they would prompt a worldwide and immediate reaction," said Dodd. "Each of these numbers represents a child and a life cut short. We can't simply afford to idly sit by as this death toll climbs. This measure can help ensure that much greater attention and resources are committed to hopefully help alleviate this growing crisis." 
   The Dodd legislation, the Child Health Investment for Long-term Development (CHILD and Newborn) Act, is cosponsored by Senator Gordon Smith, R-Ore. The measure will, among other things:
   * Double current funding for child survival and maternal health initiatives and require the US government to develop an integrated strategy for improving child and maternal health, and to create an inter-agency task force (headed by USAID) responsible for its implementation. 
  * Establish guidelines for child survival programs, including building local capacity, collaborating with non-governmental organizations and local partners, focusing on the poorest, and coordinating with other donors. 
  * Require the President to submit an annual report on efforts to promote child and maternal health globally, as well as an assessment of the US contribution toward achieving the UN's Millennium Development Goals. 
  * Create a Child Survival Fund, the goal of which is to achieve significant reductions in mortality rates for mothers, newborns, and children under 5 years of age. 
   It is estimated that 11 million children under the age of five die every year in the developing world. For children under the age of five, preventable or treatable diseases such as measles, tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria are the most common causes of death.
