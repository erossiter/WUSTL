SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $500,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Four Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $566,203 in federal grants to improve operations and firefighter safety, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  
   "We can and should do much more to protect families from the devastating effects of fire, and firefighters deserve to have the resources to provide that security," said Dodd. "After working hand-in-hand with firefighters for years to make this vision a reality, I'm pleased that these funds will be the first step in making sure these brave men and women have the training and equipment they need to keep our communities safe." 
   "Connecticut firefighters stand willing to risk their lives each and every day to make sure we're safe. The least we can do is provide them with the tools needed to do their job properly," Lieberman said. "These grants are an important step toward making sure first responders have the education, training and equipment they need to protect communities across the country." 
   The following fire departments will receive grant awards: 
   * Long Ridge Fire Company Inc.(Stamford): $204,250 
   * East Granby Volunteer Fire Department: $193,724 
   * Sterling Fire Department: $154,233 
   * West Thompson Ind. Fire Association No. 1 Inc. (North Grosvenordale): $13,996 
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 299 grants for a total of more than $28 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
