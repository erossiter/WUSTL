SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF REP. LANTOS
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today issued the following statement after it was announced that Representative Tom Lantos (D-CA) passed away this morning at the age of 80. Representative Lantos was the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress.  
   "America has lost a dedicated public servant and a remarkable person with the death of Representative Tom Lantos. I have had the privilege of working with Representative Lantos over the years in my capacity as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and found him to be a man of unwavering principle and steadfast commitment to the promotion of human rights. He overcame unspeakable obstacles to not only forge a new life for himself and his family in the United States, but also to serve as a member of the country's highest legislative body. His perspective will be sorely missed in the halls of Congress, and Jackie and my thoughts and prayers are with the Lantos family."
