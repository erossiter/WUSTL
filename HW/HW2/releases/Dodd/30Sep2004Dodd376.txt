SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE $400,000 GRANT TO ENHANCE HOMELAND SECURITY IN HARTFORD
  The Hartford Office of Emergency Services and Telecommunications Emergency Management Division will receive a $400,000 grant from the Department of Homeland Security, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Thursday. The grant will be used for planning, training and equipment needed to enhance the city's capability to respond to potential terrorist attacks involving radiological, nuclear, chemical, biological or explosive agents. Additionally, it provides resources to prepare for epidemic disease outbreaks, large scale hazardous materials accidents and major natural disasters.
   "This assistance can't magically shield Hartford from future dangers, but it can help ensure that the city is better prepared to deal with possible threats," said Dodd. "It can help provide critically important resources to help ensure that Hartford has the tools it needs to make sure the city has a united, prepared front when it comes to a possible crisis."
   "It is important now more than ever, as we continue to fight the war on terror, that we provide our communities with the resources they need to immediately respond to potential attacks," Lieberman said. "In emergency situations, effective communications and preparations can mean the difference between lives saved and lives lost. These grants will play a vital role in helping ensure that Hartford is adequately protected against terrorist threats and natural disasters."
   Since 1996, the Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) program has helped prepare highly populated areas for emergencies by providing funding for planning, training and equipment and strengthening relationships among first responders, public health officials, emergency management offices and volunteer organizations.
