SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF BILL TO READY STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE, WORKFORCE
  Sen. Dodd announced that a bill he co-authored, aimed at ensuring that vocational students and teachers have the latest technology available, has passed the Senate. Last year, Sen. Dodd met with teachers and faculty at Gateway Community Technical College to unveil the details of the bill, which will help guarantee that the Connecticut and American workforce is the strongest in the world. 
   "Essential to strengthening the workforce, Perkins not only prepares youth and adults for the careers of today, it prepares them for the careers of tomorrow," Dodd said. "And while this is not a perfect measure, I believe it will go a long way in helping another generation of Americans succeed, and in doing so, strengthen the American economy and increase our competitiveness worldwide."
   Recent reports have highlighted some of the challenges our nation faces economically. The Perkins bill will emphasize accountability and improved results to ensure that all career and technical education students receive the most-up-to-date and challenging education available. 
   Perkins works to ensure that students are not only trained with the latest technology, but that their teachers are, too. Outside of the classroom, the bill will help strengthen the ties between business, high schools, and colleges, including community colleges like Gateway, so that students are ready for college and work when they graduate. The bill aims to get high schools, industry, and colleges to work together to provide our workforce with the skills that they need in order to achieve and compete in the 21st Century.
