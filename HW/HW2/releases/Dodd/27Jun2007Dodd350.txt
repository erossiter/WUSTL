SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR PROTECTION OF CONNECTICUT MARINE LIFE
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) announced today that the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection will receive a grant for $219,563 from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. The grant money will be used to compile reports on quota monitoring, stock assessment, development, evaluation of fishery management plans (FMPs) and management measures, and to provide this information to marine staff. The grant also provides funds for enforcement of Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission management plans. 
   "The ocean is home to countless living organisms and much of Connecticut's marine economy depends on preserving and understanding their populations," said Dodd. "These funds will allow us to better monitor fish populations and the businesses that are dependant upon them, and help us learn how to ensure that both will be preserved for future Connecticut generations." 
   "The maritime industries make up a vital part of our state's character," said Lieberman. "This assistance will help us better understand, protect, and sustain both nature's intricate ecosystems and Connecticut's marine economy."
