SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON LEVIN-REED AMENDMENT
  Statement of Senator Dodd on the Levin-Reed Amendment: 
   "Today, the Republicans were given yet another chance to listen to the American people's call for a change of course in Iraq. Sadly those entreaties fell on deaf ears. Instead, the Senate Minority has chosen to stubbornly protect the President against efforts to change a failed Iraq policy, and the result will be additional loss of life and a continuation of civil war in Iraq. And, as the latest National Intelligence Estimate clearly shows, our continued involvement in Iraq is leaving our nation vulnerable to attack while diverting resources from the fight against terror. As each passing day unfolds with more chaos in Iraq and new evidence that the Administration's policy is threatening our national security, support for the President's course will continue its downward spiral. I will continue to fight for a firm redeployment deadline at every opportunity, and I am confident that the day will come when this Congress will have the courage to say enough is enough."
