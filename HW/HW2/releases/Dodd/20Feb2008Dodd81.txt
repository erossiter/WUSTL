SENS. DODD, SHELBY COMMENT ON 3COM ANNOUNCEMENT
  "Today's announcement demonstrates that the Foreign Investment and National Security Act (FINSA) that we co-authored is working, and federal agencies are taking appropriate action to protect our national security. Nonetheless, CFIUS' job is not yet complete when it comes to this transaction. Thanks to FINSA, even "withdrawn" transactions are to be monitored and reviewed. We look forward to working with the Administration to ensure that they conduct due diligence, in both protecting our national security and ensuring that appropriate foreign investment is not inhibited."
