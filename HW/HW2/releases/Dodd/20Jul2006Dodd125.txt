SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE SIGNIFICANT APPROPRIATIONS FOR CONNECTICUT'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved today the 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill, providing substantial support to Connecticut's defense industry. In part due to the efforts of Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman, (D-CT) the bill will help boost the Connecticut economy and ensure that U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are outfitted with the quality resources they need to perform their missions. 
   "This isn't everything I fought for, but on balance, it is a strong down payment on our national defense," Dodd said. "It also is another 'vote of confidence' for the workers in Connecticut who build the hi-tech weaponry that - whether in the air, undersea, or on the ground - protect our nation and helps fuel our state's economy and jobs." 
   "Our military's greatest successes have occurred when it has adapted to new times, new technologies, and new ways of thinking, planning and fighting," Lieberman said. "Never have we better needed new defense innovations than in fighting the dynamic war on terror evolving in the Middle East. This year's defense budget bolsters our strength and ability to adapt to the ever changing climate of war by ensuring America's military remains the best trained, best equipped and best led in the world. I am also pleased that this budget continues to recognize the tremendous contribution that Connecticut companies and the outstanding workers provide to keeping our country safe. I am proud to say that 'made in Connecticut' continues to be a guarantee of the highest quality weapons and equipment in the world."
