SEN. DODD MEETS WITH NORWICH MAYOR, DISCUSSES NEED FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today met with Mayor Ben Lathrop of Norwich to discuss the need for improvements to the city's sewage treatment plant. The aging infrastructure of the facility poses a threat to the environmental well-being of the Thames Estuary in southeastern Connecticut. In today's meeting, Mayor Lathrop and city officials outlined this threat and discussed the proposed improvement project with Senator Dodd. 
   "These upgrades to Norwich's wastewater treatment plant are critically important to protecting the environment of southeastern Connecticut and maintaining the area's pristine beauty," said Dodd. "I look forward to working with Mayor Lathrop to help ensure that the city of Norwich receives the resources it needs to complete this vital project. Preserving the environmental treasures of the waterways of eastern Connecticut and the Long Island Sound for future generations must be one of our top priorities."
