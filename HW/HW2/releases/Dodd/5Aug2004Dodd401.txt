SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $184,000 IN GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS
  Three Connecticut volunteer fire departments will receive a total of $184,098 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Thursday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 
   "Connecticut firefighters often are the first on the scene of a catastrophe. They shouldn't be last when it comes to getting critically important resources," said Dodd. "Thankfully this assistance - while only a start - can begin to address those tremendous shortcomings and provide our firefighters with the help they need and deserve."
   "Every day, fire fighters across the state risk their own lives for our safety," Lieberman said. "These grants provide the training and equipment Connecticut first responders need to protect our communities and do their job well."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   * Poquetanuck Volunteer Fire Department $87,480
  * Gardner Lake Volunteer Fire Department $52,302
  * Ashford Volunteer Fire Department $44,316
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed more than 16,000 grants for a total of more than $1.1 billion to help fire departments across the country strengthen their response capabilities.
