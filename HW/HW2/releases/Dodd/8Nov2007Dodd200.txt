SEN. DODD: GENERAL MUSHARRAF MUST ACCEPT THE DEMANDS OF THE PAKISTANI PEOPLE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following statement on the developing situation in Pakistan:
   "I urge General Musharraf not to move against either Benazir Bhutto or her supporters who are joining thousands of Pakistanis in protesting against the declaration of martial law. Rather, General Musharraf must accept the demands of the Pakistani people, Ms. Bhutto, and the international community to end martial law, immediately release all political prisoners, including lawyers, end the media blackout, and hold early and transparent elections. General Musharraf must also honor his longtime promise to take off his military uniform."
