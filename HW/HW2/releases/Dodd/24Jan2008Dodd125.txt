SEN. DODD DISCUSSES MUNICIPAL PRIORITIES WITH HARTFORD, BRIDGEPORT MAYORS
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today met with Mayor Eddie Perez of Hartford and Mayor Bill Finch of Bridgeport to discuss priorities for their respective cities in the coming year. Senator Dodd and the mayors, who were in Washington to attend a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, discussed the state of the nation's economy, local economic development, and transit in their discussion.  
   "As two of Connecticut's largest cities, Hartford and Bridgeport have so much to offer their residents and indeed, residents throughout the state of Connecticut," Dodd said. "I look forward to partnering with Mayors Perez and Finch on important issues to all of us, such as helping communities thrive through homeownership, expanding transit systems that ease traffic woes so people have a safe and effective way to get to work and school, and ensuring that the recent downturn in the economy does not disrupt the positive momentum both of these cities are striving toward." 
   One prominent concern for both cities is the mortgage crisis sweeping the nation. Both Bridgeport and Hartford have been hit hard by the tidal wave of foreclosures, which brings with it numerous challenges for local governments. Dodd, who is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, has made the mortgage crisis a top priority in his committee and has introduced legislation to help put an end to predatory lending practices and protect homeowners in Bridgeport, Hartford, and other communities across the nation. He has also recommended to Majority Leader Reid that any economic stimulus bill should include a provision to help local governments deal with foreclosed and abandoned properties.
