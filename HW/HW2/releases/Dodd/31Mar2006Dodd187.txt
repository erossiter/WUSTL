SEN. DODD UNVEILS PORT SECURITY LEGISLATION IN NEW LONDON
  Sen. Dodd today unveiled details of legislation, which was passed yesterday by the Senate Banking Committee, to address national security concerns related to foreign purchases of U.S. companies. Dodd authored several provisions of the bill. The issue came to the forefront during the controversy over the DP World deal to obtain the right to operate in several U.S. ports.  
   Dodd was joined by New London City Manager Richard Brown to discuss the legislation and security issues facing Connecticut. 
   "If there is a silver lining in the controversy surrounding DP World, it is that Congress and the American people are now aware that the approval process used by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is broken and are energized to fix it," said Dodd. "This legislation will significantly improve the CFIUS review process by providing a greater role for our intelligence agencies in these important national security decisions. It will also strengthen national security by creating better oversight, while at the same time ensuring that our country continues to welcome positive foreign investment." 
   Among other things, the bill:
   * Specifies that any transaction involving the purchase of a U.S. company by a foreign government will be subject to an extended 45-day investigation; 
  * Adds the Director of National Intelligence to the CFIUS Committee and ensures that the entire intelligence community will provide a full and complete review of national security implications; and 
  * Requires a mandatory reporting requirement for cases involving the takeover of critical U.S. infrastructure that could affect national security. 
   The bill now heads to the Senate floor for consideration.
