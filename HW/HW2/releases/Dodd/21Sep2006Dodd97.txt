SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HUGO CHAVEZ'S COMMENTS AT UN
  "Hugo Chavez's remarks at the United Nations yesterday were inappropriate. His behavior was destructive to the United Nations as an institution, and the UN delegates should publicly rebuke him for his intemperate remarks. What bothers me as much as his language is the fact that he believed he had the mandate to do so because the Bush Administration has allowed its preoccupation with Iraq and Afghanistan to distract our government from other important foreign policy imperatives, including remaining engaged in our own hemisphere. Historically, the United States has been a great friend to our neighbors in the Americas, and can be again if we re-engage with our neighbors."
