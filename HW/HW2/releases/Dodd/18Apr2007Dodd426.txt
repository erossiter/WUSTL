SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BOMBING IN IRAQ
  "Yet again the city of Baghdad is under attack - six separate bombs were detonated today causing the deaths of 170 Iraqis and injuries to an additional 190. One bombing alone - in the Sadriya marketplace - killed at least 115 people and uproots any sense of security Iraqis may have had to carry on with their day to day activities. Every day that our failed policy in Iraq continues, the difficulty of finding a political solution to Iraq's sectarian conflict increases, which is why I support the Feingold-Reid resolution which calls for combat forces to be redeployed by March 31, 2008. What more will it take for President Bush to abandon the status quo in Iraq and seek a surge in diplomacy instead of a surge in American and Iraqi deaths?"
