SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON GENERAL PACE'S COMMENTS
  "General Pace's comments were completely out of line. Many gay and lesbian members of our military have served their country honorably over the years and I find it outrageous that at a time when we need as many good people serving in the military as possible, we are still talking about excluding people based on their sexual orientation."
