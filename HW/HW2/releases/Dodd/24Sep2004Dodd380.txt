SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR MORE THAN $364,000 FOR TUNXIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today announced $364,280 for Tunxis Community College to help develop and implement college-based assessments of student and academic program performance.  
 The funding was allocated by the Department of Education as part of the Strengthening Institutions initiative.
   "Education is the key to future opportunities and success," said Dodd. "These critically important resources can help students step up to a higher academic level of achievement, and by doing so, access a brighter future."
   "In order for America to maintain its economic edge, our workers must continue to be the most highly-skilled and best-trained in the world," Lieberman said. "By providing Tunxis Community College with the tools necessary to help students meet these challenges, this new funding is a smart investment in our future."
   Tunxis Community College is a 2-year public institution with a student body of nearly 4,000 located in Farmington. Tunxis was awarded the grant to help improve its retention rate, graduation rate, and its ability to prepare its graduates for the technology-based workplaces of the 21st century. These goals will be met by creating an Office of Institutional Effectiveness that will coordinate and implement accountability standards. The funding can be used by this new office to create faculty development programs, develop and improve academic programs, acquire new equipment, and provide student services in order to meet its accountability standards.
