DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION RELEASES $595,200 FOR BRIDGEPORT HIGH-SPEED FERRY
  On March 22, 2005, the U.S. Department of Transportation released $595,200 for the Bridgeport High-Speed Ferry Terminal Project, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd, Joe Lieberman, and Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Bridgeport) announced. 
   "The Bridgeport High Speed Ferry is a critically important transit project," said Dodd. "It can help ease congested roadways, strengthen Eastern Connecticut's economy, and improve air quality for citizens in our state."
   "Traffic gridlock in Connecticut not only affects the quality of life for our families, but it threatens to do real economic harm to our state," Lieberman said. "These funds will encourage more commuters to use transit, get more cars off our clogged interstates, and ensure our continued ability to attract new businesses to the state."
   "I am hopeful a high-speed ferry will be a viable alternative for Bridgeport's commuters," Shays commented. "This funding will ease the burden on Bridgeport commuters and help the city further develop economically."
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman and Congressman Shays secured this funding last year in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447), and are continuing to pursue funds this year. The Bridgeport High-Speed Ferry project previously received $2.25 million in federal funding.
   The proposed Bridgeport high-speed ferry will run from Bridgeport to Stamford and lower Manhattan.
