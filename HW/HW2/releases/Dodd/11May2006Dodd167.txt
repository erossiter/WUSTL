SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE TAX BILL
  "I support tax cuts for all Americans. But this bill would irresponsibly and recklessly dig us $70 billion farther into debt while shelling out the lion's share of benefits to those who need it least. Our nation has great promise but unless we get our fiscal house in order and live within our means we are living on borrowed time and that is wrong. There are many pressing investments that need to be made - in our security, our schools, and our people. This bill ignores that. And I simply can't support what in essence amounts to a tax increase for future generations."
