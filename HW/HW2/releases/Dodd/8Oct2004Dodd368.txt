SEN. DODD, REP. DELAURO: POLITICAL MANEUVER STRIPS OUTSOURCING LANGUAGE FROM CORPORATE TAX BILL
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (Conn. 
 -03) today chastised Republican Senate leaders for striking a back room deal that stripped critical language to protect jobs from going overseas in the Foreign Sales Corporation/ Extraterritorial Income Tax (FSC/EIT) conference report.
   The outsourcing language offered by Dodd in the U.S. Senate and DeLauro in the U.S. House passed both chambers with bi-partisan support. However, when the bill went to conference committee, every Republican voted to remove the outsourcing restrictions, including those who originally voted for it. The Conference Report passed both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House with a $4 billion trade issue to enact billions in tax incentives to corporations that ship jobs overseas.
   "I am outraged by this outcome, and troubled by the tactics used to get there," said Dodd. "The strong bipartisan support this measure received when it originally passed the Senate reflected a balanced approach to a critical national problem. The conference meeting spoiled that spirit of bipartisanship and hung the American worker out to dry."
   "It is disturbing that on the eve of the release of unemployment numbers showing our economy is not creating jobs necessary to keep up with inflation, Republican leaders would strike a deal to ship jobs overseas," said DeLauro. "Yesterday's action is further proof that Republican Congressional Leadership has no real job plans for our country, only tax breaks for corporate interests."
   The bill was approved in the Senate by a vote of 70 to 26 and in the House by a vote of 280 to 141.
