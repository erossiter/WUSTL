SEN. DODD MEETS WITH NATIONAL FEDERATION OF BLIND
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today met with the Connecticut chapter of the National Federation of the Blind to discuss the bill he introduced on Friday that would allow blind individuals to earn more in the workplace without losing critical Social Security benefits, as well as other issues related to improving the lives of blind individuals. 
   "I always enjoy my meetings with the National Federation of the Blind," said Dodd. "This year, I particularly appreciate their support for the bill I introduced last week that would raise the income limit for monthly Social Security benefits and by doing so, help encourage blind Americans to pursue the jobs they want and lead more fulfilled lives as members of the workforce. I look forward to working with the National Federation of the Blind to help ensure that the blind community continues to thrive through advocacy, education, research, technology, and programs encouraging independence."
   Senator Dodd has been a longtime leader on disability related issues, and with this new legislation he hopes to create an equal playing field for blind Americans in the workforce. To qualify for benefits under current law, blind Americans must earn less than $1,570 per month, which can discourage them from pursuing jobs that would bump their monthly income slightly above this rigid limit. By increasing this monthly limit over the next five years, the Blind Person's Earning Fairness Act of 2008 seeks to encourage blind people to pursue the jobs they want and live richer, more fulfilled lives as full members of the workforce.
