SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ VOTE
  "This vote sends a clear message to President Bush and others who believe that a protracted, embattled stay in Iraq is preferable to a clear course of action. I would have preferred to begin phased deployment even earlier, but this is a positive development that I strongly support.  
   "Even if the President vetoes this bill, which I would strongly urge him not to, Congress has taken a critical step in taking the U.S. policy in a new direction and stopping the Administration's failed policy. We are also serving a wakeup call to the Iraqi government that the American Congress and the overwhelming majority of the public do not believe that the conflict in Iraq can be won militarily. It is critical that Iraqi officials get serious in working toward political reconciliation and a vision for Iraq that is supported by the majority of its citizens. This will not be the last effort by the Congress to end the administration's failed policy."
