SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT DECISION IN WATTERS V. WACHOVIA
  "Today's Supreme Court decision may have settled legal questions regarding the regulation of the operating subsidiaries of national banks.
   "I plan to carefully examine today's Court's decision and to consider with equal care its impact on the future of bank regulation. In doing so, I intend to look closely at the commitment displayed by federal banking regulators to upholding their safety and soundness duties and their equally important consumer protection and enforcement responsibilities."
