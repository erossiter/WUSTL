SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MORGAN STANLEY-CHINA INVESTMENT CORPORATION DEAL
  "Earlier this year, the Senate Banking Committee enacted legislation to tighten the federal review and approval process for foreign investments in the United States, particularly by foreign governments. A Chinese sovereign wealth fund is now proposing to acquire a sizable interest in Morgan Stanley. As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I need to know more about the specifics of this deal, including whether a CFIUS review is warranted, before coming to any conclusions about this matter."
