SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PENTAGON DIRECTIVE ON BODY ARMOR
  "I'm tremendously proud of our American soldiers. It goes without saying that they are well equipped with honor and bravery. But when it comes to getting what they need on the battlefield, outrageously we've seen that they haven't been getting what they need in terms of equipment and body armor. That's totally unacceptable, and why this directive by the Pentagon needs to be scrutinized in much greater detail. Clearly no one wants to see our soldiers getting sub-standard gear but the question is why our American soldiers are still feeling the need to purchase equipment to keep them safe and accomplish their important missions. The Bush Administration - to put it mildly - has a poor record of ensuring our troops are getting what they need. They need to immediately launch an investigation into this issue. It is yet another example of the inadequate planning and operation related to our soldiers and this war."
