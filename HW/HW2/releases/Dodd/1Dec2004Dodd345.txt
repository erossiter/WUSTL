SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Nine Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $1,097,864 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Wednesday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security. 
   "Firefighters are indispensable foot soldiers here at home. Thankfully these grants can help ensure that we have reinforcements on our nation's front lines," said Dodd. "It's time to provide our homeland defenders with the resources and staffing they need to do a very difficult job."
   "We must not condemn to frustration those whose job it is to protect us by failing to provide them with the necessary resources to meet the threats they face," Lieberman said. "We depend on Connecticut firefighters for our safety. Surely they should be able to depend upon us for support." 
   The following localities will receive funding:
   * North Madison Volunteer Fire Company $66,167
  * Winsted Fire Department $191,036 
  * Stamford Fire Rescue $198,719
  * Gales Ferry Volunteer Fire Company $73,395
  * Torrington Fire Department $21,600
  * Riverton Fire Department $71,831
  * Cheshire Volunteer Fire Department $266,798
  * Town of Windsor Fire Department $60,075
  * City of Norwalk Fire Department $148,243
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 230 grants for a total of more than $21.2 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
