SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON USA TODAY REPORT INDICATING COLLECTION OF PHONE RECORDS NATIONWIDE
  "Our nation needs to be vigilant in protecting our citizens from terrorist attacks. There should be no greater responsibility than working to keep our nation safe from harm. But I also believe that we need to protect and preserve the basic freedoms and liberties that define our nation and our national character. The fact that a massive and secret collection of personal information about average Americans all across the nation apparently is taking place without any oversight or scrutiny is troubling, to say the least. Given this Administration's long and checkered record, it isn't enough for the President to just say 'trust me.' The President needs to immediately and clearly spell out whether this secret effort has been egregiously infringing on the American public's right to privacy, and if not, what safeguards exist to give the American people confidence to believe that their rights to privacy are being fully protected."
