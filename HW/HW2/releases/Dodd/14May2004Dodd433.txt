SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN FIGHT FOR MANUFACTURING FUNDING
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today joined a group of 54 Senate colleagues in calling on the Bush Administration to provide funding for a successful program to help stop the manufacturing crisis and keep small manufacturers productive and competitive. In a letter sent today to Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, the Senators urged the Administration to restore full funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 federal budget.  
   "The American worker built this nation. They deserve better than to have the Bush Administration dismantle our nation's manufacturing base - piece by piece, and worker by worker," said Dodd. "This initiative is critically important to workers and businesses in Connecticut and across the nation and I intend to fight tooth and nail to ensure that these cuts are restored."
   "At a time when American manufacturing is facing a sharp drop in employment, surging trade deficit, diminishing share of GDP, and fierce global competition, it is absolutely critical that we continue to support the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Program," said Lieberman, who is Co-Chair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing. "The MEP program provides small and medium businesses with invaluable technical and business assistance. However, the future of MEP centers is threatened by a massive 60% cut in their FY2004 funding. We must reprogram funding for this successful program to ensure the existing MEP centers continue to assist our country's manufacturers in remaining competitive in the global market place." 
   The MEP program helps small manufacturers remain competitive in the global marketplace by providing technical assistance, support services, engineering services and business advice to small manufacturers. The MEP program's budget for fiscal year 2004 is only $39 million - 63 percent less than last year. The current funding level is forcing many MEP Centers to close regional offices and reduce business services to small manufactures. Restoring MEP funding is necessary to ensure the sustainability of domestic small manufacturing industry and its high-quality jobs. 
   The full text of the letter is below:
   May 13, 2004
   The Honorable Donald Evans
  Secretary
  Department of Commerce
  1401 Constitution Avenue NW
  Washington, DC 20230
   Dear Secretary Evans: 
   We are writing to request that you transfer and reprogram funds within the Department of Commerce to restore funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) in fiscal year 2004. The MEP is a cost-effective, strong public-private partnership that helps small and mid-sized American manufacturers modernize to compete in the demanding global marketplace. Firms assisted by locally managed MEP centers produce high wage jobs and generate revenues that continue to power our rising standard of living.
   The Federal government's modest investment of $106.6 million in fiscal year 2003 generated billions of dollars in increased sales and investment and jobs created and retained. The MEP helps small manufacturers remain competitive in the global marketplace. We hope that you will work with us to support the competitiveness of our domestic small manufacturing industry and preserve its high-paying jobs.
   The fiscal year 2004 appropriated level of $39.6 million for the MEP is insufficient to maintain the existing network of MEP Centers. According to a recent survey by the Modernization Forum, every MEP Center in the country is downsizing. MEP Centers have closed 58 regional offices and reduced staffing by 15 percent, which will leave small manufacturers across the country without invaluable technical and business assistance that helps them remain competitive in the global marketplace. On July 1, 2004 two-thirds of MEP centers come due for renewal requiring fiscal 2004 dollars. Unless action is taken before that date, the MEP centers will struggle to meet the many needs of our small manufacturers.
   We would like to work with you to transfer and reprogram funding in order to maintain the existing MEP network. Following are some accounts within the Department of Commerce that we would suggest could be used to support this effort. 
   * $5 million in unobligated funds from the Economic Development Administration;
   * Funds received by the EDA Administrator from revolving fund loan programs and liquidation; and,
   * Deobligations from the Advance Technology Program.
   We look forward to working with you on this urgent matter. 
   Sincerely,
   * Christopher J. Dodd
