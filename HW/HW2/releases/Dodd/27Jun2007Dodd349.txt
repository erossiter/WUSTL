SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HIS AMENDMENT TO IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today issued the following statement after the Senate voted to table his amendment to S. 1639, the Immigration Reform bill currently being considered by the Senate. The amendment would have helped unite parents with their children who are U.S. citizens by increasing the annual cap on green cards for parents, extending the duration of the new restrictive parent visitor visa program proposed in S. 1639, and ensuring that penalties imposed on overstays of the visa are not unfairly applied to others. 
   "I am very disappointed that my colleagues today failed to uphold and honor the family, an institution that is at the heart of what it means to be an American. My amendment was one of fundamental fairness to our fellow citizens to have the freedom to spend time with their parents living abroad. It was a basic measure that did not cut at the core of the underlying bill, nor was it partisan in any way. Yet still, some of my colleagues seem to be convinced that imposing excessive restrictions on visitation rights of parents of American citizens is necessary to reduce so-called chain migration. I reject this notion. The fact is that once parents of citizens obtain visas, they usually complete the family unit and are not likely to sponsor others. I regret that the majority of my colleagues have refused to take steps to allow all American families who wish to be united to do so. There is a lot of talk about family values these days. I guess those values are only for certain kinds of American families - not every family."
   Background information on the amendment is below.
   Background Information on Senator Dodd's
   Uniting Parents and Children Amendment
   * Under current law, parents of US citizens (USCs) are defined as immediate relatives, along with spouses and minor children, and are exempt from green card caps. S. 1639 removes them from this category, redefining the nuclear family; subjects them to an annual cap of 40,000 green cards; and creates a new parent visa category.
   * The Dodd amendment unites parents with their children by increasing the newly established cap on green cards for parents; extending the duration of the parent visa; and ensuring that penalties imposed on overstays are not unfairly applied to others.
   * For millions of immigrant families, parents are not distant relatives but vital members of the nuclear family who play a critical role, be it as grandparents or as sources of strength and support for their bereaved or single children. Their children in turn must also have every opportunity to support and care for them in sickness and in health.
   * It is unfair to USCs that their right to sponsor parents is being limited under the guise of reducing "chain migration." Once parents of USCs obtain immigrant visas, they usually complete the family unit and are not likely to sponsor other relatives. USCs with parents abroad must not be treated differently than those with parents here.
   * This amendment ensures that justice is done to parents and citizens who seek to keep their families intact and who lawfully benefit from the parent visa program by:
   * Increasing the green card cap to 90,000. 90,000 represents the average annual number of green cards issued to parents. Last year, 120,000 parents applied for green cards. S. 1639 slashes this number by more than half to 40,000. This amendment would make sure that sufficient numbers of green cards are available for parents to come to the United States.
   * Extending the parent visa to 180 days and making it renewable and valid for 3 years. These are already accepted timeframes for the validity of a visa. 180 days is the length of a tourist visa; H-1Bs are valid for 3 years. S. 1639 however limits parents to an annual stay of 30 days and does not specify long-term validity. This is too short an allotment and simply unacceptable, allowing a tourist to stay in the United States for 6 times longer than a parent.
   * Making penalties for parent visa overstays applicable only to them. S. 1639 states that if the overstay rate among visa holders exceeds 7% for 2 years, all nationals of countries with high overstay rates can be barred from this visa program or the program can be terminated. Sponsors of overstays are also barred from sponsoring other aliens on this visa. This amendment strikes language that unfairly collectively punishes those who have not violated the law, allowing law-abiding parents to continue to unite with their children.
   * This amendment is being co-sponsored by Senators Menendez and Reid and is supported by over 50 groups including the American Jewish Committee; National Council of La Raza; United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society; Conference of Catholic Bishops; and American Immigration Lawyers Association.
