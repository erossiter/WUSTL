SENATE PANEL APPROVES $25 MILLION IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION FUNDING FOR CONNECTICUT FACILITIES
  The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved legislation that will provide $25.5 million to upgrade and modernize Connecticut military facilities, Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008, which will now head to the Senate floor for consideration, allocates $64.7 billion for U.S. veterans and for building and maintenance of Department of Defense facilities. 
   "Sailors stationed at Naval Submarine Base New London perform a variety of missions vital to our national security. The resources provided in this bill build on our efforts to modernize the base, and to continue providing our Navy with first-rate facilities," Dodd said. "Moreover, this bill will fund the essential training facilities our National Guard need and deserve. I believe that the legislation addresses a number of critically important needs that ultimately will help our troops and improve Guard readiness and training as these brave men and women continue to serve our state and nation."
   "Members of our nation's military voluntarily serve this country, and in return, it is our required duty to provide them with the facilities they deserve," said Lieberman. "Our veterans' medical centers in Connecticut are top notch, and I am proud to support funding for the important work they do to provide both physical and mental health care to those who have served the United States. The new construction at New London will continue the actions to ensure that the submarine base remains the world's premier submarine center of excellence"
   Connecticut programs that will receive funding under the bill include: 
   * $11.9 million to Naval Submarine Base New London to convert an unused warehouse to a small craft maintenance facility and harbor operations center;
   * $13.6 million to construct a National Guard Readiness Center at the Niantic Training Center; and, 
   * The bill also provides funds for the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers in Newington and West Haven and the other various clinics located throughout the state.
