SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE PASSAGE OF TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT
  Statement of Senator Dodd on House Passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act: 
  "I commend Chairman Frank and the House for their efforts. This is a tremendously important issue, and one that should - and must - be a top priority. We must ensure that our nation is financially prepared and protected from the threat of a future terrorist attack. A key element of that preparation needs to be protecting American jobs, workers, and businesses to ensure that our economy continues to function. Our nation's security and prosperity depend upon it. I intend to continue to work as Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee to ensure that TRIA's proven protections are extended."
