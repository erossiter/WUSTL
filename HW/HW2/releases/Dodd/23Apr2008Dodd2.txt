SEN. DODD RESPONDS TO NOMINATION OF GENERAL PETRAEUS TO BE CENTCOM COMMANDER
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) responded to the recent announcement by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates of the President's decision to nominate General Petraeus to the position of Commanding Officer, Central Command, replacing the outgoing Admiral Fallon. 
   "Today's nomination of General Petraeus to head Central Command demonstrates once again this administration's stubborn commitment to its failed strategies in Iraq. Even more disturbingly, I am concerned that this nomination might also signal increased saber-rattling toward Iran. That would stand in stark contrast to the more measured approach to international engagement the previous commander, Admiral Fallon, brought to the post."
   "Additionally, we should not be under any illusions that General Odierno's promotion to succeed General Petraeus in leading our forces in Iraq will lead to any change in policy. As we enter our sixth year in Iraq, it is long past time that we turn the page on our current Iraq strategy and move toward political reconciliation. That means a responsible, comprehensive strategy on how to wind down our involvement in Iraq so that we can begin to address the countless other pressing national security concerns around the world."
