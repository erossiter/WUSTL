SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ELECTRIC BOAT LAYOFFS
  "This is deeply distressing and troubling news. My thoughts are with the workers and their families at Electric Boat who might be impacted by these layoffs. There is no good time to be faced with a loss of a job, but it is even more upsetting when it comes during the holiday season. It goes without saying that I would hope that no stone would go unturned in lessoning or alleviating the pain associated with these layoffs.  
   "I have made it abundantly clear to the Navy that our nation needs more submarines and not less. We simply can't afford to let increasing threats to our national security go unanswered, and submarines are a vital part of our defense arsenal. I've made plain to the Navy that they need to immediately rethink their timetables so that we can increase submarine production now and not in 2008. I've also made clear to them - in on-going, direct and no uncertain terms - Electric Boat should be given as much maintenance work as possible - period. Shipping the work elsewhere doesn't make sense from a national security perspective or a taxpayer perspective; the Navy gets everything it needs from the workers of Electric Boat. 
   "The workers at Electric Boat are vital to our national defense. No one else has the expertise, skills and knowledge to meet our nation's submarine needs and we simply can't afford to lose them or allow our submarine industrial base to be chipped away piece by piece, or worker by worker. It is vitally important that we work to protect and strengthen our submarine industrial base and not weaken it. I vow to continue to do everything in my power to protect Electric Boat worker's interests because it is in our nation's best interests."
