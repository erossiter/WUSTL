SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S SELECTION OF JUDGE ROBERTS FOR CHIEF JUSTICE
  Statement of Senator Dodd on the President Selection John Roberts for Chief Justice  
   "The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. The decisions made there aren't merely abstract legal rulings that gather dust in some law library - they impact the lives of millions of Americans each and every day. That is why the qualifications, judicial views, and temperament of Supreme Court Justices are critically important. These elements are even more important when they relate to those who would lead the Court as Chief Justice of the United States. 
   "Obviously the Senate has already begun its Constitutional role of looking at John Roberts' nomination to sit on the Supreme Court. I would expect that this new decision by the President will cause the Senate to redouble its efforts to fully and thoroughly examine Mr. Roberts' nomination to lead the highest court in the land."
