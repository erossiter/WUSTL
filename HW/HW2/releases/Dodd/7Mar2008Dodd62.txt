SEN. DODD: TODAY'S JOB LOSS DATA MUST SERVE AS WAKE-UP CALL
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, today issued the following statement on reports that 63,000 jobs were lost in February and another 450,000 people left the labor force: 
   "This morning's data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates the terrible toll that the housing crisis is having on our nation's economy. The economy continues to shed jobs, and real incomes are declining as wages cannot keep up with inflation. Our financial and credit markets are facing a crisis of confidence which is leading to a credit crunch. Housing prices are falling, while millions of Americans are trapped in mortgages that they cannot afford. Foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies are at record highs.
   "We need new policies to address these problems, as the policies that led us into this situation have failed. I have offered some new ideas, including creating the Homeownership Preservation Corporation, which I plan to introduce shortly. As unfortunate as today's data are, I hope that they will serve as a wake-up call for those who do not think that we need to do more."
