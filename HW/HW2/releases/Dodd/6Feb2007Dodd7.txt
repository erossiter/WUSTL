SEN. DODD RAILS AGAINST SENATE INACTION REGARDING IRAQ
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), a leading voice against the Senate's inaction regarding the war in Iraq, today spoke on the floor of the Senate, saying that the Senate will be judged for its refusal to allow a real debate on Iraq, and a vote on a meaningful piece of binding legislation. Sen. Dodd, who has attempted to limit troop levels in Iraq and force the President to return to Congress to get a new authorization for the war, has said that he will vote against the Warner-Levin legislation.  
   "At some point, Mr. President, the Senate will have to engage in a real debate about our failed policy in Iraq. We can't escape responsibility by refusing to debate and vote - we will be held responsible for what we don't do," Senator Dodd said on the floor. "And the longer we delay taking action, the greater the failure in Iraq and the larger the cost in American blood and treasure."
   "Mr. President, two-thirds of Americans oppose a surge. If we want the President to listen to Congress, then we'd better start acting like the coequal branch of government that we are and stop acting timidly, fearful of being held responsible for demanding a different course in Iraq," Dodd explained.
   Senator Dodd, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said he looks forward to working with likeminded colleagues who believe that there must be meaningful, binding action regarding Iraq.
