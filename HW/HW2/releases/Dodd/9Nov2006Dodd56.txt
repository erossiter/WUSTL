SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
"Today, Americans across our great nation will pay tribute to the brave men and women who have made it possible for us to live in peace, freedom, and security. Each November, Veterans Day provides us an occasion to take time to remember all those who have served in our nation's armed forces. I join all Americans in thanking them for their selfless dedication and their sacrifices on behalf of our nation, and I offer my special thanks to the nearly 300,000 veterans from the State of Connecticut.  
 "With 140,000 American Troops deployed in Iraq and 23,000 troops in Afghanistan, our thoughts are with these brave men and women and their families. We honor their service, and continue to remember the sacrifices of the many fallen heroes of these combat operations, from Connecticut and all across our country. America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen and Marines from every generation deserve our gratitude and full support."
