SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1.6 MILLION FOR CONNECTICUT BROWNFIELDS CLEAN-UP
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today announced the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded eight grants to Connecticut communities and regional councils worth a total of more than $1.6 million to help them assess, clean and redevelop abandoned, contaminated parcels known as Brownfields. These grants will benefit the cities of Bridgeport, Torrington and Meriden, the towns of Vernon and Griswold, and three regional councils.  
   "This assistance can help sweep away the past, and in its place, begin to plant the seeds of economic and environmental recovery," said Dodd. "It is good for our environment, good for economic growth, and definitely a step in the right direction."
   "The funding provided by the EPA is a crucial step in the on-going revitalization efforts of these communities," Lieberman said. "These resources should make the cleanup and redevelopment of potentially contaminated Brownfields attractive to businesses and inject new life into these cities' core downtown areas. These funds will help turn our Brownfields into amber waves of grain and fields of economic growth." 
   The following grants were awarded:
   * Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments - $125,000
   * City of Bridgeport - $400,000
   * Capital Region Council of Governments - $200,000
   * Hockanum Industrial Development Venture Corporation - $200,000
   * City of Torrington - $199,130
   * Town of Vernon - $100,000
   * City of Meriden - $200,000
   * Town of Griswold - $200,000
   EPA's Brownfields funds help communities assess contamination at abandoned and vacant sites and estimate the costs of cleaning up sites for redevelopment. Municipalities and select organizations can also receive funding for cleanup grants and to establish revolving loan programs that provide low interest loans for cleanups.
   Since 1995, EPA New England has provided more than $91 million for grants, site evaluations, job training and cleanup loan programs to dozens of communities and agencies, including more than $19.9 million to Connecticut. Federal funding has leveraged another $150 million in private investments to cleanup and redevelopment. With that was the addition of some 2000 new jobs in the state. EPA estimates that every acre of reclaimed Brownfields saves 4.5 acres of green space and every green space created, on average, has doubled the value of surrounding properties.
