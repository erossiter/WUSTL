SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON EMMETT TILL UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) issued the following statement today upon the Senate Judiciary Committee's passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, legislation that he introduced in February 2007 with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT): 
   "Today, Congress came one step closer to righting the wrongs of the past and bringing to justice people who have perpetrated heinous crimes based on racial hatred. I commend Chairman Leahy and my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for taking action on this important piece of legislation. While this bill cannot alter history or heal the wounds incurred by these senseless acts of violence, it can work to restore belief in the fairness of our justice system. I hope that the full Senate will join me in reaffirming our nation's commitment to seek the truth and work to make equal justice a reality by passing the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act." 
   The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act would give the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) increased resources to reopen Civil Rights-era criminal cases which have gone cold by designating a Deputy Chief in the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ and a Supervisory Special Agent in the Civil Rights Unit of the FBI. These individuals will be tasked with spearheading and coordinating efforts by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors to bring long-time fugitives to justice. Both positions will focus on investigating and prosecuting the unsolved murder cases that occurred prior to 1970 and the Civil-rights era.
