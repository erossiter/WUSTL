SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CLOSING OF BRISTOL SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE
  "The Social Security office in Bristol is not a luxury, it's a necessity. Many senior citizens in Bristol and the surrounding area depend on their community's Social Security office to access the services they need and deserve. Because of the distance and the lack of public transportation, the people who use Bristol's Social Security office - including senior citizens or those residents who do not drive - will find it much more difficult to make their way to New Britain as opposed to making their way downtown. I intend to fight any effort to close this office with Congressman Larson and senator Lieberman. It won't be an easy fight, but it is definitely one I intend to wage for the people of Bristol."
