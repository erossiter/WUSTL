SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $900,000 TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE ACCESS IN GROTON
  The Ledge Light Health District, a public health center in Groton, will receive $932,544 from the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) Community Access Program (CAP) to help expand services and increase their patient capacity, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today.
   CAP funds are awarded through the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC), and allow the centers to hire additional staff, purchase equipment, and offer additional services.
   "Tragically, for far too many people, health care lies beyond their reach. This assistance helps put it within their grasp," said Dodd. "Not only is this the right thing to do, but keeping people healthy reduces costs down the road."
   "As health care costs increase in Connecticut and across the nation, it is critically important that we continue to provide assistance for our low-income and uninsured families," Lieberman said. "These funds will go directly to the primary care centers that serve the neediest Americans." 
   The Ledge Light Health District provides comprehensive public health services designed to improve the quality of life and health safety of the uninsured and underinsured. The District provides prevention based programs to reduce health risk, disease and death through health education, promotions and community outreach activities.
