SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $620,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Six Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $623,000 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Thursday. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
   "Connecticut firefighters often are the first on the scene of a catastrophe. They shouldn't be last when it comes to getting critically important resources," said Dodd. "Thankfully this assistance - while only a start - can begin to address those tremendous shortcomings and provide our firefighters with the help they need and deserve."
   "As we continue to fight the war on terror and work to make our nation safer, it is imperative that we also continue to provide first responders with the resources they need to prepare and protect our communities," Lieberman said. "These grants will provide critical funding for education, training and equipment to help Connecticut firefighters save lives."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   Tolland Fire Department: $216,832
  East Hampton Volunteer Fire Department: $163,888
  Goshen Volunteer Fire Company: $72,000
  Litchfield Fire Department: $62,730
  Stratford Fire Department: $56,700
  Newtown Hook & Ladder: $50,850
   Total $ 623,000
   The award was made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed more than 18,700 grants for a total of more than $1.3 billion to help fire departments across the country strengthen their response capabilities.
