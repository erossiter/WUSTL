SEN. DODD CALLS FOR INCLUSION OF FUNDING FOR LOW-INCOME/ELDERLY FAMILIES IN STIMULUS PACKAGE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) this week requested that the developing economic stimulus package include additional Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding for low-income families. In a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D-WV), and Appropriations Ranking Member Thad Cochran (R-MS), Senator Dodd and his colleagues recommended an additional $3.62 billion for the program to support low income families in bill payment assistance, energy crisis assistance and weatherization and energy-related home repairs, as well as an additional $500 million in emergency funds. 
   "An infusion of LIHEAP funding will be used by low-income households to help cope with their rising home energy bills," Dodd said. "LIHEAP funds will be spent immediately to stimulate the economy and provide a vital safety net to families and seniors so they are not forced to choose between paying their energy bills and purchasing needed medicines and food."
