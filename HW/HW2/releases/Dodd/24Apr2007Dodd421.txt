SEN. DODD, REP. DELAURO SEEK TO REFORM NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) today announced they will reintroduce in both chambers of Congress the No Child Left Behind Reform Act (NCLBRA), a bill that would makes three basic changes to the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which was signed into law in January of 2002. Sen. Dodd, a senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and Rep. DeLauro originally introduced the legislation in 2004. 
   "The high hopes that I and many others had for the No Child Left Behind Act have not been realized," said Dodd. "This law has been implemented by the Administration in a manner that is inflexible, unreasonable and unhelpful. As a result, it has failed the teachers, the schools, and, most importantly, the students it was meant to help. Congress has a responsibility to change No Child Left Behind so that its implementation is efficient, fair and reasonable. The legislation we introduced today offers commonsense and needed reforms and takes a positive step toward truly ensuring that no child is left behind."
   "When Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act we had high hopes that it would raise school standards and ensure student achievement. Unfortunately, the reality of the legislation is another matter - teachers and students have found it to be inflexible and highly restrictive for teachers and students, and it has frequently placed enormous unfunded mandates on states like Connecticut," stated DeLauro. "That is why I am introducing the No Child Left Behind Reform Act to ensure we maintain our commitment to education by giving states the flexibility to make opportunity real for students."
   The NCLBRA will help ease current burdens on American students, teachers and administrators without dismantling the fundamental underpinnings of the law by implementing the following three major reforms:
   * More comprehensive performance measures: The NCLBRA will allow schools to be given credit for performing well on measures other than test scores when calculating student achievement. Additional measures include dropout rates, the number of students who participate in advanced placement courses, and individual student improvement over time.
   * More need-based resources for students: The NCLBRA will allow schools to target school choice and supplemental services to the students that actually demonstrate a need for them. Under the implementation of current law, if a school is in need of improvement, it is expected to offer school choice and supplemental services to whole groups of students - even those that have not demonstrated a need for them.
   * More reasonable teacher certification systems: The NCLBRA introduces a greater degree of reasonableness to the teacher certification process by allowing states to create a single assessment to cover multiple subjects for middle grade level teachers and allowing states to issue a broad certification for science and social studies.
   The National Education Association has endorsed the legislation. Other endorsers include the International Reading Association, the National Alliance of Black School Educators and the National Family Association for Deaf Blind.
