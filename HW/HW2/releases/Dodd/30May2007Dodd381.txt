SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROBERT ZOELLICK
  Statement of Senator Dodd on Robert Zoellick 
   "I am hopeful that President Bush's decision to recommend Robert Zoellick to World Bank members as the next president of the World Bank will restore the integrity and honor to the institution that was eradicated by Paul Wolfowitz's flagrant disregard for ethical standards. The importance of the World Bank's mission cannot be overstated - the institution is influential in reducing poverty and promoting development and sound governance in the many nations in which it operates. The head of such a premier organization must share a deep belief in these goals, and must have a steady moral footing in order to navigate the maze of challenges that come with the position. I hope that Mr. Zoellick brings the strong leadership and moral principles needed to help the Bank reestablish itself."
