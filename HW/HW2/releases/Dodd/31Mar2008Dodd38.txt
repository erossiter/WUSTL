SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY JACKSON RESIGNATION
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, today issued the following statement on the resignation of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Alphonso Jackson. Just over a week ago, Senator Dodd sent a letter to President Bush calling for the resignation. 
   "I recently voiced my concerns about Secretary Jackson's ability to provide the leadership necessary during these trying times for our country while under the cloud of various investigations into alleged impropriety. I hope this change in personnel will be matched by a change in policy that brings real solutions to the housing crisis that has triggered this economic recession. I stand ready to work with the President and his new HUD Secretary to that end."
