SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DECISION TO TRAVEL TO SYRIA
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Decision to Travel to Syria: 
   "Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government, and as a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, where oversight is a critical component, members need to go to hotspots not just garden spots. I can't think of a more critical part of the world than the Middle East, and I can't think of a more critical player in effecting events in the region for good or for bad than Syria. That is why I have decided to include a stop in Syria during my seven day fact finding trip to the region."
