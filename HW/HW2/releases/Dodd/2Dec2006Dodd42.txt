SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MINIMUM WAGE
"Today, the federal minimum wage will have remained stagnant for more than nine years and three months, the longest time since its establishment almost 70 years ago. Many of the financial gains associated with the last raise in minimum wage in 1997 have all but eroded due to inflation. It is next to impossible for hard-working men and women to make ends meet for themselves and their families when they are earning wages established in 1997 and salaries that fall well below the poverty line. The price of housing has increased, the price of higher education has increased, the price of health care and energy has increased. The only thing that hasn't increased since 1997 is the minimum wage. 
 "I have long supported efforts to raise the federal minimum wage by $2.10 to $7.25 per hour. This is not a lot to ask - $2.10 can barely buy you a cup of coffee these days, much less a gallon of gas. But it will make a difference in the lives of the 14.9 million American workers - not to mention their 7.3 million children - who will receive a raise in their standard of living if we make this important change. On Election Day, voters in six states overwhelmingly passed legislation calling for an increase in their states' minimum wage levels. Both Democrats and Republicans owe hard-working Americans this long overdue raise, and I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to make an increase in the minimum wage a high priority in the 110th Congress."
