SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA
  "The state of U.S. relations with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere is reflected in the large protests that President Bush confronts on his five country swing through Latin America. While I applaud the President's recent decision to focus on providing assistance for programs which support health and education activities to those most disadvantaged and to deploy a U.S. naval hospital ship to the region later this year, frankly it's too little and too late for this President to reverse the negative attitude toward the United States held by many of our closest neighbors before his term in office concludes. 
   "As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman or Ranking Member of the Western Hemisphere since 1987, I have warned against the Bush Administration's absence of a policy for the Western Hemisphere. Trying to convince governments to sign onto poorly crafted, so-called 'free trade agreements' is not a policy, rather it has provided fuel for the likes of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela to promote his ill-conceived vision of the hemisphere and encourage others with deep social divisions in their countries to follow suit.
   "The next President will have to make relations with our closest neighbors a high priority in order to forge meaningful partnerships that will enable regional leaders to work toward strengthening democratic institutions and promoting social and economic progress for all the citizens in the region. There is no time for on-the-job training; clearly there is already much work to be done to repair the strained and damaged relations between our country and others."
