SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $63,000 IN GRANTS TO BOOST CONNECTICUT CRIME CONTROL
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today that the Cities of New Britain and East Hartford, Connecticut will receive $37,659 and $25,830, respectively, to combat crime and substance abuse. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) is intended to boost efforts to combat crime. The cities will receive a broad range of support in terms of training, personnel, equipment, supplies and informational system for criminal justice.  
   "Crime and substance abuse can infect our communities and take a terrible toll on communities in Connecticut," said Dodd. "And while there isn't a magic inoculation that can prevent all crime, these resources can make a real difference and provide critically important assistance to Connecticut law enforcement officials to better do their job."
   "The best way to fight crime is to stop it before it starts," said Lieberman. "Connecticut's law enforcement deserves the technical support needed to keep our communities safe. These funds and the programs they support are critical to reducing crime and substance abuse in our neighborhoods." 
   The City of New Britain Police Department will use the funds to replace Mobile Data Terminals, to support the Police Explorer Program and the Police Athletic League, as well as continue to provide summer mentoring instructors for children who need help with educational issues.
   The City of East Hartford Police Department will use the funds to purchase protective equipment for police officers, in order to help keep the officers and the community safe through community policing and homeland security efforts.
