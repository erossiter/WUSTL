SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE MUKASEY FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Statement of Senator Dodd on Nomination of Judge Mukasey for Attorney General:
   "Our next Attorney General must be independent, honest, forthcoming, and value the rule of law above partisan politics, something we unfortunately lacked under former Attorney General Gonzalez. I look forward to learning about Judge Mukasey's views on the critical legal and security issues he will confront if confirmed as Attorney General. It is important that the Senate thoroughly examine his record in order to ensure that he demonstrates the capability and willingness to restore credibility and independence to the Department of Justice."
