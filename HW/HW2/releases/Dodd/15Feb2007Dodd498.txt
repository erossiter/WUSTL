SENS. SMITH, DODD WORK TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE FOR UNINSURED KIDS
  Sen. Gordon H. Smith (R-OR) and Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) recently introduced legislation to provide access to vital health care services for uninsured children through school-based health centers (SBHCs). S. 600, the School Based Health Clinic Act of 2007 will create a federal authorization to support the work of SBHCs across the nation.  
   "Sadly, more than nine million children in the U.S. still lack access to health insurance coverage," said Senator Smith. "As a consequence, they face enormous challenges in receiving primary, preventive and mental health services. Even those children who are fortunate to have consistent health coverage face access barriers, which may result in increased absences or undiagnosed health conditions. SBHCs help tear down those barriers so that all children--regardless of insurance or socioeconomic status--have access to a comprehensive range of health services."
   "Nothing is of greater importance than the health and well-being of our children," said Senator Dodd. "School-based health clinics have provided health care to many elementary, middle, and high school students who would not have access to care if SBHCs did not exist. This bill will help the centers to continue providing these much needed services within their communities, which improve the quality of life for children across the country." 
   Currently, there are approximately 1700 SBHCs operating across the country. SBHCs currently receive little to no federal support, forcing many to scale back services or close altogether. 
   These special health clinics--with the input of parents, school personnel, healthcare providers and other youth advocate--provide vital primary and mental healthcare services to all children, regardless of their income or insurance status.
