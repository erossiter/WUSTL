SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEW FIRE GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) today announced a federal grant to Mohegan Fire Company, totaling $143,771. The funds, distributed by the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, will enable Connecticut firefighters to enhance their emergency response capabilities. In fiscal year 2007, the AFG program will award approximately $490 million to fire and EMS departments across America. 
   "Each and every day firefighters put their lives on the line," said Dodd. "I am pleased the Mohegan Fire Company is receiving these funds, which will help provide Connecticut's firefighters with the equipment they need, and allow them to continue their excellent work."
   "Investment in the training and equipping of Connecticut firefighters is critical to protecting our citizens and communities," said Lieberman. "Mohegan's first responders deserve the best we can provide them for performing under tough, dangerous conditions."
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has distributed 361 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
