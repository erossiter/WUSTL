  The Stamford Symphony Orchestra (SSO) will receive a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joseph Lieberman and Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Bridgeport) announced today. The grant will support an Arts Education Ticket Challenge program. 
   "It is important that we continue to provide support for arts education," Dodd said. "This wonderful grant will enable Stamford Students to enjoy new experiences in the arts and provide them with a more diverse well-rounded education."
   "Appreciation of the arts is critical to every child receiving a well-rounded education," Lieberman said. "By providing these funds, the NEA is opening the door for hundreds of Connecticut children to expand their imaginations as they prepare for a successful future."
   "The arts are critical for preparing our children to succeed in school, work and life ," Shays explained. "I am grateful the NEA awarded the Stamford Symphony Orchestra funds for their innovative Arts Education Ticket Challenge."
   "Stamford students will benefit greatly from the Symphony Orchestra's outreach to our schools," said Mayor Dannel Malloy. "This NEA support will be a wonderful addition to our arts education programs in Stamford."
   "It is essential that we return arts education to students in our schools; this grant allows us to reach out to the children's parents as well," commented Barbara J. Soroca, Executive Director of the Stamford Symphony Orchestra
   The SSO will provide 50 vouchers redeemable for free tickets to each of the local district's 20 schools as part of an initiative to encourage students, parents, and families to develop and participate in projects to improve arts education. 
   Grants from the National Endowment for the Arts generate, on average, seven dollars for each dollar awarded.
