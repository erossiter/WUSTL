SENS. MCCONNELL AND DODD INTRODUCE RESOLUTION TO HONOR ROSA PARKS WITH STATUE IN U.S. CAPITOL
  Sens. Mitch McConnell and Christopher Dodd introduced a resolution today, S. Con. Res. 62, to honor Rosa Parks with the creation and placement of a statue in the United States Capitol.  
   Rosa Parks will be the first African American to be honored with a statue in the nation's Capitol if the measure is enacted. Roughly 24 years ago, the Senate passed a similar resolution to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who is honored with a memorial bust. 
   "Rosa Parks' life proved that one American with courage can make a difference," said McConnell. "She did not set out to become a hero on the evening of December 1, 1955. She was, like millions of other Americans, merely on her way home after a long day's work. But her simple, profound act of civil disobedience was the spark that ignited the modern civil-rights movement. This resolution is an appropriate way to pay tribute to this great American." 
   "Fifty years ago, through a simple but brave act of defiance, Rosa Parks became the guiding light for the Montgomery bus boycott and a catalyst for a major chapter in the civil rights movement," said Dodd. "By her solitary action, she proved that one person, through non-violent action, can change the course of history. It is fitting that we honor this extraordinary woman and the principles she embodied with a permanent statue in our nation's Capitol."
