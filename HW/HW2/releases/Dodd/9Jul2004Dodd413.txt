SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE GRANTS TO ASSIST VETERANS, PHYSICALLY DISABLED PERSONS
  Southwestern Connecticut will receive two grants totaling nearly $500,000 in assistance for veterans and persons with disabilities, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The WorkPlace Inc. in Bridgeport will receive the funds from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for two initiatives, one to provide veterans with emergency shelter, counseling, and employment and the other to assist physically disabled persons in obtaining long-term, stable employment. 
   "We should provide doors to a better life for disabled Americans and our nation's veterans," said Dodd. "Thankfully this critically important assistance can help be the key to unlock that better future." 
   "Connecticut is one of the most prosperous states in the nation, yet thousands of our residents - including many who served our country with honor - are forced to scrape by without a roof over their head or food on their plate." Lieberman said. "With these grants, the state of Connecticut can help more of its residents find the assistance they need to achieve self-sufficiency." 
   The Homeless Veterans Grant will help homeless veterans in Fairfield County obtain emergency shelter, substance abuse counseling, job counseling and other assistance such as transportation and medical referral. The DOL funds are ultimately aimed at helping WorkPlace Inc. clients address homelessness through securing meaningful employment.
   Everyone Works 2004 is the second initiative to receive DOL funds. An extension of the 2002 Work Incentive Grant, this project will support the hiring of experienced staff who will provide disabled clients with individualized assistance and promote the hiring of job seekers with disabilities to local businesses.
