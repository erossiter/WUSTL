SEN. DODD EXPRESSES CONSTITUENT CONCERNS TO FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
  Today Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) sent a letter to Marion Blakey, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), expressing his concern about the Integrated Airspace Alternative (IAA) that may route flights over southwestern Connecticut. Many residents of Stamford, New Canaan, and Greenwich have sought information from the FAA about the number and altitude of flights that will be routed over Connecticut, and the potential noise pollution that could result. Additionally, constituents are concerned that the IAA plan could affect the current flight patterns of smaller aircraft utilizing regional airports. As the FAA has failed to adequately address these concerns, Senator Dodd is asking that they provide more information about the probable effects of the IAA proposal. 
   "The FAA ought to be more forthcoming with information about how their IAA proposal will affect the residents of Connecticut," Dodd said. "I'm concerned about how the new flight patterns could affect the quality of life in Fairfield County, and I want to make sure that these questions are answered adequately so that we can consider the proposal fairly and honestly."
   Members of Senator Dodd's staff will attend a public hearing on the issue in Stamford tonight, and also met with New Canaan First Selectwoman Judy Neville on April 17 to discuss the new IAA flight patterns that will affect traffic at Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark Liberty, Teterboro, and Philadelphia airports.
