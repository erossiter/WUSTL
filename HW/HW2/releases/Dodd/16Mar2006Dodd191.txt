SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUDGET RESOLUTION
  Sen. Chris Dodd made the following statement after the Senate narrowly passed the budget by a vote of 51-to-49 late last night.  
   "Our nation is the strongest in the world. Our people have the ability to meet any and all challenges. But unfortunately this Administration and Congress have pushed us off course into dangerous waters. And instead of correcting that ill-advised course, they continue to steer us toward the rocky shoals of fiscal irresponsibility. This budget confirms that. Instead of paying down the massive debt that has ballooned under President Bush, this budget only adds to the record debt racked up by this Administration. Instead of investing in our people and our nation's security, this budget hands out goodies and treats to special interests and those at the very top.
   "It didn't have to be this way. We could have worked in a bipartisan fashion to set us on the right course but President Bush and the Republican leadership in Congress once again took the 'my way or the highway' approach which continues to bankrupt our economy. It goes without saying that this budget is yet another missed opportunity. We could have lived within our means while still investing in our security, troops, schools, infrastructure and people. This budget doesn't do that. But this fight isn't over. I intend to work in the coming weeks and months to - piece by piece - try to correct the inequities and failures of this budget. We owe it to our children and to our nation's future."
