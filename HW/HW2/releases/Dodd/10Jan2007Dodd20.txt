SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE MINIMUM WAGE VOTE
  "I commend the House for quickly acting to raise the minimum wage. This pay raise will directly impact the lives of millions of hardworking men and women who struggle each and every day to make ends meet. With the cost of gasoline, food, housing, health care and education continually rising, this modest raise is long overdue."
