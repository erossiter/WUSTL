SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BOLTON'S RESIGNATION
"I'm glad to see the Bush Administration has decided not to press Mr. Bolton's nomination any further. I would encourage the Administration to put forward an individual who believes in diplomacy and has strong bipartisan support. 
 "From day one, I've had reservations about Mr. Bolton. The most fundamental reservation is rewarding someone who has done serious harm in attempting to skew intelligence at the very time when our nation needs careful and accurate information and analysis. That's what Mr. Bolton did when he attempted to intimidate two U.S. intelligence analysts. In addition, I don't understand how someone who disdains the UN as much as Mr. Bolton did and does can be an effective representative for U.S. interests in that international organization. I would hope that the President would select from a wide bench of qualified career diplomats or political appointees who are committed to pursuing diplomacy to advance U.S. interests. I'm ready and willing to support such a nominee."
