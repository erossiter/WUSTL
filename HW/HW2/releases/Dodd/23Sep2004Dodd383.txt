SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES MILLIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, PUBLIC SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday approved legislation that would provide funds to increase economic and cultural opportunities, protect the environment, and strengthen public health and safety for Connecticut residents, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman said today. Dodd and Lieberman convinced their colleagues to include funds for a number of Connecticut initiatives in the appropriations bill that covers veterans, housing and urban development, environmental protection, and other agencies. 
   "It's critically important that we invest in Connecticut's future, and that's exactly what these funds do - help our state's economy, environment and infrastructure," said Dodd. "While we still have much work to do to ensure that these projects are ultimately funded, this is a tremendously important first step in the right direction in helping to better the lives of people in our state."
   "The funds in this bill will help Connecticut's towns become safer, healthier, and more culturally rich places to live," Lieberman said. "This money invests not only in Connecticut's economy, but also its people, its precious natural environment, and its future."
   The funds will be included in the fiscal year 2005 VA-HUD Senate Appropriations bill, one of the 13 bills that dictate annual federal government spending. Below is a more detailed breakdown of the funds from which Connecticut stands to benefit.
   * $750,000 for the University of Connecticut to assist local municipalities with land use and development issues through the University of Connecticut Center for Land Use Education and Research. The University of Connecticut will use NASA satellite data to provide information on urbanization, forest fragmentation, farmland loss, and water resource impairment for local officials struggling to accommodate growth while protecting natural, cultural, and historical resources.
   * $500,000 for the Mark Twain House to make restoration improvements to facilities neighboring the Museum in Hartford. These improvements promise to have a positive economic impact on the Forrest St. neighborhood by increasing tourism and drawing more potential business patrons to neighborhood restaurants and stores.
   * $250,000 for Foodshare to construct a new food distribution center in northern Hartford County. For over twenty years, Foodshare has been a well-known and well-respected non-profit distributor of food to low-income individuals and families in greater Hartford, distributing approximately 9.2 million pounds of food annually to over 300 soup kitchens and other social services agencies.
   * $200,000 for expansion of the Roots and Shoots program headquartered at Western Connecticut State University. Funds will support the first year of a two-year effort to train college and university students, faculty and administrators to develop "Roots & Shoots" environmental education programs in K-12 schools.
   * $400,000 for the City of Norwalk for their FILTER project to prevent runoff into Long Island Sound. This innovative technology involves storm drain catch basin inserts designed to collect trash and debris, capture hydrocarbon, and dramatically reduce bacteria and pesticide residue, thereby addressing the enormous water quality problems facing the Sound.
   * $250,000 for the City of Stamford's Waste-to-Energy project. Stamford will establish an innovative, low-emissions waste-to-energy electric generation facility that will turn dry, pelletized sewage sludge into 5 megawatts of electric power in a region facing major electricity shortages and electric grid congestion.
   * $500,000 for the New England Green Chemistry Consortium which will help deal with problems of pollution, toxicity, and safety arising from the use of hazardous chemicals in the manufacturing process.
   * $250,000 for Connecticut River Sewage Pollution Control initiatives. The funding will assist communities in both Massachusetts and Connecticut in addressing combined sewer overflows into the Connecticut River.
   * $200,000 for the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management for continued work on resolving a host of pressing air quality issues in New England.
   * $200,000 for the Northeast Waste Management Officials Association for continued work on environmental priorities in the solid waste, hazardous waste, waste site cleanup, and pollution prevention programs in Connecticut and New England States.
   The bill also included $26.2 million for the Technology Talent Act, a program that Lieberman helped create in 2002 to boost the number of math and science graduates of U.S. universities. The Technology Talent Act, sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Christopher Bond (R-MO), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Bill Frist (R-TN), and Pete Domenici (R-NM), was first introduced in 2001 and incorporated into the National Science Foundation (NSF) reauthorization bill, which passed Congress in 2002. The legislation created a framework for a multi-year competitive grant program that awards performance-based grants to institutions of higher learning to increase the number of math, science, technology and engineering graduates.
