SEN. DODD REACTS TO U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CHINA WILL END DISPUTED SUBSIDIES
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, made the following statement in reaction to today's announcement by U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Susan Schwab that China has agreed to terminate subsidies that the United States alleged were illegal under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. 
   "Today's announcement by the USTR shows just how important it is that the United States use all the tools at its disposal to level the playing field for American workers, and serves to further underscore what I have been saying for months: that the Administration must couple dialogue with action in order to address China's illegal currency manipulation. 
   "The Treasury Department should begin by using their existing authority to cite China's ongoing currency manipulation in its semi-annual report, which was due to the Banking Committee on October 15th. But that is only the first step. Congress must approve the bill that Senator Shelby and I authored and passed out of the Banking Committee to give the Treasury Department additional policy tools to file a WTO case against currency manipulators. 
   "This is a situation where actions clearly speak louder than words. Dialogue alone is not going to give American workers an opportunity to compete on fair terms with countries like China. As today's news has demonstrated, U.S.-China economic relations can be strengthened when disputes are settled through both bilateral and multilateral venues, which is exactly what my bill would enable the Treasury Department to do."
