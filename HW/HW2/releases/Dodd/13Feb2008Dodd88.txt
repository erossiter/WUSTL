SEN. DODD'S GLOBAL CHILD SURVIVAL ACT PASSED OUT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
  A bill that would dramatically reduce child and maternal mortality rates in the developing world was unanimously passed out of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations today. Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), author of the Global Child Survival Act of 2007, said that while the committee tackles seemingly large and insurmountable problems throughtout the world, child and maternal mortality is a problem that can be solved in a relatively straightforward and inexpensive manner.  
   "This investment is necessary if we are to follow through on the explicit commitment the United States made, along with 188 other countries, to reduce child and maternal mortality when we agreed to the Millennium Development Goals," Dodd explained. "And if we fail to increase our current funding for child survival, then we run the risk of failing to live up to our promise to those who are most in need."
   The Global Child Survival Act, which is co-authored by Senator Gordon Smith (D-OR), and has 20 cosponsors would:
   * Require the Administration to develop and implement a strategy to improve the health of, and reduce mortality rates among, newborns, children and mothers in developing countries.
   * Establish a task force to monitor and evaluate policy and progress in meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals.
   * Authorize additional funding for programs that improve the health of newborns, children and mothers in developing countries.
