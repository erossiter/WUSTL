SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Senate Armed Services Committee's Approval of 2008 National Defense Authorization Bill: 
  "This bill acknowledges the significant contributions that Connecticut workers make to our national defense-from submarines and helicopters to jet engines and fuel-cell vehicles. In particular, I am encouraged by provisions included in the bill that will begin expanding our submarine fleet. Under the current Administration, our country has been set on a wayward and dangerous course, with inadequate resources to maintain critical shipbuilding capabilities. America's submarines perform essential intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions as well as special operations. For too long, these missions have been underappreciated. Fortunately, this bill takes a strong step toward reversing this trend."
