SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN SECURE MORE THAN $17 MILLION FOR CT LAW ENFORCEMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL, RESEARCH INITIATIVES
  Connecticut is posed to receive more than $17 million to strengthen law enforcement initiatives, protect the environment, help small businesses, and improve educational and research programs under legislation that was given final approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday, Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today.  
   The Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill, which is expected to be voted on by the full Senate in the coming weeks, provides funding for important initiatives like the Mill River environmental restoration initiative in Stamford, the Institute for Technology and Business Development in New Britain, and the Women's Business Development Center for services in New London and Waterbury. Furthermore, the bill supports funding initiatives like an anti-youth violence initiative and a new public safety complex in Hartford, after-school activities in Bridgeport, a new community policing initiative in Meriden, and a science education initiative run by Western Connecticut State University for students in greater Danbury.
   "All of these investments can make a real difference in peoples' lives all across our state," said Dodd. "They can help strengthen and improve our state's economy, make our state safer and cleaner, and provide a brighter future for current and future generations of Connecticut residents."
   "I am pleased that this bill will help to protect Connecticut's citizens by funding anti-crime programs," Lieberman said. "It's also important that the federal government will be able to support such a diverse and significant group of research, education and environmental initiatives. Projects like these will help to protect the oceans, rivers and maritime industries that make up a critical part of Connecticut's character."
