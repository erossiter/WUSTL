SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE VOTE ON CHIP
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today applauded Senate agreement to end debate on the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), setting the stage for final passage of the bill.  
   "Plain and simple, passing the Children's Health Insurance Program will help ensure every child in America has the health care they deserve. This bill represents the hard work and agreement of a majority of members on both sides of the aisle. It is a testament to how critical issues like children's health care can be addressed in a bipartisan manner by a united Congress. I hope that President Bush will rise above partisan politics and support the efforts of both Democrats and Republicans alike to enact this measure. The health of millions of children across the country hangs in the balance."
