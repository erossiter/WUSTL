SEN. DODD JOINS BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL EFFORT TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH
  In response to recent reports in which the press has come under intense pressure to reveal the identity of their confidential sources, Sen.  
 Chris Dodd (D-CT) joined Sen. Richard Lugar (R-ID), Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN), and Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA) at a press conference today to call on Congress to pass the Free Flow of information Act of 2005. 
   Dodd, Lugar, Pence, and Boucher have introduced federal legislation in the Senate and House to protect individuals and organizations involved in gathering and disseminating news from being hauled into federal court and forced to disclose their sources or other unpublished information. The Free Flow of Information Act would establish a strong and uniform federal reporters' shield law modeled after statutes currently in place in thirty-one states and the District of Columbia. 
   "This legislation is fundamentally about good government and the free and unfettered flow of information to the public," said Dodd. "The American people deserve access to a wide array of views so that they can make informed decisions and effectively participate in matters of public concern. When the public's right to know is threatened, and when the rights of free speech and free press are at risk, all of the other liberties we hold dear are endangered. The legislation that we are introducing today will protect these rights, and ensure that the government remains open and accountable to its citizens."
   The proposed legislation protects against compelled disclosure of sources. The protection against compelled disclosure of news and information, however, is qualified - that is, an individual involved in gathering news would be required to reveal information if necessary to law enforcement and if unavailable elsewhere.
