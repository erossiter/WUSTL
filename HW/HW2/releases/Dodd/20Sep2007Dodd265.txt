CHAIRMAN DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DUBAI-NASDAQ DEAL
  Statement by Chairman Dodd on Dubai-Nasdaq Deal: 
   "I believe that a careful review of the Dubai - Nasdaq transaction is required to ensure that there are no negative national security implications associated with moving forward with this deal. That is why I placed a high priority on enacting the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 earlier this year to establish in law an elaborate and rigorous interagency review process to vet these kinds of deals. It is my understanding that the Dubai-Nasdaq deal will be voluntarily submitted to the CFIUS review process to ensure that all potential national security implications are considered before final approval. As a general matter I support foreign direct investment in our economy that promotes growth and creates good jobs for our citizens but always in the context of ensuring that our nation's security is protected. I will await the outcome of the CFIUS review before making a final judgment on the proposed deal."
