SEN. DODD CONDEMNS FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF BROADWATER PROJECT
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today commented on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) regarding the proposed Broadwater Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Storage and Regasification Facility in Long Island Sound. 
   "I am very concerned about the final environmental report on the Broadwater project released today by the FERC. It minimizes the potential dangers to the health of Long Island Sound's fragile ecosystem and does not adequately prove that suggested mitigation measures will be enough to protect the Sound. While I understand the need for increased energy resources in our region, I believe Broadwater is too dangerous and disruptive to the environment and remain opposed to the project."
