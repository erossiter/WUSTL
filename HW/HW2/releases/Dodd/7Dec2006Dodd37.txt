SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PEARL HARBOR
  "On December 7, 1941, 2,400 Americans lost their lives in the attack on Pearl Harbor, a date which, as President Franklin Roosevelt said, will live in infamy. Today, we honor the memory of those brave men and women who gave their lives in defense of their country sixty-five years ago, and reflect on an event that forever changed the course of American history. 
   "Nearly sixty years later, on September 11th, America once again found itself under brutal attack, and the United State Armed Forces once again went to war to bravely defend our great nation.
   "As America's military personnel continue to serve our nation in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere throughout the world, we extend our deepest gratitude to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, as well as their families. And we value the sacrifices of America's veterans from generations past, who on this day, sixty-five years ago, answered our nation's call to protect the world from tyranny."
