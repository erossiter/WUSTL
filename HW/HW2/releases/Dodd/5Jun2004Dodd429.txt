SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  "This is very sad news. Ronald Reagan was a patriot who reflected the eternal optimism of our nation. His charm, wit and character were evident throughout his long life, and his public service will never be forgotten. All of us were particularly proud of the dignity, strength and spirit he showed as he quietly and valiantly fought against the ravages of a devastating disease. My thoughts and prayers are with Nancy and his family at this most difficult time."
