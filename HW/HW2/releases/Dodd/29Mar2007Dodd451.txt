SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT IN HONOR OF TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
  "The courage and fortitude these men displayed is exceptional, and this long overdue honor is well-deserved. That the airmen made such great sacrifices on behalf of a country that marginalized them for so long is a testament to their true patriotism. Their service during World War II was influential not only in helping America win the war, but also in encouraging the breakdown of racial barriers here at home.  
   Today we award the Congressional Gold Medal to these brave men in recognition of their sacrifices and heroism. In particular, I would like to salute the two Connecticut residents who were honored today: William Bowie, Jr. of New Haven and Connie Nappier Jr. of New Britain. Our nation owes them and all the Tuskegee Airmen a deep debt of gratitude, and their service will never be forgotten."
