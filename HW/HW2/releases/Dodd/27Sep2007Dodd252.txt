SEN. DODD HAILS PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION EXPANDING CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) lauded Congress for reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and urged President Bush to sign the critically important legislation into law. The legislation, which has received wide bi-partisan support, would allow states to provide health insurance to a greater number of children from low income and working families. By reauthorizing SCHIP, an additional 3.1 million uninsured children will receive coverage, as well as the 6.6 million children currently in the program. President Bush announced his intention to veto the legislation. If the President fails to sign this legislation into law, approximately 800,000 children will lose their SCHIP coverage.  
   "There is no greater priority than the health and well-being of our nation's children," said Dodd. "If signed into law this legislation will help ensure that millions of more children are enrolled in SCHIP and receiving the medical attention required and they deserve. I urge the President to put politics aside and demonstrate that he is the 'compassionate conservative' he claims to be. Parents struggling to make ends meet should not be forced to choose between purchasing medical care for their children and putting food on the table."
   Senator Dodd is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) and the Chairman of its subcommittee on Children and Families. Dodd has been a longtime advocate for children's healthcare, introducing bills such as the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Medical Devices Safety and Improvement Act.
