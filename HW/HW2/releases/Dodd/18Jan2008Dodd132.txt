SEN. DODD REACTS TO AMBASSADOR BURNS' RESIGNATION
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the following remarks in reaction to today's announcement that Ambassador Nicholas Burns will resign in March as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. 
   "Nicholas Burns' departure marks the end of a long and distinguished career in the Foreign Service. While Ambassador Burns and I had our disagreements, I always greatly appreciated his candor. I hope that his exit will not further contribute to the President's confused foreign policy and further erode our moral and diplomatic standing as we enter this Administration's final year."
