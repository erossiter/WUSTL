BRIDGEPORT INTERMODAL CENTER RECEIVED OVER $5 MILLION TO SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION OF BUS TERMINAL, CONNECTIONS
  The City of Bridgeport received a $5,363,474 grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the construction of a bus terminal at the Bridgeport Intermodal Center, Sens. Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman announced today. The Bridgeport Intermodal Center brings public rail, ferry and bus facilities under one roof. The project will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and cut commute times for Bridgeport residents.  
   "For too long, roads and bridges have - like clogged arteries - impeded commuters both in Bridgeport and across our state," said Dodd. "These resources can help clear away commuter frustrations and improve our state's transportation system and economic health." 
   "Traffic gridlock in Connecticut not only affects the quality of life for our families, but it threatens to do real economic harm to our state," Lieberman said. "These funds will encourage more Bridgeport commuters to use transit, get more cars off our clogged interstates, and ensure our continued ability to attract new businesses to the state."
   The new bus facility will consist of an enclosed lobby/waiting area and transit offices and will be a part of the Intermodal Center, the centerpiece of the economic revitalization taking place downtown. The terminal will serve as a relief to CT commuters fighting the rising cost of gas and increased congestion in the area. 
   Dodd and Lieberman have secured over $34 million in federal funds for the Bridgeport Intermodal Center since 1999. The bus terminal will be operated by the Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority and serve as Bridgeport's central bus operating hub.
