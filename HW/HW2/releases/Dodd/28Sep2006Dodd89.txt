SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FIRE PROTECTION, SAFETY GRANT FOR CITY OF NEW LONDON
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today that New London will receive $31,745 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for fire prevention and safety initiatives. The grant is being made through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, a joint venture between the DHS Office of Grants and Training and the U.S. Fire Administration.  
   "Each and every day, firefighters in New London and elsewhere put their lives on the line to protect the people of Connecticut. They deserve our deepest thanks, but they also deserve the resources to do the job," said Dodd. "This funding is a step in the right direction but clearly more needs to be done to ensure that firefighters in our state and nationwide have the tools and resources they need to fulfill their critically important mission."
   "This grant will help New London firefighters in preventing fires and protecting real people and communities from disasters of any kind. It is yet another example of how the federal FIRE Act helps our local first responders move to provide the most up to date security they can," Senator Lieberman said.
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have long supported fire safety initiatives. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 332 grants totaling more than $32.5 million to aid fire departments in Connecticut.
