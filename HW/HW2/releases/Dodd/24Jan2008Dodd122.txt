CHAIRMAN DODD MEETING WITH TREASURY SECRETARY PAULSON TO FOCUS ON FINANCIAL MARKETS, STIMULUS PROPOSALS, ECONOMIC HEALTH
  After proposing his idea of a Federal Homeownership Preservation Corporation for inclusion in the stimulus package to Majority Leader Harry Reid earlier in the week, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, will discuss with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson tomorrow morning, issues of importance over which they both preside, including the vitality of the financial markets, the health of the economy, the stimulus package proposals and efforts to reduce record foreclosure rates. 
   "I've been consistent from the beginning on this issue," Senator Dodd explained. "I believe strongly that the economic downturn we are experiencing right now is absolutely tied to the foreclosure crisis impacting our cities and towns all over the country. Any stimulus package has to address the housing crisis if we are to expect it to be more than a band-aid in this tenuous situation."
   Dodd said he was looking forward to speaking with Sec. Paulson tomorrow and discussing how best to approach the economic situation and any stimulus package that is proposed.
   Dodd's mortgage corporation would purchase outstanding mortgages at the steep discounts at which they are currently valued in the marketplace, ensuring that lenders and investors are not being bailed out. Dodd will convene a hearing next week examining the relationship between the economic instability and the foreclosure crisis and how best to respond to it.
