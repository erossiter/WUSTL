SEN. DODD LAUDS FUNDING PROTECTING LOW-INCOME, ELDERLY IN CONNECTICUT FROM RISING HOME-HEATING COSTS
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today announced that Connecticut residents would receive $13,598,024 in federal funding to help low-income households pay for their home heating costs. The money, provided by the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, helps pay the winter heating bills or summer cooling bills of low-income and elderly people.  
   "In 2008, it's unconscionable that the elderly and low-income families are being forced to choose between putting food on their family's table or heating their home," Dodd said. "These emergency funds are coming at a critical time, with at least two more months of bitterly cold temperatures to be expected."
   The Connecticut Department of Social Services will distribute the resources to low-income and elderly households to help them cover increased home energy.
