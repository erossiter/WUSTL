SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON 110TH CONGRESS
  "Nearly two months ago, Americans went to the polls and demanded a change. Voters across the country have made it clear that they want a new direction for our country at home and abroad, and a new tone in Washington. It's time for the partisan rancor and missteps of the past few years to end, as well. Today we came together in a spirit of cooperation and collegiality to begin the work to move our country forward. I hope that the spirit of bipartisanship and optimism I saw today isn't done when the day is over. The American people rightfully expect much from us, and it's time to get down to work."
