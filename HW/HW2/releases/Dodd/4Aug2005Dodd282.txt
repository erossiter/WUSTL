MERIDEN TO RECEIVE MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PUBLIC SERVICES
  The city of Meriden will receive $1,033,134 to rehabilitate low- and middle-income family housing, spur economic revitalization in local neighborhoods, and provide public services to the homeless, children, and the elderly, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. 
   "Connecticut's neediest deserve a roof over their heads, not a ceiling over their dreams," Dodd said. "This assistance will not only help build better, more affordable homes, but will provide the support these families need as they pursue home ownership - and, ultimately, a brighter future." 
   "Through the restoration of community development funds this grant helps support diverse and significant redevelopment initiatives," said Lieberman. "Projects like these will help to keep our communities strong. This funding is a vital tool to help low-income families gain financial independence and it underscores the importance of acting now to get Connecticut families the help they need." 
   The funds were awarded as part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG), which helps local governments and communities build and rehabilitate affordable housing, as well as address other economic development needs. 
   The city of Meriden will use the community development funding for a broad range of initiatives, which may include housing rehabilitation and initiatives to increase home ownership among low- and middle-income families; residential and commercial neighborhood revitalization; and public support services such as transportation, job training, and daycare for the homeless, the elderly, children, and the mentally ill.
