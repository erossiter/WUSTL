SEN. DODD CONGRATULATES CONNECTICUT STUDENTS FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN WRITING
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) hailed today's report by The Nation's Report Card that found Connecticut eighth-grade students ranked first, along with students from New Jersey, out of 45 states in writing tests in 2007. More than 165,000 eighth- and twelfth-graders across the nation participated in the writing assessment, administered by the National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education. Dodd is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Chairman of its Subcommittee on Children and Families.  
   "This is a testament to the excellence of Connecticut's education system," said Dodd. "Connecticut makes a special investment in ensuring that Connecticut students have exceptional writing skills, and this investment has clearly paid off. I congratulate all the hard-working teachers, administrators, and most importantly, the students, for this great achievement, and I will continue to work to make sure that Connecticut students have the tools they need to remain the best and the brightest."
