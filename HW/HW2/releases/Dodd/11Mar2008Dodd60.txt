SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ADMIRAL FALLON
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today released the following statement on the resignation of Admiral William Fallon, the commander of U.S. Forces in the Middle East:
   "Admiral Fallon's departure marks a tremendous loss for our nation's military," said Dodd. "Frankly, his measured approach to international engagement is something we could use more of- whether he was rejecting saber-rattling with Iran or cautioning about the long term costs of the surge."
