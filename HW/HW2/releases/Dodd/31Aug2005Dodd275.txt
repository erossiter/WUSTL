SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON GASOLINE PRICE GOUGING
  Statement of Senator Dodd on Gasoline Price Gouging
   "The only thing that is rising as fast as gas prices is the anger consumers feel every time they drive up to the pump.  
 They're right to be fuming. People in Connecticut and across America have been subjected to a virtual 'shakedown' at the pump and the Bush Administration needs to do more than offer empty rhetoric - they need to provide concrete assurances that price gouging by oil companies isn't going to be tolerated. 
   "Obviously the tragic events of Hurricane Katrina have served to make a bad situation worse. And while the President should be commended for finally taking some steps recently, such as drawing down oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, more needs to be done. It isn't enough for the President to decry the notion of price gouging, he and his Administration need to investigate and comprehensively monitor pricing and specifically spell out what they intend to do to protect consumers in Connecticut and across the nation. If oil companies are using the terrible tragedy of Hurricane Katrina to line their pockets, while millions of Americans are scrambling to pay for the price of a gallon of gas, it goes without saying that they should be dealt with harshly and swiftly."
