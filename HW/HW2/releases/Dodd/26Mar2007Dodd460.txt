SEN. DODD LEADS FIGHT FOR COMPLETE FUNDING OF COMBATING AUTISM ACT
  Citing the rapidly rising incidence of autism spectrum disorders in young children, now estimated to be 1 in 150 children in 2007, Sen. Chris Dodd, author of the Combating Autism Act (CAA), has requested that the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education fully fund the measure for FY2008. The CAA passed both chambers unanimously in late 2006, and was signed into law shortly thereafter. 
   "Autism is a profound condition that can have a devastating effect on individuals and their families," said Senator Dodd. "We as a nation must devote significantly increased resources to finding answers to the many questions surrounding autism. Families struggling to raise a child with autism deserve our support, and they deserve answers. This legislation will help move us toward a better understanding of autism and better supporting those living with this difficult disability, but we cannot do that without the necessary funding."
   Writing to Subcommittee Chairman Tom Harkin and Ranking Member Arlen Specter, Sen. Dodd asked that the $168 million authorized in the bill be allocated in the following ways:
   * $114.5 million to expand, intensify and coordinate the activities of the National Institutes of Health related to autism spectrum disorders, including the support for the Interagency Coordinating Committee and Autism Centers of Excellence.
  * $37 million to increase awareness, reduce barriers to screening and diagnosis, promote evidence-based interventions, and offer training for professionals.
   * $16.5 million for the CDC's Disabilities Surveillance and Research Program for data collection, analysis and reporting. 
   Autism is a severe neurological disorder that affects language, cognition, emotional development, and the ability to relate and interact with others. It is a lifelong condition that affects not only the individual with the disability, but impacts the entire family, often requiring intensive levels of support and intervention. Current estimates suggest between 1 and 1.5 million Americans experience some form of autism.
