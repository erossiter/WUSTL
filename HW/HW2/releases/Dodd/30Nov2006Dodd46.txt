SEN. DODD ON ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMITTEE ON CAPITAL MARKETS REGULATION REPORT
"The United States has long enjoyed the deepest, most liquid, and most efficient capital markets in the world. This status has been achieved, in no small part, due to the most effective system of laws and regulations ever designed and implemented. Investors around the globe invest in our markets because they know that win, lose, or draw, they will be treated fairly. While we have an obligation to ensure that our legal and regulatory system helps to foster growth and promotes innovation, we must not damage the fundamental rights and protections that underpin the investor confidence critical to the success of our capital markets.  
 "This report makes a valuable contribution to our ongoing examination of international competitiveness, and I intend to review this report thoroughly in the coming days. It is clear that the competitiveness of our capital markets is of the utmost importance to maintaining America's economic leadership in the world and creating good jobs for our people at home. 
 "The efficiency, transparency and integrity of our financial markets is indispensable to our economic leadership in the world and economic growth and job creation at home."
