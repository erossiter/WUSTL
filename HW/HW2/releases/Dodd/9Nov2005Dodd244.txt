SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON OIL PRICES
  "Today we heard a lot of talk from top oil company executives. Talk is cheap. The price of gas is not. And while American families, businesses, and communities are paying more at the pump and more in heating costs, the five biggest oil companies took in a record $33 billion in profits this quarter alone. I've introduced legislation with Senator Dorgan to provide consumer relief in the form of a rebate check. Congress must act now because it's clear these oil companies aren't playing fair with the American public."
