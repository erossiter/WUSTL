SEN. DODD GUIDES TRANSIT SECURITY BILL THROUGH COMMITTEE
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) led the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which he chairs, to pass its first legislation in the 110th Congress today. The legislation was prompted by witnesses who testified before Dodd last month that the current Administration is doing far too little to protect America's 14 million transit riders from the risk of terrorist acts. 
   "Worldwide, transit is the top target of terrorist activities. We've already seen attacks on transit systems in London, Madrid, and Moscow. One of our many cities could easily be a target. Despite this clear warning, our nation still is not properly prepared to face this threat. Each and every day, millions of Americans step onto buses and trains to go to work and they deserve better protection. We must make transit a top priority when it comes to keeping our citizens safe. 
   "This legislation will help bring transit security closer to where it ought to be given the high threat. Beyond the obvious implications of physically protecting our citizens, safe transit systems can help to maintain public confidence, encouraging transit use and preventing our cities from being mired in gridlock."
