SEN. DODD WELCOMES HOGAN AS PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT
  Statement of Senator Dodd welcoming Michael Hogan as President of UConn:
   "I am proud to welcome Michael Hogan as the 14th President of the University of Connecticut. Dr. Hogan has been described as an 'academic decathlete'; at the University of Iowa, he distinguished himself as Vice President and Provost across a wide variety of fields. In his new role, I have no doubt that he'll continue UConn's rise to the top tier of public research universities, and I wish him all the best in Storrs."
