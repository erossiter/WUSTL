SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $42,000 FOR ALLINGTOWN FIRE DEPARTMENT IN WEST HAVEN
  Allingtown Fire Department in West Haven will receive a $42,123 grant, Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. Allingtown Fire Department will receive the funds for new equipment and safety and training programs. 
   "Connecticut firefighters are often the first on the scene of a catastrophe. They shouldn't be last when it comes to getting critically important resources," said Dodd. "Thankfully this assistance - while only a start - can begin to provide our firefighters with the help they need and deserve."
   "Our firefighters are at the front lines keeping Connecticut's citizens safe," said Lieberman. "It is important that we provide them with the support and equipment they need and deserve to continue protecting us everyday. These funds will help us help them."
   The Department of Homeland Security will award the money as part of the Assistance for Fire Fighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. The funds will be used for fire fighter health and safety programs, new fire fighting apparatuses, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety Programs.
   The awards were made possible by the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed more than 11,000 grants totaling more than $729 million to help fire departments across the country strengthen their response capabilities.
