SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO CONNECTICUT: FORMER PRESIDENT TO THANK STUDENTS FOR DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS
  Sen. Chris Dodd announced today that former President Bill Clinton will visit Connecticut to thank students for their fundraising efforts on behalf of those affected by Hurricane Katrina and the December tsunami disaster in South Asia Monday, October 3, at 1:30 p.m. at the O\'Neill Center located on the Westside Campus of Western Connecticut State University in Danbury.  
   \"I\'m so proud of our students here in Connecticut and obviously President Clinton was impressed too since he\'s agreed to thank the students in person for their tremendous efforts to help the people affected by these tragic disasters.\" 
   Dodd and the Connecticut Association of Schools requested the visit after the Brother\'s Brother Foundation, a nonprofit that seeks to improve international health and education, agreed to match the students fundraising efforts dollar-for-dollar if Clinton agreed to accept the check for the tsunami relief fund that he and former President Bush co-chair. Connecticut school students raised $300,000 and with the matching dollars will be able to build a 1,500 pupil school in Sri Lanka and provide funding support for the next five years. The students are now raising funds to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
   The event is limited to students at the participating schools but is open to members of the press.
