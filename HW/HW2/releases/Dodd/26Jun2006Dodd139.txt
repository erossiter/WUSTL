SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON VA FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT FOR CONNECTICUT
  "This is good news for veterans in our state. But I remain concerned that the VA and the Bush Administration aren't doing enough to put concrete resources to help care for our state's and nation's veterans. Every American owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to our nation's veterans and the least we should do is ensure that they get what they need when they come home from serving abroad. This federal assistance should be viewed as a first step, not the last."
