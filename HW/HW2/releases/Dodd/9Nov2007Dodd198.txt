SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE CRITICAL FUNDING FOR CONNECTICUT'S DEFENSE, SUBMARINE INDUSTRIES
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) today announced Senate passage of the 2008 Defense Appropriations Conference Report, which includes substantial funding for Connecticut's defense industry. This bill contains significant additional funds that will increase submarine production to two submarines per year by 2010 - two years earlier than originally planned by the Navy. This funding will impact thousands of jobs throughout Connecticut, especially in the southeast region of the state. The bill also includes substantial investments in current defense systems and research and development activities to ensure U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are outfitted with the quality resources they need to perform their missions
   "Finally, Congress has acknowledged the importance of submarines to our nation's security by passing this bill," said Dodd. "This bill is a vote of confidence in the workers of Connecticut who make the equipment that our military depends on to keep our nation safe. This legislation represents an investment in industries and technologies critical to our national security." 
   "The funding for a second submarine has been an extended battle for Connecticut, and today we declare victory. The additional submarine will fortify Connecticut jobs, and will make the entire country safer," stated Lieberman. "I am also extremely proud of the long list of defense research and development dollars for Connecticut that are included in this bill. The number of projects we were able to include in the bill is testimony to the strength of the high tech defense industry in our state. This funding will go a long way in keeping high paying jobs in Connecticut. This bill also keeps faith with our men and women in uniform, including many from Connecticut, by improving their pay and quality of life, their equipment, and the health care they need and deserve."
