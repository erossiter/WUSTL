SEN. DODD WORKS TO CREATE EQUAL PLAYING FIELD FOR BLIND AMERICANS IN WORKFORCE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today introduced legislation that would allow blind people to earn more in the workplace without losing critical Social Security benefits. To qualify for benefits under current law, blind Americans must earn less than $1,570 per month, which can discourage them from pursuing jobs that would bump their monthly income slightly above this rigid limit. By increasing this monthly limit over the next five years, the Blind Person's Earning Fairness Act of 2008 seeks to encourage blind people to pursue the jobs they want and live richer, more fulfilled lives as members of the workforce.
   "A staggering number - almost seventy five percent - of blind Americans are unemployed, often because they cannot afford to sacrifice their monthly benefits," said Dodd. "This is a great loss both for these individuals and for our society. It is absurd that our government discourages these willing and able Americans from pursuing full employment. By enacting this bill, we can help reverse this misguided practice and give thousands of blind people the opportunity to enjoy the rewards of the workforce." 
   Dodd's bill is supported by the National Federation of the Blind. Senator Dodd has been a longtime leader on disability issues.
   The Blind Person's Earnings Fairness Act of 2008
   Sen. Chris Dodd and Sen. John McCain
   Purpose: To update Title II of the Social Security Act to increase the level of earnings allowed for blind beneficiaries before applying a work penalty to the following levels:
   * For 2008 $1,800 per month
   * For 2009 $2,200 per month
   * For 2010 $2,500 per month
   * For 2011 $2,850 per month
   * For 2012 the earnings limit for individuals who attain Full Retirement Age in that year.
   Need for Legislation: Unemployment among blind Americans is at a staggering 74%. Increasing the earnings limit for blind people over five years and ultimately linking it to the limit applicable in the year of Full Retirement Age, work without facing an overwhelming financial penalty for their effort. This would remove a considerable disincentive to work for more than 100,000 blind beneficiaries and enable them to become live more productive lives.
   In 2008 a blind individual's earnings cannot exceed a rigid monthly limit of $1,570. Monthly earnings over this amount lead to immediate loss of the total Social Security payments paid to a primary beneficiary and all dependents. The current risk of losing these benefits for a blind head of household negates any possible economic benefit of going to work.
   An increase in the earnings limit would be cost-beneficial. An overwhelming majority of working-age blind people are already Social Security beneficiaries, so this change would not dramatically expand the number of beneficiaries. And with this meaningful work incentive proposal, many would also become taxpayers. The chance to work, earn, and pay taxes is a constructive and valid goal for senior citizens and blind Americans alike.
   Background: In 1996 Congress increased the Social Security earnings limit for seniors and gave them a powerful incentive to work. Advocates stressed that seniors would continue to work, earn, and pay taxes because they could do so with no fear of losing income from Social Security.
   The need for a higher earnings limit for the blind is just as compelling because of an all-or-nothing penalty for exceeding the limit and historically, until 1996, earnings limits for the blind and seniors were linked. In 2008 the earnings limit applicable to seniors in the year they reach Full Retirement Age is $36,120, adjusted annually. For blind individuals gross earnings exceeding $1,570 monthly ($18,840 annually) cause complete loss of benefits until attainment of Full Retirement Age.
   Existing Law: Like "retirement age," "blindness" is specifically defined in the Social Security Act and can be readily determined. By contrast, evaluating "disability" is far more subjective. Although blindness is specifically defined, not all blind people receive monthly benefits. Only those not working or whose work earnings are below an annually adjusted statutory earnings limit are eligible. Personal wealth derived from all sources other than work is subject to no penalty at all. However, income in excess of the earnings limit generated from work results in a complete loss of cash benefits for blind beneficiaries. Recognizing the negative impact of the earnings limit on seniors, Congress changed the law in 1996 and later entirely eliminated their earnings limit. The situation confronting blind people today is identical to the situation that seniors faced before 1996.
   Examples: For the blind who find employment, earnings almost never replace lost benefits once taxes and work expenses are paid. Therefore few beneficiaries can truly afford to attempt significant work, and those who do often sacrifice income and the security of a monthly check. The following examples illustrate the penalty for working:
   * A single blind person with no dependents having annual cash benefits from Social Security of approximately $12,000 or $1,000 per month (an average benefit), with no other income, receives this amount tax-free and earnings greater than $18,840 (the annual earnings limit for blind recipients) will terminate benefits.
   * Gross pay to replace benefits must be approximately $20,500, taking into account taxes and work expenses (including transportation and purchase of work-appropriate clothing).
   * This is $1,660 above the amount blind people are allowed. Annual earnings less than $20,500 clearly result in a net loss of income. While some blind people nevertheless choose to work, many do not because they cannot afford the lost income.
   * For a blind beneficiary with dependents, the situation is more desperate. With two dependents the family's total benefit from Social Security averages $17,870 tax-free annually, and earnings greater than $18,840 (the annual earnings limit for blind recipients) will terminate benefits.
   * Using conservative assumptions, including combined state and federal taxes of twenty-five percent of gross pay and child care for two children at $500 per month, replacing $17,870 in benefits would require over $32,000 in gross pay.
   * When dependents are involved, the choice whether or not to work is profoundly restricted, and the amount necessary to replace combined family benefits vastly exceeds the blind person's earnings limit.
   This legislation is supported by the National Federation of the Blind.
