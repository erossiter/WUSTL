SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINAL PASSAGE OF IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING BILL
  "A majority of members of Congress have been saying for months that it is time to change our course in Iraq. I have been among those who strongly believe the status quo in Iraq must end. Today, Congress forcefully and responsibly went on record opposing the President's failed policy in Iraq, and in so doing we have challenged the President to face reality. This war has been terribly costly - over 3,200 young lives of our brave men and women in uniform and more than $400 billion - with no measurable progress. It is not possible to justify "staying the course" any longer. With this bill, Congress is offering the President an opportunity to change our course in Iraq, to listen and respond to the will of the American people, and to support the men and women sacrificing their lives there. I urge the President to seize this opportunity to make America and Iraq stronger and safer. This is not a time for party politics or for looking back. It is a time for bipartisanship and forward thinking, and I sincerely hope the President will reconsider his decision to veto this measure when it arrives on his desk. The American people deserve no less."
