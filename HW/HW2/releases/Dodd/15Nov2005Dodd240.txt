SEN. DODD LAUDS PASSAGE OF DEFENSE BILL TO SUPPORT AMERICA'S ARMED FORCES
  Today, the Senate passed the Defense Authorization bill, which will help strengthen our military and boost Connecticut's defense industry. This bill provides a number of important benefits to military personnel in a time of war. The bill includes a 3.1 percent pay raise for all military personnel, expands health care benefits to children of troops killed in action, raises military death payments for the families of military personnel who have died in the line duty, and increases Service Group Life Insurance coverage for military families from $250,000 to $400,000 for all service members.  
   "Our nation's troops are giving their all on the field of battle. We need to ensure that they and their families have our support, but also the resources and equipment to prevail. This defense measure is a step in the right direction," said Dodd. "It lays out a blueprint to help ensure that our nation remains strong in a very dangerous world. I'm particularly proud that Connecticut workers - as they have in the past - continue to play a vital role in our national defense. Their work in building submarines, helicopters and other vitally important weaponry continues to strengthen our national defense and help fuel our state's economic engine." 
   Also included in the bill was an amendment authored by Senators James Talent (R-MO), Joe Lieberman, and Dodd to authorize another multi-year contract to procure 42 more C-17 aircraft and would encourage the Department of Defense to emphasize strategic airlift needs in the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. Pratt and Whitney manufactures the F117-PW-100 engines in Connecticut, which power these aircraft. 
   The bill will promote Connecticut's defense industry by authorizing the following: 
   * Virginia Class Submarines: $2.4 billion to produce one Virginia-class submarine. 
   * Submarine design and engineering: $185.8 million; including $30 million above the President's budget request for a Multi-Mission Module for Virginia Class submarines. 
   * SSGN Conversion: $334 million to continue converting ballistic missile submarines to attack submarines. 
   * Long Aperture Bow Array Sonar: An increase of $10 million above the President's budget request.
