SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES TRIP TO MIDDLE EAST
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) will leave Friday for a week-long trip to the Middle East to commend American troops for their service, assess the current state of affairs and willingness of regional leaders to help the United States, and examine firsthand how the proposals put forth in the Iraq Study Group Report impact the region. In addition to Iraq, Sen. Dodd will visit Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Jordan.  
   This is Senator Dodd's third visit to Iraq since the war began in 2003; his second to Lebanon and Israel this year. While in the region, potential meetings include Iraqi President Jalal Talibani, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, General George Casey, U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Sinoria and Jordan's King Abdullah. In addition to meeting with key leaders in each country, Senator Dodd will share a meal with troops from Connecticut. 
   Especially noteworthy is the inclusion of Syria in the Senator's itinerary, and his confirmed meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad. Senator Dodd has insisted for months that the United States should maintain open lines of communication with Syria, a sentiment that was echoed in the Iraq Study Group report released earlier this month. When visiting the region in April, the State Department urged Senator Dodd not to go to Syria. The State Department first urged against this trip, but the United States Embassy in Damascus will support it. 
   Senator Dodd will hold two conference calls while overseas - one for print reporters and one for radio reporters. More information will follow.
