SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $275K IN SCHOOL SAFETY MEASURES
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) today announced that four cities and towns in Connecticut will receive help from the federal government to assist local law enforcement agencies with school safety measures. The grants, totaling $278,028 and distributed to the towns of Clinton and Granby and the cities of Hartford and Stamford, are disbursed by the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS). 
   "Children today are faced with so many responsibilities and tough choices," said Dodd. "At the very least, we must provide them with a safe school environment that fosters their academic and social development and gives their families the peace of mind in knowing that their kids are safe. This assistance will help Connecticut children focus on learning, ultimately giving them a better education and a brighter future down the road."
   "The resources granted by the COPS program continue to make our communities - and in this case our schools - safer and stronger," Lieberman said. "These funds will help schools to install more security tools in and around our classrooms, improving the learning environment and strengthening the educational experience for Connecticut's youth."
   Specifically, the grants will support school safety programs that are largely already in place. The funding will be used to subsidize the costs of installation of metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other equipment that can help deter crime. They can be used to cover 50 percent of the cost of security assessments and training in schools. 
   The distribution of grants is as follows:
   * Clinton - $30,962
   * Granby - $206,714
   * Hartford - $24,185
   * Stamford - $16,167
