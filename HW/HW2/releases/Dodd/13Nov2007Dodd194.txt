SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BILL
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today expressed disappointment that President Bush vetoed the Labor, Health and Human Services (Labor HHS) Appropriations bill:  
   "It is unfortunate that President Bush has once again chosen to ignore both Congress and the American people to veto legislation that would improve the quality of life for millions of children and families throughout the nation. This needed legislation received wide bi-partisan support and would invest more than $150 million in education, health care, medical research, and job training. It is my hope that Congress will be successful in overriding this misguided veto and once again affirm its support for quality education and health care for the American people.
