SENS. DODD, FEINGOLD DRAW ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS WITH PRIVATE MILITARY FIRMS IN IRAQ
  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its report on the operation of Private Security Providers (PSP) in Iraq today, which highlighted the problems with U.S. funded PSP activities in Iraq. The study, which was conducted under the GAO Comptroller General's authority, was undertaken in part at the request of Sens. Chris Dodd and Russell Feingold.  
   The senators requested the study due to concerns about the costs of private security operations, vetting of PSP employees, implications of PSPs operating in a military zone, and the lack of regulation, guidance, and oversight of these companies. Many of these concerns were confirmed by the GAO's findings. The lawmakers plan to address the concerns raised in the report in the coming months. 
   "America has never before been confronted with the need to provide such extensive private security as it is today in Iraq. But this new demand has brought with it problems such as high costs, a lack of transparency and standards, and poor communication between security contractors and US military personnel," said Sen. Chris Dodd. "We here in Congress need to address these problems - and quickly. Only through action will we be able to protect lives, uphold our responsibility to the American taxpayer, and ultimately succeed in the reconstruction of Iraq." 
   "The GAO report confirms that there continues to be very little oversight or even understanding of private security contractors in Iraq," Feingold said. "The significant role these contractors now play in our national security policy and the vast resources they consume demand that we set clear goals and standards and effectively track their cost. I look forward to working with Senator Dodd and the rest of my Senate colleagues in addressing the important issues raised by the GAO report." 
   In particular, the GAO report found that: 
   * As of December 2004, federal agencies and contractors operating in Iraq had obligated more than $766 million for PSP operations, even though on many occasions, the PSP was unable to meet the contractor's needs. 
   * Neither the Department of State, Department of Defense, nor the US Agency for International Development have complete data on the costs of using PSPs. 
   * US government officials acknowledge that costs related to hiring PSPs have diverted a significant amount of funds dedicated to Iraqi reconstruction. In some instances, these costs have resulted in the canceling or reduction of scope of reconstruction projects. 
   * In general, there is a lack of "useful agency guidance" on matters related to PSPs. 
   * There continue to be incidents between the US military and PSPs, especially when PSPs approach military convoys and checkpoints. Moreover, military units new to Iraq are not provided with significant information regarding the operation of PSPs and their responsibility to them.
