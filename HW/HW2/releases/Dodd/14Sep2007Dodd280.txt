SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES NEW FUNDS TO FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINE IN CONNECTICUT
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) lauded the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) announcement of $450,000 in grants for Connecticut to fight the manufacture, use, and distribution of methamphetamine. The COPS Methamphetamine Initiative will provide $43.6 million to 117 different state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to combat methamphetamine use. 
   "Methamphetamine use is harmful not only to users, but also to families, friends, and their communities," said Dodd. "This funding will advance efforts to help ensure that our citizens avoid the terrible scourge of methamphetamine." 
   In total, COPS has awarded $355 million in the fight against methamphetamine. The COPS Office is a federal agency responsible for advancing community policing nationwide and supporting state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. Since 1995, COPS has invested $12.4 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring of more than 117,000 officers and provide a variety of knowledge resource products including publications, training, technical assistance, conferences, and webcasts.
