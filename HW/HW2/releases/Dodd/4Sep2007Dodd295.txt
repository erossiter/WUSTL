SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF NUSSLE AS OMB DIRECTOR
  Statement of Senator Dodd on the Nomination of Jim Nussle as OMB Director:
   "The first way out of a ditch is to stop digging. Unfortunately, appointing Jim Nussle as OMB Director is another example of President Bush digging our nation in deeper. As a Congressman, Mr. Nussle has a long record as one of the chief architects of the President's failed economic agenda. Under this President's watch, our nation has squandered its surplus and has run record deficits. At the same the President's economic policies have failed the American people. The typical American family earns less in real wages today than they did when the President took office. More Americans are without health insurance and for those that are fortunate to have health insurance, it has never been costlier. The cost of sending your children to college - the key for their economic security and the nation's future prosperity - is skyrocketing and is in danger of becoming out of reach for many families. Gas prices have more than doubled, our roads and bridges are literally collapsing and the President fails to fully fund our nation's infrastructure. Of course, the President still refuses to include the real costs of the war in Iraq in his budget.  
   "Congressman Nussle's record in support of the President's failed economic policy inspires little confidence that he will do what is really needed for America. Instead of continuing to pursue failed policies, we need to do an about face. The budget is a set of priorities, and this Administration's priorities are all wrong. Until the Administration realizes this, I do not think we will see the change that America needs to put us back on the right track."
