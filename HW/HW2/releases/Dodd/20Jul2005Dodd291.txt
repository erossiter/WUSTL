SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN HAIL COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF $1.4 BILLION FOR AMTRAK
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today hailed the Senate Appropriations Committee approval of $1.4 billion for Amtrak as part of the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.  
 This funding is a significant increase over the $360 million requested by the White House in their FY 2006 budget. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives voted to restore Amtrak to its FY 2005 funding level of $1.2 billion. 
   "Amtrak does more than transport commuters - it helps propel Connecticut's economy," said Dodd. "This assistance can help ensure that both continue to move forward, which is good news for our state and region."
   "Amtrak is a critical mode of transportation in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast," Lieberman said. "This funding will help ensure that the trains keep running, which will keep thousands of cars each day off of Connecticut's already congested highways."
   Earlier this year, Dodd and Lieberman personally worked with their Appropriations Committee colleagues to include funds for Amtrak. They also urged the Bush Administration to reverse its decision to cut funding for the rail. Back in February, Dodd and Lieberman met with Amtrak CEO David Gunn to discuss this issue.
