SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SPEAKER PELOSI'S TRIP TO SYRIA
  "Speaker Pelosi's trip to Syria is absolutely appropriate and reflects her understanding that whether we like it or not, decisions by the Syrian government do impact the lives of our men and women serving in the Middle East in a real and direct way, and therefore we must engage Syrian authorities directly in order to influence their decision making process. Last December, my official visit to the Middle East, which included a stop in Syria, was also criticized by the Bush Administration for meeting with President Assad. The Administration's effort to change Syrian behavior over the last two years with its policy of isolation has been a failure. In recent weeks there has been a tacit admission by the Administration that the policy of isolation has not worked as it how now agreed to join in talks with all of Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria, to stabilize Iraq. In light of that action, I find it extremely puzzling that the Administration would continue to criticize Congressional visits to Damascus. I commend Speaker Pelosi for her decision to include Syria on her itinerary, and I again urge the Administration to begin engaging instead of ignoring countries critical to our long-term success in the Middle East."
