SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT IN MEMORIAM OF FORMER GOV. O'NEILL
  "With the passing of Governor William O'Neill, the people of Connecticut enter a very sad time. Bill O'Neill was a true public servant and he will be deeply missed. As one of Connecticut's longest serving Governors, Bill presided over our great state for more than 10 years with a steady hand and even tone. Bill served Connecticut with distinction and his service helped improve the lives of people throughout the state. His constant dedication, unwavering compassion, and true humility put him in a class of his own. I think I speak for everyone in saying that it was an honor working with Bill. He was a true gentleman and a great friend. Jackie and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife Nikki and the entire O'Neill family at this difficult time."
