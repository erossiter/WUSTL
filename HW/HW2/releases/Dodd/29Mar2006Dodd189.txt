SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIKORSKY STRIKE
  "The workers at Sikorsky built this company. The reason Sikorsky is one of the preeminent helicopter manufacturing companies in the world is because of the quality expertise and skills of their workforce. So needless to say, I'm deeply troubled that this strike has not been settled. I've urged the management of Sikorsky in the strongest possible terms to redouble their efforts at finding some common ground with these workers. The answer lies in good faith negotiations - not threats of the hiring or utilization of other workers, especially in other states. That is definitely and absolutely not the answer. I have offered to do anything I can in my power to bring this strike to an end. In fact, today, in a conversation with Sikorsky management, I offered my office to facilitate any and all dialogue to ensure that these workers and the company find an equitable, fair solution to this strike. It is certainly not in the company's best interest or our national security's best interest to allow these workers' expertise to be lost and for this disruption to negatively impact on our armed forces."
