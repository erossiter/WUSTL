SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT DECISION REGARDING LEDBETTER V. GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on yesterday's Supreme Court decision: 
  "The Supreme Court's decision yesterday in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. flies in the face of the long-standing policy of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and years of legal precedent and will drastically restrict the ability of workers to redress wage discrimination. As Justice Ginsberg argued strenuously in her dissent, the court's decision overlooks the common characteristics of wage discrimination and will place unfairly high hurdles in the way of thousands of Americans facing systematic discrimination. This egregious decision will hinder the ability of American workers to receive equal pay for equal work."
