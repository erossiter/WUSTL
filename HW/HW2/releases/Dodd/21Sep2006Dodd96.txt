SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON CAPITOL SECURITY BREACH
  "An internal examination of this breach is currently underway and I don't want to prejudge its conclusions before a thorough and thoughtful examination. But I agree with the Capitol Police's own assessment that there was an unacceptable response to this security breach. It has been five years now since the tragic attacks of 9/11 and for this to occur just days after marking that horrible anniversary clearly shows that more needs to be done in terms of improved security. 
   "All of us are aware of the difficult challenges facing the men and women who strive to protect the Capitol and the visitors who visit here everyday. We owe them a debt of gratitude. But this was a serious breach, and I intend to closely and thoroughly examine the Capitol Police report when it is complete. We need to ensure that efforts are undertaken to ensure that any mistakes that were made don't occur in the future."
