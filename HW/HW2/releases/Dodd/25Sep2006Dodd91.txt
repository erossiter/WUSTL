SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE
  "This report is deeply disturbing. Intelligence experts attribute this growing radicalization to the war in Iraq, which they say has become the primary training ground for the next generation of terrorists. 
   "Before 9/11, the radical Islamic movement had at its core Osama bin Laden, his al Qaeda operatives and affiliated groups. We had a pretty good idea where the leaders were. We knew with one hundred percent certainty that bin Laden was in Afghanistan. 
   "Today's new radical Islamic groups take their inspiration from al Qaeda but are self- generating cells with no direct connections to Osama bin Laden, making them more difficult to identify and therefore to defend against.
   "The administration needs a new strategy for engaging the enemy - one that builds friends not generates more enemies."
