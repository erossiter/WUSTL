SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE $275,000 FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN TWO CONNECTICUT NEIGHBORHOODS
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today announced $275,000 to prevent, control, and reduce violent crime, drug abuse, and gang activity in two Connecticut communities.  
 Communities in Hartford and Norwalk were awarded Weed and Seed grants by the Community Capacity Development Office in the U.S. Department of Justice to help forge community policing efforts with prevention, intervention, and treatment initiatives and help neighborhood restoration efforts.
   "This assistance can help turn dead-end streets into on-ramps to opportunity," said Dodd. "It funds a wide variety of critically important initiatives that work, ultimately improving the lives of people in Hartford and Norwalk."
   "To effectively fight the war on drugs, we need a coordinated effort among federal, state, and local officials, schools, and communities," Lieberman said. "These funds will help ensure that Connecticut's kids receive the finest drug-awareness education and prevention efforts."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   * Hartford $50,000
   * Norwalk - South Norwalk Neighborhoods $225,000
   Weed and Seed is a community-driven initiative that aims to revitalize high-crime neighborhoods by "weeding out" criminals who participate in violent crime and drug abuse and "seeding" communities with social, educational, recreational, health, and cultural services to improve residents' quality of life. Partnerships between law enforcement, state and Federal agencies, community service organizations, local businesses, and residents help expand police coverage by increasing officers' walking beats and bicycle patrols in an effort to reduce street crime, noise, auto theft, graffiti, and prostitution. Weed and Seed initiatives also encourage housing rehabilitation and home ownership, problem-solving partnerships, and neighborhood revitalization.
