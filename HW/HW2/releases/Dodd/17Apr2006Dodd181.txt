SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN CALL FOR MEDICARE PART D CONCERNS TO BE HEARD
  Late last week Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) joined other Senate Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Michael O. Leavitt, asking the Secretary to address the financial constraints some states are facing due to Medicare Part D. 
   As a result of the failures of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), during the first three months of the new program, 46 states were forced to step in and pay for prescriptions on an emergency basis. However, no state has actually been reimbursed for expenses associated with the emergency coverage programs.
