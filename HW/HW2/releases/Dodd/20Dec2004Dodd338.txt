SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1.5 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FOOD, SHELTER FUNDS FOR CONNECTICUT
  Connecticut will receive $1,671,457 to supplement food, shelter and utility assistance programs for those at risk of becoming homeless or going hungry due to an emergency or economic disaster, Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Monday. The grants are part of the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security and has allocated more than $2.65 billion in federal aid since its inception in 1983.  
   "As the holiday season approaches, many of us reflect on how lucky we are to have family, friends, food on the table and a roof over our head, " said Dodd. "Sadly, there are thousands of people in our state that are not so lucky. We must do everything possible to help our needy friends and neighbors get back on their feet in tough economic times and this grant will help do just that."
   "Each year, this program lends a helping hand to people across America struggling to pay their rent and feed their families," Lieberman said. "By providing communities with the flexibility to decide how to best spend these resources, it ensures that the assistance goes to those who need it most."
   Since its creation 21 years ago, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program has provided a helping hand to local social service organizations that assist thousands of people in need of food and shelter. A national board, chaired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and composed of representatives from the American Red Cross; Catholic Charities; United Jewish Communities; National Council of Churches; Salvation Army and United Way of America governs the program. Funds are distributed according to a formula that includes unemployment and poverty statistics in each county. Once local boards in counties, parishes and municipalities across America receive the funding, they decide how to best address the needs of their communities. For example, many communities use these funds to supplement the efforts of local soup kitchens, Meals-on-Wheels programs and food pantries to address emergency shelter and housing needs.
