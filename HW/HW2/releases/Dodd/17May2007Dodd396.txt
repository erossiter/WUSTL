SEN. DODD CALLS ON BUSH TO REPLACE GONZALES, WOLFOWITZ, UNFIT TO SERVE
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today introduced a resolution calling on President Bush to immediately propose new candidates for the positions of U.S. Attorney General and President of the World Bank, currently being filled by Alberto Gonzales and Paul Wolfowitz, respectively. Senator Dodd characterized Mr. Gonzales as unfit to serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, citing cronyism, misleading Congressional testimony, and an inability to defend and protect the Constitution. Mr. Wolfowitz's violation of the World Bank's ethical and governance rules, as well as a World Bank ethics committee investigation, conflicts with the Bank's global mission of reducing poverty, aid development, and promoting good governance in all nations in which it operates.  
  "Be it the World Bank or the Department of Justice, the way to maintain the integrity of an institution is to have leaders of integrity at the top," said Dodd. "The time has come to move beyond these leaders in the best interests of these two institutions whose work has critical national and international consequence. The White House has sat on the sidelines for far too long. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for the President to immediately propose new candidates for these posts to ensure that the integrity and the efficacy of the Department of Justice and the World Bank are preserved, and, indeed, to preserve the honor and the effectiveness of our nation."
