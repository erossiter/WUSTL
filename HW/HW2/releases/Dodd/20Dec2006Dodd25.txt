SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR NEW HAVEN FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that the City of New Haven's Fire Department will receive $307,440 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for operations and safety programs. 
   "The holidays are thought of as the season for giving, and Connecticut firefighters generously give their time, bravery and nobility year round," said Dodd. "While their efforts can never be fully rewarded, I am grateful that their hard work will be recognized in part by this funding." 
   "This holiday season, New Haven firefighters likely will be sacrificing their family time to protect the lives and property of other families," Senator Lieberman said. "This grant represents a small token of the appreciation we all feel for the brave men and women who selflessly rush to the scene of a disaster in order to help others."
   These awards were made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to reduce critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER Act and FIRE Act were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 351 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
