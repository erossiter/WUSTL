SEN. DODD TO CO-CHAIR CONGRESSIONAL CAUCUS ON PRESS
  Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., has recently been named the Senate Democratic Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press. The purpose of the new caucus is to support freedom of the press around the world and draw attention to media censorship and the persecution of journalists. 
   "Journalists and representatives of the press are on the front lines of freedom of information. When they are harmed or intimidated, the victim is not only them but democracy," said Dodd. "This caucus will help spotlight their critically important work and hopefully foster better understanding of the challenges the press face each and every day worldwide."
  The caucus will examine the current threats to journalists worldwide and identify policies that can better provide for the free flow of information. In 2005, more than 65 journalists were killed and 1,300 were threatened or attacked.
   Other Co-Chairs of the bipartisan, bicameral caucus are Senator Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Representatives Mike Pence (IN, 6) and Adam Schiff (CA, 29).
   Senator Dodd is the author of bipartisan legislation, the Free Flow of Information Act, to set national standards that must be met before a federal entity may subpoena a member of the news media in any government, criminal, or civil case.
