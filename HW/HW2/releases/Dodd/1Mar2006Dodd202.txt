SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $2 MILLION IN GRANTS TO BOOST CONNECTICUT CRIME CONTROL
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that Connecticut will receive $2,189,001 to combat crime and substance abuse. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) is intended to boost efforts to combat crime. The Connecticut Office of Policy and Management will use the funding for training, personnel, equipment, supplies and informational systems for criminal justice.  
   "This funding will provide the tools necessary for law enforcement to make Connecticut communities safer places to live." said Dodd. "It can help people young and old by increasing the likelihood that the justice system in Connecticut can prevent crime in the future."
   "Connecticut's law enforcement deserves the technical support needed to keep our communities safe because the best way to prevent crime is to stop it before it starts," said Lieberman. "These federal funds and the programs they support are critical to reducing crime and substance abuse in our neighborhoods."
    The JAG plan will focus on: 
   * Substance Abuse: Attack the drug problem from a public health perspective by supporting treatment and aftercare programs and services so offenders are less likely to relapse and recidivate; 
   * Sanctions and Recidivism: Take measures to alleviate prison and jail crowding so that those inmates who need to be incarcerated are, and those who can be safely supervised and treated in the community are given the opportunity, and;
   * Systems Improvement: Bolster the criminal justice system so that it can operate more efficiently and effectively through technology upgrade training and coordination of multi jurisdictional activities.
