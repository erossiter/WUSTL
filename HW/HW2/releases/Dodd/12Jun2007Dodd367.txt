SENS. DODD, SHELBY ANNOUNCE BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT REQUIRING STRINGENT NEW OVERSIGHT
  Responding to years of inaction by the Treasury Department to identify and promptly adjust currency manipulation by our largest trading partners, Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Richard Shelby (R-AL), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, today announced that they will introduce legislation to level the playing field for American workers and businesses. 
   China's ongoing intervention to keep the yuan undervalued has contributed to the loss of approximately three million American manufacturing jobs, the record-high U.S. trade deficit, and undermined our overall competitiveness. The Dodd-Shelby proposal, among other things, would create tough, new authority for both the Treasury Department and the Congress to act to provide a level playing field for U.S. manufacturers and workers. The legislation would also tighten the definition of currency manipulation to provide for greater clarity and to prevent ambiguity or delay in addressing the problem. No other Congressional legislation encompasses these two elements. 
   "The United States stands to benefit greatly from China's booming economy and growth, but the current conditions of this relationship are hurtful to the U.S., not helpful," said Dodd. "A change in our currency manipulation policy is long overdue. America's companies and workers deserve an opportunity to compete on fair terms with countries such as China, just as we provide market access and fair competition for China and other nations on our soil. We are not asking for a headstart here, just a fair race. Secretary Paulson deserves credit for working to address China's unfair currency and trade practices through the Strategic Economic Dialogue. But dialogue alone is not enough; we need action as well." 
   Senator Shelby said, "I have long believed that China manipulates its currency, thereby giving it an unfair trade advantage. Although evidence gathered by the Treasury Department clearly supports this conclusion, Treasury has regrettably declined to label China a currency manipulator."
   "Accordingly, I am pleased to join with Chairman Dodd in introducing legislation that tightens the definition of 'currency manipulation' and spells out a clear process for actions to be taken by Treasury in the event that a country is found to manipulate its currency. While the Strategic Economic Dialogue is significant and necessary, this legislation provides more tools to combat unfair trade practices and also provides a formal voice for the Congress. I believe that this legislation will provide the Treasury Department with the impetus necessary to produce real results, and I look forward to working with Chairman Dodd to expedite it through the committee process." 
   Dodd and Shelby wrote to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson last month, urging him to use both dialogue and action to combat currency manipulation. The Banking Committee has held two hearings on the issue this year - one in January and one last month. 
   Senators Dodd and Shelby announce this legislation on the eve of the Treasury Department's release of the International Economic and Exchange Rate Policy report, which is issued to the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee - the committees of jurisdiction over currency-related matters - on a semi-annual basis.
   THE CURRENCY REFORM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ACCESS ACT OF 2007
   June 12, 2007 
   The Dodd-Shelby legislation would take significant new action to recognize and remedy currency manipulation by China and other countries, which has been harming the American economy, hurting our manufacturing base and driving record U.S. trade deficits. The bill also promotes Treasury's role in enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. financial services firms. 
   STRENGTHENS TREASURY'S ABILITY TO FIND CURRENCY MANIPULATION: 
   * Strengthens the definition of currency manipulation to identify countries that have both a material global current account surplus and a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States as currency manipulators, without regard to intent. 
   REQUIRES TREASURY TO ADDRESS AND REMEDY CURRENCY MANIPULATION: 
   * Requires the Treasury Department to submit a detailed plan of action to the Congress within 30 days of a finding by Treasury of manipulation. The plan of action shall set specific timeframes and benchmarks, with the goal of remedying the manipulation.
   * Requires Treasury to engage in bilateral and multilateral negotiations with countries that manipulate their currency. The Treasury must immediately seek IMF consultations when manipulation is found and requires Treasury to use its voice and vote at the IMF to that end.
   * Provides Treasury the authority to file a WTO Article XV case to remedy currency manipulation if the goals and benchmarks are not met within 9 months.
   AUTHORIZES A CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCESS: 
   * Creates a process by which Congress, led by either the Senate Banking or House Financial Services Committee, can originate a joint resolution of disapproval when Treasury fails to cite manipulation. Provides for an expedited process for such a motion through the floors of both chambers.
   PROMOTES MARKET ACCESS FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS: 
   * Requires Treasury to annually monitor and report to the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee on market access barriers for U.S. financial services firms, to identify challenges, and to develop plans to address those barriers.
   * Requires the Treasury's initial report to include the status of the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) as it relates to financial services firms. This would become the only congressionally required report on the progress of the SED.
