SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN NOTE IMPORTANT VICTORY IN LICAP CASE
  Connecticut Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman Wednesday hailed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to postpone implementation of a plan that would have artificially increased by billions of dollars electric rates paid in Connecticut and across New England.  
   "This is a major step in the right direction," said Dodd. "It means - simply put - that figuratively our state will get its day in the FERC 'court' when it comes to this very important matter. Consumers in our state deserve an affordable and reliable power supply, and hopefully this ruling signals that FERC is hearing the arguments that we've been making all along. It at least buys our state additional time to make our case and ensure that our interests are protected." 
   "I am pleased that FERC has heeded our request to postpone implementation and to reexamine its ill-advised plan to raise electric rates in Connecticut and throughout New England," Lieberman said. "Billions of dollars in additional electric costs to Connecticut ratepayers are at stake. This decision allows Connecticut to make its case against the proposed rate hike, and ensures consumers will not pay these higher electricity rates starting January 1, 2006, as FERC originally proposed." 
   The two Senators recently succeeded in getting a "Sense of the Congress" resolution attached to the energy bill asking FERC to reconsider its decision, which would have hiked rates to create over $12 billion of new financial incentives for energy companies to encourage, but not require, them to build more electric generation plants. 
   Dodd and Lieberman have repeatedly joined the Connecticut officials and other members of the Connecticut Congressional Delegation in strenuously opposing this proposal's financial impact on Connecticut consumers, as well as the impact it will have on Connecticut's overall economic and business development picture.
