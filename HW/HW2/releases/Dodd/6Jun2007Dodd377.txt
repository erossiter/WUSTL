SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. THOMAS
  "Today I remember a distinguished colleague and a good friend, Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming. 
   "Craig was a soft-spoken Senator, but no one was more dedicated to his state. From his childhood on a ranch in Cody, to his studies in agriculture at the state university, to his more than four decades in public service, Craig was a son of Wyoming through and through. And since his election to Congress in 1988, the people of his home state were his first priority. Craig's services to rural America made him one of the most popular leaders in Wyoming history, regularly reelected by resounding margins. His work on rural health care and job creation improved the lives of thousands of Wyoming families, and thousands more rural families all over America. And as a Westerner, Craig was devoted to wilderness-to America's open spaces-for his entire life.
   "Craig led a full life-full of service to his country and high accomplishment. His wife, Susan, and his four children are in my thoughts and prayers. Though they hardly need me to remind them, they should be very proud."
