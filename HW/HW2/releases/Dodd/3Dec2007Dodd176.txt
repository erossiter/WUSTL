SEN. DODD: PRESIDENT CHAVEZ SHOULD RESPECT WILL OF VENEZUELAN PEOPLE
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs, today made the following statement in reaction to the outcome of Sunday's vote, in which Venezuelan voters rejected a proposal to implement a new constitution that would have eliminated presidential term limits. 
   "I call upon President Chavez to respect the will of the Venezuelan people, who courageously went to the polls on Sunday and defeated a proposal that would grant President Chavez broad new powers and eliminate term limits for the office of the president. Despite harsh media crackdowns and numerous attempts by President Chavez to silence and marginalize his opposition, the Venezuelan people went to the polls and courageously decided that it is the rule of law, not the power of personality that rules in Venezuela. I call on President Chavez to fully and unconditionally respect the outcome of this recent referendum."
