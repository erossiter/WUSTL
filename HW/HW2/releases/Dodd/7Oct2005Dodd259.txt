SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $100,000 IN GRANTS FOR WEST HARTFORD FIREFIGHTERS
  The West Hartford Fire Department will receive a federal grant totaling $106,639 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. 
   "The brave men and women who serve in our fire departments should have every possible resource at their disposal to keep themselves and the people they protect safe," said Dodd. "I will continue to work to make sure our firefighers have the tools necessary to carry out their important duties safely and effectively." 
   "We are all indebted to this country's fire services, and recognize the importance of funding fire fighting and fire prevention," said Lieberman. "These grants will help Connecticut's citizens rest assured that those who risk their lives to protect them from fire danger have the necessary funding." 
   The award was made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 314 grants for a total of more than $31 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
