SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $400,000 IN GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Three Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $385,182 in federal grants for fire operations and firefighter safety, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Wednesday. Fire departments in Kent, Barkhamsted, and Stamford will receive grants made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  
   "Just as we wouldn't send our armed forces into the field without the best weapons, we shouldn't ask firefighters to do their very difficult job with second-rate equipment," said Dodd. "This assistance can ensure that our firefighters have the tools they need as first responders to protect our families, not only from fires, but from the risk of terrorism." 
   "Firefighters across Connecticut risk their own lives every day to protect our communities, and they deserve our whole-hearted support," Lieberman said. "These grants are a great first step toward providing the resources our first responders need to prepare for and react to emergency situations." 
   DHS will award the money as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. The funds will be used for firefighter health and safety programs, new firefighting apparatuses, Emergency Medical Service programs, and Fire Prevention and Safety Programs.
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   * Barkhamsted East Fire Department $ 39,690
  * Kent Volunteer Fire Department $ 25,992
  * Turn of River Fire Department, Inc. $ 319,500
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed more than 16,000 grants for a total of more than $1.1 billion to help fire departments across the country strengthen their response capabilities.
