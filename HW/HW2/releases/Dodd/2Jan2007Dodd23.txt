SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORD
  "This is a very sad moment for our nation. Gerald Ford was a true American patriot and public servant who led this nation through one of the most difficult times in our nation's history. His steady hand, unwavering love of our country, and deep commitment to working in bipartisanship fashion during those rough and turbulent times helped heal deeply divisive wounds and move our nation forward. My thoughts and prayers are with the Ford family at this most difficult time."
