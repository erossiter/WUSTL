SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF ENACTMENT OF SARBANES-OXLEY
  Statement of Senator Dodd on the 5th Anniversary of the Enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley: 
   "Five years ago, confidence in American business and the stock market had taken a severe blow. But in July of 2002, the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley took a major step towards restoring that confidence. It was the most significant reform of American business law in recent history, and in the five years since its passage, I believe that Sarbanes-Oxley Act has worked in achieving its over-arching goals of improving financial reporting, strengthening corporate governance and enhancing the integrity of analysts' recommendations. I'm proud to have helped author this vital legislation and want to continue to see that the statute is implemented effectively and efficiently, including for smaller businesses."
