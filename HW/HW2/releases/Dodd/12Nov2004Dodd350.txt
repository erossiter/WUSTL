TWO CONNECTICUT COMPANIES TO RECEIVE MORE THAN $45 MILLION IN FEDERAL CONTRACTS
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that two Connecticut companies, Select Energy, Inc. of Berlin and Stanadyne Corporation of Windsor, have received a total of more than $45 million in contracts to help provide energy to the Pentagon.  
   "The Department of Defense and our nation will be well-served by the award of this contract. Just as the workers of Select Energy and Stanadyne provide the Pentagon with needed fuel, their high quality work pumps pride into the state of Connecticut."
   "Select Energy and Stanadyne represent Connecticut's proud tradition of providing our nation's military with the best quality products and services," Lieberman said. "These contracts will be a boost to our state's economy and our nation's security."
   Select Energy Inc., formed at the start of electric utility restructuring, provides electricity, natural gas and other energy commodity supplies to businesses and institutions throughout 11 Northeastern U.S. states from Maine to Maryland. The company has received $44,378,606 from the Defense Department to provide electricity to Defense and Federal Civilian Installations located in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. 
   Beginning as a screw manufacturer in 1876, Stanadyne went on to develop the mechanical rotary fuel distribution pump and today manufactures filters, injectors, fuel management systems, support product and fuel additives. Stanadyne has been awarded a $658,122 contract by the U.S. Army for the delivery of fuel, pumps, and metering for the Army's High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicles. This award is one part of a larger contract valued at more than $9 million. All of the work contracted to Stanadyne will be performed at Stanadyne's headquarters in Windsor.
