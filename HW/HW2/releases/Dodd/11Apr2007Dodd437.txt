SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PREDATORY LENDING, JEC REPORT
  "I commend the Joint Economic Committee for undertaking research on this very important issue, and I am eager to carefully review their findings. I have announced that I plan to convene a summit in the coming days of leaders from all the stakeholders on this issue to come together to try to work out a process for providing relief to homeowners, and I will certainly incorporate the JEC's research into the discussion as we work to develop a solution to keep Americans in their homes. The turmoil in the subprime market is affecting millions of Americans, and I welcome any and all ideas and initiatives to keep the American dream of homeownership alive and attainable."
