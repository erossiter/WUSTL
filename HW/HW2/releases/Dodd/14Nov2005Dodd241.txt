SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE $2.6 MILLION HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FOR CONNECTICUT
  The state of Connecticut will receive a $2,613,621 grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to help the state and municipalities develop, maintain, and improve their ability to prepare and respond to hazards such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Monday. 
   "This assistance can't magically shield Connecticut from future dangers, but it can help ensure that the state is better prepared to deal with possible threats," said Dodd. "Protecting the American people from terrorism requires more than tough talk. It requires tough, smart choices, too. More resources should be allocated to prepare for a possible crisis. The Administration continues to support billions in tax breaks for the most affluent few while cutting funds that can help keep all Americans safe from terrorism." 
   "This funding is important to help Connecticut prepare for disasters of all kinds," Lieberman said. "Connecticut must be ready today to prevent and cope with the possible disasters of tomorrow, whether natural or caused by acts of terrorism. We have much more to do before we are adequately prepared, but this funding will help." 
   The Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) allows states to allocate funds according to risk and to address the most urgent state and local needs in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The EMPG provides support services that state and local governments need to improve emergency management preparedness which include hazard identification and risk assessment, hazard management, resource management, training, and public education.
