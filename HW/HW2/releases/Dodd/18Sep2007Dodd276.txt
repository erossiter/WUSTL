SEN. DODD EXPRESSES FRUSTRATION DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT FAILS TO GO TO VOTE
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) expressed his frustration that a filibuster prevented the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act from consideration by the Senate. The Act would create a new permanent seat in the House of Representatives for the District of Columbia. The vote was 57-42.  
   "There is nothing more fundamental to the vitality and endurance of a democracy of the people, by the people, and for the people than the people's right to vote," said Dodd. "The Constitution guarantees it, and the US Supreme Court has repeatedly underscored that it is one of our most precious and fundamental rights."
   "Citizens of the District, a majority of them African-Americans, who fulfill all of the duties of citizenship, ought to have the right to vote and be represented in Congress as decisions are made about their taxes, about war and peace, or about any of the myriad other questions that Congress faces each day." 
   The DC Voting Rights Act of 2007 would extend voting representation to the nearly 600,000 people who live within the borders of the District of Columbia. There have been many different proposals over the years to extend to DC citizens the right to vote, including constitutional amendments, statehood legislation, and retrocession proposals.
