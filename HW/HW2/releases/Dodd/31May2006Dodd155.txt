SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON DHS FUNDING FOR CONNECTICUT
  "The Bush Administration continues to 'nickel and dime' our nation's security needs. Law enforcement officials in Connecticut are working night and day to keep our state safe. They deserve our thanks and respect. They don't deserve funding cuts that shortchange their critically important efforts to protect our citizens. I intend to continue to fight to ensure that more resources are provided to people on the front lines of our state and nation's security."
