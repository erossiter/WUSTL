SEN. DODD INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO PRESSURE PAKISTAN ON AL QAEDA
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today introduced a resolution that will express to the Administration Congress' view that military assistance to Pakistan to help target and eliminate the terrorist activities of the Taliban and Al Qaeda should be granted only if the government of Pakistan pledges not to allow these groups to operate in their country. Sens. John Kerry (D-MA) and Joe Biden (D-DE) are cosponsors of the resolution. 
   "The fact that the Taliban and Al Qaeda have established critical sanctuaries in Pakistan from where they continue to launch and plan attacks five years after 9/11 is simply unacceptable. It reflects the misguided priorities and policies of this administration in fighting the war on terror," said Senator Dodd. "The Government of Pakistan has been a pivotal partner in the war on terror and Pakistan has itself endured acts of terrorism and sectarian violence. But the Government of Pakistan must do more in apprehending members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda and preventing their operations on its territory. Stronger US-Pakistan relations depend on it."
