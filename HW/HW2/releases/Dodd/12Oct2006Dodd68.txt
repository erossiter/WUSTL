SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON COLTSVILLE HISTORIC DISTINCTION DECISION
  "I couldn't disagree more with this decision. This proposal offered a "win-win" for Connecticut and its people as its aim is to preserve both our nation's history and create needed jobs. It goes without saying that this application should have been - and needs to be - approved. Coltsville's rich history and important national contributions should make it the ideal candidate for this distinction. Clearly, this decision needs to be immediately reviewed and reconsidered."
