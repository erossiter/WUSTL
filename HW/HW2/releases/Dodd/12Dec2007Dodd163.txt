SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF HIS DIVESTMENT LEGISLATION TO PRESSURE SUDAN GOVERNMENT
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today lauded the Senate's approval of his legislation which would provide several tools for pressuring the government of Sudan into halting the ongoing genocide in Darfur. The "Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act," today passed by unanimous consent. 
   "Genocide imposes a grave moral obligation on those with the power to stop it. This legislation empowers Americans to exercise their rights as investors, taxpayers, and pensioners to divest from businesses directly contributing to the violence and misery of hundreds of thousands of innocent Darfuris," said Dodd. "It is critically important that Congress and the President act with great haste to enact these measures into law."
   The "Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act" will:
   * Permit interested states and localities to adopt measures for divesting from companies involved in four key Sudan business sectors 
   * Allow mutual fund and private pension fund managers to cut ties with companies involved in four key Sudan business sectors; while maintaining that managers abide by fiduciary responsibilities and comply with all laws and regulations 
   * Require federal government contractors to certify that they are not involved in business in four key sectors of Sudan's economy. 
   * Require the Departments of State and the Treasury to report on the effectiveness of current Sudan sanctions 
   * Provides conditions under which this bill will expire, including that Sudan abide by a UN Security Council Resolution, cease attacks on civilians, demilitarize the Janjaweed militia, allow unfettered humanitarian relief delivery, and grant refugees right of return. 
  Senator Dodd has consistently supported immediate action in dealing with the crisis in Darfur. As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Dodd oversaw the passage of the legislation out of Committee where it passed unanimously on October 17th. The bill now proceeds to the House of Representatives where it is expected to be considered shortly.
