SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT OF ON IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today issued the following statement after the Senate voted to defeat the motion to invoke cloture on S. 1639, the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007: 
   "I am deeply disappointed that the Senate voted against the motion to invoke cloture on S. 1639. With over 12 million undocumented workers in America, a dysfunctional immigration system, and broken borders, our country is facing an immigration crisis that undermines the rule of law, divides families and threatens our national security. The American people expected this Congress to find a workable and comprehensive solution to resolve this crisis. This bill was far from perfect, especially in terms of the guest worker program and family unification. But it offered us an opportunity to move beyond the status quo and fix some of these problems including by investing billions of dollars in border security and practically dealing with the undocumented population. Moreover, by proceeding with the bill and potentially going to conference with the House, we would have had a further opportunity to address some of its shortcomings. Instead, with the bill's defeat, our nation is less secure, our immigration crisis will only fester and deepen, and we have reverted to a silent form of amnesty by doing absolutely nothing. The President has spoken time and again of the importance of achieving comprehensive immigration reform. This was meant to be his signature domestic issue. As this vote made crystal clear today, he failed to deliver as did his party. The President's inability to lead on this issue, as on Iraq, has once again come at an enormous cost to this nation."
