SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEW FIRE GRANT FOR CONNECTICUT
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) today announced a federal grant to the Pleasant Valley Volunteer Fire Department of Barkhamsted totaling $92,215 to improve firefighter safety and operations. These awards were made possible by the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grants program. In fiscal year 2007, the AFG program will award approximately $490 million to fire and EMS departments across the country. 
   "The Pleasant Valley Fire Department plays a critical role in the safety of the Barkhamsted community," said Dodd. "First responders bear great responsibility and risk, and it is our duty to make sure that they have the means and equipment necessary to perform their jobs as safely and effectively as possible."
  Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has distributed 409 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
