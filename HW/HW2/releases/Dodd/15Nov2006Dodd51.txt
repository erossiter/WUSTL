SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE THREE CONNECTICUT FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO RECEIVE OPERATIONS, SAFETY GRANTS
The Old Mystic, Poquetanuck and Ashford Fire Departments will receive $252,540 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today. The funding will be used for operations and safety.  
 "Firefighters work tirelessly to keep us safe, and they deserve the funding necessary to protect themselves in this honorable yet dangerous line of work," said Dodd. "These grants will help provide the proper vehicles, equipment and renovations our firefighters and firehouses need to do their jobs safely and effectively."
 "Our firefighters are an integral part of our first line of disaster response. These grants are part of a critical federal program to provide adequate resources to our firefighters to ensure they have the resources they need to perform their jobs and to safely protect their communities," Lieberman said.
 The fire departments to receive funding are:
 Old Mystic Fire Department - $146,330
 Poquetanuck Volunteer Fire Department - $34,390 
 Ashford Volunteer Fire Department - $71,820.
 This award was made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
 Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 347 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
