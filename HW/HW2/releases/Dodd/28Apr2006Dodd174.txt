SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S APPROVAL OF DUBAI'S TAKEOVER OF DONCASTERS
  "I'm very concerned that this purchase may impact U.S. military- related manufacturing in Connecticut. I've asked the Treasury Department and Doncasters for a briefing on exactly what conditions have been placed on the transaction to ensure that national security interests are protected. I intend to find out from Treasury officials what, if any, national security vulnerabilities were identified in the course of the 45-day CFIUS investigation, and how those vulnerabilities are going to be mitigated if this deal goes forward. I also look forward to hearing the game plan for implementing any proposed safeguards from Doncasters' representatives. My final decision on this transaction will take into account all relevant information."
