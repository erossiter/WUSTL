SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON FORMER CONNECTICUT GOV. MESKILL
  I am saddened to hear of the death of Thomas J. Meskill. Tom served the people of Connecticut as a mayor, as a congressman, and as governor. From his earliest days in state politics, he inspired his constituents with his ability to bring together disparate factions and achieve concrete results. Tom ended his career by serving for nearly two decades as a judge on the federal bench. There, as at every other point in his political life, he was respected for his fair-mindedness. My thoughts and prayers are with his family tonight, especially his wife Mary. Governor Meskill deserves our gratitude; as one of his colleagues put it, "He brought more advancements to Connecticut than people will ever know."
