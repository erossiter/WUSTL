CHAIRMAN DODD UNVEILS PLAN TO HELP STUDENTS AFFORD COLLEGE
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, today announced that he will introduce legislation to help students and their families afford college. Chairman Dodd's legislation would implement needed reforms in the private student lending market - the fastest-growing segment of the $85 billion student loan industry - and will help ensure that all students wishing to pursue a higher education are able to obtain the most competitive and affordable student loans.
   The Private Student Loan Transparency and Improvement Act would require lenders to provide more accurate and timely information to their customers about the interest rates, terms and conditions of their products, thereby helping students better understand their financial options and obligations. The legislation will also prohibit documented practices that have harmed students and families in obtaining the most competitive and affordable student loans. 
   "The ability to pursue a higher education is a fundamental element of the American dream," said Dodd. "We must ensure that Americans have options to be able to pay for college, and I believe that private lending should be one of them. That said, I have several concerns related to the overall impact private loans have on a student's educational and financial future. When lenders approach students - their potential customers - are they presenting them with all the facts, in clear language that 18-year-olds can understand and agree to? Are they treating their prospective customers fairly and independent of where they attend school and where they live? I fear that in some cases, perhaps many, the answer to these questions may be 'no' - which is simply unacceptable. This legislation will help to ensure that students understand the products they are buying to help finance their education, and that unfair and deceptive practices in this market are outlawed. Finally, I want to acknowledge the tremendous work that has been done by Senator Kennedy, Congressman Miller, and Attorney General Cuomo to address the shortcomings in the federal student loan market - my efforts today serve to complement theirs."
   "I commend Senator Dodd for crafting a thoughtful and thorough legislative response to the deceptive and illegal practices uncovered by my office as part of our investigation into the private student loan market," said New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. "This bill will go a long way to taming the wild west of the student loan industry. The bill prohibits the most egregious industry practices and seeks to deter discriminatory lending and underwriting practices. The problems we have found in the student lending industry are nationwide in scope and demand a federal solution. I also commend Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller who, like Senator Dodd, are working to pass legislation that will help and protect students and parents across the country."
   Chairman Dodd is leading Congressional efforts on the oversight of the private educational lending market, and has pledged to address the issue aggressively and comprehensively. At the hearing he convened on Wednesday, Chairman Dodd announced that he will convene a meeting with federal regulators on their oversight of this market. On Thursday, he sent a letter along with Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to the top 20 lenders in the country requesting information on the criteria by which they underwrite their loans.

   "The Private Student Loan Transparency and Improvement Act"
   June 8, 2007
   The Dodd legislation extends new protections to all private student loans in order to improve transparency, prevent unfair and deceptive private lending practices and eliminate conflicts of interest.
   Preventing Unfair and Deceptive Private Lending Practices and Eliminating Conflicts of Interest: The Dodd legislation draws from the New York State Code of Conduct and applies provisions of it to the private student loan market. The Dodd bill would:
   * Prohibit lenders from engaging in revenue-sharing and loan co-branding arrangements that use the name or logo of an institution;
   * Prohibit lenders from offering inducements, or any item of value, in exchange for preferential consideration of their private loan products or services;
   * Prohibit lenders from using any data in their underwriting that may have disparate impact on the loan products, terms, or conditions available to student borrowers based on race, age, and other personal factors, or the institution they attend.
   Improved Disclosures to Student Borrowers: Borrowers are best served when provided with accurate and timely disclosures about their private student loans. The Dodd legislation would:
   * Require all private student loan solicitations to include a disclosure box that includes the loan's APR, other information regarding the terms and conditions of the loan, whether the rate is introductory or promotional, and if so, its duration;
   * Require lenders to provide a clear and concise disclosure of the rate, terms and conditions of a private loan that has been approved for a student borrower prior to their signing the promissory note; and provides borrowers with a "cooling off" period;
   * Requires lenders to provide prominent disclosure to applicants of their eligibility for lower-cost federal loans through the federal financial aid program and requires the borrower, and co-signor, to certify that they have received, and read, the disclosure;
   * Apply Truth in Lending Act (TILA) provisions to all private student loans
   Promoting Loan Transparency: The Dodd bill would authorize the Federal Reserve to implement rules requiring private lenders to collect and report data regarding their student loan applications, originations and denials, including the terms and conditions of the loans they make, aggregated by the race, gender, and age of the borrower as well as by type of institution. Similar requirements exist for mortgage lending activities under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), which was enacted to curb discriminatory mortgage lending practices.
   Making College More Affordable: The Dodd bill would authorize federal banking regulators to give financial institutions credit under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) for making "low-cost" private loans (i.e. loans with costs and fees similar to federally guaranteed loans) to low-income student borrowers.
