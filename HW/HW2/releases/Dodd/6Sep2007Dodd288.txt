SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO REPORTED LEVIN-REED LEGISLATION
  Today Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) expressed his opposition to the reported Levin-Reed legislation: 
   "Rather than picking up votes, by removing the deadline to get our troops out of Iraq you have lost this Democrat's vote. 
   "Despite the fact that this has been the bloodiest summer of the war and report after report says that there has been little to no political progress, the White House continues to argue that their strategy is working. 
   "It is clear that half measures are not going to stop this President or end this war. 
   "I cannot and will not support any measure that does not have a firm and enforceable deadline to complete the redeployment of combat troops from Iraq. Only then will Congress be able to send a clear message to the President that we are changing course in Iraq, and a message to the Iraqis that they need to get their political house in order. 
   "I urge my colleagues to join me and declare their opposition to this measure."
