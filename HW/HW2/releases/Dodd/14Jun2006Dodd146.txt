SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE OVER $2 MILLION IN AID FOR CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today that the Connecticut Department of Transportation will receive $2,912,620 in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation to help purchase new vehicles for the CTTRANSIT-Hartford division. This money is part of the $3.3 million Senators Dodd and Lieberman secured for buses and bus-related facilities in Hartford in the FY06 Transportation, Treasury, HUD Appropriations bill.  
   "This assistance can make a real difference. It will do more than just help transport commuters - it can help move our economy in the right direction," said Dodd. "By providing commuters in the region with more buses, we can hopefully reduce traffic congestion and make Connecticut's transit system more efficient. That's good news for our state."
   "As soaring gas prices continue to burden daily commuters and smog increasingly pollutes our cities, it is important to give Connecticut citizens travel options through public transportation," said Lieberman. "This grant will help to satisfy these growing needs."
   CTTRANSIT is the Connecticut Department of Transportation-owned bus service. CTTRANSIT-Hartford operates over 30 local and 12 express bus routes, many of which operate seven days a week, serving the 26 towns in the capital region. CTTRANSIT-Hartford makes connections with Middletown Area Transit, and CTTRANIST-New Britain, helping to connect central Connecticut residents and businesses.
