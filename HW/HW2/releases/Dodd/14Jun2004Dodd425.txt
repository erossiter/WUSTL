SENATE APPROVES SEN. DODD'S AMENDMENT TO HELP AMERICAN SOLDIERS
  In response to reports that U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq were sent into combat without appropriate protective gear, Sen.  
 Chris Dodd today successfully won approval for an amendment to reimburse troops for protective equipment purchased with personal funds.
   "American troops are bravely and valiantly giving their all on the battlefield. They shouldn't have to also give by digging into their pockets to pay for protective gear," said Dodd. "This measure will help fix that by helping to ensure that our combat troops have the support and resources they need."
   The Dodd amendment was developed in response to discussion with members of the military and concerned families like that of Specialist Bill Palifka, a member of the Connecticut National Guard's 248th Engineer Company, which was stationed west of Baghdad last year. He learned shortly before deploying that his unit wouldn't have the interceptor vests it needed to be safe in Iraq. So his mother, a nurse from East Hartford, went out and bought a vest for $1,100 from a private company. Families and communities around the country have likewise raised funds to send body armor and other safety equipment to loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   While recent budgets have sought to address equipment shortfalls, little is being done to repay those military personnel and their loved ones who have already used their own money to pay for essential gear. The Dodd amendment recognizes that private citizens and community organizations should not have the responsibility to provide U.S. troops the items they need to stay safe in combat operations, and repays those who have had to invest in their own protective equipment.
