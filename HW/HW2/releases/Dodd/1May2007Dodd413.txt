CONNECTICUT DELEGATION URGES BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE FEDERAL RELIEF FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY DEVASTATING NOR'EASTER
  Connecticut's Congressional delegation urged the Bush Administration to provide federal relief funds to help repair damage caused by the devastating nor'easter that hit the region last month. In a letter to President Bush and Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) Director Arthur Cleaves, the delegation calls on the administration to grant the state's request for federal assistance.
   "The State of Connecticut's preliminary damage assessment demonstrates statewide flooding resulted in damage to over 2,406 residential units and more than 179 businesses," the letter said. "Private sector losses are estimated at $31,215,550 and public sector damages are estimated at $11,978,231. These preliminary damage assessments confirm major impacts to residents, businesses, and State and local government units."

   The Honorable George W. Bush
   President of the United States
   The White House
   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
   Washington, DC 20500
   Through: Mr. Arthur Cleaves
   Regional Director - FEMA Region I
   U.S. Department of Homeland Security
   99 High Street, 6th Floor
   Boston, MA 02110-2320
   Dear Mr. President:
   We are writing to voice our strong support for Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell's April 30, 2007 request that you declare a major disaster for the State of Connecticut as a result of a major nor'easter which produced heavy rain, frozen precipitation, high winds, and coastal, riverine and urban flooding beginning on April 15, 2007.
   On the morning of Sunday, April 15, 2007, a major nor'easter engulfed the State of Connecticut causing flooding along the Farmington, Housatonic and Connecticut rivers for several days. Flood warnings were cancelled on the Farmington River on April 20, 2007 and on the Housatonic River on April 21, 2007. Flood warnings continued for the Connecticut River until Friday, April 27, 2007 - twelve (12) days after the storm.
   On April 15, 2007, Governor Rell took all necessary steps under state law when she executed the State Emergency Plan, and ordered activation of the State Emergency Operations Center. Governor Rell urged all motorists to avoid driving on the morning of April 16, 2007 due to widespread flooding. In addition, on April 17, 2007 Governor Rell directed the State Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security to solicit damage reports from State and local officials. Finally, on April 18, 2007 Governor Rell requested a Federal/State preliminary damage assessment (PDA) pursuant to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regulations.
   The State of Connecticut's preliminary damage assessment demonstrates statewide flooding resulted in damage to over 2,406 residential units and more than 179 businesses. Private sector losses are estimated at $31,215,550 and public sector damages are estimated at $11,978,231. These preliminary damage assessments confirm major impacts to residents, businesses, and State and local government units.
   Governor Rell has determined that the April 15, 2007 major nor'easter is of such severity and magnitude that the financial costs exceed the State of Connecticut and affected local governments capabilities. Supplementary federal assistance is necessary to ensure continued appropriate cleanup and repair operations, and to ensure public safety. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 5121-5206 (Stafford Act), we strongly urge immediate and favorable consideration of Governor Rell's request for the following federal assistance: (1) Public Assistance for Fairfield, Litchfield, Hartford, and New Haven counties; (2) Individual Assistance which includes Individuals and Households Program, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Small Business Administration disaster loans, and Farm Service Agency loans for Fairfield, Litchfield, Hartford, New Haven, and Middlesex counties; and (3) that the Hazard Mitigation Program be made available statewide.
   We thank you in advance for your consideration of this matter.
   Sincerely,
