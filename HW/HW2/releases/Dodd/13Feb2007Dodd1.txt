SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAN
  "I am deeply troubled by this Administration's escalating rhetoric against Iran, especially intelligence from unnamed officials that is not fully documented. It is frighteningly reminiscent of the pattern we saw in the drumbeat that led to the war with Iraq. We continue to witness the lethal consequences of our failed policies in Iraq. I will not remain silent should the Bush Administration attempt to lead us down a similar path with respect to Iran.  
   "Iran's regime poses a serious threat to the region - to Iraq, Israel and the United States, most especially. Iran is supporting and financing international terrorist organizations and is seeking to acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons. And it is wielding influence within certain quarters of Iraq in ways that are destabilizing. 
   "Unfortunately, until very recently the Bush Administration sat on the side lines and did nothing to engage Iran in any meaningful dialogue to press Iran to change course. The United States must exhaust all avenues - robust diplomacy and direct negotiations coupled with economic pressures on Iran's financial and energy sectors. While the United States should never take any option off the table to advance our national security interests, it is critical that all options be carefully analyzed and the implications of their use fully understood. Based on the Administration's track record I have no faith that it will behave judiciously."
