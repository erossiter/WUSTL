SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEW FIRE GRANTS FOR CONNECTICUT
  Senators Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (ID-CT) today announced $677,693 in federal grants to five Connecticut cities and towns for vehicle acquisition and improving operations and firefighter safety. These awards were made possible as part of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program by the U.S. Fire Administration. In fiscal year 2007, the AFG program will award approximately $490 million to fire and EMS departments across America.  
   "Connecticut's firefighters are the people we depend on most during emergencies," said Dodd. "Each and every day these brave men and women put their lives on the line to protect the people of their community. These grants will help ensure Connecticut's first responders receive the training and equipment they need to continue their live saving work." 
   "Across this great state, our firefighters valiantly put their lives on the line to protect our families and friends," said Lieberman. "I am pleased that these Connecticut towns will receive greater resources so their first responders can better perform their heroic service."
  The following fire departments received federal grants:
   * South Fire District of the City of Middletown - $50,827
   * City of Norwalk Fire Department - $77,659
   * Town of Burlington Fire Department - $307,161
   * Oneco Fire Company Number 1 - $64,871
   * Winchester Volunteer Fire Department - $177,175
  Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has distributed nearly 420 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
