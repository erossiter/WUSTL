SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON COMMISSION ON SECURITY FORCES OF IRAQ
  Statement of Senator Chris Dodd on Commission on the security forces of Iraq: 
   "Today's report by the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq has found what the American people concluded long ago. As General Jones said, "there is a fine line between assistance and dependence." I could not have said it better myself. The report states that Iraq's Police Force is exceedingly dysfunctional and should be dismantled ; and that Iraq's Army still has a way to go before it will be an effective defense force. Iraq's political leadership is not going to take the necessary steps to address these and other weaknesses in Iraq's government until they understand that our commitment truly is not open-ended. That is why we should begin to redeploy US combat forces from Iraq and to complete that redeployment by April 31, 2008. Then there can be no doubt that Iraq's future is the responsibility of its political leaders."
