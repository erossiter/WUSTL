SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $600,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Five Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $591,246 in federal grants to improve operations and firefighter safety, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000, which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security.  
   "One of the many lessons that we can learn from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina is that our firefighters and first responders need to be fully equipped for anything that comes their way including natural disasters," said Dodd. "While only a start, these grants are a step in the right direction, but we can and must do more to ensure that our first responders are given the tools they need to keep us safe at home." 
   "Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath have made even more apparent the vital role of first responders in saving lives and helping communities recover from emergencies," Lieberman said. "We must do all we can to make sure first responders have the resources to do their jobs well, and I am pleased that this funding, while only a beginning, will help provide Connecticut firefighters with needed training and equipment." 
   The following fire departments will receive grant awards: 
   * Windham Center Fire Department $55,385 
   * Vernon Fire Department $183,217 
   * Westbrook Ambulance Association Inc. $76,712 
   * Canaan Fire Company $200,787 
   * Sharon Fire Department, Inc. $75,145 
   The awards were made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 303 grants for a total of more than $30 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
