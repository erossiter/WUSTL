SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT RULING RE: GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES
  "Today's decision by the Supreme Court to decline the appeals of two inmates at Guantanamo Bay is extremely regrettable, as it would have helped restore America's international credibility with respect to adherence to the Rule of Law. 
   "This misguided decision highlights the urgency of enacting the Restoring the Constitution Act into law. This legislation would restore basic rights to people who have been imprisoned by our government, and protect our men and women serving overseas by restoring adherence to the Geneva Conventions. 
   "Our ability to combat terrorism and promote the rule of law is seriously impaired when we fail to live up to the standards we call on others to adhere to."
