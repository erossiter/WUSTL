SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR WOLCOTT, NIANTIC FIRE DEPARTMENTS
The Niantic and Wolcott Fire Departments will receive $198,550 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) announced today. The funding will be used for operations and safety.  
 "Firefighters put their lives on the line every day to keep our citizens safe," said Dodd. "We owe these men and women not only our profound gratitude, but also the resources they need for proper equipment, training, and recruitment."
 "Our communities rely on first responders to help them in times of need, and our first responders rely on us to provide them with the equipment and training they need to safely and effectively do their jobs," Lieberman said. "The fire safety grants announced today will greatly benefit the communities of Niantic and Wolcott by providing their first responders with the resources they need to do their jobs."
 The fire departments to receive funding are:
 Niantic Fire Department - $70,300
 Wolcott Volunteer Fire Department - $128,250 
 These awards were made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
 Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to reduce critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER Act and FIRE Act were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 348 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
