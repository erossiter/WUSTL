SEN. DODD INTRODUCES MEASURE TO ENSURE COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TERMINAL ILLNESSES
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) has introduced legislation in the Senate that would amend the Social Security Act (SSA) to ensure that individuals suffering from certain terminal diseases are entitled to receive social security disability benefits. Under current law, an individual who contracts a covered terminal illness, and who has not been part of the workforce for a period of time, may not qualify for social security disability benefits they would otherwise be entitled to.  
   "This bill is really about ensuring fairness. We should reward people who contribute to the social security system, not punish them," Dodd said. "Under the current system hardworking Americans are being denied benefits at a time when they need them most," Dodd said.
   The Claire Collier Social Security Disability Insurance Fairness Act would amend the SSA to provide that the eligibility standard for disability insurance benefits not be applicable in the case of a disabled individual suffering from a covered terminal illness. Currently, the SSA mandates that a person earn 20 quarters of Social Security earnings during the 10 years preceding a disability to collect benefits. This discriminates against people who have earned the required number of credits outside of the time period prescribed. 
   This bill is named after Claire Collier, a Stamford mother of three, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2003. Sen. Dodd became aware of this issue after meeting with Ms. Collier in Washington.
