SEN. DODD MEASURE TO PROVIDE NEWSPAPER ACCESS TO BLIND PASSES SENATE
  Promoting the goal of equal access and participation for all, a bill which ensures funding to the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) for NFB-NEWSLINE passed the Senate by unanimous consent yesterday. The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS), provides funding for real-time electronic audio copies of newspapers by telephone to the blind and disabled individuals.  
   "I commend the National Federation for the Blind for developing this unique public-private partnership to serve the needs of the blind and disabled individuals," Dodd said. "This bill will help continue to serve existing readers with improved services, while at the same time expand services to more readers." 
   The NFB-NEWSLINE program is a telephone-based electronic audio newspaper service serving our Nation's 1.3 million blind Americans by providing nearly 28 million minutes of on-demand service in response to 2,600 calls per day. Currently, NFB-NEWSLINE provides some level of service to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by providing local dialing numbers for the blind and disabled to use to access newspapers and periodicals. The bill authorizes $750,000 to the Library of Congress for this service in fiscal year 2007, and continuing funds for fiscal years 2008-2111.
   "For a very modest amount of funding, NFB-NEWSLINE ensures that all Americans, regardless of disability, have timely access to the decisions of their government and the happenings within their community, nation, and the world beyond," Senator Dodd said.
