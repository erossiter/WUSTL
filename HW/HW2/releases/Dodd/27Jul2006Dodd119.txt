SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADAM WALSH BILL SIGNING
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Adam Walsh Bill Signing: 
  "Every child is a precious gift. When one is tragically abused, molested or killed, the unfathomable pain and loss is beyond comprehension. We need to do everything in our power to protect our children and punish those who would do them harm. This measure will establish important new sentencing guidelines and a national sex offender registry, and lay out uniform reporting requirements for state sex offender registration programs. As the author of an earlier bill that included many of the concepts that were incorporated into this measure, I believe that this legislation will help American to protect our children."
