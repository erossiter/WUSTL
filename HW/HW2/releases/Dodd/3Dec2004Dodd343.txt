CONNECTICUT TO RECEIVE $24 MILLION FOR HOMELAND SECURITY
  The State of Connecticut will receive $24,080,428 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for important homeland security and emergency preparedness activities, including training, planning and the purchase of specialized equipment, Sens. Joe Lieberman and Chris Dodd announced Friday.  
   Both Senators expressed strong disappointment with regard to the distribution of funding to high-threat urban areas, and plan to follow up with the Department of Homeland Security for a full explanation of how DHS determines which cities are designated to receive such grants. New Haven received funding from this account for FY 2004, but no Connecticut cities were funded for FY 2005. Senator Lieberman, ranking Democrat on the Governmental Affairs Committee which oversees the Department of Homeland Security, plans to ask the new nominee for Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for details on how the allocations for high-threat areas are made.
   "Safeguarding our citizens against the threat of terrorism takes money, so that those on the front lines can do the job they are expected to do and are expert in doing," Lieberman said. "This money for the state is a start toward helping ensure 
   Connecticut communities have the equipment, training, and technology necessary to respond to a terrorist attack, or any other emergency situation. But we will track the progress for the high threat areas closely. Cutting high-threat urban area money from the state at this time is a huge mistake." 
   "This assistance can't magically shield Connecticut from future dangers, but it can help ensure that the state is better prepared to deal with possible threats," said Dodd. "It can help provide critically important resources to help ensure that Connecticut has the tools it needs to ensure that the state has a united, prepared front when it comes to a possible crisis. Protecting the American people from terrorism requires more than tough talk. It requires tough, smart choices, too. This Administration continues to support billions in tax breaks for the most affluent few while cutting funds that can help keep all Americans safe from terrorism."
   Through the State Homeland Security, Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention, Citizen Corps, Emergency Management Performance Grant, and Metropolitan Medical Response System programs, DHS provides financial assistance to the states to improve the capabilities of state and local agencies to respond to terrorist attacks.
