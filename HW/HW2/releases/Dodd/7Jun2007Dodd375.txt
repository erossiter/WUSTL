SEN. DODD DENOUNCES BOYCOTT OF ISRAELI UNIVERSITIES
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently sent a letter to Sally Hunt, the Joint General Secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), applauding her objection to the UCU's vote to endorse a boycott of Israeli academic institutions and expressing outrage at its passage.  
   "UCU's support of the boycott conflates scholarship and politics to such an extent as to make the two indistinguishable," the letter stated. "Whatever one's view of the Arab-Israeli conflict, holding Israeli universities responsible for the policies of their government is as untenable as holding Oxford responsible for the foreign policy of Prime Minister Blair. Universities ought to be institutions of learning, not organs for politics."
