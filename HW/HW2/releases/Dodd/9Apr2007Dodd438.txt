SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON IMMIGRATION
  "I agree with the President's stated goal of achieving comprehensive immigration reform this year. With over 12 million undocumented workers in our country, the American people expect Congress and this administration to find a workable solution to this longstanding problem - one that protects American jobs and security while providing a pathway to earned citizenship for undocumented workers, many of whom play an important role in our economy. Unfortunately, last year, efforts to pass an immigration reform bill were blocked by the Republican-controlled House. In this Congress, we have an opportunity and an obligation to tackle this issue head-on on a bi-partisan basis. But without Presidential leadership, comprehensive reform will not be possible. Hopefully, this time the President will have the courage to stand up to members of his own party who fought against reform last year."
