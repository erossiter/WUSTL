SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT OF ON SENATE VOTE ON EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on the Senate Vote on the Employee Free Choice Act:  
   "I am disappointed that due to the outcome of today's vote, the Senate will not have the opportunity to enact the Employee Free Choice Act, a measure that would help improve the workplace for millions of American workers by creating an atmosphere where they could choose a union free from employers' pressures. If we are going to preserve the American middle class-if workers are going to be able to effectively bargain for their fair share-then we need a way to deter unwanted coercion and discrimination, and a way for workers to fearlessly let their voices be heard. Passing this legislation would have been a crucial step in the fight for strengthening worker's rights. Although I am frustrated by the obstructionist tactics employed by some Senators to prevent full debate on this measure, I will continue to work to put real teeth in our labor laws and help improve the working conditions for all American workers."
