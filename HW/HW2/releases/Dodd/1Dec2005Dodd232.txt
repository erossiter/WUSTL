SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH SIGNING ROSA PARKS MEASURE INTO LAW
  "This is a fitting tribute to a remarkable woman. Rosa Parks was a true civil rights pioneer. Though she was humble by nature, she had a steely determination that led to the betterment of her fellow citizens. I am pleased that the signing of this measure coincided with the 50th anniversary of her heroic actions."
