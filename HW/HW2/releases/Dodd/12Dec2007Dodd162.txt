SEN. DODD PRAISES HEAD START RENEWAL
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following remarks after President Bush signed into law a five-year renewal of Head Start. Dodd is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the chairman of its Subcommittee on Children and Families.  
   "As a longtime advocate for children and the Head Start program, I am pleased to say that today signifies the culmination of years of hard work. The Head Start program establishes the foundation for a lifetime of learning for many of our most vulnerable children, both in Connecticut and throughout the nation, and this five-year reauthorization will provide additional resources to strengthen its impact and lay the groundwork for its continued success. I want to thank my colleagues for their tireless dedication to this vital program and commend the strong bipartisan effort that it took to get this vital initiative through Congress. Nothing reduces poverty as much as a strong education, and Head Start provides children what they need to start learning early."
