SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. DISTRICT COURT'S RULING ON WIRETAPPING
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on U.S. District Court's ruling on wiretapping: 
  "Today's ruling by a federal judge finding that the government's wiretapping program administered by the National Security Administration is unconstitutional comes as no surprise to those of us who believed the government had been overstepping its boundaries and lawlessly infringing upon the rights of law-abiding citizens. U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor should be commended for her adherence to the values we promise so ardently to uphold in the U.S. Constitution and this illustrates, yet again, the need for the Bush Administration to get serious about lawfully protecting the national security of our country rather than thumbing its nose at the law in the name of fighting terrorism."
