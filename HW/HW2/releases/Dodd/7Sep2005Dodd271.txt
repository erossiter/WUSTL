SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON CONNECTICUT'S AIR NATIONAL GUARD RULING
  Statement of Sen. Chris Dodd on Connecticut's Air National Guard Ruling 
   "Connecticut's 103rd Fighter Wing has a proud history of service to our state and nation. I applaud the court's ruling to stop the removal of Connecticut's only Air National Guard aircraft. It is the right decision and I will continue to support the state's authority over its own National Guard assets."
