SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF HABEAS CORPUS RESTORATION ACT OF 2007
  "I applaud the Senate Judiciary Committee for reporting favorably today on the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007. This is an important first step in reasserting our nation's commitment to the rule of law and correcting the deeply flawed Military Commissions Act of 2006, which in its current form, does not provide a credible process for bringing suspected terrorists to justice. I urge my colleagues to also support comprehensive legislation that I have offered: the Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007. In addition to restoring Habeas Corpus rights, this legislation bars evidence gained through torture or coercion and reinstates U.S. adherence to the Geneva Conventions in order to protect the nation's military personnel abroad."
