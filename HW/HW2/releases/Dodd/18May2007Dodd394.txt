IN LETTER, CHAIRMAN DODD, COMMITTEE MEMBERS URGE REGULATORS TO QUICKLY FINALIZE SUBPRIME GUIDANCE
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, today sent a letter to federal regulators commending their decision to extend the protections and underwriting requirements established by the Nontraditional Mortgage Guidance to subprime borrowers, and urging them to finalize the guidelines as quickly as possibly. The guidelines will help loan servicers ensure that prospective homeowners understand and are able to afford the terms of the adjustable rate mortgages being offered to them, as borrowers often experience severe payment shocks when these types of mortgages reset. The letter also urges the regulators to encourage servicers to abide by the Statement of Principles - aimed to provide long-term, affordable alternatives to homeowners facing foreclosure - that leading stakeholders agreed to after Chairman Dodd convened a Homeownership Preservation Summit last month. 
   Banking Committee members Jack Reed (D-RI), Charles Schumer (D-NY), Wayne Allard (R-CO), and Jim Bunning (R-KY) joined Dodd in sending the letter to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration.
   "I am encouraged by the regulators' decision to apply the guidelines to the subprime market," said Dodd. "But as each month passes with more inaction, Americans are losing their homes. I hope that the regulators recognize the urgency of this problem, and act quickly to fulfill their obligation to address this growing crisis, both with regards to this guidance and future regulation."
