SEN. DODD PROTECTS FAMILY VALUES IN AMENDMENT TO IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today continued his longstanding legacy of advocating for children and families when he introduced an amendment to S. 1348, the Immigration Reform bill currently being debated by the Senate. The Dodd amendment unites parents with their children who are U.S. citizens by increasing the annual cap on green cards for parents, extending the duration of the parent visitor visa proposed in S. 1348, and ensuring that penalties imposed on overstays of the visa are not unfairly applied to others. 
   "The strong bond between parents and their children is a worldwide phenomenon, and exceeds any barrier, fence, or border patrol," said Dodd. "This amendment ensures that we respect and promote family relationships between our fellow citizens here in the United States and their parents abroad by making sure the visitation provisions in the underlying bill are sensible and fair. I hope my colleagues agree that the current measures in the bill unreasonably keep parents from their children, and therefore threaten the deeply held American belief in the importance of families." 
   Senator Dodd is a senior Democratic on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and is the Chairman of the Senate Children's Caucus. 
   Senator Menendez (D-NJ) is a cosponsor of the Dodd amendment, and the following organizations have offered their endorsement:
   * National Council of La Raza
   * National Immigration Forum
   * Conference on Catholic Bishops 
   * Asian American Justice Center 
   * Immigrant Legal Resource Center
   * Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF)
   Background Information on Senator Dodd's Uniting Parents and Children Amendment
   * Under current law, parents of US citizens (USCs) are defined as immediate relatives, along with spouses and minor children, and are exempt from green card caps. S. 1348 removes them from this category, subjects them to an annual cap of 40,000 green cards, and creates a new parent visa category. 
   * The Dodd amendment unites parents with their families in the US by increasing the annual cap on green cards for parents; extending the duration of the parent visa; and ensuring that penalties imposed on overstays are not unfairly applied to others. 
   * The debate around this provision goes to the heart of how a family is defined in America. For millions of immigrant families, parents are not distant relatives but absolutely vital members of the nuclear family who play a critical role, be it as grandparents providing care for their grandchildren while their parents are at work or as sources of strength and support for their bereaved or single children. 
   * Ensuring that parents have every opportunity to unite with their children or live with them for extended periods is important not only because of their contribution to the nuclear family but also so that their children can support and care for them in sickness and in health. 
   * It is unfair to USCs that their right to sponsor parents is being limited under the guise of reducing "chain migration." Once parents of USCs obtain immigrant visas, they usually complete the family unit and are not likely to sponsor other relatives. USCs with parents abroad must not be treated differently than those with parents here.
   * This amendment ensures that justice is done to parents and citizens who seek to keep their families intact and who lawfully benefit from the parent visa program by: 
   a. Increasing the green card cap to 90,000. 90,000 represents the average annual number of green cards issued to parents. S. 1348 slashes this number by more than half to 40,000. This amendment would make sure that sufficient numbers of green cards are available for parents to come to the United States. 
   b. Extending the parent visa to 180 days and making it renewable and valid for 3 years. These are already accepted timeframes for the validity of a visa. 180 days is the length of a tourist visa; H-1Bs are valid for 3 years. S. 1348 however limits parents to an annual stay of 30 days and does not specify long-term validity. This is too short an allotment, particularly for parents who come for health reasons or to help their children during and after childbirth. 
   c. Making penalties for parent visa overstays applicable only to them. S. 1348 states that if the overstay rate among visa holders exceeds 7% for 2 years, all nationals of countries with high overstay rates can be barred from this visa program or the program can be terminated. Sponsors of overstays are also barred from sponsoring other aliens on this visa. This amendment strikes language that unfairly collectively punishes those who have not violated the law, allowing law-abiding parents to continue to unite with their children.
