SEN. DODD, REP. LARSON SPEAK OUT AGAINST BUSH BUDGET PROPOSALS CUTTING FUNDING FOR CONN. CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER
  This morning, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and John Larson (D-CT-1) toured the Connecticut Children's Medical Center (CCMC) in Hartford and led a roundtable discussion on the impact of the federal budget on children's health, and in particular their concerns about the President's proposal to eliminate the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment Program. Sen. Dodd and Rep. Larson were joined by CCMC President and Chief Executive Officer Martin J. Gavin, staff of CCMC, including physicians and pediatric residents, and CCMC patients and families.  
   "No one in this country should go through the pain of watching their child suffer because they can't find a pediatrician," said Dodd. "By cutting the budget of CCMC and other children's hospitals across the country, President Bush is depriving our children of access to the best possible health care. This budget proposal is simply unacceptable, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is not approved." 
   "It is very disturbing to see this Administration make these devastating cuts to the budget," said Larson. 
   "The Connecticut Children's Medical Center has provided wonderful care for our daughter while at the same time taking care of our family's needs," said Melissa and David Mack, whose daughter is a patient at the CCMC.
