SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW
  Sen. Dodd made the following statement regarding the release of the Quadrennial Defense Review - a Congressionally mandated review of defense strategy, programs and policies conducted by the Department of Defense every four years.  
   "The Quadrennial Defense Review puts the military on record as recognizing that building one sub a year is insufficient and harms our military readiness. The Navy has continued to push these target dates back so I intend to press the Navy to increase submarine production immediately because we can't afford to wait. Building two submarines a year immediately protects both our national security and our submarine industrial base. We simply can't allow layoffs to go forward because we'd lose the cutting edge expertise and skills our nation needs in the 21st century."
