SEN. DODD HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION
  Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) voted in support of legislation which would make it easier for the federal government to assist in the investigations of hate crimes. The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment has wide spread national support, including the backing of 31 state attorneys general and nearly every one of the country's major national law enforcement organizations. The Senate defeated an attempted filibuster of the amendment by a 60 to 39 vote and then adopted the amendment by voice vote.  
   "Hate crimes stem from the lowest form of ignorance and threaten entire communities," said Dodd. "They are a particularly virulent form of violence, and that is why a broad consensus supports swift investigations and strong penalties for hate crimes. The special nature of hate crimes often makes investigations particularly difficult, especially for small, local police departments. This amendment will help ensure that more criminals are brought to justice by making it easier for the federal government to assist in hate crime investigations." 
   The legislation seeks to expand federal jurisdiction in cases where local or state officials are unable or unwilling to take action themselves. The amendment also increases the categories of hate crime that are subject to federal jurisdiction. Existing law only allows for federal involvement in crimes committed on account of race, color, religion, or natural origin. This amendment sensibly expands that list, adding crimes based on the victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.
   Senator Dodd has a strong record of supporting hate crime legislation. Dodd was an original cosponsor of the Mathew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 as well as an original cosponsor of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005.
