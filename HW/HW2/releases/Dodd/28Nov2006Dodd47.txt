SEN. DODD CAUTIONS AGAINST PREMATURE IMPLEMENTATION OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT
Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today urged the Administration to delay implementation of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 until a new Secretary of Defense has been appointed and given an opportunity to scrutinize the highly controversial law. In letters to President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld, Sen. Dodd delivered his criticism of the Military Commissions Act and recommended that the new Secretary of Defense undertake a review of the statute that includes direct consultation with members of Congress as well as the Judge Advocate General's Corps
 "I strongly believe that terrorists who seek to destroy America must be punished for any wrongs they commit against this country," said Dodd. "But in my view, in order to sustain America's moral authority and win a lasting victory against our enemies, such punishment must be meted out only in accordance with the rule of law. It is my belief that the provisions of the Military Commissions Act run counter to these very aims, and may actually undermine the judicial system established by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
 "To prosecute America's war on terrorism, it is my view that our new Secretary of Defense will have to thoroughly vet the provisions of the Military Commissions Act."
 On November 16, 2006, Sen. Dodd introduced his Effective Terrorists Prosecution Act, legislation which is intended to amend the Military Commissions Act in order to establish an effective process for bringing terrorists to justice, which is currently not the case under the existing law. The Effective Terrorists Prosecution Act would also seek to ensure that U.S. servicemen and women are afforded the maximum protection of a strong international legal framework guaranteed by respect for such provisions as the Geneva Conventions and other international standards, and to restore America's moral authority as the leader in the world in advancing the rule of law. 
 The full text of the letter to the President is below, followed by the letter to Secretary Rumsfeld:
 November 28, 2006
 Dear President Bush:
 I am writing to urge you to refrain from any action that would essentially implement Public Law 109-366, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, until the new Secretary of Defense has been confirmed and has had the opportunity to undertake his own review of this statute and related draft implementing regulations. I strongly believe that terrorists who seek to destroy America must be punished for any wrongs they commit against this country. But in my view, in order to sustain America's moral authority and win a lasting victory against our enemies, such punishment must be meted out only in accordance with the rule of law. 
 It is my belief that the provisions of the Military Commissions Act run counter to these very aims, and may actually undermine the judicial system established by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Moreover, having thoroughly examined the provisions of this controversial law and consulted various military legal authorities, I remain convinced that its hasty implementation might leave U.S. servicemen and women unprotected by the safeguards of the Geneva Conventions and vulnerable to abuse overseas.
 With the nomination of a new Secretary of Defense, I believe that you took a commendable step toward establishing a new direction in U.S. national security policy, and, what I hope is a renewed commitment to universally accepted principles of human rights. To prosecute America's war on terrorism, it is my view that our new Secretary of Defense will have to thoroughly vet the provisions of the Military Commissions Act. In so doing, he should consult Congress as well as members of the Judge Advocate General's Corps to establish an effective system for bringing terrorists to justice that ensures compliance with our international obligations while promoting the rule of law.
 I appreciate your consideration of this request.
 Sincerely,
 CHRISTOPHER J. DODD
 United States Senator

 Dear Secretary Rumsfeld:
 I am writing to urge your Department to refrain from any action that would essentially implement Public Law 109-366, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, until the new Secretary of Defense has been confirmed and has had the opportunity to undertake his own review of this statute and related draft implementing regulations. I strongly believe that terrorists who seek to destroy America must be punished for any wrongs they commit against this country. But in my view, in order to sustain America's moral authority and win a lasting victory against our enemies, such punishment must be meted out only in accordance with the rule of law. 
 It is my belief that the provisions of the Military Commissions Act run counter to these very aims, and may actually undermine the judicial system established by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Moreover, having thoroughly examined the provisions of this controversial law and consulted various military legal authorities, I remain convinced that its hasty implementation might leave U.S. servicemen and women unprotected by the safeguards of the Geneva Conventions and vulnerable to abuse overseas.
 I believe that your successor has a good opportunity to make significant changes to our national security policy and renew our commitment to universally accepted principles of human rights. Prosecuting America's war on terrorism, in my view will require a fresh set of eyes to thoroughly vet the provisions of the Military Commissions Act. In so doing, I hope that he will be advised to consult Congress as well as members of the Judge Advocate General's Corps to establish an effective system for bringing terrorists to justice that ensures compliance with our international obligations while promoting the rule of law.
 I appreciate your consideration of this request.
 Sincerely,
 CHRISTOPHER J. DODD
 United States Senator
