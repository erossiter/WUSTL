SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON MILITARY COMMISSIONS MANUAL
 "I believe that the manual is a deeply flawed document on first review. I am particularly concerned about the limits on the independence of military judges, the lack of safeguards against coerced evidence being introduced in trial, and the limitations on defense access to witnesses and evidence.  
   "I feel strongly that it is more imperative than ever that Congress consider legislation to amend the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to address its flaws and those contained in the manual implementing the MCA. 
   "I am currently working with Senators Leahy and Feingold and others to review the Effective Terrorists Prosecution legislation, which I introduced last December, and will introduce a new bill in the coming days to address flaws in the MCA and implementing manual that are impediments to the effective and credible prosecution of suspected terrorists."
