SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE $700,000 FOR HARTFORD YOUTH PROGRAM
  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded Co-Opportunity, Inc. of Hartford a grant of $700,000, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The grants are part of HUD's Youthbuild Block Grant program, which provides funding to train young people to build new homes for the needy. 
   "Funding for Youthbuild pays dividends in return, producing skilled laborers and quality homes for some of Connecticut's neediest families," said Dodd. "Youthbuild is a successful initiative, and I am grateful to see that these resources will help enhance and expand its reach to more children and families across the state." 
   "The Youthbuild program offers a wonderful opportunity for kids to learn important life skills," Lieberman said. "This funding is so important because it not only helps prepare America's youth for future success, it also provides housing for those who need it the most."
   Youthbuild teaches young people how to build new homes for people in need, and new lives for themselves. Each year, youths who participate in Youthbuild receive a combination of classroom academic and job skills development and on-site training in a construction trade. With support from HUD, Youthbuild participants are able to put their newly acquired skills to good use rehabilitating and building housing for low-income and homeless people in their communities. More than $353 million in grants have been awarded since the program's inception in 1993. This years funding will enable nearly 4,000 young people to construct or rehabilitate more than 1,000 affordable housing units nationwide.
