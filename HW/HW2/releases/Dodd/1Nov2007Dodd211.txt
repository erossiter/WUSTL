BANKING CHAIRMAN DODD URGES PRESIDENT TO SUPPORT BIPARTISAN SUDAN BILL
 In response to opposition from the Bush Administration, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, today urged the President to recognize the urgency of the situation in Darfur and rethink Administration resistance to the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act. The bipartisan bill, authored by Dodd, was overwhelmingly approved by the Banking Committee on October 17th by a vote of 21-0. 
   "Two years ago President Bush recognized that the crimes in Darfur constitute genocide. Tragically, every day since then the people of Darfur have been subjected to grinding, relentless violence and misery under which they have suffered for so long," said Dodd. "Unfortunately the Administration's opposition to the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act is not a surprise. The Administration testified before the Banking Committee that they were concerned that action might impact ongoing diplomatic efforts with Libya and the international community. However, those talks are stalled and I believe there is broad based support for the Divestment Act." 
   The Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act seeks to combat genocide in Darfur by focusing on the role of divestment. This legislation provides a legal framework by which state, local governments and other institutions can divest Sudan related investments from their portfolios. 
   "Delay and obstruction should not - and must not - be an option," Dodd said. "The President and his Administration need to rethink their opposition to this bipartisan bill. I will be requesting that the Majority Leader expedite consideration of this measure and I hope Senator McConnell will cooperate to allow the Senate to consider this important bill. States and investors should be able to safely divest from companies whose investments are propping up the repugnant regime in Sudan."
