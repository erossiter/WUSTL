SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ STUDY GROUP'S REPORT
"The Iraq study group conclusions and recommendations are very realistic and sobering at the same time. What is very clear is that the group has come to the same conclusion that many of us in Congress have felt for some time - namely that we are not winning in Iraq and we need a course correction if we are to have any chance of success. Our troops are absolutely doing their part. They are bravely and valiantly sacrificing everything they've got on behalf of our nation, and they deserve concrete bipartisan solutions that will help them fulfill their mission. 
 "I couldn't agree more with the group's conclusion that there is no magic formula for fixing the problems in Iraq. I also totally concur that we must set benchmarks for Iraq to meet as a condition of our continued assistance. Iraq must make progress on reconciliation, security and improvement in the daily lives of the Iraqi people. Iraq's neighbors and regional leaders should be included in finding a solution to Iraq's problems. The United States does indeed have long term interests in the region and a broken Iraq does not advance those interests; that is why the work of the group must be given very serious consideration by President Bush."
