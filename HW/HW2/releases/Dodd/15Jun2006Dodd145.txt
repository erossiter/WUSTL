SEN. DODD CO-SPONSORS BILL PROTECTING ARMED SERVICE MEMBERS FROM FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL SERVICES PRACTICES
  Recognizing that the members of our country's Armed Services should not be preyed upon by unscrupulous and dishonest financial service providers, Sen. Chris Dodd yesterday supported a bill which would enact stricter standards by which some insurers and other financial service companies market their life insurance and securities products to servicemen and -women and require full disclosure by the representatives about their product. 
   "Our troops are giving their all for our country, and it's unconscionable that some of our servicemen and -women are being fleeced by deceitful and fraudulent financial services providers," Dodd explained. "Certainly the members of our country's Armed Services should not be led to believe the Federal Government is behind the financial products they're being sold when it's not."
   The legislation would bar financial service providers from selling certain products on federal military installations without first providing a number of important financial disclosures. The bill also would provide that all state insurance and securities laws and regulations be deemed to apply to financial activities conducted on military bases or other federal facilities. In addition, the bill would require the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a registry of insurance agents and financial advisers that have been banned from doing business on federal military installations. 
   The Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, of which Senator Dodd is a member, unanimously passed the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act. The bill is now slated for consideration by the full Senate.
