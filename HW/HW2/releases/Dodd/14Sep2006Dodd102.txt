SEN. DODD URGES APPROPRIATIONS PANEL TO UPHOLD PROVISION VITAL TO ARMY'S READINESS
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) today wrote to the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee chairman and ranking member urging them to retain the Dodd-Inouye-Reed Amendment in the 2007 Defense Appropriations bill, as conferences begin between the Senate and the House of Representatives to align the two versions of the bill. 
   The Dodd-Inouye-Reed Amendment addresses potential shortfalls in critical combat gear that challenge U.S. military readiness identified by military commanders. Sen. Dodd's amendment, which was included as part of the 2007 Defense Appropriations bill and approved by the Senate 98-0 last week, would make available $6.7 billion to the military to close the funding gap in the President's proposed defense budget originally disclosed by Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker. Prior to passage of the Dodd Amendment, the Senate bill only partially addressed the needed funding level sought by General Schoomaker.
   "Our military personnel's bravery and valor can never be exhausted. But our military hardware is stretched thin and our fleets of aircraft, tanks, and trucks are wearing out," Dodd said. "The Bush Administration needs to provide more than just hollow rhetoric to 'stay the course.' If we are truly serious about making Americans safe from terrorism, then our armed forces must have the resources they need to be successful."
   "As the United States confronts growing threats to peace and security throughout the globe - from the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East - it is essential that we ensure that our nation's military is fully prepared to perform its combat missions. We owe our nation, and our men and women in uniform, no less."
