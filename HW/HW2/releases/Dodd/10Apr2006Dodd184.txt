SEN. DODD OUTLINES DETAILS OF BILL TO PROMOTE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH
  Sen. Chris Dodd today announced the planned introduction of legislation that promotes children's mental health during a roundtable discussion at Klingberg Family Centers with Klingberg President Rosemarie Burton, children, parents, mental health professionals and advocates.  
   "Regrettably, children's mental health continues to carry an unfortunate stigma - a stigma that all too often keeps children from getting the help they need," Dodd said. "We have a societal obligation to break through this stigma, to better understand this pressing health issue and to help our young people get the care they need so they can succeed and attain their dreams. This legislation is a good first step toward addressing our children's mental health."
   According to the Surgeon General, one in ten children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of impairment. Also, only one quarter of the children with mental health needs have those needs met, according to a 2001 RAND Corporation study. 
   Dodd's legislation authorizes $210 million for new grants and research initiatives to: 
   * Enhance access to children's mental health services; 
  Improve the quality of children's mental health services; 
   * Improve the regional and local coordination of children's mental health services; 
   * Improve collaboration between federal agencies with respect to promoting children's mental health policy; and 
   * Increase federal research into children's mental health. 
   Senator Dodd will introduce this legislation when the Senate reconvenes later this month.
