SEN. DODD CONTINUES TO OPPOSE IMMUNITY FOR TELECOMM COMPANIES WHO PARTICIPATED IN SECRET WIRETAPPING
 Today, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) continued to stand up for the rule of law and the Constitution by urging his Senate colleagues to reject legislation which would grant immunity to telecommunications companies who cooperated with the Bush administration's secret wiretapping program. Senator Dodd recently joined several of his colleagues in sending a letter to Majority Leader Reid requesting that he bring to the floor FISA reform legislation that does not include retroactive immunity. Since the decision has been made to bring up S2248, a bill reported by the Senate Intelligence Committee with retroactive immunity, Senator Dodd will oppose considering the bill and urge his colleagues to vote with him against cloture. If those efforts fail, Senator Dodd will offer an amendment to strip retroactive immunity from the legislation.  
    "Providing retroactive immunity to companies that may have violated the law will set a dangerous precedent," said Dodd. "Companies who violated the trust of thousands of their customers will be immune to prosecution and the details of their actions will stay hidden. The President, and his Administration, has consistently used scare tactics in an attempt to force Congress to pass FISA legislation that provides retroactive immunity. I urge my colleagues to stand up to this administration and this President and say enough is enough." 
   Since the Bush administration's secret wiretapping program came to light in 2005, numerous telecommunications companies have been implicated in the possible illegal surveillance of their customers. Dodd has consistently stated that these companies must be held accountable for invading the privacy of their customers.
