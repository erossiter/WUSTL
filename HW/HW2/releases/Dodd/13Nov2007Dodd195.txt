SEN. DODD CALLS ON GENERAL MUSHARRAF TO RELEASE BENAZIR BHUTTO FROM HOUSE ARREST, RESTORE PAKISTAN'S CONSTITUTION
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following statement on the developing situation in Pakistan: 
   "I urge General Musharraf to release Benazir Bhutto from house arrest and restore Pakistan's Constitution. Since emergency rule was declared ten days ago, thousands of political activists have been arrested, a media blackout has ensued, and Benazir Bhutto has been unlawfully detained in her home. Unfortunately, the actions taken over the past week by the Musharraf government have stalled Pakistan's political progress. It is essential that General Musharraf release Benazir Bhutto from house arrest and accept the demands of the Pakistani people. I also urge General Musharraf to honor his longtime commitment to help Pakistan transition to democracy by taking off his military uniform and holding early and transparent elections."
