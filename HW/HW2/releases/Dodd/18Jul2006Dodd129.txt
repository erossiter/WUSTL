SEN. DODD URGES FULL FUNDING FOR ELECTION REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Chris Dodd has urged a key subcommittee within the Senate Appropriations Committee to provide full funding to enable states to implement the reforms mandated in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), so that all eligible voters across the nation have an equal opportunity to vote and have that vote counted. Senator Dodd is the original co-author of HAVA, legislation enacted in 2002.  
   Dodd wrote to Senators Christopher Bond and Patty Murray Monday, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate's Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies, urging them to close the $724 million gap in funding for HAVA within the committee's jurisdiction, resulting from the lack of funding for the program during the past two fiscal years. 
   The total election reform shortfall for FY 07, including for programs outside the subcommittee's jurisdiction, is $798 million. Dodd's effort is supported by local election officials, civil and voting rights groups, disability and language minority organizations such as the National Association of Election Officials, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   If funding is not restored through the committee process, Dodd will offer an amendment to adequately fund election reform efforts.
