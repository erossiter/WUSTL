SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S BUDGET
  "The budget should reflect a set of priorities that can best advance opportunity, prosperity, and security for all Americans, now and into the future. This budget regrettably comes up far short. 
   "With the enormous budgetary damage already wreaked by this Administration, the need to restore fiscal discipline is more important than ever. Unfortunately, the President's budget fails the test of responsibility, both to current and future generations. The President has proposed spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for high income individuals, while raising taxes on middle-income families through the alternative minimum tax and reducing our ability to meet important priorities like education, health care, and restoring the strength of our military that has been weakened by this Administration's war in Iraq. With the retirement of the baby boomers just around the corner, the President continues to put forth an agenda that makes our predicament worse by sending us deeper into debt.
   "This budget shows us more of the fuzzy math we have come to expect from this Administration. Its claims of a declining deficit lack credibility, since it once again fails to specify a full and accurate accounting of the Administration's proposals over the full budget window. The American people deserve better.
   "The Bush administration has laid out its view for what our nation's priorities should be in the coming fiscal year, but it will ultimately be up to the Congress, through its power of the purse, to decide what those priorities should be and to ensure that the meet the needs and demands of the American people. I look forward to working to close the critical funding gaps contained in the President's budget. "
