SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT
  "Today we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, which was signed into law on October 18, 1972. This landmark law to reduce water pollution represented a crucial step toward reversing years of environmental neglect and abuse. Over its 35 years, the Clean Water Act has been responsible for remarkable advances in curbing further pollution of our waterways and restoring damaged waterways to health. Of course, there is more to be done to ensure that all Americans have access to safe and healthy water supplies and to protect fragile ecosystems. I am proud to support the Clean Water Restoration Act, which strengthens the Clean Water Act after a Supreme Court decision undermined critical environmental protections of the law. I believe we must continue in the spirit of the Clean Water Act to limit pollution, including greenhouse gas pollution, for there is no greater gift we can give to our children than a healthy planet."
