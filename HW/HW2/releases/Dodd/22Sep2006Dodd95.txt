SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN CONGRATULATE THREE BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS
  Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) today announced that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded the prestigious 2006 Blue Ribbon Schools Award to three Connecticut schools. The Blue Ribbon award is vigorously sought by schools across the nation. Winners must demonstrate a commitment to academic excellence; a strong sense of leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission; a high quality of teaching and challenging curriculum; and a strong show of family and community involvement in the school.  
   "The term 'extra credit' doesn't come close to describing what each of these schools, parents, teachers and students have achieved," said Dodd. "They have distinguished themselves against the best of the best in the educational field all across the nation, and our entire state should be proud of their outstanding achievements." 
   "The faculty, parents, and especially the students ought to be extremely proud of this accomplishment," Lieberman said. "Hundreds of outstanding elementary and secondary schools are nominated for this honor, yet only a handful are chosen. We in Connecticut have known for some time that our schools are second to none. Now we have three blue ribbons to prove it." 
   The three schools which received the Blue Ribbon Award are: 
  * Hartford Magnet Middle School, Hartford
  * St. Joseph's School, Rockville
  * Connecticut International Baccalaureate Academy, East Hartford
   After a rigorous self-evaluation period, schools are screened and nominated by their state education department or other sponsoring agency. A National Review Panel made up of leading educators determines the most qualified schools and forwards their recommendations to the U.S. Secretary of Education. 
   Established in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Award identifies and recognizes outstanding public and private schools across the country, establishes models for school effectiveness, and facilitates sharing of best practices among schools.
