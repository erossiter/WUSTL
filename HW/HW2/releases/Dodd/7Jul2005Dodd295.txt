SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING LONDON BOMBINGS
  "Our thoughts and prayers are with the British people today. We stand united with them and the world in our fight against terrorism. These coordinated and savage attacks will not shake our resolve or determination to protect our freedom and way of life. It's important that our world leaders today stand strong as global talks at the G-8 Summit continue. The Congress stands behind them and will continue to fight terrorism here at home and around the globe."
