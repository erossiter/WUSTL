SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT REFUSING TO HEAR TELECOMMUTER TAX CASE
  Sen. Dodd released the following statement following the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the telecommuter tax case known as Huckaby v. New York State Division of Tax Appeals. Sen.  
 Dodd is the author of the Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act - legislation that would prevent states like New York from collecting taxes from employees for work performed outside that state. 
   "It is disappointing that the Supreme Court will not hear this very important case. This decision underscores the need to take action on the legislation that I have introduced along with Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Shays. Millions of Americans work from home or satellite offices at least part of the time, including many Connecticut residents. Telecommuting is good for them and their families. It reduces traffic congestion, reduces pollution, and helps businesses strengthen their bottom line. The current rules punish telecommuters rather than reward them and that needs to change."
