SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN GRANTS TO PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE
  Substance abuse initiatives in Waterbury, New Britain, Glastonbury, East Hartford, and New Haven will receive $1,107,233 in federal grants aimed at preventing and combating youth drug and alcohol abuse, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. 
   "Youth in Connecticut should have a bright future; we can't allow drug and alcohol abuse to cast a shadow over their lives," said Dodd. "This assistance can help lead Connecticut kids to a better, healthier, and more productive life, and improve our communities and our state."
   "Drugs and alcohol corrupt too many lives of Connecticut's next generation," Lieberman said. "It is our local communities which are best equipped to instill in our children the values of a life without substance abuse, and these grants will help our grassroots anti-drug agencies do that."
   The first grant, an Effective Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment Program grant for $182,090, was awarded to the Morris Foundation Inc., in Waterbury to help expand their adolescent care in Waterbury and Ansonia. Both communities have recently suffered a number of adolescent drug-related deaths. The resources will be used to provide counseling to about 50 youth struggling with substance abuse problems.
   Ten other grants were provided by the Department of Justice for the Drug-Free Communities Support Program to assist local organizations in reducing substance abuse by engaging youth in learning projects with their parents and peers. The funds provide substance abuse services in schools such as drug education programs, drug screening, and family counseling. The funds may also be used to help change youth attitudes about drug use through media campaigns.
   The following initiatives will receive Drug Free Communities Support Program grants:
   * Human Resources Agency of New Britain - $81,701
   * Glastonbury Alcohol and Drug Council - $75,000
   * East of the River Action for Substance Abuse Elimination Inc. - East Hartford - $100,000
   * Substance Abuse Action Council of Central Connecticut - New Haven - $75,000
   * Middlesex County Substance Abuse Action Council - $97,455
   * The Stonington Substance Abuse Prevention Task Force - $99,898
   * Newtown Youth Services, Inc. - $100,000
   * Capital Area Substance Abuse Council - Hartford - $100,000
   * Regional Youth/Adult Substance Abuse Project - Greater Bridgeport Area - $100,000
   The Drug-Free Communities Support Program provides federal grants to community coalitions that mobilize the community to prevent youth alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug, and inhalant abuse. The grants support coalitions of youths; parents; media; law enforcement; school officials; faith-based organizations; fraternal organizations; state, local, and tribal government agencies; healthcare professionals; and other community representatives working to curb substance abuse. The initiative enables coalitions to strengthen their coordination and prevention efforts, encourage citizen participation in substance abuse reduction efforts, and disseminate information about effective programs.
   Senator Dodd recently authored and Senator Lieberman cosponsored the Sober Truth on Preventing (STOP) Underage Drinking Act designed to prevent the spread of underage drinking. The measure would coordinate efforts at the federal level, authorize a national adult-oriented media campaign against underage drinking, provide grants to prevention programs, and increase research and data collection on underage drinking.
