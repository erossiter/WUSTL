SEN. DODD: LET US DEDICATE OURSELVES TO CONTINUING MARTIN LUTHER KING'S UNFINISHED WORK
  Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) today made the following statement on the 40th Anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. 
   "On this day, the fortieth anniversary of the tragic death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we recall how Dr. King captured America's attention and helped guide a nation on the precipice of change. His mission still holds as much importance today as it did forty years ago in its ability to inspire the hopes and dreams of all Americans. While we take today to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King and mourn a life taken far too early, let us dedicate ourselves to continuing Dr. King's unfinished work by embracing his commitment to civil rights and equal opportunity for all Americans."
   Dodd is the author of The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, a bill that would give the Department of Justice and the FBI the ability to reopen Civil Rights-era criminal cases which have gone cold. The bill was approved by the House of Representatives last year by a vote of 422 to 2 and is currently pending before the Senate.
