SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $150,000 FOR CONNECTICUT FIREFIGHTERS
  Three Connecticut fire departments will receive a total of $148,961 in federal grants to enhance operations and firefighter safety, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today. The grants are made available through the FIRE Act of 2000 and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 
   "We can and should do much more to protect families from the devastating effects of fire, and firefighters deserve to have the resources to provide that security," said Dodd. "After working hand-in-hand with firefighters for years to make this vision a reality, I'm pleased that these funds will be the first step in making sure these brave men and women have the training they need to keep our communities safe."
   "We must not condemn to frustration those whose job it is to protect us by failing to provide them with the necessary resources to meet the threats they face," Lieberman said. "We depend on Connecticut firefighters for our safety. Surely they should be able to depend upon us for support."
   The following localities will receive grant awards:
   Beacon Hose Company No. 1 $77,950 
  South Manchester Fire Department $36,000 
  Warren Vol. Fire Company $35,011
  Total $148,961
   The award was made possible by the FIRE Act of 2000, a law authored by Dodd and co-sponsored by Lieberman that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment, hire new personnel, and initiate education and training programs. Since the FIRE Act was enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now a part of DHS, has distributed 216 grants for a total of more than $19.9 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
