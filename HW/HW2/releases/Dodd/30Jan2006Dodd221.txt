SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SELECTION OF SITE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM
  "It goes without saying that this museum is long overdue. Our nation for too long has ignored the importance of the history, culture and contributions of African-Americans. Thankfully, this selection signals that our nation is one step closer to making this museum a reality."
