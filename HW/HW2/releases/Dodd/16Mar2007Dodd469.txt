SEN. DODD ANNOUNCES HEARINGS ON SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS
  Addressing the Hispanic Leadership Institute Conference today, Sen. Chris Dodd announced that he is taking action to correct the growing crisis of subprime mortgage lending which could cost millions of American families their homes and financial security. 
   In his speech, Dodd said that homeownership is a critical source of wealth for families, and that predatory and irresponsible lending practices by some subprime lenders threaten to cause preventable home foreclosures for millions of Americans.
   The crisis, said Dodd, strikes at the very heart of the American Dream.
   "In our America, it's critical for families to be able to buy a home. It's also critical in our America for families to keep their homes. Predatory lending practices put these goals at risk. As Chairman, I will use all the powers and tools at my disposal to keep families victimized by predatory loans in their homes and ensure that America's dream of homeownership remains alive," said Dodd.
   Dodd announced hearings to deal with the mortgage crisis will take place March 22nd. He vowed to use the forum not only to ask tough questions, but to demand answers from federal officials and the mortgage lending industry.
