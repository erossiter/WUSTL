   "Children and their developing minds are our most important resource for the future, and it is critical that we provide all children with a solid educational foundation to help them bloom and grow," said Dodd. "By reaching out at an early age and providing more opportunities to learn, we help ensure that each and every child will attain a better and brighter future."
