SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF BRAC DECISION SAVING NEW LONDON SUB BASE
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on one-year anniversary of BRAC decision saving New London Sub Base: 
  "The defeat of the Administration's proposal to shut down the New London Sub Base was not only significant for Connecticut, it was critically important to our national security.   
   "As the Commission came to understand, the Sub Base is part of an intricately developed network of military, industrial, and research facilities, including General Dynamics-Electric Boat, which, once dismantled, could never be fully re-constituted.  
   "Fortunately, the Pentagon's decision was so flawed that it compelled a number of former high-level Navy officials, from retired four-star Admirals to a former President of the United States, to vociferously object to the proposed closure. I believe that one of the most valuable lessons learned was that despite being the 'silent service', there are few challenges that are truly insurmountable to the submariner community. Nobody was more convincing in making the case to save the base than these retired military leaders.  
   "It is essential that the civilian leaders at the Pentagon gain a much greater understanding of the needs of our military's commanders throughout the world, who are requesting a greater submarine force, even while the Administration insists on cutting the fleet drastically low. Maritime superiority must remain a cornerstone of U.S. defense policy to preserve peace and security within our nation and throughout the world. I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress, as well as senior Navy officials, to promote advancements in submarine technology, greater training resources for our submarines and new construction at the world's premier submarine facility, the Naval Submarine Base New London."
