SEN. DODD, REP. DELAURO ANNOUNCE NATIONAL GUARD WILL RECEIVE NEW EQUIPMENT
  Members of the Connecticut National Guard awaiting deployment to Afghanistan will leave with new equipment they say they need, Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (CT-3) announced today. Ten days ago, the lawmakers called on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to act on requests made by some members of the Connecticut National Guard to receive appropriate equipment for combat missions they will undertake in Afghanistan.

   "I'm pleased that these soldiers will receive the equipment best suited for their critical mission," said Dodd. "The United States government has no higher priority than the safety and well-being of our troops serving in harm's way and that must begin with outfitting them with first-rate equipment. I'd especially like to thank General Martin, Connecticut's Adjutant General, for his efforts to ensure that these soldiers get the equipment they need." 
   "These courageous men and women are preparing to leave their family, their friends, and their homes to serve their country in Afghanistan," said DeLauro. "No soldier should ever have to make this sacrifice without the best equipment possible. I am delighted that the Department of Defense and General Martin are working to ensure these soldiers have the equipment they deserve."
   The Connecticut Guardsmen initiated a request for more modern equipment while stationed at Fort Bragg, but that request was purportedly denied. The First Infantry Division of the Army's 102nd Battalion was mobilized and reported to Fort Bragg for training in February. They are expected to be deployed to Afghanistan this spring.
