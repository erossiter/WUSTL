SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ALITO TO SUPREME COURT
  Statement of Sen. Chris Dodd on the Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court 
   "I'm disappointed that it appears President Bush chose to nominate a top choice of the extreme Right rather than a mainstream jurist more in line with the views of the American people. There are important questions that I hope Judge Alito will answer during the confirmation process, including his thoughts on a woman's right to choose and a commitment to equal opportunity for all, among others. As the author of the Family and Medical Leave Act, I'm troubled that Judge Alito wrote the lead opinion in a case that would have weakened this law that has spared millions of Americans the agonizing choice between the job they need and the family they love. The Supreme Court later upheld the Family and Medical Leave Act, essentially reversing Alito's opinion. I'm also dismayed that this appointment fails to more accurately reflect the great diversity of the American people on the Court. 
   I view the vote on a Supreme Court nominee as one of the most important votes I cast as a senator. I will closely examine this nominee to determine if he is qualified to serve on the highest court in the land. This includes an examination of his academic record, professional accomplishments, demeanor and temperament, and his ability to be an impartial, thoughtful jurist. This is a very important nomination that will likely shift the direction of the Supreme Court for years to come and I intend to follow the process closely."
