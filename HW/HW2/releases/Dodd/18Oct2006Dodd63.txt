SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY ON WEAPONS IN SPACE
  "All of us want to ensure that we have a strong military and that our national interests are protected. But I'm deeply concerned that once again the Bush Administration is taking a 'my way or the highway' approach in the area of space that serves only to alienate our allies, isolate us internationally, and in the end put us at greater risk. Each and every time the Bush Administration has approached issues related to our national security and foreign policy in a unilateral fashion, America's interests have been ill served. No where is a multilateral approach more critical than in questions of how the world intends to utilize space for the good of all mankind. As we deal with the threats to peace and security from the proliferation of landbased weapons, surely we need to think long and hard before creating potential space based proliferation threats. Once again the Bush Administration's unilateralism could put our nation at risk."
