SEN. DODD INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROMOTE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH
  Sen. Chris Dodd today introduced legislation which promotes children's mental health and seeks to increase both the quality of and access to services for those affected. Sen. Dodd recently met with children, parents, mental health professionals and advocates at the Klingberg Family Centers in New Britain in April to discuss children's mental health.  
   "Regrettably, children's mental health continues to carry an unfortunate stigma - a stigma that all too often keeps children from getting the help they need," Dodd said. "We have a societal obligation to break through this stigma, to better understand this pressing health issue and to help our young people get the care they need so they can succeed and attain their dreams. This legislation is a good first step toward addressing our children's mental health."
   According to the Surgeon General, one in ten children and adolescents suffer from mental illness sever enough to cause some level of impairment. Also, only one quarter of the children with mental health needs have those needs met, according to a 2001 RAND Corporation study. 
   Dodd's legislation authorizes $210 million for new grants and research initiatives to:
   * Enhance access to children's mental health services; 
  * Improves the quality of mental health services; 
  * Improve the regional and local coordination of children's mental health services; 
  * Improve collaboration between federal agencies with respect to promoting children's mental health policy; and 
  * Increase federal research into children's mental health. 
   The American Association of Adolescent and Child Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Association for Children's Behavioral Health, the National Association of State Mental Health Plan Directors and School Social Work Association of America have all pledged their support for this legislation.
