SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL GRANTS FOR FIVE CONNECTICUT TOWNS
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that more than $675,000 in federal grants was awarded to Connecticut fire departments. The grants were made possible through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   "Our communities depend on firefighters to protect them from danger and educate them on matters of public safety," said Dodd. "These brave men and women work hard to keep their fellow citizens safe, and we should honor their work by providing the necessary funding, equipment, and training so that they may continue to serve their communities.
   "Firefighters all across Connecticut devote their time and energy to courageously serving their communities," Lieberman said. "These grants will help provide them with the necessary training and equipment to respond to disasters, both natural and man-made, and to continue to protect the citizens of our state." 
   The following fire departments were awarded federal grants:
   * Scotland - $27,930
   * North Branford - $296,457
   * Middlefield - $55,917
   * Brookfield - $141,645
   * Plainville - $154,827
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, which gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to alleviate critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER and FIRE Acts were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 358 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities. Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been tireless advocates for increasing federal funding for first responders.
