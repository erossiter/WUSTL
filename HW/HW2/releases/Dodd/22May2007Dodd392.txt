SEN. DODD ON CONNECTICUT RYAN WHITE CARE ACT FUNDING
  Sen. Dodd today blasted the Bush Administration for cutting HIV/AIDS funding for Hartford and New Haven under the Ryan White CARE Act Part A supplemental program. The City of Hartford's grant award was cut from $2,024,791 to $913,750 and the City of New Haven's grant award was cut from $2,710,386 to $1,501,862. Sen. Dodd issued the following statement in response: 
   "Today, the Bush Administration ignored the unified call by the Connecticut congressional delegation to give Connecticut's cities priority for this critical funding. Connecticut has already suffered from more than $1.6 million in HIV/AIDS funding cuts. The administration of the reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act has been mishandled at many levels of government. As a result, individuals living with HIV/AIDS in Connecticut are losing access to critically needed medical and dental care, housing, transportation, and rehabilitation services. I am deeply disappointed and concerned by this announcement and will continue to push for additional funding so that individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS can maintain access to services needed to maintain their health and well being."
