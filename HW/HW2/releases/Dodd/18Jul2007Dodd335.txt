SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE PASSAGE OF PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2007
  Statement of Senator Dodd on House Passage of the Public Safety  
   "I applaud the House's passage of the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation enables firefighters, police, and other public safety officers to collectively bargain for fair wages and benefits - a basic right they've been denied in some 20 states. Those who stand on the front lines against terrorism, fire, natural disasters, and crime deserve strong unions, safe working conditions, and a decent wage. This bill helps them get just that. I look forward to supporting it in the Senate, and I'll do everything I can to help it become law."
