SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR WILTON FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced today that the Wilton Fire Department will receive $105,877 in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for operations and safety programs. 
   "While Wilton's firefighters have an abundance of honor and bravery, they do not have nearly enough funding," said Dodd. "I am pleased that, with this grant, the community will be able to continue to rely on their responsible, well-trained firefighters to protect them from danger." 
   Fire fighters dedicate themselves everyday to improving the safety of their communities, and this grant will provide the firefighters in Wilton with the help they need to carry out their heroic duties," said Lieberman.
   These awards were made possible as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program's Fire Prevention & Safety Grant initiative, administered by the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been longtime advocates for fire safety. In 2000, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the FIRE Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and initiate education and training programs. In 2003, Dodd authored and Lieberman cosponsored the SAFER Act, a law that gives local fire departments the ability to reduce critical shortfalls in professional and volunteer personnel. Since the SAFER Act and FIRE Act were enacted, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, has distributed 350 grants for a total of more than $35 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities.
