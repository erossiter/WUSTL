SENS. DODD, LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $780,000 TO PROTECT CONNECTICUT PORTS
  Three Connecticut ports will receive $781,000 in port security grants through the Department of Homeland Security Port Security Grant Program, Sens.  
 Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman announced Friday. These funds will be used to enhance the security of Connecticut ports and surrounding communities in preparation for potential emergencies such as terrorist attacks. 
   Connecticut is host to many sensitive facilities on its shoreline including: critical highway and rail bridges, ferry terminals, the home heating tank farms including the home heating oil reserve in New Haven and the nuclear submarine base at Groton. 
   The grants will be used to improve surveillance, lighting, fencing, and other physical enhancements of the ports.
   "This weekend we're reminded that apart from ensuring that the terrible scars of 9/11 heal - we must ensure that our nation isn't injured again," said Dodd. "This assistance can do exactly that by shoring up our state's homeland security."
   "As we continue to fight the domestic war against terrorism, it is critically important that we provide local port authorities with the funding they need to ensure the security of our communities," Lieberman said. "This funding will help us achieve that goal and we are thankful for the support."
   The following groups will receive grants:
   * Bridgeport Police Marine Unit: $ 600,000
  * New London Police Department: $150,000
  * R & H Terminal, LLC, New Haven: $31,000
  * Total: $781,000
   In addition, The Bridgeport and Port Jefferson Steamboat Company has been awarded a grant in the amount of $132,160 for physical security enhancements at the Port Jefferson, N.Y., Terminal. 
   The awards were made possible by the Port Security Grant Program and distributed through the Office for Domestic Preparedness at the Department of Homeland Security.
