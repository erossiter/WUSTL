SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT DECISION ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN
  "Throughout my career I have believed that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. I am deeply troubled by today's Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003, a decision which will needlessly endanger women's health throughout the country. I voted against this legislation in 2003 because it did not include an exception to allow this type of medical procedure when a mother's health is at risk. In overturning long-standing Supreme Court precedent, today's decision will create uncertainty throughout the country for women and doctors on what medical procedures are legal, and will undermine their ability to decide what is most appropriate for a patient's health, free from politics. While I am disappointed by today's decision by the Supreme Court, it has renewed my pledge to continue to support a woman's right to reproductive choice."
