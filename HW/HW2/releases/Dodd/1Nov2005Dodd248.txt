SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON AVIAN FLU
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Avian Flu
   "It is not an understatement to say that we could possibly be looking at a 'Hurricane Katrina' type of health care threat.  
 That is why, unlike federal preparations and responses to deal with that disaster, we can't afford to fail. We must be fully and adequately prepared to deal with this very real threat. Experts agree that the possibility of pandemic flu, whether avian flu or another strain, is one of the most significant threats to our nation's public health. A flu outbreak could put millions of American lives at risk, cripple the economy, and cause worldwide panic. 
   "I commend the President for finally breaking his long silence on this critically important issue; it is long overdue. For more than a year now, we've pressed the Administration to deal with this threat and our pleadings have been ignored. For instance, the Administration has - up to now - only stockpiled enough anti-viral medication to treat 2 percent of our nation's population. That is unacceptable. We can and must do better. The President has finally outlined some worthy initiatives that I believe can help deal with this threat. Democrats in the Senate have already made enormous progress on this issue, spurring approval of $8 billion in appropriations for flu pandemic preparedness. I stand ready to do whatever is necessary at the congressional level to make sure our nation is prepared."
