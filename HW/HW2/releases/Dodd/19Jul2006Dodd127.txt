SEN. DODD MEASURE PROTECTING ARMED SERVICE MEMBERS FROM FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL SERVICE PRACTICES PASSES SENATE
  A bill which will help protect members of our country's Armed Services who may be preyed upon by unscrupulous and dishonest financial service providers passed the Senate yesterday. The measure, co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), will enact stricter standards by which some insurers and other financial service companies can market their life insurance and securities products to servicemen and -women,  
   "Our troops are giving their all for our country, and it's unconscionable that some of our servicemen and -women are being fleeced by deceitful and fraudulent financial services providers," Dodd explained. "Certainly the members of our country's Armed Services should not be led to believe the Federal Government is behind the financial products they're being sold when it's not."
   The legislation will bar financial service providers from selling certain products on federal military installations without first providing a number of important financial disclosures. The bill also will provide that all state insurance and securities laws and regulations be deemed to apply to financial activities conducted on military bases or other federal facilities. In addition, the bill will require the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a registry of insurance agents and financial advisers that have been banned from doing business on federal military installations. 
   The Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, of which Senator Dodd is a member, unanimously passed the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act last month.
