SEN. DODD ISSUES STATEMENT ON GAO RECOMMENDATION TO REOPEN CSAR HELICOPTER CONTRACT BID
  "The GAO made the correct decision today. American military personnel depend on our pararescue squads to save their lives when they are in harm's way. These units need and deserve the best possible equipment.
   "The helicopter designed and manufactured by Sikorsky's Connecticut workforce fits that bill. I applaud the company's decision to aggressively challenge the Air Force's flawed decision, and believe that Sikorsky's aircraft should win this contract on its merits, in an open and fair competition."
