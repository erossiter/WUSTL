SEN. DODD CALLS ON CONGRESS TO EXTEND TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE
  In response to today's Rand Corporation report, Sen.  
 Chris Dodd, the author of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, issued the following statement calling on Congress to extend the legislation: 
   "Today's Rand Corporation report once again illustrates the need for Congress to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. Failure to do so would create additional, unnecessary risks to our economy. Sadly, we know that despite our efforts to stop future terrorist attacks, terrorism can strike anytime, anywhere and simply the threat of terrorism can have lasting effects on our economy. TRIA is presently working to protect jobs and our economy and it's imperative that Congress extend this law as quickly as possible."
