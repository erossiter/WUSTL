SEN. DODD SPEAKS TO CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS INSTITUTE
  While addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute yesterday, Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) challenged members to change conditions in the nation today that continue to lead to a disparity among children born in different socio-economic groups.  
   "My daughters will judge their father, just as your children and grandchildren will judge you. What did you do at the outset of the 21st century when you saw that the nation was moving in the wrong direction?" Dodd asked. "There are too many children in foster care and 200,000 children last June [who] graduated from high school, were accepted into college, and could not go because they lacked the financial resources. In America, you ought never be denied a higher education because of a lack of financial resources."
   Sen. Dodd encouraged members to get involved in their communities and with children in order to move the country forward and provide more equal footing for all Americans. 
   "Elect good people on state and local levels; people who care about children, who care about education," urged Dodd. "Become engaged in your community. This isn't all about public policy. It's a lot more about caring about our children."
   Senator Dodd spoke at the Institute's opening luncheon. Dodd is the Chairman and founder of the Senate's Children's Caucus, and spent two years as a Peace Corps volunteer, where he became fluent in Spanish. He is the author of the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act, which ensures that no parent has to choose between the job that they need and the children that they love.
