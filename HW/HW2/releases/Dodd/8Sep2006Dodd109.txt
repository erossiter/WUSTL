SEN. DODD COMMENTS ON INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S IRAQI WAR INTELLIGENCE REPORT
  Statement of Sen. Dodd on Intelligence Committee's Iraqi War Intelligence Report:
   "This report is an extremely useful document because it makes clear once and for all that the justification given by the Bush administration for going to war with Iraq was not only terribly flawed, but was purposefully concocted to deceive the American people. That is shameful. Members of the Intelligence Committee have done a great service to the American people by bringing out the truth."
