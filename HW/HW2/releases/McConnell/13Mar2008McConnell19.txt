SEN. MCCONNELL: WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR RESPONSIBLE SPENDING LEVELS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement on Thursday after voting for the DeMint-McCain Amendment:  
   "Although we've taken steps in the past to reform the spending process, more can and should be done to restore the public's trust and bring greater transparency to the way the federal government spends taxpayers' money. 
   "The DeMint-McCain amendment would have provided an important pause to allow us all-those who oppose earmarks and those who favor them-to take a step back, build a better oversight system, and allow these reforms to be implemented. We must now work toward the implementation of these additional reforms so that they can be in place and in use before consideration of any spending bills this year. 
   "I agree with the sponsors of the amendment that Congress must consider ways to ensure greater transparency and accountability and we will work together toward that goal. I also believe the Constitution gives Congress an important role in spending decisions and I take that obligation very seriously. If any President decides that he or she opposes what's good for my state, I will not stand idly by leaving Kentucky's families and military installations defenseless. 
   "In sum, Congress must be good stewards of taxpayers' dollars and we should continue to fight for responsible spending levels, not only in discretionary accounts - as with the $22 billion we saved taxpayers at the end of the last Congress - but also to the other two-thirds of the federal budget that is mandatory entitlement spending. Sadly, this Democrat budget does nothing to address that looming crisis threatening the economy our children will inherit from us."
