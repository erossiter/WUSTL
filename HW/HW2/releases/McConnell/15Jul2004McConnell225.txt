SEN. MCCONNELL'S TOBACCO BUYOUT BILL APPROVED BY SENATE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) today introduced a buyout proposal for tobacco quota owners and growers, which was approved by the U.S. Senate and included in H.R. 4520, the JOBS Act.  
 The legislation now goes to a House/Senate Conference Committee for approval.
   Senator McConnell's bill provides payments of $8 per pound to quota holders and $4 per pound to growers. The payments, based on the 2002 quota level, would be distributed over a ten-year period. The funds required will be obtained from manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products sold in the United States and will total $12 billion.
   "Today's action gets us one step closer to achieving a buyout for tobacco farmers," said McConnell. "Getting to this point has been a long and difficult process, but one that was vital to the future livelihoods of our tobacco farmers and their families. While this doesn't guarantee a buyout, we're closer than we've ever been before."
   McConnell added, "on several occasions it appeared as if prospects for this measure were doomed, so today's action by the Senate is particularly sweet."
