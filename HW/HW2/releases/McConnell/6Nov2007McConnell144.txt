JUDGE MUKASEY DESERVES A FULL SENATE VOTE THIS WEEK
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement after a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to report to the Senate floor the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to serve as Attorney General of the United States:  
   "Democrats asked the President to nominate a new Attorney General; he did. They asked for consultation; they got it. They asked for someone like Judge Mukasey to be nominated, and the President in fact nominated Judge Mukasey - almost seven weeks ago. 
   "Judge Mukasey is highly qualified and supported by a bipartisan majority of the Senate. He was deemed a consensus choice when he was nominated, and he still is today. Unfortunately, the nomination of this good man ran into the partisanship that affects all-too-many of those who volunteer for public service. 
   "Judge Mukasey has waited almost seven weeks for a vote. This process has gone on long enough. Judge Mukasey deserves to have an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor this week. And I believe he will be confirmed with strong bipartisan support."
