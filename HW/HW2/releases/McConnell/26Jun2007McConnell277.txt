SENATE REPUBLICANS SUCCEED IN PROTECTING EMPLOYEES' RIGHT TO SECRET BALLOTS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement after Senate Republicans succeeded in protecting workers' right to conduct secret ballot elections:  
   "The principle of a secret ballot is deeply rooted in the American tradition, and workers here have enjoyed this freedom at the workplace by law for 60 years. While it is unfortunate that Democrats would seek to reverse this right, Senate Republicans today stood firm in defending it. By preserving the secret ballot in union organizing drives, Republicans made sure America's 140 million workers are not intimidated or coerced into siding with either labor or management - and that anyone who would consider launching a future assault on the right to a secret ballot thinks twice before doing so."
