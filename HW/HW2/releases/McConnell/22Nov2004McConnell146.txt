SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR E-CAVERN PROJECT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1 million for the E-Cavern Project in Louisville, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   The E-Cavern project is a partnership between E-Cavern, the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky. The universities will use the funding to research and develop solutions to protect our nation's critical financial data. The project will be housed in a three million square foot limestone cavern under the city of Louisville.
