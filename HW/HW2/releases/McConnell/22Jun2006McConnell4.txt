SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFEAT OF TROOP WITHDRAWAL AMENDMENTS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today following the defeat of the troop withdrawal amendments authored by Sens. Kerry and Levin: 
   "Today, the Senate overwhelmingly opposed the notion that America should cut and run in Iraq before the job is completed. These votes send the unmistakable message to the terrorists that we are united in our determination to defeat them, and will not yield until we do."
