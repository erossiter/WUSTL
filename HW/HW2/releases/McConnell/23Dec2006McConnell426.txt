A UNIFIED POSITION AGAINST IRAN'S NUCLEAR ACTIONS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader-Elect Mitch McConnell made the following statement Saturday following the United Nations Security Council's unanimous vote to impose sanctions on Iran for its failure to suspend its uranium enrichment program: 
   "The unanimous vote by the Security Council shows the world is behind the U.S. position on Iran, and makes clear that Iran's failures are placing it on the fast track to international pariah status. The U.S. and the international community are rightly acting together to take aggressive steps to counter the danger created by an irresponsible Iranian government."
