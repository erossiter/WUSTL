SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON MAJORITY LEADER FRIST
U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today regarding the future plans of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist: 
 "Rare is the person who, acknowledged to be the very best in his field, risks leaving it all behind to tackle an entirely new career. But Bill has now done that twice. He has already risen to the very top of two difficult professions, and I know that he will similarly excel in whatever field he chooses in the future."
