NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE MAKES CLEAR: LEAVING IRAQ WOULD ONLY EMBOLDEN TERRORISTS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the recently declassified key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate:  
   "Whoever leaked this report forgot to mention a key finding of the intelligence community: If we defeat the terrorists in Iraq, there will be fewer terrorists inspired to carry on the fight. In other words, defeating terrorists in Iraq not only secures that new democracy, but prevents future attacks here at home. This is a dramatically different message than the selective leaks to the media. 
   "It's important to remember that terror attacks against the United States didn't start the day our troops entered Baghdad, and they won't end if we leave Iraq to the terrorists. Attacks here at home stopped when we started fighting al Qaeda where they live, rather than responding after they hit. "
