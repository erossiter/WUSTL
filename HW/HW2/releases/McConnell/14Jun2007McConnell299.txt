SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $18 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that he secured $18 million in additional funding for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA) program at the Blue Grass Army Depot. McConnell's request was included in the FY'08 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (VA) Appropriations bill.  
   "This funding will enable further progress to be made towards the safe and timely disposal of the chemical weapons stockpile at the Blue Grass Army Depot," said McConnell. "The elimination of these dangerous weapons is a top priority for me, and Kentuckians can rest assured that I will fight for this funding until it ends up in Richmond." 
   The FY'08 Military Construction and VA bill must now be approved by the full Senate.
