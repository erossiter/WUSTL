SEN. MCCONNELL: SENATE PROTECTED INTEGRITY OF CONSTITUTION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the Senate's rejection of unconstitutional legislation on Congressional representation for the District of Columbia, and the constitutional remedy that remains available for granting that representation:  
   "I opposed this bill because it is clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional. As the lead Senate Republican co-sponsor of the Help America Vote Act, I have long fought for making it easier to vote and harder to cheat. However, we in this body have a duty to defend the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. If the residents of the District are to get a member for themselves, there remains a remedy: amend the Constitution."
