SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON STEM CELL VOTE
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today following the votes on the stem cell research bills: 
   "I believe there is much more we can do to support the exploration of science and innovative research. But I also believe that federal scientific research needs to be conducted in a medically ethical manner. After careful consideration, I chose to support S.2754, which promotes a promising form of stem cell research that does not require the destruction of human life."
