SEN. MCCONNELL: ISG REPORT NO 'GET-DONE-QUICK SOLUTION'
U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Wednesday regarding the release of Iraq Study Group (ISG) report: 
 "I think we all know there is no quick or easy way to complete the important mission in Iraq, and those who hoped this report would provide a get-done-quick solution will be disappointed. And though we won't reach agreement overnight, this is an opportunity for us to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats and the White House and reach consensus on one of the most critical issues before the Congress."
