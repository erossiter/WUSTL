PRESIDENT SIGNS CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement today regarding the Military Commissions Act becoming law:  
   "This legislation ensures the President will be able to continue the terrorist interrogation program that has saved innocent American lives and prevented attacks here at home and around the world. By passing this bipartisan legislation, the Congress recognized, as the President does, that we are a nation at war against extremists who want to kill our citizens, cripple our economy and discredit the principles we hold dear - freedom and democracy. 
   "The military commissions system codified in this legislation protects our troops and protects classified information. And most important, it protects America. It is a critical component of our national security effort."
