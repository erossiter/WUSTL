SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of nearly $28 million for projects at the University of Louisville. The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature.  
   Senator McConnell delivered a total of over $30 million in earmarked funds to UofL in this year's appropriation cycle. Since 1998, he has personally secured more than $100 million for UofL priorities. 
   "Everyone is aware of what a great season the football Cards are achieving, but with today's announcement of these earmarks it is the research faculty and students who are the year's biggest winners," said McConnell. "President Ramsey is a talented leader who has articulated an exciting vision for the University. I am proud to help him in pursuit of the important goal of making UofL a national leader in health sciences and other disciplines." 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for UofL: 
   * $10.25 million for the UofL Biomedical Research Building. The University will use the funds Senator McConnell secured to help construct a 134,700 square foot facility at its Health Sciences Campus. The new facility will provide lab space and a full-service animal facility to support cancer research and is part of the University's effort to attain designation from the National Cancer Institute as a Comprehensive Cancer Center. Just today the Courier-Journal reported that Kentucky suffers from some of the highest cancer rates in the nation. 
   * $2 million for the UofL Regenerative Medicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease Project. Senator McConnell secured these funds to help the University continue its efforts to identify deficiencies leading to heart failure and pursue tissue engineering to repair damaged hearts. Louisville has developed a reputation as an international leader in heart research, and Senator McConnell has delivered an additional $4.2 million to the University to support cardiovascular research at the UofL Cardiovascular Innovation Institute in previous years. 
   * $450,000 for the UofL Cancer Agripharmaceutical Institute. UofL, in cooperation with Large Scale Biology in Owensboro, Kentucky, has developed a large-scale plan to produce cancer vaccines through the use of tobacco plants. This project not only will impact dramatically the development of cancer vaccines but also could help Kentucky tobacco farmers develop alternative uses for their tobacco plants. The Institute also supports the University's effort to be designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute. 
   * $500,000 for the UofL Computational Biology Project in Oral Health. These funds will be used to help health care professionals develop new biotechnology-based diagnostic tools and therapeutics for the early detection of chronic conditions, birth defects and periodontal disease. The University hopes that this project will address both the high levels of tooth loss and the prevalence of birth defects, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other treatable chronic conditions in Kentucky. 
   * $300,000 for the UofL Chronic Disease Management Education Program in Cancer. Senator McConnell secured these funds to help the University design and test a chronic disease management program specifically for cancer patients, their families, and their clinical caregivers, including oncologists. The project will help cancer patients and their families learn to live with cancer while research teams work aggressively to develop cures and will help the University meet its goal to be designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute. 
   * $500,000 in funding for the UofL Effects of Collaboration Team Intervention on Child Well Being Project. UofL will use these funds to establish collaborative teams of professionals, mentors, and attorneys to assist high-conflict families in identifying problems, strengths, and solutions to problems. The teams also will direct parents and children to neighborhood resources that can strengthen the family. 
   * $3 million for the UofL Pediatric Clinical Proteomic Center. The University of Louisville will use these funds to support research on proteomics technology, which focuses on the products of genes and how changes in specific patterns or alignment of proteins impact functions in the body. The University of Louisville is uniquely positioned to research these changes in proteins specifically as children develop from infants through childhood to adolescence. 
   * $400,000 for the UofL Sustainable Buildings Project. The University has established a partnership with the Jefferson County Public School District and the Louisville Metro Government to prepare plans to incorporate energy, water and waste efficiency technologies into public infrastructure being built or renovated. The University hopes that this research eventually will help school districts and other public agencies across the Commonwealth and the nation implement strategies to conserve energy and reduce operating costs. 
   * $2 million for the UofL Institute for Advanced Materials. The University's Institute for Advanced Materials will perform basic and applied research in energy-related materials. In particular, the Institute will focus on researching nanoscale materials to develop new materials with unique properties, including new forms of metal and inorganic materials for applications in energy production and conversion. 
   * $2 million for the Kentucky Rural Energy Consortium. UofL is a member of this consortium, which will research, develop and deploy renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies related to agriculture and rural communities. 
   * $2.5 million for the UofL Shuttle Bus Program. Senator McConnell secured these funds to support the campus shuttle system, which transports over 300,000 passengers primarily from the parking facilities at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium to other locations throughout the University community. The University will use these funds to improve passenger shelters, purchase additional vehicles, and increase security. 
   * $2 million in funding for the UofL Space Flight Exploration Project. UofL will use the funding to simulate the microgravity environment of space and perform a series of twelve experiments to study simultaneous changes in brain processing and cognition. Participants will be engaged in perception and cognition during different states of sleep and wakefulness and after different periods of sleep reduction. 
   * $1 million for the Northern Kentucky University/UofL Digital Science Center. UofL is working with NKU to establish a Digital Science Center and Stellar Command Center to teach astronomy and geology to college students and to increase interest in these sciences among elementary and secondary school students. Funds in FY'05 will be used to expand on this project by taking a hands-on astronomy program to schools through mobile and transportable units. Senator McConnell provided $1.7 million for this partnership in FY'04. 
   * $1 million for the UofL/Illinois Waste Management and Research Center Technology Diffusion Initiative. UofL and the University of Minnesota are working with the University of Illinois Waste Management and Research Center to implement technology diffusion programs for industrial sectors important to the three states. UofL specifically will focus on the metal finishing industry in Kentucky. 
   "The University of Louisville is a premier research facility and this funding will go a long way in helping it continue its nationally recognized research," said McConnell. "UofL deserves this funding, and I was honored to have secured this funding for this fine institution." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
