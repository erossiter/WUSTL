SEN. MCCONNELL: TROOP FUNDING BY CHRISTMAS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Tuesday on the need to fully fund our troops in the field before Congress leaves for Christmas:
   "The Senate overwhelmingly passed two resolutions this year rejecting any action that would undermine our troops in the field, and we owe it to our troops to protect them by providing the funding they need without further delay or grandstanding. Their families, here at home, deserve to know their loved ones are provided for by the time Congress leaves for Christmas."
