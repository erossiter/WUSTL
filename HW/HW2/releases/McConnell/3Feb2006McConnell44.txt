SEN. MCCONNELL APPLAUDS NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the latest economic figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: 
   "Each day brings fresh evidence that our economy is strong and growing stronger. In the last two and a half years, over 4.7 million new jobs have been created. Growth is solid and sustained and unemployment is low. While none of us will be satisfied until everyone who wants a job has one, it is clear the American economy remains the strongest in the world."
   *The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced today that the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent - the lowest monthly rate since July 2001 and lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. In January, the economy created 193,000 jobs and has created over 2 million jobs over the past 12 months, and more than 4.7 million since August 2003.
