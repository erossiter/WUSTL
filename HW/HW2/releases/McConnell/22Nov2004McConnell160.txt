SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR PADUCAH AREA TRANSIT SYSTEM
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1.3 million for the Paducah Area Transit System.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the funding for the Paducah Area Transit System, which will help them develop a mobile training system that includes simulators to improve its driver-training program. 
   The Paducah Area Transit System currently depends on extensive classroom training and limited road instruction time to train drivers, which limits the utility of the training. The new system, with the driving simulators, will improve the effectiveness of driver training. Senator McConnell previously supported the Paducah Area Transit System by earmarking $2 million for the transportation agency in FY'01. 
   "This much-needed funding will be used by the Paducah Area Transit System to improve its driver training program," said McConnell. "I was pleased to have secured this funding for this important project, which may also be shared with other transit systems across Kentucky." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
