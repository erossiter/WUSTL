REPUBLICANS WELCOME FURTHER DEBATE, DEMOCRATS OBJECT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding the efforts of Senate Democrat Leadership to delay further votes on Iraq amendments by conducting an all-night session: 
   "The Senate has been debating Iraq all year and Republicans welcome further debate. I have offered the Democrat Leadership the opportunity to have a series of votes on Tuesday. They objected. There is no need to further delay votes on these important amendments with, what a senior Democrat aide characterized as 'a political stunt.' Our soldiers and the American people expect more from us."
