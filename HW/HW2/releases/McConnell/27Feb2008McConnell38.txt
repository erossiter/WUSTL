SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ROLE WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY IN OUR NATION'S PUBLIC LIFE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement on Wednesday regarding the role William F. Buckley, Jr. in our nation's public life:  
   "For more than five decades William F. Buckley Jr. played a heroic role in our nation's public life. He combined a powerful intellect and a gentle manner with an enormous drive, and a child's certainty that in the battle of ideas, the truth would always win. 
   "Generations of Americans learned they were conservatives the first time they picked up National Review. And those who were not convinced could not help but like the man who founded it. He charmed television audiences with his mind and wit and grace. He personally tutored hundreds of young minds in the principles and arguments of conservatism. He held the ground, as one admirer put it, until the reinforcements came, and then led them all as a happy warrior in the greatest cultural and ideological battles of our day. Bill Buckley inspired us with the passion and conviction of his life. And when we learned that he had died in his study, he inspired us by his death. 
   "He left the world as he lived it, filling even his final moments with meaning and purpose. We are saddened by the loss of this good man, and grateful for his extraordinary life."
