SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES NEARLY $288 MILLION FOR WESTERN REGION OF KENTUCKY
  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. McConnell has secured funding for important projects throughout Kentucky. This year he is proud to announce he brought home nearly $288 million for the western part of Kentucky.  
   The following is the funding Senator McConnell obtained for this region of the state in the FY'05 Budget: 
   * $112 million for cleanup activities at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This money will be used to fund continued environmental cleanup efforts at the plant. This amount includes funding to accelerate the characterization and disposal of 50,000 tons of scrap metal and 41,000 drums of low-level waste. 
   * $50 million for Depleted Uranium Conversion. In recent years, McConnell authored two federal statutes requiring DOE to build a facility in Paducah to convert 39,000 canisters of hazardous depleted uranium hexaflouride into a more stable compound. On July 27, 2004, DOE began construction on this facility, which will employ 150 individuals when completed. 
   * $4.1 million for Worker Health Monitoring. This funding will be used for continued operation of a mobile health unit that screens current and former workers at the plant for the early signs of lung cancer. The mobile health unit travels between the three gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
   * $3.5 million for construction of an Aquatic Training Facility for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). This funding will create an aquatic training facility that will enhance survivability and training for the unit's elite helicopter pilots who fly extensive and dangerous missions at considerable distances over water. It will also improve training for the helicopter pilots of the 101st Airborne, who will have access to this facility. 
   * $2 million to widen Cole Road near Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Cole Road is the primary commercial vehicle access route to Fort Campbell. 
   * $1 million to widen KY 911 and KY 115 near Fort Campbell, Kentucky. These funds will be used to widen KY 911 and KY 115, which serve as alternative routes for convoy access to the deployment route from Fort Campbell. 
   * $750,000 for construction of a maintenance facility at the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. 
   * $4.5 million for production of an Obstacle Breeching System for the Marine Corps by the Ensign-Bickford Company in Muhlenberg County. The funding will be used to manufacture the portable rocket propelled weapon system, which is designed to destroy land mines and wire obstacles during assault breaching operations. 
   * $6 million for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment at Fort Campbell that will be used to protect Chinook helicopters from missile attack. 
   * $500,000 for the City of Elkton to upgrade the sewer plant and extend sewer lines. The Elkton Wastewater Treatment Plant is operating beyond its capacity. The existing sanitary sewer lift station needs to be upgraded and the rehabilitation of some sewer lines will alleviate infiltration and inflow problems. 
   * $200,000 for the Hopkins County Community Clinic, a not-for-profit community health facility that provides free diagnostic and treatment services to low-income working families in Hopkins County and the surrounding communities. 
   * $200,000 for the Hopkinsville-Christian County-Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force Partnership. The Narcotics Task Force Partnership is a collaboration that includes the Hopkinsville Police and Fire Departments, the Christian County Sheriff and Police Departments, and the Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force. The funds will be used to purchase technology to link the agencies and help first responders better serve the members of the communities during an emergency. 
   * $160,000 for the Mayfield Police Department for a computer-aided dispatch system. The system will allow dispatchers to locate the origin of 911 calls on a map and assist responding units. This funding will enable police to respond more easily and provide increased security for the residents of Mayfield. 
   * $1.3 million for the Paducah Area Transit System, which will help them develop a mobile training system that includes simulators to improve its driver-training program. 
   * $69 million for the Olmsted Lock and Dam project.* This funding will be used for the continued construction of a new facility that will replace locks 52 and 53 on the Ohio River. Once complete, this facility will be the largest locking facility in Kentucky in terms of tonnage. 
   * $32.5 million for the Kentucky Lock and Dam project. This funding will be used to double the lock's size to handle the increased tonnage of today's larger barge traffic. 
   * McConnell worked with other members of the Kentucky delegation on this project.
