SEN. MCCONNELL: MARCH FOR LIFE A 'JUST AND NOBLE CAUSE'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Tuesday regarding the 35th annual March for Life:  
   "Tens of thousands of Americans will gather today in Washington to affirm that every human life is precious. They know this principle lies at the root of every just society, and their presence is a powerful reminder of just how fragile a principle it is. I applaud the participants of the 35th annual March for Life on their commitment to a culture that treats its weakest members with dignity and respect, and I join them in working to advance this just and noble cause."
