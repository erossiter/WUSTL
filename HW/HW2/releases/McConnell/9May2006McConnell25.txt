SEN. MCCONNELL REMINDS SENIORS OF DEADLINE TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN
 U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell today reminded seniors that the enrollment deadline for the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan is Monday, May 15, 2006.  
   Anyone on Medicare - those who are 65 or older, and some Americans with disabilities - is eligible to sign up for the benefit. Since last November, more than 30 million Americans have enrolled in the new Medicare prescription drug plan, including more than 482,000 Kentuckians. The average premium that seniors pay is a third less than had been expected - just $25 per month - saving Americans an average of $1,100 per year. 
   Kentuckians on Medicare who have little or no prescription drug costs can enroll in a plan for as low as $12 a month to protect against future unexpected drug bills. 
   Americans with limited incomes will get additional help, and only have to pay very little or nothing at all. On average, Medicare will cover more than 95 percent of prescription drug costs for the neediest Medicare beneficiaries. 
   "I encourage every eligible Kentuckian to take advantage of this valuable new program," said McConnell. "The Medicare prescription drug benefit is working and is a great deal for our seniors, giving them additional and enhanced choices for their health care." 
   If you're interested in enrolling in the plan, you can ask your doctor or pharmacist for assistance. You can also contact a Medicare counselor 24 hours-a-day at 1-800-MEDICARE, and you can enroll online by visiting the official Medicare website at www.Medicare.gov.
