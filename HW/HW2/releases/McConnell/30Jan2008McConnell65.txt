SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FISCAL REFORM WORKING GROUP
  In a continuing effort to bring greater transparency and taxpayer confidence to federal government spending, U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell appointed a Fiscal Reform Working Group Wednesday. The working group, chaired by Senator Dick Lugar (R-Ind.), will review the earmark process for spending and revenue and recommend additional means for the Senate to bring greater transparency and fiscal responsibility to government spending.  
   McConnell selected Sens. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) to serve on the working group. 
   "Although we've taken steps in the past to reform the spending process, more can and should be done to restore the public's trust and bring greater transparency to the way the federal government spends taxpayers' money," McConnell said. 
   The Fiscal Reform Working Group will report its findings to the Republican Conference by March 15.
