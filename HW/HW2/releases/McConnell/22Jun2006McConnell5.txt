SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $20 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FISCAL '07 AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests for over $20 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'07 Agriculture Appropriations bill, must now be approved by the full Senate. 
   Included in the funding secured by McConnell is a total of $6 million for construction of the only two federal research labs in Kentucky. Other projects include:  
   UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY ($9.48 MILLION) 
   * $3 million for construction of a UK/Agriculture Research Service (ARS) lab. This funding is the second installment of construction funds for the ARS lab, one of two federal research labs in Kentucky. 
   * $3.2 million for the UK/ARS Forage-Animal Production Research Unit and $386,000 for the UK Forage for Advancing Livestock Production project. This funding will enable UK researchers to continue their study into the nutritional value of new forages for livestock. This research will contribute directly to cattle ranchers' bottom line by aiding in the development of healthier and therefore more valuable beef cattle. 
   * $752,000 for the UK New Crop Opportunities project. This funding will allow Kentucky farmers to be on the cutting edge of the changes taking place in the global marketplace and allow them to emerge as leaders in this field. 
   * $639,000 for UK's Advanced Genetics Technology Center. This funding will be used to study ways to eliminate plant and animal diseases, enhance nutritional and health value of foods, and develop new uses for agriculture plants and animals. 
   * $835,000 for UK's Health Education Extension Leadership (HEEL) Program. The HEEL program links UK's School of Public Health with the College of Agriculture. This program uses the expertise from both schools to develop and implement programs designed to improve the health of the communities they serve. 
   * $668,000 for UK's Precision Agriculture Research Unit. Precision Agriculture allows researchers to use satellites to help farmers measure the amount of seed, fertilizer and water they need for their land, thus enabling them to increase the productivity and eliminate crop inefficiencies. 
   "This funding allows UK to continue to make progress towards constructing its federal research lab," said Senator McConnell. "This facility and the research being conducted by UK's scientists and students are important to the future of agriculture in Kentucky." 
   WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY (over $6.5 MILLION) 
   * $3 million for construction of a WKU/ARS research lab. This funding is the second installment of construction funds for the ARS lab, one of two federal research labs in Kentucky. 
   $3.2 million for WKU/ARS research on waste management. Kentucky is a top producer of both beef and poultry products, leaving the state susceptible to agricultural waste management challenges. WKU will use the funds to work in conjunction with the ARS to examine ways to prevent contamination from waste products and to keep livestock production levels from declining. 
   $392,000 for a cooperative agreement between WKU and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). This funding will be used to conduct water quality monitoring initiatives. 
   "With this funding, WKU can continue to take steps towards constructing its federal research lab," said Senator McConnell. "The research conducted at the lab is important for the long-term safety and sustainability of Kentucky's agricultural industry because it will be used to develop new ways to dispose of animal waste." 
   STATEWIDE FUNDING FOCUSED ON PROTECTING KENTUCKY'S ENVIRONMENT (over $4.2 MILLION) 
   * $2.97 million for the Kentucky Soil Erosion Control/Soil Survey Program. 
   * $990,000 for Kentucky Natural Resources Conservation Service Conservation Technical Assistance Grants. 
   * $300,000 for wildlife damage control efforts in Kentucky. 
   The FY'07 Agriculture Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
