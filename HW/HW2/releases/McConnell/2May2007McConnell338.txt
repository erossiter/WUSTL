WITH VETO SUSTAINED, REAL WORK ON TROOP FUNDING BILL CAN BEGIN
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday on the House vote to sustain the President's veto of legislation containing a surrender date for Iraq:  
   "By sustaining the President's veto, Congress has reaffirmed its commitment to send a clean bill to the President which supports the mission of our troops. No matter how you may feel about the effort - and there are wide differences - we need to get the money to our troops. Delaying these desperately needed funds has already created unnecessary hardships for our military. Now that the political posturing is over, we must quickly move forward and craft a clean bill which gives our commanders in the field the funding they need to properly equip and train our forces." 
   Leader McConnell will participate in a bipartisan, bicameral meeting this afternoon at the White House to discuss the next steps in ensuring our troops receive necessary funds, training and equipment.
