SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES EDUCATION DEPARTMENT GRANT FOR FAYETTE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Department of Education has approved a grant of nearly $400,000 for the Fayette County Public School System.  
   This funding will allow the Fayette County Public School System to offer a comprehensive, research-based health and fitness program called "Reality P.E." to its students. The program will create a partnership between the school district, the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department, the University of Kentucky, the YMCA, Boys and Girls Club of American, and the Lexington-Fayette County Government Division of Parks and Recreation to raise the standard for physical education. "Reality P.E." will help students increase physical activity and teach them to adopt healthy living habits. 
   "It is critical that young people are taught the importance of staying active and making good choices," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will allow the Fayette County School District to provide quality physical education opportunities to its students."
