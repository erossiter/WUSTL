SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $15.8 MILLION FOR KENTUCKY AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell - a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee - obtained over $15.8 million in funding for several Kentucky projects in the FY '08 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill. It now goes to the full Appropriations Committee for consideration. 
   McConnell used his seniority on the Appropriations Committee to direct funding to the following Kentucky agriculture projects:  
   UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (OVER $9.2 MILLION) 
   * $3 million for construction of a UK/Agriculture Research Service (ARS) lab. This funding is the third installment of funds for the ARS lab, one of only two federal research labs in Kentucky. McConnell secured the initial funding to establish the ARS lab. 
   * $2.9 million for the UK/ARS Forage-Animal Production Research Unit and $390,000 for the UK Animal Health project. This funding will enable UK researchers to continue their study with ARS into the nutritional value of new forages for livestock and animal health systems. This research will contribute directly to cattle ranchers' bottom line by aiding in the development of healthier and therefore more valuable beef cattle. 
   * $750,000 for the UK New Crop Opportunities project. This funding will allow Kentucky farmers to be on the cutting edge of the changes taking place in the agriculture marketplace and allow them to emerge as leaders. 
   * $645,000 for UK's Advanced Genetics Technology Center. This funding will be used to study ways to eliminate plant and animal diseases, enhance nutritional and health value of foods, and develop new uses for agriculture plants and animals. 
   * $843,000 for UK's Health Education Extension Leadership (HEEL) Program. The HEEL program links UK's School of Public Health with the College of Agriculture. This program uses the expertise from both schools to develop and implement programs designed to improve the health of the communities they serve. 
   * $675,000 for UK's Precision Agriculture Research Unit. Precision Agriculture allows researchers to use satellites to help farmers measure the amount of seed, fertilizer and water they need for their land, thus enabling them to increase the productivity and eliminate crop inefficiencies. 
   "The University of Kentucky's College of Agriculture is a leading agricultural research institution and this funding will help it build on its success," said McConnell. "This funding will allow UK to continue the construction on the federal research lab, and once built, students will be able to use cutting-edge technology to help shape the future of Kentucky agriculture." 
   WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY (OVER $5 MILLION) 
   * $2 million for construction of a WKU/ARS research lab. This funding is the third installment of funds for the ARS lab, one of only two federal research labs in Kentucky. McConnell secured the initial funding to establish the ARS lab. 
   * $2.9 million for WKU/ARS research on waste management. Kentucky is a top producer of both beef and poultry products, leaving the state susceptible to agricultural waste management challenges. WKU will use the funds to work in conjunction with the ARS to examine ways to prevent contamination from waste products and to keep livestock production levels from declining. 
   * $125,000 for the Green River Water Quality and Biological Diversity Project. WKU is leading an effort to measure the effectiveness and conservation efforts in the Green River watershed. 
   "This critical funding moves Western Kentucky University another step closer to a new federal research lab," said McConnell. "Once constructed, WKU's lab will enable researchers and students to find ways to address agricultural waste products and develop solutions to protect our livestock and the environment from contamination." 
   STATEWIDE FUNDING FOCUSED ON PROTECTING KENTUCKY'S ENVIRONMENT (OVER $1.6 MILLION) 
   * $1.075 million for the Kentucky Soil Erosion Control/Soil Survey Program. 
   * $580,000 for Kentucky Soil Conservation Districts Technical Assistance Grants. 
   "These funds are important for conservation projects in Kentucky," said McConnell. "Rural communities are working hard to adapt to environmental changes across the state and this money will help local leaders and farmers prevent future flooding and soil erosion, especially on the farm." 
   The FY'08 Agriculture Appropriations bill now goes to the full Appropriations Committee for approval.
