SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ CONFERENCE REPORT
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the conference report for supplemental troop funding which mandates troop withdrawal beginning no later than October 1st, 2007: 
   "This latest proposal mandates that, no matter how well the Iraqi government meets its benchmarks and no matter how well our troops succeed in Iraq, the surrender must begin no later than October 1st. That sends absolutely the wrong message to al-Qaeda, our allies in the region, and our forces in the field."
