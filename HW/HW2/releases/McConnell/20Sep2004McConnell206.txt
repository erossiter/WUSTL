SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR FORT KNOX
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Senate has approved his request of $4.69 million in military construction funding for Fort Knox.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which now goes to a House/Senate Conference for final approval. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill: 
   * $1.85 million for construction of a Shoot House. This funding will allow Fort Knox to construct a re-configurable facility for simulated urban assault training. 
   * $1.9 million for construction of an Urban Assault Course. This funding will expand and modify an existing assault course to allow units to train in a simulated urban environment. 
   * $940,000 for taxiway and airfield improvements at Godman Army Airfield. This funding will strengthen and widen taxiways to allow expanded operations by heavy cargo aircraft at Fort Knox. 
   "Fort Knox is one of the leading military installations training soldiers for today's urban settings," said Senator McConnell. "I am pleased the Senate approved my request for funding which will enable Fort Knox to expand and improve its urban combat training facilities." 
   In addition, Senator McConnell helped protect the following project, which was included in the President's original budget: 
   * $50 million for construction of a Barracks Complex at Fort Knox. The Army originally placed this project in the budget at Senator McConnell's request in order to improve living conditions for soldiers at Fort Knox.
