SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON IRAQ, HOMELAND SECURITY
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell held a media availability following the weekly policy lunch Tuesday. The following are excerpts from his remarks.  
   On the Iraq debate: 
   "Senator Reid and I have been in discussion about how and when to resume discussion of the General Petraeus mission in Iraq. Let me repeat that at whatever point we go back to discussing the Petraeus mission it is the view of the overwhelming majority of the Republican Conference that we will want to vote on funding for the troops." 
   On the Homeland Security bill: 
   "With regard to the 9/11 bill, we had an opportunity to talk to Secretary Chertoff at lunch. I will not characterize his views in private to us, but let me say, I think the bottom line for most of our conference is going to be: When we finish this bill, does it make America's security greater or does it diminish America's security? 
   "There are a number - some very important amendments that will be offered by our side. The majority leader indicates there will be some substantive amendments offered by the Democratic side. We'll have to see what the bill looks like at the end of the process and, again, ask that question at the end of the process: Does this bill, if signed, enhance the nation's security or diminish it?" 
   On amendments to the Homeland Security bill: 
   "I think both sides are starting the 9/11 bill with the feeling that it will not be the repository for Iraq amendments. Senator Reid and I have not yet reached an agreement about how and when to have the Iraq debate, but I think both sides are going to start the 9/11 debate with amendments that are more or less related to the 9/11 bill."
