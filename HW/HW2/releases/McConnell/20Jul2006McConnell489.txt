SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $25 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY'S UNIVERSITIES IN FISCAL 2007 LABOR/HHS/EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests for $25 million in funding for several Kentucky universities. The funding, which is included in the FY'07 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, must now be approved by the full Senate. 
   "Kentucky's universities are using cutting-edge technology to conduct innovative research," said Senator McConnell. "While today's action is only the first step in the process, I will work to ensure that this funding ends up back home so this important research can continue."  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE ($19.25 MILLION) 
   * $15.7 million for construction of a new biomedical research building. The University will use the funds to construct a facility at its Health Sciences Campus. The new facility will provide lab space and a full-service animal facility to support cancer research and is part of the University's effort to attain designation from the National Cancer Institute as a Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
   * $3.2 million for the Center for Cardiovascular Repair. The University has expertise in cardiovascular disease and treatment and has begun focusing on the use of adult cardiac stem cells to regenerate heart muscle that is damaged or dead. The Center will sort, grow, and expand these cells and will develop therapies to administer cardiac stem cells in patients who suffer from heart attacks or heart failure. The funds will be used to develop core facilities and to purchase equipment for this innovative work. 
   * $350,000 for the Chronic Disease Management Education Program in Cancer. These funds will be used to advance the University's ongoing work to design and test a chronic disease management program specifically for cancer patients, their families, and their caregivers. The project will help cancer patients and their families learn to live with cancer while research teams work aggressively to develop cures and will help the University meet its goal to be designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute. 
   UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY ($2.5 MILLION) 
   * $1.5 million for the High Bandwidth Network Connection project. The University is a member of the National High Speed Grid and this funding will allow it to upgrade its connection to the grid to maintain full membership. This connection supports health care delivery and education and clinical and biomedical research at UK. 
   * $1 million for the Kentucky Oral Health Initiative. These funds will allow the University to continue the Kentucky Oral Health Initiative, which was created to improve oral health care for disadvantaged populations in Kentucky while addressing the link between oral health and other serious health issues, such as neonatal development and cardiovascular risk. 
   WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY ($1.75 MILLION) 
   * $1.5 million for the Kentucky Academy of Mathematics & Science Information Technology project. The Academy, an on-campus residential program for high school juniors and seniors who will take university-level classes, will be housed at WKU. The funds will be used for state-of-the-art information technology systems that will support the education of the Academy students. 
   * $250,000 for the Hispanic Resource Center. These funds will be used by the University to extend health outreach services to Hispanic families in south central Kentucky. The Center focuses on health screening, referrals, public health issues, health promotion, disease prevention, and assimilation resources for the area's Hispanic population. The program works in conjunction with the University's successful Mobile Health Screening Program. 
   NORTHERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY ($1.5 MILLION) 
   * $1.5 million for the Infrastructure Management Institute. The funds will be used by the University to establish a program that will develop the best practices and solutions for technology management issues facing businesses and industries today. 
   The FY'07 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
