DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO TAKE 'YES' FOR ANSWER ON TAX RELIEF
  U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Wednesday in response to House Democrats' decision to disregard the Senate-passed, bipartisan AMT patch and instead further delay tax refunds for millions of Americans: 
   "Eighty eight Senators, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the Senate, are on the record regarding the middle-class tax hike known as the AMT: the Senate will not pass a short-term fix for some, if it includes a permanent, massive tax hike for others. But rather than take up a bipartisan Senate bill that would pass the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, the House has chosen yet again to take the path of the partisan dead end.
   "They've chosen to put political gamesmanship ahead of the 50 million American families whose tax returns will be delayed while the House Democrat Leadership tries to make a political point. With less than a month before the filing season begins, the House must stop these political games and take up the Senate-passed AMT patch immediately, or explain to taxpayers why they are delaying refunds for tens of millions of American families."
