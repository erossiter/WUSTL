  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests for over $9 million in funding for Kentucky.

   "I am pleased the committee approved my request to fund infrastructure improvement projects and economic development in western Kentucky," said Senator McConnell. "While this is just the beginning of the appropriations process, I will work to ensure that the funds remain in the final bill." 
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky:
