SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $2.5 million for the University of Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill, which the full Senate may consider as early as this week.
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill:
   * $1.5 million for the Minimally Invasive Surgery Modeling and Simulation Project at the University of Kentucky. This interactive, virtual reality-based simulator will allow students and military surgeons to practice surgery techniques.
   * $1 million for a partnership with Ft. Knox for the Visualization for Training in Urban Terrain Project, which uses virtual simulation to train soldiers for combat in urban environments.
   "Virtual simulators are helping researchers and military personal with important practical training," said McConnell. "I am pleased that the Appropriations committee agreed that this funding will help advance surgical and combat techniques."
