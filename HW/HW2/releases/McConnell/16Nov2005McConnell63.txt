SEN. MCCONNELL'S RESOLUTION TO HONOR ROSA PARKS WITH STATUE IN U.S. CAPITOL IS APPROVED
  Sen. Mitch McConnell's resolution, S. Con. Res. 62, honoring Rosa Parks with the creation and placement of a statue in the United States Capitol passed the Senate today. Sen.  
 Christopher Dodd (D-CT) joined McConnell as an original co-sponsor. 
   Rosa Parks will be the first African American to be honored with a statue in the nation's Capitol. Roughly 24 years ago, the Senate passed a similar resolution to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who is honored with a memorial bust. 
   "Placing a statue in the U.S. Capitol is a fitting tribute to one of America's great heroes," said McConnell. "Rosa Parks' act of civil disobedience was the spark that ignited the modern civil-rights movement. This statue will immortalize her life and will enable future generations to remember this brave woman and the role she played in changing the course of history. I am honored to have worked with my colleagues to make this happen."
