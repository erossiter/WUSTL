SEN. MCCONNELL: REPUBLICANS ARE PROTECTING NEGOTIATIONS
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Wednesday regarding legislation to allow government price-fixing for Medicare prescription drugs. Cloture was not invoked by a vote of 55-42.  
   "This bill is flawed and does nothing to provide our seniors with more benefits for less money. I've never seen the government take a program from the private sector and deliver it more efficiently and at a lower cost. Today the Senate protected healthcare access for tens of millions of seniors as well as price negotiations to ensure they pay the least amount of money for the prescription drugs they need."
