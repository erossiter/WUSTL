PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNS SEN. MCCONNELL LEGISLATION RENEWING SANCTIONS ON BURMA
  Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell praised President Bush for signing his legislation renewing sanctions against the illegitimate and repressive State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma. 
   "By signing the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, the President once again sent a message to the entire world that the United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Burma in their struggle for freedom and justice. I am hopeful that the UN Security Council will soon follow suit." 
   Senator McConnell's bill passed the Senate on July 26, 2006.
