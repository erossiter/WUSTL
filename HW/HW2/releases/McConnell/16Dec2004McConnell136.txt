SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES MORE THAN $24 MILLION FOR BOWLING GREEN, OWENSBORO
  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. McConnell has secured funding for important projects throughout Kentucky. This year he is proud to announce he brought home more than $24 million for Owensboro, Bowling Green and surrounding communities, including over $10 million for Western Kentucky University.  
   The following is the funding Senator McConnell obtained for this region of the state in the FY'05 Budget: 
   * $2.3 million for the design of an Agriculture Research Service (ARS) lab at WKU. The federal lab will house the Animal Waste Management Research Unit, which will focus research efforts on creating innovative waste management strategies and technologies that will help reduce the environmental impact of livestock operations. With horses, poultry and cattle now being Kentucky's top agricultural products, it is critical that these research activities move forward quickly. 
   * $2.78 million for Animal Waste Management Research. Kentucky is a top producer of both beef and poultry products, leaving the state susceptible to agricultural waste management problems. WKU will use the funds to work in conjunction with the ARS to examine ways to prevent contamination from waste products and to keep livestock production levels from dropping. 
   * $2 million for the South Central Kentucky Water Infrastructure Project at the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark. This funding will be used for water and sewer improvements related to the industrial park. 
   * $2 million for the Bowling Green Transpark U.S. 68/31W Improvements Project. Funds will be used to improve U.S. 68 and U.S. 31W, which provide access to the Bowling Green Transpark. 
   * $1.5 million for the South Central Kentucky Training and Development Project at the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark. This funding will be used to provide equipment for the on-site technical training center, which will ensure that workers have the skills needed by employers at the industrial park. 
   * $5 million for the Owensboro Waterfront Development Project. This funding will enable the city to continue its work to make the waterfront a community gathering spot 
   * $1 million for the Owensboro-Daviess County Airport Runway Extension Project. 
   * $1 million for the Central Kentucky Agriculture and Exposition Center in Casey County, Kentucky. This funding will enable the County to build an agricultural center, which will allow local residents to showcase their farm products. 
   * $250,000 for the Old Warren County Courthouse Restoration Project. The Old Warren County Courthouse was constructed in 1869 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but exposure and previous misguided attempts at restoration threaten the distinguishing historic characteristics. Funds will be used to restore and preserve this unique building. 
   * $600,000 for the WKU Spotlight Youth Project. The University will use these funds to encourage youth to participate in community activities through service projects and mentoring programs. 
   * $1.5 million for the WKU Just Think! Project. WKU faculty, undergraduates, and graduate students will provide education, training and enrichment opportunities to elementary and secondary students, their caregivers, and other non-traditional students living in and around the public housing facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The University hopes to have a dramatic impact on at-risk students and their families by improving academic performance, increasing literacy and mathematics skills, and developing work-related skills. 
   * $500,000 for the WKU E-Train Project. Senator McConnell secured these funds to help WKU build upon the success of the E-Train Initiative, which focuses on increasing the familiarity with and use of technology in the classroom. The University has partnered with 28 local school districts in the Green River Education Consortium and provided thousands of hours worth of teaching the use of technology to elementary and secondary teachers. The E-Train Initiative was established in 2001 with funds earmarked by the Senator, and he has delivered $900,000 to this project in previous appropriations bills. 
   * $500,000 for the WKU Small Public Water Technology Center. The funding will be used by WKU to continue operating the center, which provides assistance to small public water systems across Kentucky. 
   * $600,000 for the WKU Center for Wastewater Research, which performs wastewater management activities for small and rural communities throughout Kentucky. 
   * $800,000 for the Lost River Cave Improvement Project. The funds will be used by Friends of the Lost River Cave Inc. in conjunction with WKU to preserve and develop the Lost River Cave as a tourist attraction for the region. 
   * $800,000 for WKU to complete the establishment of an Environmental Control Technology Laboratory. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory has been working with WKU and other institutions through the Combustion Technology University Alliance to develop and deploy new coal combustion technology. Western's Environmental Control Technology Laboratory will develop clean coal technology for municipal, regional, and national power generating facilities. 
   * $800,000 for the WKU Green River Biological Diversity Monitoring project. $400,000 from the Natural Resource Conservation Service and $400,000 from the EPA will be used to conduct water quality monitoring initiatives along the Green River. 
   * $100,000 for the Simpson County 911 Center. The funds will assist the County in developing mapping capabilities and upgrading technology to handle increased call volume.
