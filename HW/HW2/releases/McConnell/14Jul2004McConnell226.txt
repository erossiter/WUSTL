SEN. MCCONNELL UNVEILS NEW CHILD PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell today joined officials from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Kentucky-based Appriss, Inc. at a press conference to announce a new partnership designed to help law enforcement agencies locate missing children and their abductors. 
   Appriss, Inc., which is located in Louisville, has agreed to donate its "JusticeXchange" database to the NCMEC free of charge. This new technology provides up-to-date information on inmates held in jail facilities across the country. This database will allow the NCMEC to immediately know when a suspected abductor has been booked by any law enforcement agency in the country. It also will allow the Center's analysts to search for missing children who might later be arrested as adults.
   "I'm proud that Appriss, Inc. has put Kentucky on the map as a leader in criminal justice information-sharing," said Senator McConnell. "No longer will those who prey on children be able to hide in the bureaucratic cracks between police forces of various jurisdictions. Appriss and the National Center will now be able to use their new technology to track these predators."
   Over the course of his career in public service, Senator McConnell has been a leading advocate on behalf of our nation's children.
   Attached is a summary of Senator McConnell's work on behalf of missing and exploited children.
