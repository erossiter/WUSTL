BIPARTISAN MAJORITY SUPPORTS JUDGE SOUTHWICK
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement on Wednesday after a clear bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Judge Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals:  
   "Judge Southwick asked to be judged fairly-to be judged on the facts, to be judged on his record. It is the same standard he has applied to others as a judge, a military officer, and a teacher. It is a standard for which he is well known and admired. Today the U.S. Senate held him to that same standard and a clear bipartisan majority agreed that he is exceedingly qualified to continue serving his country, this time on the Fifth Circuit."
