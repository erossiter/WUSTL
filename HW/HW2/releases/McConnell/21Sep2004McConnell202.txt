SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR KNOBS STATE FOREST PROJECT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $1.2 million for the Forest Legacy Knobs State Forest project.  
 The funding, which is included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   Kentucky recently established a Forest Legacy Program, a national program to protect forest resources and to ensure good forest stewardship. The Commonwealth identified property in Bullitt County, Kentucky, that is ideal for funding under the Forest Legacy Program. The property, referred to as the Kuhn tract, lies in an area that is quickly becoming a developed residential area and is also adjacent to the 14,000-acre Bernheim Research Forest. 
   "As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was pleased to secure funding for this important project," said McConnell. "The funding will be used by the Forest Legacy Program to create the Knobs State Forest and Wildlife Management Area, which will be used for recreational and educational activities." 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
