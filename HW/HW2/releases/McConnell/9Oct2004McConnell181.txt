SENS. REID, MCCONNELL WIN MAJOR HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE REFORM
  Sens. Harry Reid (D-NV) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY), leaders of the bipartisan working group charged with implementing recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission to reform congressional intelligence oversight, as well as other options to improve oversight of the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security, won Senate approval for significant reform today.  
   Reid and McConnell have been holding meetings with a bipartisan task force consisting of 20 other senators - ten from each party - for the past month. They have also consulted with the members of the 9/11 Commission. 
   "This is a significant reform of Congress' oversight of homeland security and intelligence," said Reid. "Thanks to the cooperation and compromise of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our homelands and hometowns will be safer and better prepared to respond to terrorist threats." 
   "I applaud my colleagues for approving this critical reform, which will enable Congress to better monitor and support the executive agencies tasked with keeping America safe," said McConnell.
