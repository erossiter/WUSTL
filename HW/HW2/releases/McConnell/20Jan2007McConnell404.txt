SEN. MCCONNELL: REFORM THE TAX CODE, INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Saturday regarding the President's radio address to the nation, and the need to reform the tax code and make health care more accessible for America's families:  
   "Too many people today who don't get health insurance through their jobs are unfairly priced out of the market because of government interference. The President is right, the tax code should be changed to help them. Allowing all Americans the same benefits that large companies get when paying their health care costs just makes sense. By correcting this inequity, government can provide the tools necessary for individuals to buy affordable, quality health insurance for their families - and then get out of the way and let them make their own choices. 
   "By allowing Americans to deduct the money they spend on health insurance, we will encourage more participation - and drive down prices in the bargain. This, in turn, would allow more people to buy their health insurance directly, giving them the freedom to control where, how, and how much, they spend."
