SEN. MCCONNELL: REP. RANGEL TAX INCREASE 'DEAD ON ARRIVAL' IN SENATE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement regarding Congressman Rangel's proposed $1.3 trillion tax hike, which, if passed, would be the largest tax hike in U.S. history:
   "The last thing the American people need right now is a $1.3 trillion tax increase that would be a dangerous jolt to our economy. If such a proposal were to pass the House, it would be dead on arrival in the Senate."
