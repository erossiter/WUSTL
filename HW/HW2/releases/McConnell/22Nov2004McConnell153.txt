SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR HOPKINS COUNTY COMMUNITY CLINIC
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $200,000 for the Hopkins County Community Clinic.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured $200,000 for the clinic that provides free health care to the working poor in western Kentucky. The Hopkins County Community Clinic is a not-for-profit community health facility that provides free diagnostic and treatment services to low-income working families in Hopkins County and the surrounding communities. 
   Since 2001, Senator McConnell has secured more than $1 million for similar clinics across western Kentucky ensuring that those most in need have access to quality healthcare services. 
   "The volunteers and medical staff at the Hopkins County Community Clinic deserve our heartfelt thanks for their work to provide medical care to families in the region," said McConnell. "I was pleased to have secured funding for the clinic and I am grateful for their commitment to serving the people of western Kentucky." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
