SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR CENTRAL KENTUCKY AGRICULTURE AND EXPOSITION CENTER
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his request of $1 million in funding for the Central Kentucky Agriculture and Exposition Center in Casey County, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure funding for the construction of the center. 
   "Farmers in Casey County have been hit hard by the decline in the tobacco industry," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the community to build a facility to promote agriculture through livestock shows, sales and events that showcase local farm products." 
   The full Senate must now approve the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.
