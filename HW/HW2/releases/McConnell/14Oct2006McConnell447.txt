SECURITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY ACTS ON PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR TOUGH SANCTIONS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Saturday following the United Nations Security Council's unanimous vote to impose strong sanctions on North Korea in an effort to end the threat and restore stability:  
   "The unanimous vote by the Security Council sends a strong message, not only to North Korea, but to Iran and others that the world is united against such dangerous and provocative acts. The President's leadership and John Bolton's diplomatic expertise fostered this success and they should be commended for their insistence that the international community act, and act quickly. The President was right to call for additional, tough measures. And his decision to have the response to this threat be a multinational response was the right one."
