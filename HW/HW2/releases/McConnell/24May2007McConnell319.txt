SEN. MCCONNELL: KENTUCKY TO GET THREE NEW VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Department of Veterans Affairs plans to open three new community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in Kentucky. Earlier today, McConnell spoke with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson about the clinics, which will be located in Daviess, Grayson, and Madison counties.  
   According to the VA, they will become operational in 2007 and 2008. Local VA officials will keep communities and their veterans informed of progress in the creation of the new CBOCs. 
   "This is exciting news for Kentucky's veterans. These clinics will give veterans greater access to health care and other services by bringing the VA system closer to home," said McConnell. "I appreciate Secretary Nicholson for recognizing the importance of these clinics to the deserving veterans of my home state."
