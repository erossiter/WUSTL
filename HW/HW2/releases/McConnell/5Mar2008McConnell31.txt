SIX ADDITIONAL KENTUCKY COUNTIES ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced Wednesday that Kentuckians in Bath, Harrison, Hopkins, Nicholas, Shelby, and Spencer counties, who were affected by the severe weather on February 5 - 6, 2008, are now eligible to apply for federal disaster assistance. 
   In early February, Senator McConnell contacted President Bush and Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff about the federal disaster declaration. Residents in these additional six counties join the residents in the nine counties that have been previously declared eligible to receive disaster assistance since February 22: Allen, Christian, Fayette, Hardin, Hart, Meade, Mercer, Monroe, and Muhlenberg.
   According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Kentuckians affected by the storm in those counties can apply for assistance online at www.fema.gov or by calling (800) 621-FEMA (3362). For the hearing- and speech-impaired, contact TTY (800) 462-7585.
