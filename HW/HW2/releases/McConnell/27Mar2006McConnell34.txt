SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on immigration reform: 
   "America is a nation of immigrants, but we're also a nation of laws. As a proud spouse of an immigrant, I understand firsthand the value they bring to our society as well as to our economy. My hope is that we can reach consensus on a bill that not only secures our borders, but provides a reasonable guest worker program that does not reward illegal activity."
