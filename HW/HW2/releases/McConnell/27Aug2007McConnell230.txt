  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Monday praising Iraqi leaders for reaching consensus on issues critical to the stability of Iraq: 
   "I welcome the news that Iraqi leaders have taken steps to reach consensus on issues critical to the stability and future governance of Iraq. In the past few weeks we've heard reports from Iraq that our brave troops are succeeding in providing the security that General Petraeus' mission was designed to provide. Iraqi leaders must take this opportunity to make tough decisions like the ones they made yesterday."
