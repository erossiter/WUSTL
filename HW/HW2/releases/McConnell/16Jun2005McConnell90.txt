SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $377 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FY 2006 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests for over $377 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Energy & Water Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate.  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT ($191.3 MILLION) 
   * $105 million for cleanup activities at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This money will be used to fund continued environmental cleanup efforts at the plant. This amount includes additional funds to accelerate the characterization and disposal of scrap metal and low-level waste offsite. 
   * $85.8 million for the construction of DUF6 facilities in Paducah and Portsmouth. In recent years, McConnell authored two federal statutes requiring DOE to build a facility in Paducah to convert 39,000 canisters of hazardous depleted uranium hexaflouride into a more stable compound. On July 27, 2004, DOE began construction on this facility. Construction will create 200 jobs and the plant will have 150 permanent jobs once operational. 
   * $465,000 for Worker Health Monitoring. This funding will be used for continued operation of a mobile health unit that screens current and former workers at the plant for the early signs of lung cancer. The mobile health unit travels between the three gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
   "As the FY'06 appropriations process begins on Capitol Hill, the cleanup of the Paducah plant remains one of my top legislative priorities," said McConnell. "This funding is necessary to keep construction of Paducah's DUF6 conversion facility on track." 
   UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE ($3.9 MILLION) 
   * $1.5 million for the UofL Institute for Advanced Materials. This funding will support high-performance energy systems through basic and applied research in energy-related materials. The Institute will focus on the development of advanced materials that are critical to meeting today's higher energy demands. 
   * $400,000 for the UofL Sustainable Buildings Project. This funding is for a collaborative effort between UofL, Jefferson County Public Schools and the Metro government to prepare plans to incorporate energy, water and waste efficiency technologies into public infrastructure being built or renovated. UofL hopes that its research will help school districts and other public agencies across Kentucky and the nation implement strategies to conserve energy and reduce operating costs. 
   * $2 million for the UofL Grid Computing in Kentucky and its Impact on Research and Education Project. The Grid Computing facility will allow researchers to conduct advanced research by using the combined processing power of idle computers. The project will also allow UofL to conduct distance learning education programs at middle and high schools throughout Kentucky. 
   "The University of Louisville does an outstanding job using its federal funding to research and develop new and exciting technologies that not only benefit Kentucky, but the nation," said McConnell. "I am pleased to have secured this funding for the university, and I will use my seniority on the Senate Appropriations Committee to help keep it in the final bill." 
   U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ($182 MILLION) 
   * $32 million for the Kentucky Lock Project. This funding will be used to double the lock's size to handle the increased tonnage of today's larger barge traffic. 
   * $85 million for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. This funding will be used for the continued construction of a new facility that will replace locks 52 and 53 on the Ohio River. Once complete, this facility will be the largest locking facility in Kentucky in terms of tonnage. 
   * $65 million for the McAlpine Locks and Dam Project, located on the Ohio River. The funding will be used to maintain the construction schedule of an auxiliary lock chamber that will give the McAlpine project twin 1,200 foot locks to allow the facility to handle projected traffic increases. 
   "This funding will be used to make improvements on the Kentucky, Olmsted and McAlpine locks and dam projects, which are necessary due to increasing amounts of barge traffic on our rivers," said McConnell. "Upgrading these locks and dams will also provide significant economic benefits for the entire region." 
   The FY'06 Energy & Water Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
