SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON COOPERATION ON MINIMUM WAGE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement after the bipartisan Senate vote to move ahead on legislation to increase the federal minimum wage and provide tax relief to small business:  
   "At the opening of the 110th Congress, we pledged to proceed in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation, and we are continuing to do just that. We have already begun to fulfill our promise to the American people to tackle tough issues like lobbying reform and an increase in minimum wage. We're going to pass a good minimum wage increase bill because of Republican support and because Republicans insisted on a bipartisan package, not a partisan fight."
