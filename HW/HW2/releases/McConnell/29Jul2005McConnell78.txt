SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES NEARLY $16 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FY 2006 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Senate has approved his requests of nearly $16 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Interior Appropriations Conference Report, now goes to the President for his signature.  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   * $1.5 million for the University of Louisville Lung Biology/Translational Lung Disease Program. The City of Louisville suffers from unusually high levels of ozone. Kentuckians also suffer from high rates of lung disease. Since FY'99 Senator McConnell has secured over $100 million in funding for projects at UofL. "I am pleased to have secured funding for the UofL Lung Disease Program," said McConnell. "The funds will allow students and investigators to research solutions to the growing health problem of lung disease in Kentucky, which will be beneficial for the health of all citizens in the Commonwealth." 
   * $200,000 for land acquisition at the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. This funding will allow for the purchase of land from willing sellers to expand the refuge. Once complete, the refuge will occupy a total of 20,000 acres in Marshall County, Kentucky. Since FY'97 Senator McConnell has secured $13.25 million in funding for the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. "I am pleased to have once again secured funding for the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge," said McConnell. "The wildlife refuge is a popular tourist attraction in Kentucky and this funding will be used to expand the size of the refuge for all to enjoy." 
   * $500,000 for the Calvert City Municipal Wastewater Expansion Project. This funding will be used to begin upgrading the Calvert City wastewater treatment plant. With tremendous growth along the I-24 Corridor and improvements to the collection system, Calvert City now needs to increase the treatment capacity at the wastewater plant from 390,000 gallons per day to 650,000 gallons per day. Since FY'99 Senator McConnell has secured $20.25 million in funding for community water and wastewater improvement projects across Kentucky. "Improving water systems in Kentucky communities is important," said McConnell. "The funds I secured for Calvert City will benefit the entire community and allow for continued economic development and I am glad to be able to help." 
   * $8.4 million from the U.S. Forest Service for management and operation of Land Between the Lakes (LBL). The funding will be used for continued operation of the recreational facility located in western Kentucky. Since FY'97 Senator McConnell has secured $72.1 million in funding for the LBL. "The LBL is a top tourist destination for Kentuckians and non-Kentuckians alike and these funds will help in its continued operation," said McConnell. 
   * $1 million for the South Campbellsville Sewer Line Extension Project. The sewer line extension will serve the South Campbellsville area along KY Hwy 70. This extension will bring sanitary sewer service to 125 existing homes, as well as open another area of Green River Lake to future development. "Current and future residents of South Campbellsville will benefit from this funding because the city will be able to expand sanitary sewer services," said McConnell. 
   * $500,000 for the Western Kentucky University Small Public Water Technology Center. This funding will allow WKU to continue to assist small public water systems across the Commonwealth. Since FY'98 Senator McConnell has secured $3.95 million in funding for this project. "WKU provides a useful service by assisting small public water systems across the Commonwealth and I am pleased to have once again secured funding for this project," said McConnell. 
   * $225,000 for the Western Kentucky University/Mammoth Cave National Park International Center for Science and Learning. This funding will be used to support a WKU-operated center at Mammoth Cave dedicated to environmental studies. "The partnership between WKU and Mammoth Cave is exciting," said McConnell. "The Center will enhance the environmental studies of students from across the region and nationwide." 
   * $250,000 for the Mt. Sterling Methodist Church Historic Restoration Project. This funding will be used to help preserve the historic Mt. Sterling Methodist Church in Montgomery County, Kentucky so that it can be used again by the community. The Church was constructed in 1883 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since FY'00 Senator McConnell has secured $1.525 million in funding for historic preservation projects in Kentucky. "The Mt. Sterling Methodist Church has been a fixture in the community since 1883," said McConnell. "This funding will be used to preserve the Church for future generations to enjoy." 
   * $1.65 million for the Daniel Boone National Forest (DBNF). Of that amount, $750,000 will be used for land acquisition from willing sellers and $900,000 for the Forest Service to continue marijuana eradication operations. The Forest Service works in conjunction with local law enforcement agencies to identify and destroy marijuana plants on or near national forest land. Since FY'98 Senator McConnell has secured $15.287 million in funding for the DBNF. Of that funding, $5 million has been used for counter drug efforts and $10.287 million for land acquisition. "I have had a long-standing interest in securing funds for land acquisition and marijuana eradication operations at the Daniel Boone National Forest," said McConnell. "The Forest Service and local law enforcement agencies do an outstanding job of clearing the Forest of this illegal crop thus making this national treasure safe for all to enjoy." 
   * $1.75 million for the Forest Legacy Knobs State Forest Project. Kentucky recently established a Forest Legacy Program, a national program to protect forest resources and to ensure good forest stewardship. The Commonwealth has identified property in Bullitt County, Kentucky that is ideal for funding under the Forest Legacy Program. This area is quickly becoming a developed residential area and is also adjacent to the 14,000-acre Bernheim Research Forest. Last year, Senator McConnell secured $1.2 million for this project. "This funding, in addition to what I secured last year, will be used to protect the land by the Knobs State Forest from development as well as for the promotion of good forest stewardship," said McConnell. 
   The FY'06 Interior Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
