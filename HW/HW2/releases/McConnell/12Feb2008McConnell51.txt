SEN. MCCONNELL: BIPARTISAN PROTECTION OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday regarding the need to finish the FISA legislation before it expires at the end of the week:  
   "The Senate today will finish the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond bill. 
   "This bill is the product of months of painstaking negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats, and benefitted from the participation of intelligence experts in the Executive Branch. 
   "The overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Intelligence Committee reflected the care, concern and good faith that went into crafting this bill. The final vote was not 15-0, but a vote of 13-2 around here is pretty close. 
   "The Rockefeller-Bond bill contains the two main ingredients that are needed for this bill to be signed into law: it will allow intelligence professionals to do their jobs, and it will not allow trial lawyers to sue the telecommunications companies who may have participated, and according to the Intelligence Committee itself, acted in good faith to help protect the country. 
   "A bill that does not satisfy these two requirements will not become law, nor should it. 
   "Last week was a great example of what we can accomplish when we work with, instead of against, each other. We were able to pass an economic growth package on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis which the President will sign this week. 
   "We have another chance this week to put up a bipartisan win by passing the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond bill-a bill that is critical to protecting the homeland from attack and protecting our forces fighting overseas. 
   "I am confident that, with the help of our friends on the other side of the aisle, we can work through pending amendments, send this over to the House, and then on to the President for his signature this week."
