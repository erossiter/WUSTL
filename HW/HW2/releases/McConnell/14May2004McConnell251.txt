SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NLD'S DECISION TO BOYCOTT UPCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN BURMA
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today in response to the National League for Democracy's (NLD) decision to boycott the May 17th constitutional convention in Burma:  
   "The news this morning that the National League for Democracy will boycott the sham May 17th constitutional convention in Burma is testament to the courage and principles of the NLD and Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 
   "I have no doubt that they made this decision after careful deliberation. The purpose of the convention was to marginalize the NLD and to provide legitimacy to the State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC) repressive rule. Once again, Suu Kyi has taken the moral high ground. 
   "News reports indicate that the United Nationalities Alliance (UNA), which is comprised of eight ethnic-based political parties that ran in the 1990 election, similarly decided that its members will not join the convention. 
   "I fully support the decision of the NLD and the UNA. That the NLD and the ethnic nationalities have remained true to their objectives and convictions comes as no surprise to those us who have observed Burma from afar. 
   "It is past time that the European Union, the United Nations, and Burma's neighbors stand with the people of Burma. They have an opportunity to do so now - by supporting the courageous decision of the NLD - and they must not miss it."
