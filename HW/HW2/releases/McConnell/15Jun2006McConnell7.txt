SEN. MCCONNELL JOINS PRESIDENT BUSH AT SIGNING OF MINER ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell today joined President Bush at the White House for the signing of S. 2803, the MINER Act. Sen. McConnell cosponsored the legislation.  
   "The law the President signed today is a great step towards improving the safety of Kentucky's coal mines," said McConnell. "I was pleased to see the culmination of a lot of hard work on behalf of our miners. Coal mining is a valued tradition and will remain a path to economic opportunity for Kentucky." 
   Earlier today, the Senate passed the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 4939, the Supplemental Appropriations bill. Included in this legislation is $35.6 million for inspection of coal mines and for research to develop new mine safety technology. Senator McConnell voted in favor of the legislation, which now goes to President Bush for his signature.
