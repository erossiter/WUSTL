SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR DANIEL BOONE NATIONAL FOREST
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $1.85 million in funding for the Daniel Boone National Forest.  
 The funding, which is included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   At McConnell's request, the bill designates $1 million for land acquisition and $850,000 for the Forest Service to continue marijuana eradication operations. 
   The Forest Service works in conjunction with the local sheriff's departments, State Police and the Kentucky National Guard to identify and destroy marijuana plants. The eradication program includes both ground and airborne surveillance support to destroy marijuana plants on or near national forest land. 
   "The Daniel Boone National Forest is one of Kentucky's greatest treasures," said McConnell. "The law enforcement agencies and the Kentucky National Guard involved in the drug eradication efforts do an amazing job of clearing the forest of this illegal crop. This is a very successful program and I'm glad to have played a role in securing funds to keep it in operation." 
   Earlier this year, Senator McConnell also secured $3.6 million in the Defense Appropriations bill for the Kentucky National Guard's marijuana eradication program in the Daniel Boone National Forest area. The program will include aerial surveillance support, eradication, and interdiction support. 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
