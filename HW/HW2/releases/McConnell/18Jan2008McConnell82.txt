SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement honoring the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This year the national holiday in honor of Dr. King's birthday will be observed on Monday, January 21. 
   "On Monday we honor a man who dedicated his life to the principle that all men are created equal and who heroically gave his life in defense of this truth. More than half a century has passed since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., began to call our nation back to its original promise, yet the majesty of his words, the power of his conviction, and the courage of his vision continue to inspire. And as long as the battle against discrimination is fought, that legacy will endure. As we remember Dr. King, we recommit ourselves to the battles he fought against all hatred and prejudice. And we recall the words he wrote from an Alabama jail cell forty five years ago, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'"
