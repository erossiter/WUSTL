SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST ATTACKS IN INDONESIA
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the terrorist attacks in Indonesia:  
   "Mr. President, I come to the floor today to condemn the terrorist attacks in Bali this past weekend that murdered over 20 people and injured scores of others. I ask my colleagues to keep the innocent victims of the attacks - and their families and friends - in our thoughts and prayers. 
   "The indiscriminate murder of men, women and children in Bali by suicide bombers underscores the viciousness of ideological extremists. Young men and women wooed to the dark side of religious fanaticism should not be fooled that paradise follows their suicide. At the end of the day, there is only death and destruction. 
   "During these turbulent times, the people of Indonesia should know that they do not stand alone. As we share common principles of freedom and human rights, the world's democracies stand with you. I encourage President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to let America and other nations know how best we can help in the aftermath of the attacks - and what assistance we can provide to counter terrorism in Indonesia. In the war against terrorism, your struggle is our struggle. 
   "Mr. President, let me close by saying that like the Bali bombings in October 2002, the ripple from this weekend's attacks are felt on the shores of all free nations. Indonesia does not stand alone."
