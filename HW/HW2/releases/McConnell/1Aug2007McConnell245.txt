PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNS SEN. MCCONNELL'S BURMA SANCTIONS LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced Wednesday that President Bush signed into law his legislation renewing sanctions against the Burmese government. 
   "I appreciate the President's support of this important legislation. By signing the bill, he sends a strong message that the United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Burma in their struggle for freedom and democracy."
   BACKGROUND:
   The bill, cosponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), calls for the renewal of sanctions against the Burmese junta, which include an import ban on Burmese goods entering the U.S. and visa restrictions on officials from the regime - the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).
   The legislation maintains sanctions on the regime until changes are taken by the SPDC - changes that include taking concrete, irreversible steps toward reconciliation and democratization, such as the full, unfettered participation of the National League for Democracy and ethnic minorities in the political affairs of the country; ending attacks on ethnic minorities; and securing the immediate, unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
   The bill passed the Senate on July 24, 2007.
