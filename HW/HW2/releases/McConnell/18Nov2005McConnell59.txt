SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $13 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR TRANSIT PROJECTS IN KENTUCKY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his requests for over $13 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary and HUD Appropriations Conference Report, now goes to the President for his signature.  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   Paducah ($7.5 million) 
   * $5.3 million for the Paducah Waterfront Development Project. The funds will be used to make improvements to Paducah's riverfront area. Local officials envision a comprehensive project that will include a public docking facility, a marina and green space. 
   * $1.1 million for the Paducah Area Transit System. The funds will be used for the purchase of passenger buses and handicapped-accessible vans. 
   * $1.1 million for runway improvements at the Barkley Regional Airport. The Barkley Regional Airport is the fourth largest commercial airport in Kentucky. The funds requested will go towards taxiway and runway improvements at the Airport. 
   "I am pleased to have secured the funding for Paducah," said McConnell. "This money will be used to improve the city's transportation infrastructure and develop the waterfront. Kentucky's riverfront makes up a common neighborhood for everyone in the community to share. It is a significant part of Kentucky's landscape." 
   Fort Campbell ($2.7 million) 
   * $1.6 million for the Fort Campbell Force Protection Barrier Project. Funds will be used to construct concrete wall sections along portions of US 41A which will provide noise protection and privacy for post housing. 
   * $1.1 million for the Fort Campbell Variable Message Boards. The funds will be used for the installation of variable message boards along main highway approaches to Fort Campbell. The boards will enable the base to advise the public of gate closures and give special event instructions or direct traffic to underused gates. 
   "Fort Campbell is a premiere military installation and I am pleased to have secured this funding which will improve the quality of life for our military men and women stationed at the base and those living in the surrounding communities," said McConnell. 
   Additional Kentucky Projects ($2.85 million) 
   * $1.5 million for the E-Caven Project. The E-Cavern project is a partnership between E-Cavern, the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky. The universities will use the funding to research and develop solutions to protect our nation's critical financial data. The project will be housed in a three million square foot limestone cavern under the city of Louisville. 
   * $1 million for the Morgan County Bridges Improvement Project. In Morgan County, there are 15 bridges in various locations in desperate need of maintenance and repair. Many of the nearly 14,000 residents of the County live dispersed along small country roads. Ensuring that these bridges are properly maintained helps Morgan County residents travel to work, schools, and throughout the community. 
   * $350,000 for the Foothills Community Action transit project. Foothills Express serves as a human services transportation broker for Kentucky and provides transit and brokerage services in eight counties in Kentucky. Funds will be used to help expand services by implementing a fixed-route service in Madison County, Kentucky, installing automated vehicle locators and mobile data terminals on vehicles, and purchasing paratransit service vehicles. 
   The FY'06 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary and HUD Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
