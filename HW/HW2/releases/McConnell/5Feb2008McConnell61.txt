DEMOCRATS OBJECT TO REPUBLICAN COMPROMISE
  In an attempt to speed passage of the economic growth package, U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday proposed a compromise that would have allowed the Senate to vote Wednesday on the Senate Democrat package, followed by an amendment to the House bill that would have ensured that seniors and disabled veterans receive a rebate check. The McConnell-Stevens amendment also ensured that immigrants who have entered the country illegally would not receive rebate checks. Majority Leader Reid objected to the request.  
   "We can pass this legislation quickly, while ensuring that low-income seniors and disabled veterans are included in the economic growth, but those here illegally do not," McConnell said. "Rather than working with us to finish this legislation quickly, the majority objected. Rather than finishing the bill today, the majority objected." 
   The McConnell-Stevens amendment would: 
   Exclude illegal aliens from receiving rebate checks 
   Allow seniors and disabled veterans to qualify for the rebate checks by counting Social Security benefits and VA disability payments towards the $3,000 earned income test.
