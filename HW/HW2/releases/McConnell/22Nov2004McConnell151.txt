SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR ROAD PROJECTS NEAR FORT CAMPBELL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $3 million in funding for road projects near Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and secured the following funding: 
   * $2 million to widen Cole Road near Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Senator McConnell secured these funds to widen Cole Road, the primary commercial vehicle access route to Fort Campbell. 
   * $1 million to widen KY 911 and KY 115 near Fort Campbell, Kentucky. These funds will be used to widen KY 911 and KY 115, which serve as alternative routes for convoy access to the deployment route from Fort Campbell. Senator McConnell previously earmarked $2.25 million to improve the intersection of KY 911 and KY 115 in earlier appropriations bills. 
   "Expanding the capacity of these roads will improve the installation's deployment route and improve access to the Fort for soldiers, civilians and family members," said McConnell. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
