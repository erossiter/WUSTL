SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HICKMAN-FULTON COUNTY RIVERPORT AUTHORITY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Department of Homeland Security has approved a grant of $90,000 for the Hickman-Fulton County Riverport Authority.  
 The money will be used to enhance security at the Hickman Port. 
   The grant will allow the Hickman-Fulton County Riverport Authority to install a fence around the perimeter of the facility, add lights to illuminate restricted access areas and purchase emergency power generators. The Authority also would like to implement an identification badge system for employees, vendors, repair technicians and visitors. 
   Earlier this year, Senator McConnell wrote a letter of support for this funding to the Acting Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. 
   "I am pleased the Department of Homeland Security agreed with me in recognizing the importance of this project," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will help the Hickman-Fulton County Riverport Authority increase its overall port security."
