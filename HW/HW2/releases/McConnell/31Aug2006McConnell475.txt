SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TO AMERICAN LEGION
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the President's speech to the American Legion and the need to provide every legal tool to fight a global enemy:  
   "Despite the terrorist threat facing America and our allies, too many critics forget that we are a nation at war. It may be that memories have faded since we have not been attacked at home over the past five years, but the threat is no less real, and will not lessen by pretending it doesn't exist. 
   The men and women who defend our nation around the world must have every legal tool available to them to fight this global enemy. Sadly, the issue is still a matter of some debate in the Congress: some bragged that they 'killed' the Patriot Act; others cheered a recent court decision that would remove the President's ability to catch terrorists when they are still in the planning stages. 
   But we will have the opportunity in September to debate and pass legislation ensuring that all necessary tools are available in the fight against terror. I welcome that debate. America must have and aggressively use every tool at our disposal in order to protect our citizens, and the Congress must continue to provide those tools. To do any less would be a dereliction of duty."
