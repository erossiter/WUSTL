SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $8.75 MILLION FOR NORTHERN REGION OF KENTUCKY
  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen.  
 McConnell has secured funding for important projects throughout Kentucky. This year he is proud to announce he brought home $8.75 million for the northern part of Kentucky. 
   The following is the funding Senator McConnell obtained for this region of the state in the FY'05 Budget: 
   * $650,000 for the NKU Digital Science Center. NKU is working with UofL to establish a Digital Science Center and Stellar Command Center to teach astronomy and geology to college students and to increase interest in these sciences among elementary and secondary school students. Funds in FY'05 will be used to expand on this project by taking a hands-on astronomy program to schools through mobile and transportable units. 
   * $500,000 for the NKU Institute for New Economy Technologies (iNET). Senator McConnell secured these funds to help NKU develop the infrastructure necessary to equip students to work in a new economy based on technology, hardware and software, and communications systems, rather than the traditional industrial and manufacturing industries. The University will use these funds to train faculty, develop new coursework, and implement technology-rich teaching environments. 
   * $5.3 million for development of the Army's Rapid Fuel Transfer System by KECO Industries in Florence. The funding will be use to support research and testing of a new bulk fuel transfer system that will reduce the time it takes the U.S. Army to deploy existing fuel lines. 
   * $2.3 million for production of a Weapons Shot Counter for the Special Operations Command by Accu-Counter in Kenton County. The funding will be used to enhance the ability of the Special Ops Forces to gauge the wear and reliability of their weapons.
