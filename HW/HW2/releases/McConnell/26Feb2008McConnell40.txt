SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON TROOP FUNDING CUT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday opposing the Feingold bill to cut off funding for our troops in the field:  
   "This afternoon we will indulge in a little bit of nostalgia with another vote on the Feingold bill to cut off funds for the troops in Iraq. 
   "I don't know what our friends on the other side expect to accomplish with this, but if past experience is any guide, we already know the final outcome. 
   "Last May, 67 of us voted against a proposal to cut off funds for troops in the field. 
   "Four months later, 70 senators voted against it again. 
   "Two weeks after that, 68 senators voted against it for a third time. 
   "And in December, 71 of us, nearly three fourths of the Senate, voted 'No' once again to cutting off funds for troops in the field. 
   "So the outcome of the final vote on the Feingold bill is obvious: the U.S. Senate is on record not once but four times that it will not cut off funds while our troops are in the field. All the more so will we oppose it when the fight in Iraq, by all accounts, is showing clear-cut tactical progress, and now, at last, some important political progress is also being made. 
   "But this bill does give us an opportunity - an opportunity to step back and highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in Iraq since the first time our friends proposed cutting off funds last May. 
   "It gives us a chance to highlight why we were wise to reject it even when the outcome in Iraq was unclear - much less when progress is being made. 
   "Two months ahead of another visit by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, we should acknowledge the heroic sacrifices of our men and women in uniform and the important turnaround they've achieved in Iraq on behalf of the American people, the brave Iraqis who have stood with them, and our nation's long term security."
