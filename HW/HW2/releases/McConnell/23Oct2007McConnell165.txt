SEN. MCCONNELL'S REQUESTS OF $15.2 MILLION FOR KENTUCKY UNIVERSITIES PASSES SENATE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that the Senate has approved his requests of $15.2 million in funding for several Kentucky universities. The money is included in the FY'08 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, which now goes to the House/Senate Conference Committee for consideration. 
   "Kentucky universities are some of the leading research institutions in the country," McConnell said. "This funding will help our universities address pressing health issues, like cardiovascular disease and access to care in rural areas. These resources will also strengthen the academic programs offered by our universities; helping to ensure that Kentucky's best and brightest can get a world class education here in the Commonwealth."
   McConnell, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for the following Kentucky projects:
   * $10.75 million to upgrade medical research facilities at the University of Louisville. These funds will be used to ensure that UofL's facilities and equipment remain on the cutting edge of biomedical research - including the university's world renowned cardiovascular programs.
   * $1.5 million for the University of Kentucky Research Foundation. The funding will be used to upgrade UK's connection to the National High Speed Grid. University of Kentucky researchers are using the grid to support health care delivery and education throughout Kentucky and across the nation. This funding will allow researchers to use high-tech connections for clinical and biomedical research at UK and several central and eastern Kentucky hospitals, including the College of Osteopathic Medicine in Pikeville
   * $500,000 for the Kentucky Oral Health Initiative at the University of Kentucky. These funds will allow UK, and its partners in Madisonville, Morehead and Hazard, to continue its work to improve oral health care for disadvantaged populations across the state. UK researchers are also studying the link between oral health and other serious health issues, such as neonatal development and cardiovascular risk.
   * $1.5 million to purchase equipment for the Western Kentucky Science Building. WKU is building a new science building and renovating existing space on the campus to create a new science, technology and engineering facility. This funding will be used to ensure this facility includes state-of-the-art equipment and information technology for Western's students and researchers.
   * $500,000 for the Western Kentucky University Mobile Health Screening Unit. This funding will be used to equip the mobile health unit with technology to communicate directly with primary care physicians by an interactive, live remote. Since McConnell first secured funding for the program in 2001, WKU has operated a successful mobile health screening program which provides primary care services to people living in rural south central Kentucky. This funding will help medical professionals in the unit get quicker test results, which can be communicated to patients while they are still in the mobile health unit.
   $500,000 for the Northern Kentucky University's Infrastructure Management Institute. Northern Kentucky University will use these funds to continue its work to train students to better understand the needs of future employers. These students will work to develop solutions for technology management issues facing businesses and industries across the country.
