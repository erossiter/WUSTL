SEN. MCCONNELL URGES PASSAGE OF SEN. GREGG AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement regarding Sen. Judd Gregg's commonsense amendment, "A Second Look at Wasteful Spending:" 
   "Americans are watching and we are committed to ensuring that this commonsense reform gets the vote it deserves. Last week the Senate demonstrated we are serious about lobbying reform and I believe we can do the same for fiscal discipline. I call on my colleagues to take this opportunity to pass this sound measure to reduce wasteful spending.
   "Fiscal responsibility is not just an election-day issue. If we are serious about reform, we must take the steps necessary to connect fiscal rhetoric with fiscal reality. The commonsense reform offered by Sen. Gregg is an opportunity to do that - it deserves a vote."
   McConnell is a co-sponsor of the Gregg amendment, which gives the President the opportunity to veto wasteful spending and use the savings for deficit reduction.
