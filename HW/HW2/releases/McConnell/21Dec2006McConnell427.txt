SEN. MCCONNELL ANTI-TERROR BILL SIGNED INTO LAW
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader-Elect Mitch McConnell released the following statement Thursday after the President signed the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006:  
   "This bipartisan legislation makes it clear that the Palestinian Authority can expect no U.S. assistance so long as it continues to be led by an unreconstructed terrorist organization. The Palestinian people are ill-served by a Hamas-led government that refuses to work toward the betterment of its citizens by failing to renounce terror and work toward peace with Israel." 
   McConnell introduced the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act in March; it passed the Senate on June 23, 2006 and the House on December 7. 
   The legislation restricts assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) unless the Hamas-led PA publicly acknowledges Israel's right to exist, recommits itself to all its prior agreements with Israel, makes progress toward dismantling terrorist infrastructure, and institutes fiscal transparency.
