SEN. MCCONNELL CALLS ON SENATE TO SUPPORT MEDICAL CARE ACCESS PROTECTION ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell delivered a Senate floor speech today in support of the Medical Care Access Protection Act, which protects a woman's access to important health care.  
   During the speech, McConnell said the legislation "allows a patient to be fairly compensated, while placing badly needed limits on often out-of-control damage awards. It is time for the Senate to address this crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support it." 
   Senator McConnell highlighted the impact the medical liability crisis has had on Kentucky. Currently, 66 of Kentucky's 120 counties have no OB/GYN's, which forces many Kentucky mothers to travel long distances to reach hospitals that deliver babies. 
   The Kentucky Medical Association reviewed state and hospital records and found that only 426 doctors in Kentucky delivered babies last year in Kentucky - down 79 doctors from the year before. Expectant mothers that are deemed "high risk" face further difficulty because nearly one-third of Kentucky's OB/GYN's - 31 percent - have limited the number they will see, for liability reasons. 
   "Kentucky is facing a medical liability crisis," said Senator McConnell. "Fewer OB/GYN's are practicing in the Commonwealth because of the high premiums they are made to pay which in turn has forced women to make tough choices about their medical care." 
   The Medical Care Access Protection Act allows patients to recover 100 percent of their economic damages. This can include hospital bills, lost wages, therapy and rehabilitation costs, and a wide variety of additional expenses a victim might incur. It also includes a tiered cap on non-economic damages that could allow a patient to recover as much as $750,000.
