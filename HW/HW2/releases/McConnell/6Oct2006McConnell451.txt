DESPITE DIRE DEMOCRAT PREDICTION, DEFICIT SHRINKS AGAIN
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding a sharp decrease in the deficit, and highlighted that tax relief led to increased economic growth and millions of new jobs. He noted that despite the benefits of the tax relief, the senior Democrat on the tax-writing panel said in a recent interview that he 'cannot think of one' of the Republican tax cuts that should be renewed:  
   "When we enacted significant tax relief for all taxpayers, the Democrat leadership fought us and predicted growing deficits and economic ruin. But tax relief is doing exactly what we said it would do. Since we passed the President's tax relief package, millions of new jobs have been created, the economy has undergone significant growth, and now the deficit is shrinking faster than anyone could have predicted. 
   "Tax relief works. Those who promote heaping new taxes on families and businesses don't seem to understand that. But the economy, and millions of people in newly created jobs, do."
