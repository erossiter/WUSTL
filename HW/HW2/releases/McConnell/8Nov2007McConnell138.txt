JUDGE MUKASEY CONFIRMED AS U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement after a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to confirm Judge Michael Mukasey to serve as the 81st Attorney General of the United States:  
    "Tonight, a clear bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Judge Mukasey because he is one of the most qualified candidates ever nominated to the position of Attorney General. This support stands in stark contrast to the partisan politics that delayed this vote for seven weeks, and ends a sorry chapter in the history of the Senate confirmation process. 
   "It is my hope that our colleagues across the aisle can now put the campaign aside and work together with Judge Mukasey on our common goals for the Department of Justice." 
   Judge Mukasey was confirmed by a vote of 53-40.
