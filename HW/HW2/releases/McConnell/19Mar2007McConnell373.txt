SEN. MCCONNELL: 'WE MUST NOT SUCCUMB TO THE POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY OF THE EASY WAY OUT'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Monday on Iraq and the broader war on terror.  
   "This is the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq, but some forget that we are now in our sixth year without a terrorist attack here at home. That is no accident, no quirk of fate. Yet there are some who still don't comprehend the importance of America's role - and the importance of prevailing in this long struggle - in Iraq and the broader war on terror, and against those who would bring it to our shores. 
   "The War on Terror continues, and the central front is Iraq. This is what the terrorists themselves have said. Al Qaeda's hope is to force a withdrawal of U.S. troops. That would be a victory for al Qaeda and a nightmare for the Iraqis. For the sake of the Iraqi people, the stability of the region, and the security of America and our allies, we must not retreat from this fight; we must not succumb to the political expediency of the easy way out."
