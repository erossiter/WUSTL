SENATE PASSES SEN. MCCONNELL RESOLUTION CONDEMNING MILITARY JUNTA IN BURMA FOR ITS DETENTION OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday following passage of his resolution condemning the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma for its continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.  
   "Passage of this resolution reflects the Senate's grave concern about the deteriorating situation in Burma, and it tells those living there that the American people have not forgotten about them. We are committed to keeping the pressure on this dictatorial regime, continuing to call for an end to attacks against ethnic minorities, and promoting democracy and reconciliation in Burma. 
   "Additionally, Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners must be immediately and unconditionally released. The Nobel Peace Prize winner has dedicated her life to the peaceful, non-violent movement for democracy and reconciliation in Burma, and the U.S. Senate strongly supports her." 
   The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), John McCain (R-AZ), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Richard Lugar (R-IN), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC).
