   "I've spoken with Dr. John Barrasso and hope to have him in the Senate as early as Monday. His energy, combined with the excellent staff that served Sen. Thomas so well over many years will allow him to get started right away, in what will be a busy legislative session." 
   Over the next week, Barrasso will receive orientation from the Secretary of the Senate, Senate disbursing office, Sergeant-at-Arms as well and other administrative, security and legislative offices.
