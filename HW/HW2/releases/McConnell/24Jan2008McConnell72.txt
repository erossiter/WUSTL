SEN. MCCONNELL: WE CAN AND SHOULD PASS FISA BILL BY FEB. 1ST
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor Thursday regarding the need to pass FISA reform by February 1:  
   "We may only be a few days into the session, but it's not too early to note a change in tone from last January. Talks are moving forward on an economic growth package, and there's good reason to expect an important national security achievement on FISA by next week. 
   "I had hoped that we would move to FISA first, since nothing could be more urgent than protecting this vital national security tool before its expiration on Feb. 1. Our first duty is to protect Americans from harm, and we know for a fact this law has helped us detect and disrupt terrorist plots. It would be grossly irresponsible for Congress to weaken it or let it lapse. And the notion that some in Congress would even consider filibustering this vital anti-terror tool is difficult to comprehend. 
   "Fortunately, common sense seems to have prevailed. I was encouraged to see that my good friend the Majority Leader believes we can pass a FISA bill with sufficient time to get it signed before it expires. And I was very pleased to see that the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee believes the bipartisan version reported out of his committee last fall will be the one we ultimately pass by Feb.1. This is good news not only because the Intelligence Committee's version is the best, but with some modification is also the only one the President will sign. 
   "We've put this off long enough. Let's pass this bill, and protect this vital tool before it expires."
