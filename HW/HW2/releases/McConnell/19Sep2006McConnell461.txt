BRINGING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE ACT: NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, PROGRAM MUST AS WELL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding progress on the Bringing Terrorists to Justice Act:  
   "Since 9-11, our security forces have captured and interrogated known terrorist killers and extracted information on past and future attacks that has been critical to saving American lives. We need to remember there have been no terrorist attacks on our homeland since 9-11 and that is in part due to these interrogations. In light of the Hamdan decision, Congress must ensure that this program can continue. 
   "While we continue to negotiate the specific language, it is important to note that the President and Congressional Republicans agree on the bottom line: that the terrorist interrogation program can go forward."
