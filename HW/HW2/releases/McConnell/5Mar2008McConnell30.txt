SEN. MCCONNELL: 'WE WANT TO EXPAND THE FAMILY BUDGET, NOT THE FEDERAL BUDGET'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Wednesday regarding the release of Democrats' budget which increases spending and raises taxes: 
   "Budget week is the time of year when priorities are made clear, and the priorities of the Democrats are raising taxes on American families, more wasteful Washington spending and more budget gimmicks to mask how big they want the government to grow. 
   "Republicans have different priorities. We want to expand the family budget, not the federal budget."
