SEN. MCCONNELL ATTENDS GROUNDBREAKING FOR DUF6 CONVERSION PLANT IN PADUCAH
  Sen. Mitch McConnell today attended the groundbreaking for the DUF6 conversion facility in Paducah, Kentucky.  
   On July 15, 1998, Sen. McConnell introduced the first legislation calling for the creation of the plant. On July 17, 1998, the Senate passed McConnell's legislation, shortly thereafter, Rep. Ed Whitfield helped secure quick passage in the House, and on July 21, 1998, the bill was signed into law. 
   In 2002, McConnell introduced and secured passage of legislation to ensure that construction of this facility would begin in Paducah by July 31, 2004. 
   "For the past fifty years, the men and women of this community worked - frequently at risk to their own health - to produce the energy our nation needed to remain prosperous and free," said McConnell. 
   "Today, this community faces important new challenges. The first is addressing the environmental legacy of the gaseous diffusion plant in a way that protects the community and eventually allows the facility to be reused. The second, and perhaps more important challenge, is attracting new jobs to the region." 
   "This groundbreaking represents an important milestone in addressing both challenges," said McConnell. "While it's entirely appropriate that we celebrate this milestone, we must also recognize that much remains to be done." 
   "Now that we have broken ground, we must ensure that construction continues until the plant is built and every canister of waste is safely disposed of. We must also ensure that cleanup continues in other areas of the plant - cleaning up the scrap-yards, safeguarding the groundwater and ensuring that the facility and community are safe for future use."
