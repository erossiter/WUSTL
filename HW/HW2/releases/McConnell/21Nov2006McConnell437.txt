SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DOD DECISION ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS DISPOSAL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the decision by the Department of Defense to delay the disposal of its chemical weapons stockpile:  
   "I'm disappointed to see that the Department of Defense is again backsliding on its commitment to the Richmond community. Why they would approve these future-year budget projections is truly difficult to understand. They would subject the people living near the Blue Grass Army Depot to the dangers of chemical weapons until well into the 2020s. I am going to continue to lead the fight to ensure that these heinous weapons are disposed of in a safe and timely manner."
