SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONCLUSION OF BURMESE REGIME'S 'NATIONAL CONVENTION'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Wednesday on the Burmese Regime's "National Convention" which concluded earlier this week:  
   "The conclusion of the 'National Convention' in Burma has closed the curtain on an event that was a farce from the very beginning. The process could in no way be legitimate due to the exclusion of the National League for Democracy and the simultaneous oppression of ethnic minorities and peaceful activists. The State Peace and Development Council needs to halt its vicious crackdown on nonviolent protesters and permit the people of Burma to engage meaningfully in a democratic reconciliation process."
