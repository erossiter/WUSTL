SEN. MCCONNELL CALLS FOR FULL CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS ON IMMIGRATION BILL
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following statement on the Senate floor Monday on the comprehensive immigration bill:  
   "As the Majority Leader indicated, we are in the middle of a big, challenging contentious issue. 
   "There are many amendments pending. In fact, over 80 filed at the desk. A lot of work has been done over the recess in terms of some of those amendments. It is my hope that some of them can be disposed of without roll call votes. It is also my hope that during the day's session the managers will be prepared to set up votes on the pending amendments so we can make progress on the bill tomorrow. 
   "This is a very significant piece of legislation, as we all know. We need to have maximum opportunity for the largest number of amendments to be considered before we entertain the notion of shutting down debate on this important measure. 
   "It's quite possibly the most significant measure we will be dealing with this Congress and we need to make sure that all Senators feel they have had an opportunity to offer their amendments and that those amendments have had a shot at being considered. 
   "So I would encourage people on both sides of the aisle to come on over. Let's make sure we have plenty of amendments in the queue and can have a full day working on this bill beginning tomorrow."
