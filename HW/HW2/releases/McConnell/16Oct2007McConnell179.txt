BAN ON INTERNET TAX SHOULD BE MADE PERMANENT
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican Whip Trent Lott, Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Ranking Member Ted Stevens, and Senator John Sununu (R-N.H.), held a press conference Tuesday urging a vote to make the internet tax moratorium permanent before the moratorium's November 1st expiration date.  
   "It is the view of the group of us, led by Senator Sununu. that we should have a permanent ban on taxation of the internet," Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said today. 
   Senator Sununu along with 6 cosponsors recently introduced S. 2128, The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007. The bill has been placed on the Senate calendar. 
   "We've got an obligation to act," said Senator Sununu. "All we want is an opportunity to debate and vote on the issue. A bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives supports making this a permanent ban on internet taxation. A filibuster-proof majority of the United States Senate supports making it permanent." 
   Republican Senators are urging swift action to bring an up-or-down vote on making the internet tax moratorium permanent before its looming expiration date. "It would be my goal to get a vote on permanency before the expiration on November 1st," said Leader McConnell.
