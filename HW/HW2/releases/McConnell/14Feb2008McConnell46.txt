PUTTING NATION AT RISK BY FAILING TO ACT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the apparent decision by the House Democratic leadership to allow the Protect America Act to expire, putting the nation at great risk:  
   "This critical national security legislation has wide bipartisan support in the Senate, bipartisan majority support in the House, and will ensure that surveillance of terrorists can continue. The Senate passed it by a 68-29 margin, but the House Democratic leadership refuses to even bring it to a vote-preferring to let it expire instead. 
   "We must not leave our nation at greater risk, but if the House leaves town without providing the tools we need to keep our country safe, that's exactly what they will have done."
