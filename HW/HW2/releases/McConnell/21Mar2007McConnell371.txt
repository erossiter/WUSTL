MYSTERY SOLVED: DEMOCRATS ADMIT BUDGET CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF TAX HIKES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement on Wednesday after Senate Democrats conceded their proposed budget does, in fact, contain massive tax hikes:  
   "Senate Democrats have finally admitted that refusing to extend tax relief hits your wallet in the same way as any other tax hike. The good news is that the Democrats admit they have a tax problem here and tried to address it. The bad news is that the tax hike is still three times larger than the previous tax hike record - a whopping $736 billion. 
   "Republicans said at the beginning of the session we would not support tax hikes for hardworking Americans. The Democrats' recent tax hike admission does not begin to address the tax squeeze that America's workforce will feel if this budget is passed as is. We certainly can't support what amounts to a tripling of the biggest one in American history."
