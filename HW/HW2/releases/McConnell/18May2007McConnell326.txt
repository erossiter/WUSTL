SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONTINUATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO BURMA
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on President Bush's notification to Congress of his intent to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma and the associated sanctions: 
   "President Bush's decision to continue the national emergency regarding Burma sends a strong message to the ruling junta that their actions will not be tolerated by the U.S. government. It also comes at a time when the unelected Burmese government has decided to enter into a deal with Russia to build a nuclear-research reactor."
