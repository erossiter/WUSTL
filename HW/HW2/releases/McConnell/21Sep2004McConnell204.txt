SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CUMBERLAND GAP NATIONAL PARK
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $1 million in funding for the Cumberland Gap National Park to expand its boundaries to include Fern Lake.  
 The funding, which is included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   Fern Lake is located just southeast of Middlesboro, Kentucky and serves as the primary water source for the community. The owner of Fern Lake has decided to sell approximately 750 acres of land, including 150 acres that comprise the lake. As a result, Congress recently passed legislation that Senator McConnell sponsored in cooperation with Congressman Hal Rogers that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire Fern Lake and the surrounding watershed. 
   "Fern Lake is a beautiful and pristine body of water that would be best protected by the management of the National Park Service," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the Cumberland Gap National Park to purchase the lake and protect its beauty and exceptional water quality for future generations." 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
