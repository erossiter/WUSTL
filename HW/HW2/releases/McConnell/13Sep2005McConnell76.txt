SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF TATENHOVE TO FEDERAL BENCH IN KENTUCKY'S EASTERN DISTRICT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today following President George W. Bush's nomination of Gregory F. Van Tatenhove to the federal bench in the Eastern District of Kentucky.  
   "I am delighted that President Bush has nominated Greg Van Tatenhove to the federal bench in the Eastern District of Kentucky," said Senator McConnell. "I have known Greg for a number of years and am confident that he will serve the citizens of Kentucky with distinction. Greg is an intelligent and thoughtful individual who has a temperament that will serve him and the bench well." 
   Van Tatenhove, a graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law, has served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky since 2001. From 1994-2001 he was Chief of Staff and Legal Counsel to Representative Ron Lewis. 
   Prior to his work with Representative Lewis, Van Tatenhove participated in the Attorney General's Honors Program as a trial attorney in the Federal Programs Branch of the Civil Division. He spent nearly fours years litigating on behalf of the government in federal courts around the country. He was one of eleven lawyers chosen nationwide by the Federal Programs Branch to participate in this program. 
   Van Tatenhove also clerked for the Honorable Eugene E. Siler, Jr., when Judge Siler was the Chief Judge of the United States Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Van Tatenhove also served as a legislative assistant for Senator McConnell prior to law school. 
   "I also want to thank Greg's wife, Jane, and his two children, Cooper and Catherine, for supporting him in this new endeavor."
