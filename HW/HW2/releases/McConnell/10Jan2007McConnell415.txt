A NEW STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN IRAQ
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement regarding President George W. Bush's speech on a revised U.S. strategy for victory in Iraq:  
   "We know with certainty that a precipitous, hasty withdrawal guarantees a strategic failure in Iraq and across the region. We are not the only ones concerned with instability in Iraq; our allies in the war on terror, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Kuwaitis and the Israelis would all be threatened by an American withdrawal. 
   "The President should be commended for adapting to the reality on the ground in Iraq, and although the new plan is not without risk, it provides the best chance for helping the Iraqi people form a country that can defend itself and is an ally in the war on terror. 
   "We have given the Iraqis the best chance for success, and we have given them the best of America. They must now choose to help themselves by reconciling political differences, and putting down sectarian militias. The Commander in Chief deserves our support as the military adapts its strategy and tactics. War is inherently risky, but a hasty withdrawal guarantees defeat."
