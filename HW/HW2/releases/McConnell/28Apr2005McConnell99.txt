SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON FAIRNESS RULE FOR JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today in support of the Fairness Rule for judicial nominations, which was proposed by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist: 
   "I applaud Senator Frist's leadership to return the Senate to the way it has operated for 214 years. Judges deserve a simple up-or-down vote - no matter who the President is - and I encourage my Democrat colleagues to support the Fairness Rule."
