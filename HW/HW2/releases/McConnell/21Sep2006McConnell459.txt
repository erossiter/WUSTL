CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE FROM OFFICE OF SEN. MCCONNELL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding progress on the Bringing Terrorists to Justice Act: 
   "The President was very clear that any legislation on terrorist detainees must ensure that our intelligence-gathering interrogation program can continue. As the President said, this valuable program has saved innocent American lives and is preventing future terrorist attacks. The legislation we will soon consider on the Senate floor meets the President's criteria. This is a big win in the continuing war on terror."
