SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Monday on the President's FY'09 budget:  
   "The President proposed pro-growth policies aligned with our long-term economic goals. The best way to ensure lasting health for the U.S. economy is to keep taxes low and spending in check so that U.S. businesses remain competitive and American families have more to invest. 
   "It now falls to Congress to fully and fairly consider this budget proposal. As we do, we must ensure the priorities of balanced budgets, lasting tax relief for American workers and job creators, continued security, and sustained prosperity are protected. The Senate must take care not to undo the economic expansion policies contained in the proposed growth package by increasing the size of government instead of the size of the economy. 
   "While this is only the first step in the budget process, I will work with the delegation to ensure that essential Kentucky priorities are protected in the final budget."
