SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S FISCAL YEAR '07 BUDGET
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on President Bush's FY'07 budget:
   "I applaud President Bush for delivering a budget that not only funds our nation's priorities and restrains federal spending, but continues the pro-growth policies that have kept America's economy strong. While this is only the first step in the budget process, I will work with the delegation to ensure that essential Kentucky priorities are protected in the final budget."
