SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $16 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FISCAL '07 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests for over $16 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'07 Interior Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky:  
   * $1.5 million for the University of Louisville Lung Biology/Translational Lung Disease Program. The City of Louisville suffers from unusually high levels of ozone. Kentuckians also suffer from high rates of lung disease. "The University of Louisville's research in respiratory medicine is beneficial for all Kentuckians," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will allow scientists to continue to better understand the basis of lung diseases and to formulate solutions to this growing health problem." 
   * $450,000 for the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. Of that amount, $250,000 will be used for land acquisition from willing sellers and $200,000 for the construction of environmental education shelters. "This funding will allow for the refuge to expand with the purchase of land from willing sellers," said Senator McConnell. "It will also be used for the construction of shelters to accommodate environmental education activities." 
   * $8.3 million from the U.S. Forest Service for management and operation of Land Between the Lakes (LBL). The funding will be used for continued operation of the recreational facility located in western Kentucky. "The LBL remains one of Kentucky's top tourist destinations and this funding will help with its continued operation," said Senator McConnell. 
   * $500,000 for the Western Kentucky University Small Public Water Technology Center. "WKU provides important support for small public water systems across the Commonwealth, and I am pleased to have again secured funding for this project" said Senator McConnell. 
   * $250,000 for the Western Kentucky University/Mammoth Cave National Park International Center for Science and Learning. "The partnership between WKU and Mammoth Cave is enhancing the environmental studies of students from across the region and nationwide," said Senator McConnell. "This funding is important because it will be used for the continued operation of the Center." 
   * $2.05 million for the Daniel Boone National Forest. Of that amount, $750,000 will be used for land acquisition from willing sellers and $1.3 million for the Forest Service to continue marijuana eradication operations. The Forest Service works in conjunction with local law enforcement agencies to identify and destroy marijuana plants on or near national forest land. "The Daniel Boone National Forest is a national treasure and needs to be preserved," said Senator McConnell. "I am pleased to have once again secured funds for the Forest that will be used for land acquisition and the successful marijuana eradication operations." 
   * $1 million for the Green River Valley Water District project in Hart County. "This funding will help Hart County expand its water services to meet the growing needs of the citizens," said Senator McConnell. 
   * $600,000 for improvements to the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in LaRue County, Kentucky. Funds will be used to make improvements to the Abraham Lincoln Boyhood Home at Knob Creek which is a part of the National Historic Site. "Kentucky is proud to be the birthplace of one of our nation's greatest leaders, President Abraham Lincoln," said Senator McConnell. "With the bicentennial of his birth approaching in 2008, these funds will be used for the preservation of his birthplace in LaRue County." 
   * $180,000 for the historic preservation of the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington. "It is important that we maintain the Commonwealth's rich history," said Senator McConnell. "The Kentucky Theatre in Lexington is an official project of the Save America's Treasures program and these funds will help in its renovation and preservation." 
   * $1 million for the Kentucky Forest Legacy Marrowbone Creek State Forest Project. The Commonwealth has identified property in Metcalfe County, Kentucky, that is ideal for funding under the Forest Legacy Program. The tract includes 48,000 feet of blue line streams that feed into the biologically diverse Upper Cumberland River Valley and Green River watersheds and a number of hardwood timber stands. "Kentucky's participation in the Forest Legacy program assists in its efforts to protect critical forest resources and to ensure good forest stewardship to sustain these resources," said Senator McConnell. "I am pleased to have secured funds for the Forest Legacy property in Metcalfe County." 
   * $640,000 towards the acquisition of Fern Lake by the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. "The acquisition of Fern Lake will ensure that it will remain a protected watershed for future generations to enjoy," said Senator McConnell. 
   The FY'07 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
