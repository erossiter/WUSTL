SEN. MCCONNELL: USDA DECLARES KENTUCKY A NATURAL DISASTER AREA - FARMERS CAN NOW APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has designated 118 counties in Kentucky as primary natural disaster areas due to freezing temperatures over the Easter weekend. In April, Sen. McConnell sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns in support of Kentucky's request for disaster designation.  
   The arrival of unseasonably warm weather in March accelerated the growth of many crops. This event, combined with frigid temperatures over Easter weekend, devastated many of Kentucky's agriculture products, including apples, pears, peaches, grapes, wheat and alfalfa. 
   "This announcement provides our agriculture producers with much needed assistance during this crucial time," said McConnell. "Our farmers will now be able to apply for low-interest emergency loans to help them pay their essential farm and living expenses." 
   Leslie and McCreary Counties were named contiguous disaster counties, and farmers in those areas are also eligible for low-interest emergency loans. 
   Kentucky farmers interested in applying for the assistance should contact their local Farm Service Agency office for further information.
