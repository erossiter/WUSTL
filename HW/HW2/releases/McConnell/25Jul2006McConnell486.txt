SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the Child Custody Protection Act, which makes it a federal offense to transfer a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion in order to evade a parental notification or parental consent law in the state in which the minor resides:  
   "I believe that parents have both the right and a responsibility to be actively involved in their children's lives. This bill promotes the safety of children and ensures that parents - the people best equipped to make major medical decisions - are present and available to be heard at such a pivotal moment in their children's lives. 
   "What opponents of this bill forget is that no parent wants anyone to take their children across state lines - or even across the street - without their permission. This is a fundamental right, and the Congress is right to uphold it in law."
