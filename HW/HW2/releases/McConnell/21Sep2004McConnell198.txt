SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR WKU ADVANCED COAL COMBUSTION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $800,000 for Western Kentucky University to complete the establishment of an Environmental Control Technology Laboratory.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory has been working with WKU and other institutions through the Combustion Technology University Alliance to develop and deploy new coal combustion technology. Western's Environmental Control Technology Laboratory will develop clean coal technology for municipal, regional, and national power generating facilities. 
   "This funding is important because it will allow the University to complete its Environmental Control Technology Laboratory," said Senator McConnell. "Western is a leader in developing clean coal technologies that are both energy efficient and environmentally responsible." 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
