SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DEFICIT ANNOUNCEMENT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement today after the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released its Mid-Session Review: 
   "Today's announcement proves that America's economy remains robust. Our pro-growth policies are creating jobs, expanding our economy, and reducing our deficit. The Republican Congress will make certain this growth continues by restraining unnecessary spending and rejecting calls for tax increases that would undermine our economy."
