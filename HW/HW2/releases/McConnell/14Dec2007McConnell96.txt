SEN. MCCONNELL: DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION A BIPARTISAN ACHIEVEMENT
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor Friday regarding final passage of the Defense Authorization Conference Report: 
   "Passage of this important conference report is a bipartisan achievement. I want to thank the managers for their hard work.
   "I was particularly pleased to see the committee provided full authorization for the supplemental funding of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   "And I was pleased to see the committee recommended no policy changes to the Petraeus Plan.
   "The Wounded Warriors legislation, which we passed earlier in the year, is also included. The Wounded Warriors bill is vitally important to our men and women in uniform, and important to the people of Kentucky.
   "So I thank the managers of this conference report. This is an important accomplishment for our men and women in uniform, who we can all agree are deserving of this body's full support and our deepest gratitude."
