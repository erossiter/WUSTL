SEN. MCCONNELL: IT'S TIME TO MOVE FORWARD WITH RESPONSIBLE EXPANSION OF SCHIP
  On Thursday, the House of Representatives voted to sustain the President's veto of an unworkable transformation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding the urgent need to reauthorize this program:  
   "Now that the veto has been sustained, it's time to move forward with a serious plan to extend health coverage for those SCHIP was meant to cover: low-income children. It's time to stop the campaign ads and time to start working across party lines to forge a bipartisan compromise. 
   "Surely Democrats wouldn't walk away and leave these young people from low-income families uninsured just to make a political point. I don't see how they can refuse to sit down with us to improve this bill when Republicans support and the President will sign legislation maintaining current coverage and extending coverage to additional low-income kids."
