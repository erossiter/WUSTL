USDA DECLARES KENTUCKY NATURAL DISASTER AREA - FARMERS CAN NOW APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has declared every Kentucky county a natural disaster area due to extreme drought conditions. In September, Senator McConnell sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns in support of Kentucky's request for disaster designation.  
   The current drought condition, combined with frigid temperatures over Easter weekend, devastated many agriculture products, including an estimated 50 percent loss on Kentucky's forage crops and decreased yields for corn and soybeans. The drought also impacted Kentucky's cattle producers who are struggling to secure adequate pasture and hay for their herds. 
   "Agriculture is a vital part of the Commonwealth's economy, and this disaster declaration will provide much needed assistance to our agriculture producers during these difficult times," said McConnell. "Our farmers will now be able to apply for low-interest emergency loans to help them pay their essential farm and living expenses." 
   Kentucky farmers interested in applying for the assistance should contact their local Farm Service Agency office for further information.
