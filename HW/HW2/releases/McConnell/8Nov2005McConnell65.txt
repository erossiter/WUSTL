SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $333 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FY'06 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that his requests for over $333 million in funding for Kentucky have been approved by a House/Senate Conference Committee. The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Energy & Water Appropriations Conference Report, is expected to be approved by the House and Senate this week. Once approved, it goes to the President for his signature.  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the conference committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT (OVER $148 MILLION) 
   * $105 million for cleanup activities at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This money will be used to fund continued environmental cleanup efforts at the plant. This amount includes additional funds to accelerate the characterization and disposal of scrap metal and low-level waste offsite. 
   * $85.8 million for the construction of DUF6 facilities in Paducah and Portsmouth - Paducah is expected to receive $42.9 million, half of the funding secured. In recent years, McConnell authored two federal statutes requiring DOE to build a facility in Paducah to convert 39,000 canisters of hazardous depleted uranium hexaflouride into a more stable compound. On July 27, 2004, DOE began construction on this facility. Construction will create 200 jobs and the plant will have 150 permanent jobs once operational. 
   * $465,000 for Worker Health Monitoring. This funding will be used for continued operation of a mobile health unit that screens current and former workers at the plant for the early signs of lung cancer. The mobile health unit travels between the three gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
   * Report language on phosgene contamination of DUF6 canisters. The conference report includes a provision requested by Senator McConnell calling for an independent study on the presence of the chemical agent phosgene in as many as 1,825 depleted uranium cylinders at Paducah. The Senator authored the study language in response to recent news reports that the chemical might be causing corrosion in some of the cylinders. 
   According to a recent Inspector General's memorandum, significant concerns have been raised about the presence of a phosgene in the DUF6 stockpile. 
   "I have long championed efforts to convert Paducah's depleted uranium into a safer, more stable form, and I want to make sure that it is carried out as safely as possible," said McConnell. "I understand DOE believes that phosgene poses no risk to workers or the community, but I believe it is worth seeking an independent opinion before the conversion facility begins operations in 2007." 
   UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE ($1.9 MILLION) 
   * $1.5 million for the UofL Institute for Advanced Materials. This funding will support high-performance energy systems through basic and applied research in energy-related materials. The Institute will focus on the development of advanced materials that are critical to meeting today's higher energy demands. 
   * $400,000 for the UofL Sustainable Buildings Project. This funding is for a collaborative effort between UofL, Jefferson County Public Schools and the Metro government to prepare plans to incorporate energy, water and waste efficiency technologies into public infrastructure being built or renovated. UofL hopes that its research will help school districts and other public agencies across Kentucky and the nation implement strategies to conserve energy and reduce operating costs. 
   "I am pleased to have secured this funding because it will allow the University of Louisville to conduct valuable energy conservation and application research," said McConnell. "Everyone agrees on the need to look for ways to conserve energy, and students and scientists at UofL are discovering ways to turn available materials into a useable resource." 
   U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ($183 MILLION) 
   * $23 million for the Kentucky Lock Project. This funding will be used to double the lock's size to handle the increased tonnage of today's larger barge traffic. 
   * $90 million for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. This funding will be used for the continued construction of a new facility that will replace locks 52 and 53 on the Ohio River. Once complete, this facility will be the largest locking facility in Kentucky in terms of tonnage. 
   * $70 million for the McAlpine Locks and Dam Project, located on the Ohio River. The funding will be used to maintain the construction schedule of an auxiliary lock chamber that will give the McAlpine project twin 1,200 foot locks to allow the facility to handle projected traffic increases. (Senator McConnell worked with Representative Northup on this project). 
   "The Kentucky, Olmsted, and McAlpine locks and dams help move commerce on our waterways," said McConnell. "This funding will be used to improve the locks and dams so they can handle an increase in barge traffic which in turn will make a positive economic impact on the region." 
   Once approved by the House and Senate, the FY'06 Energy & Water Appropriations Conference Report will be sent to the President for his signature.
