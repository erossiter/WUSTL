SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON AMBASSADOR BOLTON
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday regarding the need for Senate action on the nomination of John Bolton as Permanent Representative to the United Nations:  
   "During his tenure at the United Nations, Ambassador Bolton has proven to be a strong advocate on behalf of America's interests and he deserves to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The vitally important matters confronting the United Nations Security Council - such as Iran, Darfur, North Korea, and Israel's efforts to combat terrorism - demand steadfast action and leadership. John Bolton is the right man for this job."
