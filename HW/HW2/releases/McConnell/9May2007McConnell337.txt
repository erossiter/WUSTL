SEN. MCCONNELL: WE CAN ACHIEVE IMMIGRATION REFORM THIS YEAR
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following statement Wednesday on the Senate floor regarding the upcoming proposal for immigration reform: 
   "Mr. President, based on comments we've heard from some of our colleagues on the other side over the last two days, there is some concern that the bipartisan immigration compromise that members and staff have been working on so diligently over the last two months might be brushed aside in favor of last year's unsuccessful bill.
   "I strongly urge my colleagues to reconsider this approach, if indeed it's the one they plan to take. This exercise needs to be a bipartisan one, or it will not succeed. This is indisputable. And any effort to move legislation on this issue that isn't the result of the ongoing bipartisan discussions would be a clear signal from Democrats that they are not yet serious about immigration reform.
   "So I urge my colleagues to stay at the table. Let this bipartisan working group finish its work, so we can achieve immigration reform this year. Scrapping their work now will only end in frustration and defeat, for both sides."
