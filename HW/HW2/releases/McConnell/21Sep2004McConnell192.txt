SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES $500,000 IN FUNDING FOR CITY OF ELKTON
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his request of $500,000 in funding for the City of Elkton.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure the funding, which will be used to upgrade the sewer plant and extend sewer lines. The Elkton Wastewater Treatment Plant is operating beyond its capacity. The existing sanitary sewer lift station needs to be upgraded and the rehabilitation of some sewer lines will alleviate infiltration and inflow problems. 
   "This funding will enable the City of Elkton to upgrade its wastewater treatment plant to accommodate industrial growth in the region," said McConnell. 
   The full Senate must now approve the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.
