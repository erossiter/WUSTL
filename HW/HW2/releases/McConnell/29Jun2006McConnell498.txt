SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $316.5 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FISCAL '07 ENERGY & WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests for $316.5 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'07 Energy & Water Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky:  
   PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT ($145.7 MILLION) 
   * $110 million for cleanup activities at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This money will be used to fund continued environmental cleanup efforts at the plant. This amount includes additional funds to accelerate the characterization and disposal of scrap metal and low-level waste. 
   * $35.2 million for the continued construction of DUF6 facilities in Paducah and Portsmouth. McConnell authored two federal statutes requiring DOE to build a facility in Paducah to convert 39,000 canisters of hazardous depleted uranium hexaflouride into a more stable compound. On July 27, 2004, DOE began construction on this facility and these additional funds will further this effort. Construction will create 200 jobs and the plant will have 150 permanent jobs once operational. 
   * $500,000 for Worker Health Monitoring. This funding will be used for continued operation of a mobile health unit that screens current and former workers at the plant for the early signs of lung cancer. The mobile health unit travels between the three gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
   "The cleanup of the Paducah plant remains one of my top legislative priorities," said Senator McConnell. "While this is just the beginning of the FY'07 appropriations process, I will work to ensure that this funding remains in the final bill." 
   UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE ($2.4 MILLION) 
   * $1 million for the UofL Computational Biomarker Discovery Center (CBDC). The funds will be used to establish a CBDC at UofL. The Center will specifically focus on developing clinical tools that predict the risk or early diagnosis of cancer, diabetic complications, and children's diseases so that preventative measures can be taken and early stage treatments can be more successful. 
   * $400,000 for the UofL Sustainable Buildings Project. This funding is for a collaborative effort between UofL, Jefferson County Public Schools and the Metro government to prepare plans to incorporate energy, water and waste efficiency technologies into public infrastructure being built or renovated. UofL hopes that its research will help school districts and other public agencies across Kentucky and the nation implement strategies to conserve energy and reduce operating costs. 
   * $1 million for the Kentucky Rural Energy Consortium. Uof L will administer the funds for the consortium which includes the University of Kentucky. The consortium will research, develop and deploy renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies related to agriculture and rural communities. 
   "The scientists and students at the University of Louisville are conducting important research not only for Kentucky, but our nation," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will allow the University to establish a new research center and continue its valuable energy conservation projects." 
   UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (over $1.4 MILLION) 
   * $1 million for the UK Coal-Derived Low Energy Materials for Sustainable Construction Project. This funding will be used to research the feasibility of reusing coal-derived byproducts to make high-quality concrete, cement and masonry products. 
   * $3 million for the Center for Advanced Separation Technology (CAST), of which UK will receive approximately $400,000. CAST is a consortium of seven top mining schools, including UK, focused on developing new technologies to reduce the cost of separations in coal, metals, and industrial mining operations. The industry seeks advanced technologies to separate coal from waste rock near the point of extraction, which is particularly important for mining the thinner coal seams in the Appalachian region. Not only will new technologies produce cleaner coal, but the recovery of minerals in an environmentally acceptable manner also should improve. 
   "Kentucky's coal is a valuable natural resource that we count on to heat our homes and power our economy," said Senator McConnell. "The University of Kentucky is conducting important coal-related research and I am pleased to have secured this funding." 
   U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ($167 MILLION) 
   * $20 million for the Kentucky Lock Project. This funding will be used to double the lock's size to handle the increased tonnage of today's larger barge traffic. 
   * $90 million for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. This funding will be used for the continued construction of a new facility that will replace locks 52 and 53 on the Ohio River. Once complete, this facility will be the largest locking facility in Kentucky in terms of tonnage. 
   * $57 million for the McAlpine Locks and Dam Project, located on the Ohio River. The funding will be used to maintain the construction schedule of an auxiliary lock chamber that will give the McAlpine project twin 1,200 foot locks to allow the facility to handle projected traffic increases. 
   "The Kentucky, Olmsted and McAlpine locks and dams are important for moving commerce on our waterways," said Senator McConnell. "This funding will be used to make improvements to the locks and dams so they can accommodate increased barge traffic." 
   The FY'07 Energy & Water Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
