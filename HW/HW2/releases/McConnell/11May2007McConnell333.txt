SEN. MCCONNELL: 'THE ONLY CHANCE TO GET AN IMMIGRATION BILL IS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS'
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday on the Senate floor regarding the decision to give the immigration bipartisan working group more time to complete their work: 
   "Let me say with regard to immigration, the only chance to get a bill is on a bipartisan basis. I agree with the decision of the Majority Leader to accept the recommendation of those who have been involved in that discussion. That gives us the maximum opportunity to piece back together the bipartisan agreement that we thought we almost had a week or so ago on this most important legislation."
