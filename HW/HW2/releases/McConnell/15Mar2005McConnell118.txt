SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell today released the following statement on judicial nominations:  
   "The President's judicial nominations deserve a simple up or down vote. For more than 200 years, that simple proposition has been recognized as one of the ways the Constitution balances power among our three branches of government. Even if one strongly disagrees with a nomination, the proper course of action is not to obstruct a potential judge through the filibuster but to vote against him or her. Unfortunately, this obstruction necessitates that we restore these norms and traditions, and that includes through the use of the so-called "constitutional" option. 
   "If our Democratic colleagues make good on their threat to shut down the government, they place at risk funding for child care, education, highway projects, an energy bill and other important programs that impact the lives of every American. I urge them not to shut down the government."
