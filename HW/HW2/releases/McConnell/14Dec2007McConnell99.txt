SENATE CONFIRMS NEW SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
  The United States Senate unanimously confirmed the nomination of Lt. Gen. James Peake (Ret.) Friday to serve as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the confirmation allows Gen. Peake to begin to immediately "identify and correct" areas where the VA can improve. 
   "The Senate has entrusted Gen. Peake to be an advocate for the best our country has to offer - the brave men and women who have ably served our nation," McConnell said. "Their sacrifices on our behalf have earned them the finest treatment available, and I trust Gen. Peake will identify and correct any areas where the VA has fallen short in its duty so that our veterans receive the care and attention they deserve."
   Peake is the first physician and first general to serve as VA Secretary. President Bush announced the nomination on October 30.
