DEMOCRATS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONDEMN ANTI-PETRAEUS AD, REVERSE PARTISAN TREND
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Tuesday to encourage Senate Democrats to give the testimony of General Petraeus full consideration and to condemn the despicable ad run by a special- interest group against Gen. Petraeus:  
   "Even before Gen. Petraeus came to the Hill, senior Democrats were attacking his credibility. And on Monday, a Democrat-affiliated front group ran a despicable ad attacking his integrity and honor - before he ever uttered a word of testimony. 
   "Today Democrats have an opportunity to reverse that trend, to condemn the ad and to listen with an open mind to what Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker recommend for our troops and our long-term security."
