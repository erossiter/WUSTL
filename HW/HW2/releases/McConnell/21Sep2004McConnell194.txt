SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY NARCOTICS TASK FORCE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $250,000 for the Hopkinsville-Christian County-Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force Partnership.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   The Narcotics Task Force Partnership is a collaboration that includes the Hopkinsville Police and Fire Departments, the Christian County Sheriff and Police Departments, and the Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force. The funds will be used to purchase technology to link the agencies and help first responders better serve the members of the communities during an emergency. 
   "This important funding will enable the agencies to purchase technology to help them share information in a timely manner and improve public safety in Christian County," said McConnell. 
   The FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
