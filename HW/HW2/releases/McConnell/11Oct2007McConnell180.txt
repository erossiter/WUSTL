SEN. MCCONNELL: UN SECURITY COUNCIL SENDS STRONG MESSAGE TO BURMA'S TYRANNICAL REGIME
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following comments Thursday in response to the United Nations Security Council's statement on Burma: 
   "I am encouraged that, for the first time ever, the United Nations Security Council has agreed to a formal statement on the situation in Burma. This statement, which 'strongly deplores' the recent actions taken by the State Peace and Development Council, is a good first step toward multilateral efforts to promote peace and reconciliation in Burma. The document puts the Security Council, including China and Russia, on record as opposing the junta's brutality and reflects the growing international consensus that the situation in Burma is untenable."
