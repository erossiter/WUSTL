SEN. MCCONNELL PRAISES PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE PACKAGE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Thursday after the passage of the bipartisan minimum wage increase with tax and regulatory relief for small businesses:  
   "The President and the Republican Congress were clear on the need to couple an increase in the minimum wage with small business tax relief, and this legislation does just that. This is a testament to what we can accomplish when we work together to move critical legislation forward. 
   "An overwhelming majority of Senators acknowledged creating new jobs and expanding the economy are more important than partisan wrangling. We look forward to working with the House of Representatives to send a final bill to the President that will be a victory for both those who earn the minimum wage and those who pay it." 
   H.R. 2 as amended passed by a vote of 94-3.
