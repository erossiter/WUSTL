SEN. MCCONNELL: INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY NEEDS FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT FIX
  On Friday, U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called on the Senate to pass the McConnell-Bond legislation. The Director of National Intelligence requested Congressional action to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) before adjourning for the August recess. 
   "There's one thing I think virtually everybody in the room would agree with, and that is that we can't leave here without a bill signed into law by the President of the United States.
   "There's only one of these proposals before us that he will sign. He indicated earlier today that he will only sign a bill that Admiral McConnell, whom we all profess to greatly respect, believes will get the job done, at least for the next six months. There's one proposal that does that and only one.
   "So if we don't want to be back here tomorrow and next week still dealing with this problem - and we certainly, I think, agree we cannot leave town without addressing it - there's only one way to get a presidential signature and that is for the Bond-McConnell proposal upon which we will vote in a moment to get 60 votes.
   "That's the only way to get the job done.
   "There may be merit in both proposals but that's not the way Admiral McConnell sees it. He enjoys widespread respect throughout this body.
   "If we want to get the job done, get the President's signature, the Bond-McConnell proposal is the one that should be supported."
