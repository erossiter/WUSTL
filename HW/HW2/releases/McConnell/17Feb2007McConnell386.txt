SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING PROCEDURAL VOTE ON PELOSI-REID 'STAY THE COURSE' RESOLUTION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Saturday following a procedural vote on the Pelosi-Reid "Stay the Course" resolution:  
   "This was not a vote on whether or not we should send the reinforcements Gen. Petraeus recommended. It was a vote on whether or not the Senate should debate the most critical aspect of this issue: funding for our troops in harm's way. It is beyond disappointing that the Democrat leadership has refused to allow a debate and a simple vote on protecting our troops by funding their operations. 
   "The Constitution gives Congress control of the purse, so it defies reason for Democrats to continue blocking a vote on the Gregg funding resolution. Senate Republicans have been clear since the beginning of this debate weeks ago that the troops deserve to know whether or not they are supported by the Congress."
