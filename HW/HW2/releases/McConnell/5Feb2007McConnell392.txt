SEN. MCCONNELL: BUDGET CONTAINS PRO-GROWTH POLICIES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the President's FY'08 budget:  
   "President Bush has put forth a budget that continues pro-growth policies to keep America's economy robust without raising taxes. 
   "More than seven million jobs have been created since August 2003. These gains are the result of the energizing tax relief we passed and should be kept in place. Additionally, we have used the strong economic climate to cut the deficit in half. 
   "We can continue this trend and balance the budget the right way: by slowing the growth of government rather than slowing the growth of the economy."
