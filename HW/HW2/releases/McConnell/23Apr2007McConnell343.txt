SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ALTERNATIVE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BILL
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the Majority Leader's call for the President to 'come to us with an alternative' supplemental funding bill:  
   "I understand the Majority Leader is calling on the President to save the Democrats from themselves and their internal divisions over the war by sending up his own 'alternative' spending bill for our troops in the field. But the President already did that when he sent his request to Congress - 77 days ago. 
   "To me, the answer to the Democrats' quandary is quite simple: Take out the surrender date, take out the pork, and send it to the President for his signature as soon as possible. Not only would this prevent a veto, it would get the funds, equipment and training to our troops faster, and do it without tying the hands of the generals in the field."
