HENRY CLAY DESK TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM SENS. MCCONNELL TO BUNNING IN 110TH CONGRESS
Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning successfully pushed through the Senate today a resolution to allow the senior Senator from Kentucky to reassign the Henry Clay desk to the junior Senator from Kentucky when serving as party leader.  
 In the 106th Congress, Senator McConnell introduced and the Senate unanimously passed S. Res 89, decreeing that the desk Henry Clay used while serving in the United States Senate would be assigned to the senior Senator from Kentucky during his or her term in office, to maintain the Clay legacy. 
 Since 1999, Senator McConnell has used the Clay desk. However, in January 2007, Senator McConnell will begin service as the 15th Republican Leader. With the leader's position comes the use of the Republican Leader's desk, which was first used by Republican Leader Charles McNary of Oregon in 1937. 
 The resolution approved today amends the 1999 resolution by adding that, if the senior Senator from Kentucky is also a party leader, then the Henry Clay desk will go to the junior Senator from Kentucky upon the request of the senior Senator. In January 2007, Senator Bunning will begin using the Henry Clay desk. 
 "It has been my distinct privilege to use the Henry Clay desk," said Senator McConnell. "The resolution ensures the Bluegrass State will maintain its link to a tradition symbolized by the historic desk. I am sure my colleague and friend Senator Bunning will honor and keep the legacy of the Henry Clay desk - a legacy I have been proud to help continue." 
 "I want to thank Senator McConnell for introducing this resolution to allow me to use the Henry Clay Desk while he serves as Republican Leader," said Senator Bunning. "Henry Clay dedicated his life to public service, as a Congressman, Secretary of State, and United States Senator. Few have served Kentucky and this nation with more dedication and passion than Henry Clay and I am honored to inherit this symbol of his legacy here in the Senate."
