SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING IMPROVED BORDER SECURITY, IMMIGRATION, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding the administration's announcement on improved border security, immigration and worksite enforcement measures:  
   "During the immigration debate, and ever since, countless well-informed Americans spoke up about the need to enforce our borders and our laws. Their voice was heard in the Capitol and the White House. The billions we've added to the homeland security funding bill for border security and interior enforcement, and the administration's enhanced commitment to cracking down on illegal immigration are necessary steps toward securing our nation--and living up to the expectations of our constituents."
