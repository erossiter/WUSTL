SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH AT VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS NATIONAL CONVENTION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Wednesday following President Bush's remarks on the war on terrorism at the Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention in Kansas City, Mo.:  
   "Today the President unequivocally pledged to continue to support our troops' efforts to protect our nation's strategic interests in Iraq. We are seeing the progress our soldiers and Marines are making on a daily basis and must continue to support them. 
   "Critics of the war on terror have begun to acknowledge the success of our forces in quelling violence and increasing stability in Iraq. And they are recognizing the inherent danger a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. troops will have on the safety and security of our nation. 
   "In a few short weeks we will hear from General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker and the President regarding the efforts of this generation's warriors to protect our nation's interests in Iraq and in the war on terror. We must make our decision on where to go from here based on the facts, not political calculations. We owe them a fair hearing, and we should not forget the brave Americans who are in a foreign field, far from their families, sacrificing for all of us today."
