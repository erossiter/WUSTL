SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES VA GRANT TO BUILD VETERANS CEMETERY IN KENTUCKY
  Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson informed Sen. Mitch McConnell today that the VA is awarding a $6.9 million grant for the establishment of the Northern Kentucky State Veterans Cemetery in Williamstown, Kentucky.  
   According to the VA, the federal grant will be used to build the 99-acre cemetery in Williamstown. In its initial 20-acre development, the cemetery will provide 3,706 full-casket gravesites, 500 in-ground cremation burial sites and 1,020 columbarium niches. 
   "Our veterans have honorably served our country, and they deserve the utmost respect long after their service is over," said McConnell. "This funding will be used to honor them, and I appreciate Secretary Nicholson for providing my state the necessary funds to build it." 
   The funds also will cover the costs of cemetery infrastructure, including administration and maintenance buildings, roads and utilities. Design costs and equipment to operate the cemetery are also funded.
