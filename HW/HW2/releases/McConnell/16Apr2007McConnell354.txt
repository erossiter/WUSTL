SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DEMOCRATS' UNWILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ON 'SURRENDER DATE', NON-WAR-RELATED FUNDING
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding Democrats' unwillingness to compromise on the 'surrender date' and non-war-related funding they added to the troop-funding bill knowing it would be vetoed:  
   "I understand that they need to make a point, I understand they expect to 'pick up seats'* with the issue, and I understand there is an internal struggle within their party. But to me the answer is simple: Fund the troops first, don't make political points by delaying the essential supplies, material and training our forces in the field, and those preparing to enter the war zone. 
   "We're having a meeting at the White House on Wednesday and it is my hope that the Democrats will reconsider their inflexible, uncompromising position on their party's advocacy of a surrender date, measures restricting our commanders on the ground, and non-war spending."
