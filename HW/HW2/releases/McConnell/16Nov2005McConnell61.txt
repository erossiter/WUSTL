SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR EDMONSON COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request for $200,000 in funding for the Edmonson County Sheriff's Department, which will be used to upgrade its communication equipment and purchase additional law enforcement technology.  
   The funding is included in the Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   Earlier this year, Department officials informed Senator McConnell they would like to purchase state-of-the-art mobile radios for patrol vehicles and portable radios for patrol officers. They also want to use funds to purchase equipment to help their officers fight the growing methamphetamine problem in south central Kentucky and computer equipment to help with criminal investigations. 
   "Law enforcement agencies rely upon modern technologies for everything from enforcing traffic laws to investigating crimes," said McConnell. "The Edmonson County Sheriff's Department informed my staff about its needs to upgrade its equipment. I am pleased to have secured this funding which will enable the Department to purchase the equipment that will help their officers communicate with each other and better respond to emergencies." 
   The Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Conference Report will now be sent to the President for his signature.
