SEN. MCCONNELL: AMERICAN PEOPLE SET ANOTHER ECONOMIC RECORD
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday following a record-setting 50 months of consecutive job growth:  
   "The American people have done it again. The American economy is roaring along, creating new job growth for 50 consecutive months, the longest growth streak on record. Smart economic policies led principally by a lowered tax burden created the economic environment necessary for sustained growth, and the American workforce took it from there. 
   "While some in Washington want to impede this record growth by raising taxes, I couldn't disagree more." 
   Background 
  This is the first time the milestone of 50 consecutive months of job growth has ever been reached since the government began keeping records in 1939.
