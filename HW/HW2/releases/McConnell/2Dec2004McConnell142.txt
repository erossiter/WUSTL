SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON UKRAINE ELECTIONS
  The people of Ukraine deserve fair and full expression of their political will through credible elections. By all accounts, this has yet to happen. Calls for a repeat of second-round elections make sense, and is the right course of action. 
   The continued interference by Russia into Ukrainian affairs must immediately end. This is not the 1950s. President Putin should tend to his own house, and focus his efforts instead on bolstering democracy and media freedom in Russia.
