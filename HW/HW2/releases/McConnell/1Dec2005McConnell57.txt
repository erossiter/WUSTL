SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT SIGNING LEGISLATION TO HONOR PARKS WITH STATUE IN U.S. CAPITOL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today praising President George W. Bush for signing legislation he co-sponsored to honor Rosa Parks with a statue in the U.S. Capitol:  
   "By sitting down 50 years ago, Rosa Parks stood up for the dignity and equality of African-Americans. Now her statue will stand in the nation's Capitol as a reminder of her act of courage, which served as the spark to ignite the modern civil-rights movement. 
   "I applaud the President for signing this legislation and recognizing America's debt to Ms. Parks. For decades to come, Americans will visit the Capitol, see her statue, and be reminded that one person with courage can unshackle millions."
