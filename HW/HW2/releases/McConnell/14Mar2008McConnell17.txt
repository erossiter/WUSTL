SEN. MCCONNELL: DEMOCRATS' BUDGET GROWS GOVERNMENT, PUNISHES TAXPAYERS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding his vote against the Democrat budget which raises taxes on lower- and middle-income families:  
   "This debate made clear that Congressional Democrats are willing to raise taxes on middle- and lower-income families so they can spend more from Washington. Instead of working to increase the size of the family budget, Democrats once again chose to grow the government budget--raising taxes on middle-class American families by an average of $2,300 a year and refusing to reform the middle-class tax hike known as the AMT. Sadly, this budget does nothing to address the looming entitlement crisis our children will inherit from us."
