FIX AMT NOW: MIDDLE CLASS TAXPAYERS CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement Friday regarding House passage of the Democrats' massive tax increase:  
    "The last thing the American people need right now is a massive tax increase which would be a dangerous jolt to our economy. Congress must pass a responsible fix to this middle class tax hike, the AMT; a fix that doesn't replace one massive tax increase on Americans with another. 
   "The IRS sent Congress a letter warning the Democrat leadership that, unless this problem is fixed before Thanksgiving, the tax returns of 50 million taxpayers-and $75 billion in tax refunds-will be delayed. We must take action to fix the AMT before Thanksgiving-without raising taxes. Middle class taxpayers can't afford to wait."
