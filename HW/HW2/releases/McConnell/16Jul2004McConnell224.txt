SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR FORT CAMPBELL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request for an additional $6 million in military construction funding for Fort Campbell.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate.
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill:
   * $3.6 million for construction of an Aquatic Training Facility for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). This funding will create an aquatic training facility that will enhance survivability and training for the unit's elite helicopter pilots who fly extensive and dangerous missions at considerable distances over water. It will also improve training for the helicopter pilots of the 101st Airborne, who will have access to this facility.
   * $2.4 million for construction of an Airfield Vehicle Support Facility. This funding will be used to construct a facility to house and maintain U.S. Air Force aircraft loading vehicles and airfield equipment.
   "Fort Campbell is one of our premier military installations," said Senator McConnell. "The pilots of the 160th SOAR and 101st Airborne Division have played critical roles in the War on Terror, and this aquatic training facility will help them prepare for future missions."
   In addition, Senator McConnell helped protect the following projects, which were included in the President's original budget:
   * $33 million to construct a Command and Control Facility for the 101st Airborne Division.
   * $30 million for construction of a Barracks Complex for the 5th Special Forces Group.
   * $1.6 million for construction of a Shoot House.
