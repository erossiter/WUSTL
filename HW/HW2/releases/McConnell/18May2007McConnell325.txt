SEN. MCCONNELL: NEGOTIATIONS 'DISAPPOINTING'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday after a meeting on the Iraq supplemental with bicameral congressional leadership and White House chief of staff Josh Bolten:  
   "Despite the Senate's overwhelming bipartisan rejection of a surrender date, it's disappointing that Democrat Leadership continues to demand that we give our enemy a timeline for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. It has been 102 days since the President sent an emergency request to ensure our troops in the field have the funding, training, and equipment they need to complete their mission. We need to move past debating a surrender date, pass a bill the President can sign, and get these funds to our troops by Memorial Day."
