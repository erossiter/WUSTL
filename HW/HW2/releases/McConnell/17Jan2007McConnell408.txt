SEN. MCCONNELL: GREGG REFORM AMENDMENT DESERVES A VOTE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Wednesday calling on the Democrat leadership to schedule a vote on "A Second Look at Wasteful Spending," an amendment sponsored by Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) to the ethics reform bill (S.1):  
   "Fiscal responsibility is not just an election-day issue. If we are serious about reform, we must take the steps necessary to marry fiscal rhetoric with fiscal reality. The commonsense reform offered by Sen. Gregg is an opportunity to do that - it deserves a vote." 
   McConnell is a co-sponsor of the Gregg amendment, which gives the President the opportunity to veto wasteful spending and use the savings for deficit reduction.
