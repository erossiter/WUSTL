SEN. MCCONNELL: STRENGTHENING MEDICARE REQUIRES BIPARTISAN SOLUTION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the Medicare Funding Warning Response Act of 2008 introduced by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg:  
   "Millions of American seniors depend on Medicare to provide health insurance. Yet, as indicated by the recent Medicare Board of Trustees' report to Congress, this critical program must be strengthened so it can continue to serve the needs of the Americans who have come to depend on it. 
   "Democrats and Republicans can create a bipartisan solution to strengthen Medicare. There are several commonsense solutions contained in the legislation proposed by Sen. Gregg which will lower costs and improve coverage for America's seniors and the disabled. Ensuring the continued sustainability of Medicare can and should be a bipartisan accomplishment."
