SEN. MCCONNELL: 'BOB GATES WILL BE A STRONG LEADER FOR THE PENTAGON AND FOR OUR TROOPS'
U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the confirmation of Dr. Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. The vote in favor of the confirmation was 95-2:  
 "Throughout his confirmation process, Dr. Bob Gates has demonstrated intelligence and candor. I believe these characteristics, and his many years of service to our nation, will serve him well as he works to protect America, and I am confident that he will be a strong leader for the Pentagon and for our troops. 
 "Dr. Gates has a proven record of bipartisan cooperation, demonstrated most recently by his tenure with the Iraq Study Group. As a member of that group, he has traveled to Iraq, met Iraqi leaders and talked to our military commanders on the ground. He is ready to hit the ground running and lead the Pentagon from the day he is confirmed. 
 "Five years into the War on Terror, America has made great progress. But much hard work still lies ahead, as we continue to defend Americans here at home while fighting abroad the terrorists who would do us harm. The position of Secretary of Defense is more important than ever, and I believe the President has made an outstanding choice."
