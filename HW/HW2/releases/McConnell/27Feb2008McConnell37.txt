SEN. MCCONNELL: IRAQ DEBATE 'OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT PROGRESS'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor Wednesday regarding the motion to proceed to a debate on Iraq: 
   "The matter before us, the Feingold withdrawal amendment, has been voted four times before. Each of the times it was voted on in the past, one could argue that things were going less well in Iraq than they are today.
   "The highest number of votes the Feingold withdrawal proposal has received at any point in these four votes is 29 votes. It should be voted on, defeated once again and it certainly will be.
   "Now we've had six months or so of undeniable progress on all fronts.
   "The security situation is dramatically improved. Even on the political side, where I think members on both sides were frustrated with the new Iraqi democracy, they've finally begun to take the kind of steps that are needed where the de-Ba'athfication law was approved. Local elections have been scheduled for later in the year.
   "They are finally making some progress on the government side as well as the undeniable progress on the security side--at this point, not just brought about strictly by American troops, but also the sons of Iraq, these people who have decided to defend their neighborhoods and help us defeat Al Qaeda have grown dramatically in terms of numbers and commitment.
   "So there is, as I indicated, a lot of interest on our side in continuing to at least point out the progress that's been made in Iraq both in terms of security and on the political side."
