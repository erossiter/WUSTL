SEN. MCCONNELL: WE NEED TO GET FUNDS TO THE TROOPS - NOW
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor Friday regarding troop funding:  
   "I have a simple message this morning: we need to get funds to the troops -- now. 
   "The Secretary of Defense told us yesterday that money for the Army and Marine Corps will soon run out--that he'll have to start writing pink slips, tearing up contracts and reducing missions at military bases--if we don't approve these funds for training and supplies that are needed to protect these brave men and women in the field. 
   "Are we about to deny all those supplies just as the successes of General Petraeus's plan have become clear? 
   "Attacks are down. Casualties are down. Political cooperation is taking root at the local level. 
   "We should not leave our forces in the field without the funding that they need to accomplish the mission for which they have been deployed. The Pelosi bill, if it was to get to the President's desk, would be vetoed, as was the supplemental bill sent to the president earlier this year that contained a withdrawal date. 
   "We need to get our troops everything they need. We need to get it to them right now."
