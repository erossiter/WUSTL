SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES $5.15 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR BOWLING GREEN
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that that Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $5.15 million in funding for projects in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The funding is included in the Senate FY'05 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate.  
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure the following funding: 
   * $1.5 million for the South Central Kentucky Training and Development Project at the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark. This funding will be used to provide equipment for the on-site technical training center, which will ensure that workers have the skills needed by employers at the industrial park. The bill also includes $1.75 million for the South Central Kentucky Water Infrastructure Project at the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark. This funding will be used for water and sewer improvements at the industrial park. 
   "This important funding supports the Kentucky Trimodal Transpark in its effort to provide jobs to workers in and around Warren County," said McConnell. 
   * $800,000 for the Lost River Cave Improvement Project. The funds will be used by Friends of the Lost River Cave Inc. in conjunction with Western Kentucky University to preserve and develop the Lost River Cave as a tourist attraction for the region. 
   "This funding will help the city of Bowling Green protect this unique treasure," said McConnell. 
   * $500,000 for the WKU Small Public Water Technology Center. The funding will be used by WKU to continue operating the center, which provides assistance to small public water systems across Kentucky. The bill also contains $600,000 for the WKU Center for Wastewater Research, which performs wastewater management activities for small and rural communities throughout Kentucky. 
   "Western Kentucky University has been instrumental in assisting water districts in Kentucky to provide high quality water and cost-effective service to families across the state," said McConnell. "This funding will enable WKU to continue its vital research." 
   The full Senate must now approve the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.
