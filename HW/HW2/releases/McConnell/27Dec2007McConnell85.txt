SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DEATH OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto: 
   "Benazir Bhutto's bravery stands in stark contrast to the cowardice of those who remain committed only to chaos, murder and thwarting democracy in Pakistan. 
   "It is our expectation that President Musharraf and the Pakistani people will go forward with free and fair elections."
