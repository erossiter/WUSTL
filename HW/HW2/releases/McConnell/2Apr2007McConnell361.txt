SEN. MCCONNELL: FUNDING CUT 'CEDES THE INITIATIVE TO THE ENEMY'
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding legislation by U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) that would cut-off funds to troops in the field on an arbitrary surrender date:  
   "Announcing a surrender date to al Qaeda is a dangerous military policy, cedes the initiative to the enemy, and directly contradicts the 96 Senators who just last month voted against funding cuts for troops in the field. The chosen date isn't tied to circumstances on the ground or the needs of the military commanders. It's completely arbitrary. It was pulled out of thin air. And the terrorists have already marked it on their calendars."
