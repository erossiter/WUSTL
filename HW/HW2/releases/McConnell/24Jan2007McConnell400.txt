SEN. MCCONNELL: PUT POLITICS ASIDE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement on Wednesday after the Senate Democrats blocked U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg's A Second Look at Wasteful Spending amendment from coming to a vote:  
   "I'm disappointed that our Democratic colleagues promised a new way of working together, yet blocked a commonsense fiscal measure designed to do just that. Twenty Democrats currently in the Senate supported a similar measure when it was proposed in 1995, yet today they refused to allow even a simple yes-or-no vote. 
   "Americans demanded reform and we owe it to them. If we are going to continue to pass real reforms, must put politics aside and get to work."
