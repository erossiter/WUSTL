SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES VA GRANT FOR STATE VETERANS CEMETERY IN WILLIAMSTOWN, KENTUCKY
  Secretary of Veterans Affairs James B. Peake informed Senator Mitch McConnell Wednesday that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is awarding a $1.31 million grant for the Kentucky State Veterans Cemetery in Williamstown, Ky. 
   In April 2007, the VA awarded a $6.9 million grant to build the 99-acre cemetery in Williamstown. This latest grant will be used for the purchase and placement of 1,000 lawn crypts and construction of a building to house equipment.
   "I appreciate Secretary Peake for providing the funds to build the Kentucky State Veterans Cemetery," McConnell said. "Our veterans have honorably served our country, and they deserve to be remembered by future generations."
   According to the VA, the cemetery will initially provide 3,706 full-casket gravesites, 500 in-ground cremation burial sites and 1,020 columbarium niches.
