SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES EDUCATION DEPARTMENT GRANT FOR ROBERTSON COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Department of Education has approved a physical education grant of over $300,000 for the Robertson County School System.  
   The funding will be used to implement a physical education program for elementary and secondary students. Elementary school students will benefit from a curriculum called "SPARK" (Sports, Play and Active Recreation for Kids), which is a combination physical activity and nutrition program. 
   Secondary school students will use a fitness center to develop physical activity programs and will monitor their health through the use of fitness portfolios. School staff will be provided professional development and members of the community will also have access to the fitness center. 
   "This funding will help the Robertson County Schools foster healthy lifestyles for students and their families," said Senator McConnell.
