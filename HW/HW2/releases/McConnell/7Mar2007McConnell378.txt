SEN. MCCONNELL: FIVE PROVISIONS THAT DESERVE A VOTE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Wednesday regarding an amendment to the 9/11 Commission Bill that would close existing loopholes and strengthen national security in five key areas:  
   "If we are serious about strengthening our homeland security, we have a chance to show it by implementing the commonsense policies in this combined Cornyn amendment. These anti-terror proposals close loopholes in current law and fundamentally change our security policy. It is a critical part of achieving the goal we all share for protecting the nation against unimaginable attacks." 
   Background 
   The Cornyn Amendment: 
   For the first time, makes it a crime to recruit people to commit terrorist acts 
   Authorizes the immediate deportation of suspected terrorists whose visas are revoked on terrorism grounds 
   Prevents the release of dangerous aliens whose home countries will not accept them back into their country. 
   Makes it a crime to encourage terrorism by rewarding the families of suicide bombers after the bombings take place. This is not a crime under current law. 
   Increases penalties for those who call families of soldiers serving overseas and falsely claim that their family member has been killed. 
   Leader McConnell filed cloture on the Cornyn Amendment Wednesday afternoon to ensure that the underlying bill is finished in a timely manner.
