SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING BOMBINGS IN LONDON
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the bombings in London: 
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to the people of London. As they did for us following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Americans will stand by the people of the United Kingdom. The resolve of our two nations will continue to be tested, but we will not let the barbaric actions of terrorists stand in our way as we continue to aggressively fight the War on Terror."
