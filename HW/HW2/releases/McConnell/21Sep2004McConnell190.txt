SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR NKU/UOFL DIGITAL SCIENCE CENTER
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his request of $1 million in funding for the Northern Kentucky University/University of Louisville Digital Science Center.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure the following funding: 
   * $1 million for the Northern Kentucky University/University of Louisville Digital Science Center. The funding will be used by the Digital Science Center for the "Taking Astronomy to the Schools" project. 
   "NKU and UofL are working to establish a Center to teach astronomy and geology to college students and to increase interest in these sciences among elementary and high school students," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the universities to expand the program and encourage students to explore scientific study in NASA-related areas." 
   The "Taking Astronomy to the Schools" project will impact over 50,000 middle and high school students and 400 teachers. Senator McConnell previously secured $1.7 million for this project. 
   The full Senate must now approve the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.
