SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE SPACE FLIGHT EXPLORATION PROJECT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his request of $2 million in funding for the University of Louisville Space Flight Exploration Project.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure the funding for the program. 
   UofL will use the funding to simulate the microgravity environment of space and perform a series of twelve experiments to study simultaneous changes in brain processing and cognition. Participants will be engaged in perception and cognition during different states of sleep and wakefulness and after different periods of sleep reduction. 
   "The University of Louisville is working to break new ground in the assessment and understanding of the impact of low gravity environments on the cognitive and perceptual processes critical for successful space missions," said McConnell. 
   The full Senate must now approve the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.
