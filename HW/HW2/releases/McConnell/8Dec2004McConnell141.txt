SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell issued the following statement today on passage of S. 2845, the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004:  
   "This intelligence reform bill builds upon the steps the Administration took shortly after 9/11 to improve America's intelligence agencies and make America safer. The legislation will enhance inter-agency cooperation, improve our covert operations capabilities, and provide more complete and timely intelligence to policy makers and the military. 
   "Our nation has taken a big step, but much more work remains in our efforts to combat terrorism around the globe, and Congress must remain vigilant in the face of continuing threats to our nation's security. President Bush deserves great credit for securing passage of this landmark reform bill."
