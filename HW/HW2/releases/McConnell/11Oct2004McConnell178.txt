SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR FORT KNOX
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Senate approved his request of $4.69 million in military construction funding for Fort Knox.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to the President for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill: 
   * $1.85 million for construction of a Shoot House. This funding will allow Fort Knox to construct a re-configurable facility for simulated urban assault training. 
   * $1.9 million for construction of an Urban Assault Course. This funding will expand and modify an existing assault course to allow units to train in a simulated urban environment. 
   * $940,000 for taxiway and airfield improvements at Godman Army Airfield. This funding will strengthen and widen taxiways to allow expanded operations by heavy cargo aircraft at Fort Knox. 
   "I am pleased to have secured this funding for Fort Knox which will enable the base to continue training soldiers to fight in urban settings," said McConnell. 
   In addition, Senator McConnell helped protect the following project, which was included in the President's original budget: 
   * $50 million for construction of a Barracks Complex at Fort Knox. The Army originally placed this project in the budget at Senator McConnell's request in order to improve living conditions for soldiers at Fort Knox.
