SEN. MCCONNELL RECOGNIZES AUNG SAN SUU KYI'S 62ND BIRTHDAY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement today in honor of the 62nd birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi:  
   "Today, Aung San Suu Kyi passes another birthday under house arrest in Burma. Much like many of her previous ones, her 62nd birthday almost certainly will not be a happy one for the Nobel Peace Prize winner. 
   "The best gift we can give Suu Kyi on this day is to continue to urge the international community to press for her immediate and unconditional release, as well as the release of all prisoners of conscience. We also need to continue to call for an end to attacks against ethnic minorities and to promote democracy and reconciliation in this troubled land. 
   "Congress can also extend birthday wishes to Suu Kyi by immediately passing the bill to renew sanctions against the Burmese government. 
   "As always, Suu Kyi can count on my full support. I am committed to standing with her and the people of Burma for as long as it takes for freedom to triumph." 
   On June 14, 2007, Senators McConnell and Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill calling for the renewal of sanctions against the Burmese regime, which include an import ban on Burmese goods entering the U.S. and visa restrictions on officials from the dictatorial regime that currently holds Burma in its grip - the State Peace and Development Council. 
   Last week, when introducing the bill, Senator McConnell said "every dollar we keep out of the hands of this junta is one less dollar it can use to fund the conscription of children, its nuclear program, and the war it has waged against its own people for nearly two decades." In addition to McConnell and Feinstein, the bill has 58 cosponsors.
