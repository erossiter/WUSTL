SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S SPEECH, ADMINISTRATION CRITICS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the President's speech to the Military Officers Association of America:  
   "The President, by providing a clear agenda for the ongoing fight against al Qaeda, continues to widen the gulf between the action and determination of this administration and the empty rhetoric of many of his critics. His critics are not unpatriotic, they are just wrong. 
   "We are safer now here at home because of the aggressive effort to find and kill terrorists where they live. It's not an accident. It's not a quirk of fate. It's been because we've been on offense, while maintaining a strong homeland defense."
