SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR CUMBERLAND GAP NATIONAL PARK TO PURCHASE FERN LAKE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1 million for the Cumberland Gap National Park to expand its boundaries to include Fern Lake.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   Fern Lake is located just southeast of Middlesboro, Kentucky and serves as the primary water source for the community. The owner of Fern Lake has decided to sell approximately 750 acres of land, including 150 acres that comprise the lake. As a result, Congress passed legislation that Senator McConnell sponsored in cooperation with Congressman Hal Rogers that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire Fern Lake and the surrounding watershed. 
   "Fern Lake is a Kentucky treasure," said McConnell. "This funding will be used by the Cumberland Gap National Park to protect the lake and drinking water for future generations to enjoy." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
