SEN. MCCONNELL ON BURMA: WE STILL HEAR THE CRIES OF FREEDOM
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday on the recent violence in Burma and the State Peace and Development Council's move to cut off Internet access to the people of Burma: 
   "Today, I send a message to the tyrannical State Peace and Development Council: you cannot censor the graphic images the world has witnessed during the past few days; they will never be forgotten. We still hear the cries of freedom from the people you seek to silence. We stand with the courageous people of Burma in their heroic struggle."
