SEN. MCCONNELL: FUNDING TROOPS IN FIELD IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Monday in response to President Bush's call for Congress to continue to fully fund the troops in the field: 
   "During the last few months, the Petraeus plan has produced important military progress in Iraq. Gen. Petraeus and our men and women in harm's way are combating Al Qaeda and assisting our allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot turn our backs on our warriors now by cutting off funds when there is still work to be done and still troops to protect. Congress overwhelmingly passed two resolutions this year rejecting any action that would undermine our troops in the field and Congress must now fulfill its responsibilities and send the message to our troops that we support their mission."
