1793: CORNERSTONE OF 'GLEAMING SYMBOL'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday regarding the anniversary of the day in 1793 when George Washington laid the cornerstone of the United States Capitol:  
   "Historians tell us that George Washington's decision to preside over the Constitutional Convention lent instant credibility and respect to the document it produced. And yesterday we recalled the signing of that document, upon which this nation's laws and institutions are firmly built. 
   "Well, six years later George Washington would lend his reputation to another enduring work, a white beacon of stone and mortar that inspires us and millions of others around the world more than two centuries later. On this day in 1793, George Washington laid the cornerstone to the United States Capitol. 
   "The building would take nearly a century to complete, but the magnificence of the finished product would stand as a testament to the perseverance of generations of Americans and to the enduring principles it was meant to embody and project. 
   "And so we pause today to reflect on the many contributions of our first president, not only to this nation, but also to the city that bears his name - not the least of which is the gleaming symbol at its heart."
