SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR ENSIGN-BICKFORD COMPANY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $6 million for the Ensign-Bickford Company in Muhlenberg County.  
 The funding is included in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill, which the full Senate may consider as early as this week.
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmark in the funding bill:
   * $6 million for the Obstacle Breeching System at the Ensign-Bickford Company. The funding, included in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill, will be used to manufacture the Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS). Ensign-Bickford is the prime contractor for the APOBS, which was developed for the Marine Corps and the Army. APOBS is a portable rocket propelled weapon system designed to destroy land mines and wire obstacles during assault breaching operations. APOBS creates a 45-meter long by 0.6-meter wide pathway through land mines and wire obstacles.
   "The employees of Ensign-Bickford are doing an outstanding job assisting our armed forces in the War on Terror," said McConnell. "Ensign-Bickford is ensuring the safety of our troops abroad by manufacturing a system to clear terrain of land mines and other anti-personnel obstacles."
