SEN. MCCONNELL: IT'S TIME TO START ADDRESSING COUNTRY'S PRIORITIES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding the President's call for action on spending bills. Friday marked the first time in 20 years that the Congress failed to send a single appropriations bill to the President this late in the year. 
   "Friday marks the first time in 20 years that Congress has gone this long without sending even a single appropriations bill down to the President for his signature.
   "In addition, Congress is woefully behind in passing a clean veterans' bill, fixing the middle-class tax hike, and working together to pass an SCHIP bill that the President will sign.
   "Unless Congress acts soon, we'll have troops in the field without a commitment from Congress to fund their mission. We ought to immediately provide our troops the funding they need.
   "It's time to start addressing the country's priorities. All of these things need to be done, and soon."
