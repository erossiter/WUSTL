SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR HARDIN COUNTY WATER DISTRICT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $750,000 for the Hardin County Water District.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, obtained $750,000 for the Hardin County Water District's Water Quality Assurance Plan and System Improvements Project. The District will use these funds to ensure that the water it supplies to customers is safe and clean and to improve existing infrastructure. 
   In FY'04, McConnell secured $500,000 for the Hardin County Water District, bringing the total federal funding obtained by McConnell to $1.25 million. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues approved this funding for the Hardin County Water District," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the County to continue providing high quality water and cost effective services to the people of Hardin County. I hope this improved capability will lead to enhanced economic development opportunities, as well as better service for the region." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
