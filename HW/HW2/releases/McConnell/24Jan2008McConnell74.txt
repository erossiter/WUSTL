SENATE PASSES SEN. MCCONNELL RESOLUTION HONORING 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a speech on the Senator floor on Thursday honoring the American Printing House for the Blind (APH) for its 150 years of service to blind and visually impaired Americans. Senator McConnell also authored a resolution recognizing the Louisville, Ky. facility on its anniversary - the resolution passed the Senate Wednesday evening (resolution attached). 
   During the floor speech, McConnell noted that APH, which was established in 1858, has served as the official national source of educational materials for the legally blind for more than a century. He also praised the APH for its continued commitment to developing, producing and distributing materials in Braille, large print, and enlarged print for over 58,000 blind and visually impaired Americans.
   "Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky are proud to be the home of the American Printing House for the Blind, which adds much to our community," McConnell said. "My resolution reflects the Senate's appreciation for the hundreds of employees at the APH who are committed to serving blind and visually impaired individuals throughout our country. The Louisville facility has opened up a world of knowledge and information to millions of Americans for the past 150 years, and their dedication deserves to be honored. I appreciate my colleagues for recognizing this important institution and milestone."
   Senator McConnell's resolution was co-sponsored by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY).
