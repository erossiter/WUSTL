SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR NORTHERN KENTUCKY DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $10 million for Northern Kentucky defense projects.  
 The funding is included in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill, which the full Senate may consider as early as this week.
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill:
   * $7 million for the Rapid Fuel Transfer System at KECO Industries in Florence. This funding will be used to support research and testing for a new bulk fuel transfer system that will reduce the time it takes the U.S. Army to deploy existing fuel lines. This system will greatly enhance the Army's logistics efforts to provide rapidly moving forces with necessary fuel.
   "Our military's performance must remain at its peak," said McConnell. "The ability to rapidly refuel is critical to improving the capabilities of our forward operating military forces."
   * $3 million for the Weapons Shot Counter at Accu-Counter in Kenton County. These funds will be used to enhance the ability of the Special Operations Forces to gauge the wear and reliability of their weapons.
   "Our Special Operations Forces will greatly benefit from the Weapons Shot Counter because it provides useful information leading to improved confidence in the performance of their weapons," said McConnell.
