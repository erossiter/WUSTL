SEN. MCCONNELL: HELPING SENIORS SAVE ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
  American seniors are celebrating an historic event this summer. Last month, marked the first time seniors could sign up for and use a Medicare-approved prescription drug discount card. This is all possible because seven months ago, President George W. Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. This extraordinary measure preserves and strengthens Medicare and will provide a prescription drug benefit for millions of American seniors - our greatest generation. 
   While the full drug benefit will not begin until 2006, seniors can get substantial help immediately with the Prescription Drug Discount Card. The card, which is available now, is already providing an incredible amount of relief to seniors. In Kentucky alone, there are some 650,000 seniors who are eligible to use their discount cards to reduce the cost of their medicines. To date, more than three million American seniors are already enrolled in one of the card programs.
   Seniors can use the cards to save 15 to 30 percent from the usual retail price of most brand name drugs and more on generics at neighborhood pharmacies. Further, a recent study found savings of 7 to 20 percent or more on mail-order prices for brand name drugs for those seniors who receive their medications through the mail.
   Also, low-income seniors struggling with high drug costs will get these savings as well as an additional $600 a year credit - or $1,200 over the next 18 months - to help pay for prescriptions. In Kentucky, about 123,000 low-income seniors are eligible for this program.
   In order to find the Medicare-Approved drug discount card that is best for you, I encourage you to call toll-free 1-800-MEDICARE or visit the web site, www.Medicare.gov.
   A Medicare customer service representative will review your drug needs and help you select the right card. However, before calling 1-800-MEDICARE you should have the following information handy:
   * Your zip code;
   * List of your prescription drugs, including dosage;
   * Income to determine if you are eligible for the $600 credit;
   * And any special preferences, such as the name of your local pharmacy.
   Also, if you like to comparison shop, you can do so by visiting the web site, www.Medicare.gov, which will help you find the lowest prices for your prescription drugs.
   There is no deadline to enroll and participation is entirely voluntary. However, I would encourage any Medicare beneficiary who is interested in paying less for their prescriptions to call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit www.Medicare.gov as soon as possible.
