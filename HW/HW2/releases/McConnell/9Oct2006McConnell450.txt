POLITICAL ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT WON'T STOP THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding senior Democrats politicizing North Korea's claim of a successful underground nuclear test, and the need to work toward a solutions:  
   "The Democrats need to take a deep breath and realize that this is not about the election, and that Americans don't want anyone playing partisan politics with the threat of nuclear weapons. Rather than attack the President, we ought to be coming together to support his efforts to protect America. 
   "The president's political opponents attack him for a 'unilateral' approach to Iraq. Now they attack him over a multilateral approach to North Korea. Listening to some Democrats, you'd think the enemy was George Bush, not Kim Jong-Il.
