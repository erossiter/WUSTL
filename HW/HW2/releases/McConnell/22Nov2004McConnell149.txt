SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR CITY OF ELKTON
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $500,000 for the City of Elkton, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell used his position as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee to secure the funding, which will be used to upgrade the sewer plant and extend sewer lines. The Elkton Wastewater Treatment Plant is operating beyond its capacity. The existing sanitary sewer lift station needs to be upgraded and the rehabilitation of some sewer lines will alleviate infiltration and inflow problems. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues approved my funding request for the City of Elkton," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the City to upgrade its wastewater treatment plant to accommodate industrial growth in the region." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
