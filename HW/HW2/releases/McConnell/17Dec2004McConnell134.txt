SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BURMA
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today in support of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and freedom in Burma:  
   "The international community must publicly and forcefully condemn the illegitimate State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC) efforts to further harass and endanger Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The eyes of the world remain focused on this courageous Nobel laureate - and the thuggish generals who continue to deny the people of Burma freedom and justice. 
   "Junta leader Than Shwe is directly responsible for the welfare and safety of Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in Burma. Given heightened concerns for Suu Kyi and her compatriots, the United Nations should act immediately to discuss and debate the situation in Burma that infects the region with drugs, HIV/AIDS and refugees. To do anything less is to undermine the courageous struggle for freedom in that country. 
   "I welcome the statement issued by ASEAN Parliamentarians on Burma, comprised of regional members of parliament, who offered their unequivocal support to Burma's democracy movement, urged the immediate release of Suu Kyi and all political prisoners, and recommended that ASEAN bar Burma from being awarded chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006. 
   "Moreover, recent statements by the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines reflect a broadening concern regarding the political situation in Burma. 
   "Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's recent assertion that Suu Kyi's detention is "reasonable" is both reckless and dangerous, and calls into question his democratic credentials. He is clearly out of step with the region, the European Union and other world democracies. Thaksin would be wise to place principles ahead of profit with respect to Thailand's relationship with Burma."
