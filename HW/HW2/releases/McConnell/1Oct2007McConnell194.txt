SENATE PASSES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING MILITARY JUNTA IN BURMA
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) joined Senator John Kerry (D-MA) in introducing a resolution in the U.S. Senate on Monday condemning the tyrannical State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) for its use of violence against the peaceful protestors in Burma.  
   The resolution, which passed the Senate Monday evening, calls on the SPDC to immediately cease attacks against ethnic minorities, release Aung Sang Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners, and begin a meaningful tripartite political dialogue with Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy, and the ethnic minorities. 
   It also urges China to remove its objections to efforts by the United Nations Security Council to condemn the actions taken by the SPDC against the peaceful demonstrators, and to suspend military assistance to the SPDC until civilian democratic rule is restored in Burma. 
   "I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in expressing our support for the people of Burma and condemning its brutal regime," said McConnell. "This resolution reflects the Senate's grave concern about the deteriorating situation in Burma, and it tells those living there that the American people have not forgotten about them. We are committed to keeping the pressure on this dictatorial regime, continuing to call for an end to attacks against ethnic minorities, and promoting democracy and reconciliation in Burma."
