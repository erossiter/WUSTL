BIPARTISAN PROPOSAL FOR BORDER SECURITY, IMMIGRATION REFORM
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the bipartisan proposal on border security and immigration reform:  
   "It's encouraging to see a group of Senators from such a wide arc of the political spectrum reach an agreement on one of the most difficult issues facing our nation. The need to secure our borders, and to have a real security infrastructure in place is critical; it's a requirement for my support of any legislation. I believe the agreement is far stronger than the bill the Senate produced last year. I will review the text of the bill and I hope to be able to support it when the Senate turns to this issue next week."
