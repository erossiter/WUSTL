REPUBLICANS ADD BORDER SECURITY FUNDING TO DEFENSE BILL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement on the Senate floor Wednesday regarding the Senator Graham's border security amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill:  
   "I'm extremely pleased the Senate is about to adopt Senator Graham's border security amendment to this bill, and I'm proud to be a co-sponsor. 
   "We got the message earlier this year: Americans want a strong and secure border. 
   "Now we'll be sending them a $3 billion down-payment on it. 
   "The border is our first line of defense; the Graham Amendment is intended to make sure we don't lose sight of that, and our adoption of it proves that we haven't. 
   "Thanks to this amendment, we'll soon have thousands more agents patrolling the border, three hundred miles of vehicle barriers, and 105 ground-based radar cameras. 
   "We'll finish hundreds of miles of fencing that we already promised to build. 
   "And we'll have the funds to remove and detain potentially dangerous illegal immigrants for overstaying their visas, and illegally re-entering the country. 
   "To Republicans, it's simple: there is no defense without a strong border first. And I think most Americans agree. 
   "I hope the amendment will be adopted overwhelmingly."
