SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOUSE DEMOCRATS' MOST RECENT, INADEQUATE FISA PROPOSAL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the House Democrats' most recent, inadequate FISA proposal:  
   "The House Democratic leadership's plan to gut the terrorist surveillance legislation will not adequately protect the nation. The Senate has already demonstrated opposition to any bill that does not provide the intelligence community with the necessary tools to hunt terrorists or protect patriotic companies that may have assisted the government. If the House sends yet another inadequate bill to the Senate, let me make one thing clear: it will not 'move the ball forward' as some has suggested; it will only further delay the protections the intelligence community needs to adequately protect the nation from terrorist attacks. 
   "The Senate held numerous hearings and votes on this legislation, and an overwhelming majority of the Senate has rejected this flawed approach. Voting on this inadequate and doomed legislation is not the same as taking action--it is simply more delay, and another day of obstructing the bipartisan majority of the House from acting on the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond security legislation. 
   "The Protect America Act expired nearly two months ago; surely the House Democratic leadership won't go on spring break for two weeks without finishing their work in a responsible way."
