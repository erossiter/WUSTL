SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF LT. GEN. PEAKE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the President's nomination of Lt. General James Peake (Ret.) as Secretary of Veterans Affairs:  
   "The men and women who have sacrificed so much to protect our security and freedom represent the best our country has to offer. We hold our veterans in the highest regard and it is my expectation that the new Secretary of Veterans' Affairs will work every day to ensure they have the best care in the world, and to identify and correct any areas where the VA has fallen short in its duty to our nation's veterans. 
   "In meeting with Gen. Peake I will ensure he is a worthy advocate for the men and women who have served our country. The Senate must do its part and consider the nomination of Gen. Peake through a fair but complete hearing and floor debate - followed by a vote - so that our veterans continue to receive the care and attention they deserve."
