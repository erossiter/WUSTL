SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF AMBASSADOR KIRKPATRICK
Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday on the death of Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick: 
 "Few people did more to win the Cold War than Jeane Kirkpatrick, and few can match the courage that she brought to defending freedom and American interests around the world. She was a warrior for human rights, for freedom and for her nation. Few have or ever will match her service to our nation. We, and millions around the world, are in her debt."
