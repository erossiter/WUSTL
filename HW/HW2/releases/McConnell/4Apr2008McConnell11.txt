SEN. MCCONNELL: LET'S HEAR FROM GENERALS, NOT JUST MOVEON
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday in response to the Democrat leadership's letter to the President and the General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker hearings next week: 
   "Rather than hear from our ambassador about the political and economic progress in Iraq, and rather than listen to the Petraeus plan for safely drawing down troops in Iraq, the Democrat leadership is relying on a letter to paper over the disparate views in their party.
   "While Democrats are divided on how best to assuage MoveOn, the military has described the safe way to return troops to the U.S. without abandoning an ally or our regional interests. Ambassador Crocker and Gen. Petraeus will be here next week, and I intend to listen to their report on progress and their recommendations for how best to lower troop levels in Iraq. We should allow them to speak."
