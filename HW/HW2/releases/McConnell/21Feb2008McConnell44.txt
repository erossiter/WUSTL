GRAYSON COUNTY TO GET NEW VA OUTPATIENT CLINIC
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that the Department of Veterans Affairs has selected its location for the new community-based outpatient clinic in Grayson County, Ky.  
   The VA has decided to build the community based outpatient clinic at 611 West Main Street in Clarkson, Ky. According to the VA, the facility will provide health care to more than 13 thousand veterans living in Grayson and surrounding counties, and is expected to have more than 30 people on staff. 
   "With the selection of the site for Grayson County's community-based outpatient clinic, the VA has taken a positive step forward in meeting the needs of Kentucky's men and women who have served in uniform," McConnell said. "Once constructed, this clinic will improve health care access and the quality of life for our veterans." 
   Earlier today, Senator McConnell spoke with VA Secretary Lt. General James Peake about the Grayson County clinic and was told it is on track to open this year. "This is great news for Kentucky's veterans and I appreciate Secretary Peake for recognizing the importance of this clinic to our deserving veterans," McConnell added. 
   The VA is also opening community based outpatient clinics in Daviess and Madison counties in Kentucky.
