SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell today released the following statement on passage of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act: 
   "Today, the Senate passed a bill to strengthen our borders, reform guest-worker programs that benefit employers and our economy, and deter illegal activity. I believe more work needs to be done to improve the bill as Congress considers it further. However, this is a necessary first step to balancing our tradition as a nation of immigrants, but also a nation of laws."
