SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON CORNYN SECURITY AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Friday after Senate Democrats blocked a vote on a critical amendment to the 9/11 Commission bill:  
   "By blocking a vote on an amendment aimed at strengthening our national security, Senate Democrats have diminished the ability of our law enforcement agencies to go after terrorists in the U.S. I am disappointed Senate Democrats refused to work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure both sides received votes on amendments to strengthen essential national security legislation. If we are going to continue to make strides in the global War on Terror, we must work together to ensure the safety and security interests of Americans are protected."
