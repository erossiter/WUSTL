SEN. MCCONNELL REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Following the President's State of the Union Address, U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called on his colleagues to build on the legislative successes of last year by working together to address a number of issues that are important to the American people.  
   "Tonight, we in the Congress are recommitted to moving our nation forward. 
   "There are many things we can do right now to protect America at home, and now is the time for Congress to act. 
   "We need to work together to pass key national security legislation which will help keep America safe from terrorist attacks. 
   "We need to protect our long-term economic interests by keeping taxes low so that hardworking American families can keep more of the money they earn, and providing relief to the small businesses that are the cornerstone of our economy. 
   "And Congress can provide peace of mind to Americans about their health care, by increasing access to quality, affordable health coverage. 
   "The problems we face are urgent and real. But we can solve them together. 
   "Americans expect us to sort through our differences and produce results. 
   "We must build on our successes from last year and continue to work together toward our common goal of protecting America."
