SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $15 MILLION FOR KENTUCKY IN FY'08 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his requests of over $15 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, included in the FY'08 Interior Appropriations bill, now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell used his seniority on the Appropriations Committee to direct funding to the following Kentucky projects:  
   * $1 million for the Green River Valley Water District project in Hart County. "I am pleased to secure funding for this important project" said Senator McConnell. "These funds will help expand access to clean water in rural Hart County." 
   * $600,000 for the Monroe County Water District. "I recognize the need for improved drinking water supplies in Monroe County," said Senator McConnell. "This funding addresses that need and will be used towards the construction of a new water treatment plant at the Cumberland River." 
   * $500,000 for the Western Kentucky University Small Public Water Technology Center. "WKU provides necessary support for small public water systems across the Commonwealth, and this funding will enable the university to continue this important service," said Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell has delivered $4.45 million for this project in previous years. 
   * $800,000 for the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. Of that amount, $500,000 will be used for land acquisition from willing sellers and $300,000 for construction equipment. "The Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge, which will use the money to expand and improve its land, serves as a safe haven for the bald eagle and peregrine falcon," said Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell has delivered $13.45 million for the refuge in previous years. 
   * $1.25 million for the Daniel Boone National Forest. Of that amount, $350,000 will be used for land acquisition and $900,000 will be used by the Forest Service to continue marijuana eradication operations. "I am pleased to have once again secured funds for the preservation and expansion of the Daniel Boone National Forest," said Senator McConnell. "Additionally, this funding will be used by the Forest Service and local law enforcement agencies to continue their work to identify and destroy marijuana plants on or near national forest land." Senator McConnell has delivered $18.4 million for the DBNF in previous years. 
   * $350,000 for improvements to the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in LaRue County, Kentucky. Funds will be used to make improvements to the Abraham Lincoln Boyhood Home at Knob Creek, which is a part of the National Historic Site. "Efforts to preserve President Lincoln's birthplace will ensure that a part of Kentucky's heritage is saved," said Senator McConnell. "With the bicentennial of his birth approaching next year, these funds will help make the site ready for everyone to enjoy." 
   * $1.9 million towards the acquisition of Fern Lake by the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. "The Cumberland Gap National Park is a popular tourist attraction and these funds will ensure that Fern Lake, which is visible from the Pinnacle Overlook, remains a protected watershed for future generations to enjoy," said Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell has delivered $1.9 million for this project in previous years. 
   * $661,000 for the Kentucky Forest Legacy Marrowbone Creek State Forest Project. The Commonwealth has identified property in Metcalfe County, Kentucky, that is ideal for funding under the Forest Legacy Program. The tract includes several tributaries that feed into the biologically diverse Upper Cumberland River Valley and Green River watersheds and a number of hardwood timber stands. "This funding will be used towards the purchase of a tract of land in Metcalfe County for the establishment of the Marrowbone Creek State Forest," said Senator McConnell. "The Forest Legacy program assists in protecting critical forest resources and ensuring good forest stewardship to sustain these resources." 
   * $8.1 million from the U.S. Forest Service for management and operation of Land Between the Lakes (LBL). The funding will be used for continued operation of the recreational facility located in western Kentucky. "I, along with many Kentuckians and visitors to our state, recognize the attraction to the LBL," said Senator McConnell. "I am pleased to have once again secured funding for the continued operation of this popular tourist spot." 
   * $750,000 for the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research (CPBR) of which the University of Kentucky is a member. "This funding will enable students and educators at UK to be on the front lines of innovation as they conduct biotechnology research that can be transferred to the marketplace," said Senator McConnell. 
   The FY'08 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
