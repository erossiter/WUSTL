SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FISCAL COURT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request for $200,000 in funding for the Montgomery County Fiscal Court, which will be used by the agency to upgrade its current E-911 capabilities.  
   The funding is included in the Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   Earlier this year, the Montgomery County Fiscal Court informed Senator McConnell that it would like to purchase E-911 computer aided dispatch equipment, which will help the County emergency services agencies better respond to incidents more rapidly and efficiently. 
   "Law enforcement agencies rely upon modern technologies for everything from enforcing traffic laws to investigating crimes," said McConnell. "The Montgomery County Fiscal Court informed my staff about its needs to upgrade the E-911 equipment. I am pleased to have secured this funding which will enable the Department to purchase the equipment that will help them better respond to emergencies." 
   The Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Conference Report will now be sent to the President for his signature.
