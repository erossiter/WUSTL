SENS. MCCONNELL, BUNNING, REP. WHITFIELD ASK DOE TO LOOK OUT FOR BEST INTERESTS OF PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT WORKERS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, along with Sen. Jim Bunning and Rep. Ed Whitfield, sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman today to inquire about his plans to re-enrich depleted uranium at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky.  
   In the letter, McConnell, Bunning and Whitfield expressed their beliefs "that any plan pursued be in the best interests of the Paducah community, the plant's workforce, and the taxpayers." 
   There are currently 39,000 cylinders of depleted uranium hexafluoride stored at the facility. A number of these cylinders contain uranium with assay levels high enough to make it economically feasible to re-enrich. Officials have said this material may potentially be worth between $750 million and $2 billion. 
   In the letter, the members stated they "believe that the Department of Energy should examine the opportunities available to realize the value of this uranium in a manner that serves the interests of the Paducah plant's workforce, the community, and the taxpayer. We also believe that any plan to re-enrich the uranium stored at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant should require that this work be conducted in Paducah. We would respectfully request that the Department provide an outline of the various options currently under consideration and how each would impact Paducah."
