SEN. MCCONNELL: AMERICA WILL CONTINUE TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement on Monday after a bipartisan group of Senators introduced the America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act:  
   "We need to do more to keep the jobs of the 21st Century here in America and make sure that our children have the skills to keep our country at the forefront of innovation. The America COMPETES Act directs funding to strengthen educational opportunities in the critical areas of math and science and encourages our young people to pursue careers and strengthens curriculum in those fields. I appreciate the hard work of all the Senators involved to create a comprehensive bipartisan solution that continues America's efforts to strengthen innovation and entrepreneurship here at home."
