SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR SEVERAL LOUISVILLE DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $94.575 million for the Louisville area. The funding is included in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill, which the full Senate may consider as early as this week. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill:
   * $79 million for United Defense and Raytheon in Louisville. This funding will be used for naval gun work at both facilities. The projects at United Defense include: $10 million for Mk 45 Mod 4 5" guns to modernize the Navy's large caliber gun systems; $16 million for Mk 45 5" gun overhauls; $15 million to develop and test the weapons system for the Coast Guard's Deepwater Vessel and Navy's Littoral Combat Ship; $10 million for Minor Caliber Gun Production; and $8 million for Mk 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tube Remanufactures. Raytheon would receive $20 million to upgrade the Block 1B Configuration of the Phalanx Close-in Weapons Systems (CIWS).
   * $8 million for the McConnell Technology Training Center (MTTC). By applying innovative technologies and products, MTTC has helped to save the U.S. Navy billions of dollars in maintenance and repair costs.
   * $7.575 million for the University of Louisville. Senator McConnell secured $1 million for continued research on the Army's lightweight vehicle development; $4 million for the Nanoscience Army Missile Defense Initiative; $1.575 million for the U.S. Air Force Center for National Security Research; and $1 million for Biometric Signatures Research.
   "While this is just the first step in the funding process, I am hopeful these projects will remain in the final bill," said McConnell. "Kentucky's military installations, universities and defense manufacturers play a vital role in the war on terrorism and American national security, and it is imperative that they receive the financial support necessary to continue their work to support our troops here and abroad."
