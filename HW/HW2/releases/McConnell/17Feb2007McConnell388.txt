SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF REP. GENE SNYDER
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the death of Rep. Gene Snyder:  
   "Elaine and I are saddened by the death of Gene Snyder. Congressman Snyder was an outstanding leader, tireless public servant and a man of great character. I will always remember Gene as the man who gave me my first real opportunity in politics. In the summer of 1963, I served as an intern in his Capitol Hill office and I learned a lot from watching him work. I will always be grateful to him for giving me that experience. I also enjoyed the times we worked together on behalf of the people of Jefferson County - a community that he truly loved. Gene will be missed."
