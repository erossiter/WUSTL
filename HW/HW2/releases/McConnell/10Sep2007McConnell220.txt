SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. HAGEL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the announcement by Senator Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) that he will retire at the end of the 110th Congress:  
   "Chuck Hagel is one of the few genuine foreign policy experts in the Senate and an independent, serious voice on many of the most challenging issues we face. He is a patriot who proved his dedication on the battlefield, a skilled entrepreneur, a dedicated father, husband, and friend-a man who has served his country and the people of Nebraska as a solid conservative. We wish him success in all his future plans. He will be missed."
