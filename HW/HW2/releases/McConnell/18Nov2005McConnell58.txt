SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES $15.4 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FY'06 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his requests for $15.4 million in military construction funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, now goes to the President for his signature.  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   Fort Campbell ($8.3 million) 
   * $8.3 million for improvements to the Main Gate Access Control Point (Gate 4). The current main gate access control point does not meet current Department of the Army Physical Access Control Point standards and lacks active and passive barriers, permanent shelter from inclement weather, and a visually screened area. This project would replace the existing gate with a five-lane entry, two-lane exit facility that includes a gatehouse and active and passive barriers. 
   "This funding will help improve access to Fort Campbell which is one of the nation's top military installations," said McConnell. "This project will help with enhanced security as well as improving congestion around the Post." 
   Fort Knox ($7.1 million) 
   * $1.3 million for construction of a Heavy Equipment Transport Access Road. Public highways currently are used to transport combat vehicles to some of the installation's training areas. This not only causes more rapid deterioration of the highways but also poses serious safety risks. This project will rebuild and pave approximately 3.8 miles of an existing but impassable training area access road so that combat vehicles can access training areas without using public highways. 
   * $1.2 million for improvements to the Godman Airfield JP8 Storage Tank Facility. The aboveground JP8 fuel storage facility at Godman Airfield has a capacity of 30,000 gallons. When aviation units, including the 101st Airborne Division and Special Operations Forces, visit the installation to perform training exercises, they often exhaust the fuel supply quickly. Increasing the capacity of the JP8 fuel storage facility to 90,000 gallons will give aviation units the ability to better utilize the installation's training ranges and to facilitate joint operations training activities. 
   * $4.6 million for improvements to Battalion Dining Facilities. The funds will be used to improve dining facilities at the installation, which will be needed as Fort Knox prepares for the arrival of a brigade combat team. 
   "Thanks to the recent implementation of the BRAC recommendations, Fort Knox will once again be the home of combat troops," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the base to complete much-needed transportation improvements and upgrade its dining facility, which will greatly enhance the quality of life for current and future troops at the base." 
   The FY'06 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
