SEN. MCCONNELL WELCOMES ROGER WICKER TO SENATE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday welcoming Roger Wicker to the U.S. Senate: 
   "Gov. Barbour made a great choice, and Roger Wicker's many years of public service in the military, the State Senate and in Congress will help him have an immediate impact in the Senate." 
   Wicker was appointed Monday by Governor Haley Barbour to fill the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Senator Trent Lott. Although a Senator upon appointment by the Governor, he will be officially sworn in when the Senate reconvenes on January 22.
