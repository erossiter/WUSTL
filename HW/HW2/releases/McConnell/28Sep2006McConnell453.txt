SENATE CLEARS CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding Senate passage of the Military Commissions Act:  
   "Passage of this legislation ensures that a critical component of our national security efforts can continue. This legislation recognizes that we are a nation at war. We are not conducting a law enforcement operation against a check-writing scam or trying to foil a bank heist. We are at war against extremists who want to kill our citizens, cripple our economy and discredit the principles we hold dear - freedom and democracy. Al Qaeda respects no law, no authority, no legitimacy but that of its own twisted strain of radical Islam. 
   "This is wartime legislation. Armed with these tools, the President will be able to continue the terrorist interrogation program that we know has saved innocent American lives. The tribunal system codified in this legislation protects our troops, protects classified information and protects the rights of defendants. And most important, it protects America. Interrogation of high-value detainees will continue providing intelligence and helping to prevent terror attacks on the U.S."
