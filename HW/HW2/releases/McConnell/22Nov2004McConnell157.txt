SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR NORTHERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1.5 million for projects at Northern Kentucky University.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   "The research being conducted at Northern Kentucky University is helping prepare students to join the twenty-first century workplace," said McConnell. "NKU has earned this funding, and I am honored to deliver this appropriation for this fine institution." 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for NKU: 
   * $500,000 for the NKU Institute for New Economy Technologies (iNET). Senator McConnell secured these funds to help NKU develop the infrastructure necessary to equip students to work in a new economy based on technology, hardware and software, and communications systems, rather than the traditional industrial and manufacturing industries. The University will use these funds to train faculty, develop new coursework, and implement technology-rich teaching environments. 
   * $1 million for the NKU/UofL Digital Science Center. NKU is working with UofL to establish a Digital Science Center and Stellar Command Center to teach astronomy and geology to college students and to increase interest in these sciences among elementary and secondary school students. Funds in FY'05 will be used to expand on this project by taking a hands-on astronomy program to schools through mobile and transportable units. Senator McConnell provided $1.7 million for this partnership in FY'04. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
