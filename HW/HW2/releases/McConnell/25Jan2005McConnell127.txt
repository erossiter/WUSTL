SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE
  Today on the Senate floor, Sen. Mitch McConnell praised President George W. Bush's nomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State.  
 During his speech, Sen. McConnell declared his "unqualified support for the president's nominee to be America's 66th Secretary of State." 
   Senator McConnell said, Dr. Rice "has excelled in the foreign policy arena for 25 years and served three Presidents. She has built lasting, personal relationships with world leaders and foreign policy makers worldwide. She has been one of the main authors of America's new approach to foreign policy in the aftermath of September 11. Most importantly, she has the complete trust and confidence of the president, and is perfectly poised to follow his leadership as America promotes freedom and democracy across the globe." 
   McConnell added, "Dr. Rice is the ideal person to lead the State Department at this time. The department's mission will be to shatter the barriers to liberty and human dignity overseas, and Dr. Rice has already broken many barriers in her relatively short lifetime." 
   The Senate is expected to vote on the nomination of Dr. Rice on Wednesday, January 26, 2005.
