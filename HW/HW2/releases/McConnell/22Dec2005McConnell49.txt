SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $95 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FY 2006 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. McConnell announced today that the Senate approved his requests for over $95 million in funding for several Kentucky defense-related projects. The funding, included in the FY'06 Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report, now goes to the President for his signature.  
   "I am pleased to have secured funding for Kentucky's military installations, defense facilities and universities" said Senator McConnell. "The federal money will allow Kentuckians to conduct important defense-related research and production activities to benefit our troops at home and abroad." 
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, brought home money for the following projects: 
   * $40.65 million for naval gun work at BAE Systems (formerly United Defense) and Raytheon. BAE Systems will receive $13 million to overhaul Mk 45 Mod 5" Gun Mounts; $7 million to upgrade Mk 4 5" Guns; $8.4 million to transition production of the 57mm MK 110 Gun to Louisville; $1.75 million to remanufacture Mk 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes; and $2.1 million to support the Minor Caliber Gun System. Raytheon will receive $8.4 million to produce Phalanx SEARAM systems. Since FY'98, Senator McConnell has provided nearly $300 million for these projects. 
   * $7.3 million for research projects at the University of Louisville. UofL will use $2.1 million to continue its work on the Nanowire Technology for Missile Defense project; $1.4 million to continue its partnership with the United States Air Force on the Signature Exploitation project; and $2.8 million to continue its research into biometric signatures. Senator McConnell previously has provided $8.9 million to support these projects. UofL also will receive $1 million to support a new project to develop software to assist the Army in developing vehicles. This new project uses some information gathered from the IMPACT project, for which Senator McConnell delivered $5.6 million over the past six years. 
   * Over $2.1 million for research projects at the University of Kentucky. UK will receive $1.1 million to continue its research in the field of minimally invasive surgery and $1 million to continue its partnership with Fort Knox to develop a rapidly deployable visualization center. Senator McConnell previously has earmarked $5.9 million for these projects. Also, the Advanced Carbon Nanotechnology Program Consortium will receive $3.5 million. UK is a member of the consortium and is expected to receive a share of the secured funds. 
   * $2 million for Fort Knox. Senator McConnell earmarked $1 million to continue to create crossroad cluster communities that will enhance training for soldiers; he provided $750,000 for this project last year. The installation also will receive $1 million to make improvements to the Christiansen Grenade Range. 
   * $7 million for naval research at the McConnell Technology Training Center. The MTTC helps the U.S. Navy reduce shipboard operations and maintenance by applying innovative products and technologies, and Senator McConnell has earmarked nearly $47 million for the MTTC in previous years. 
   * $2.52 million for the Kentucky National Guard Marijuana Eradication Program. The Kentucky National Guard partners with local law enforcement agencies to identify and destroy marijuana plants grown in and around the Daniel Boone National Forest. Since 1998, Senator McConnell has secured $22.7 million (excluding the $2.52 million secured in FY'06) for the Kentucky National Guard's participation in this program. 
   * $2.7 million for defense work in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. Senator McConnell secured $2.7 million for Ensign-Bickford, a manufacturing company with a facility in Muhlenberg County, to produce rapid wall breaching kits for the military. 
   * $2.1 million to support military efforts to recognize and respond to bio-threats. Accella Learning, a Lexington-based technology company, has been working with the Army to develop an intelligent tutoring system to help train military medical teams to respond to victims of biological and chemical warfare. Accella will use the funds earmarked by Senator McConnell to validate and test this system at Fort Campbell. 
   * $9.6 million to support the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment at Fort Campbell. Senator McConnell secured $1.9 million for Personnel Locator Systems and $7.7 million for MH-47 Infrared Suppressors. This equipment is critical to protecting the lives of the elite 160th Special Operations troops. 
   The bill also includes authorizing language and an additional $20 million for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA) program, which is responsible for disposing of chemical weapons currently stored at the Bluegrass Army Depot outside Lexington and the Pueblo Depot in Colorado. The Bluegrass Army Depot is expected to receive a portion of the secured funds. 
   The FY'06 Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
