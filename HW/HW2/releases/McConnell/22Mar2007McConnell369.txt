SUPPLEMENTAL SHOULD FUND TROOPS, NOT TELL THEM THEY'VE FAILED
 U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding arbitrary timetables for Iraq troop withdrawals attached to the emergency war supplemental:  
   "This bill should be about providing our troops in the field with the resources they require to prevail. Regrettably, the Democrat leadership chose instead to make it into a message to our troops and the Iraqis that their mission won't succeed. 
   "Just last week this very same measure was firmly rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Senate. To include this language again is to effectively block funding for our troops. We will oppose this poison pill; we will oppose this measure that ties the hands of our generals and publicly announces a withdrawal date to the enemy. We will, however, continue to give General Petraeus the support and resources necessary to complete his important mission."
