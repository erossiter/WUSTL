SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY NARCOTICS TASK FORCE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $200,000 for the Hopkinsville-Christian County-Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force Partnership.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   The Narcotics Task Force Partnership is a collaboration that includes the Hopkinsville Police and Fire Departments, the Christian County Sheriff and Police Departments, and the Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force. The funds will be used to purchase technology to link the agencies and help first responders better serve the members of the communities during an emergency. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues approved my request for this important funding which will enable the agencies to purchase technology to help them share information in a timely manner and improve public safety for Christian County families," said McConnell. "I was impressed by Christian County's plan to unite various counter-drug assets to better fight this scourge. The citizens of Christian County will be the biggest winners as a result of this cohesion and funding." 
   In previous appropriations bills, Senator McConnell has secured nearly $3 million to support the efforts of local law enforcement agencies across the Commonwealth. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
