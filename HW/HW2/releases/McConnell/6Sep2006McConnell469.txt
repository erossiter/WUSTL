SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON TERRORIST DETAINEE LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement today regarding the President's proposed legislation for terrorist detainees held in Guantanamo Bay:  
   "While ensuring terrorist defendants detained at Guantanamo receive basic fairness, we also must ensure that we do not compromise national security or put classified intelligence information into the hands of terrorists. The administration's proposal does a good job of striking that balance. And it's important to remember, these defendants are not common criminals. Rather, many are terrorists, sworn enemies of the United States who would gladly use any information to harm us, and any opportunity to strike us again."
