SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES MORE THAN $108 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his requests of more than $108 million in funding for several Kentucky defense, research, and training projects. The funding is included in the FY'05 Defense Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to the President for his signature. 
   "Kentucky was a huge winner in this year's defense bill," said Senator McConnell. "I am pleased to have secured funding for these projects, which will help Kentucky's military installations, universities and defense manufacturers continue their important work of supporting our troops at home and abroad."
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following earmarks in the Conference Report:
   * $64.2 million for naval gun manufacturing at United Defense and Raytheon in Louisville. The funding will be used to upgrade weapons technology systems, including the modernization of the Navy's large caliber gun systems and production of ship self defense systems.
   * $6 million for naval research at the McConnell Technology Training Center in Louisville. By applying innovative technologies and products, the MTTC has helped to save the U.S. Navy billions of dollars in maintenance and repair costs.
   * $6.3 million for defense and research projects at the University of Louisville. The funding will be used for several projects, including continued research on the Army's lightweight vehicles and research into new sensor technologies to improve military intelligence.
   * $6 million for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment at Fort Campbell that will be used to protect Chinook helicopters from missile attack.
   * $3.25 million for Fort Knox for troop training and support. The funding will be used for several projects, including training soldiers for urban combat.
   * $2.5 million for defense and research projects at the University of Kentucky. The funding will be used for virtual simulators to help researchers and military personnel train soldiers for combat in urban environments and to assist military surgeons with surgical and combat techniques.
   * $2.7 million for the Kentucky National Guard to conduct marijuana eradication in the Daniel Boone National Forest. The Guard's program includes aerial surveillance, eradication and interdiction support.
   * $2.3 million for production of a Weapons Shot Counter for the Special Operations Command by Accu-Counter in Kenton County. The funding will be used to enhance the ability of the Special Ops Forces to gauge the wear and reliability of their weapons.
   * $5.3 million for development of the Army's Rapid Fuel Transfer System by KECO Industries in Florence. The funding will be use to support research and testing of a new bulk fuel transfer system that will reduce the time it takes the U.S. Army to deploy existing fuel lines.
   * $4.5 million for production of an Obstacle Breeching System for the Marine Corps by the Ensign-Bickford Company in Muhlenberg County. The funding will be used to manufacture the portable rocket propelled weapon system, which is designed to destroy land mines and wire obstacles during assault breaching operations.
   * $5.1 million for APR-39A Radar Warning Receiver which will provide early warning to Marine Corps pilots of CH-53E helicopters of enemy radar directed weapons systems. In addition, this receiver integrates and displays warnings for other threat sensors on the aircraft, such as missile and laser warning systems.
