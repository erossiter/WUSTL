SEN. MCCONNELL: 'I CANNOT SUPPORT ENDING DEBATE ON THIS BILL WHEN THERE ARE STILL SO MANY ISSUES TO CONSIDER'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement after voting to extend debate on the comprehensive immigration reform bill to ensure adequate consideration of amendments to improve the bill:  
   "Immigration reform is one of the most important issues facing our nation and it deserves our full consideration. Rushing this bill benefits no one. 
   "The Senate cannot call immigration 'complete' if, we've not been able to offer amendments to improve and strengthen the reform. Progress on such an important issue should not be measured by calendar days, but by Senators having the opportunity to debate and vote on their ideas to improve the bill. 
   "At the beginning of this session, I challenged the Senate to come up with a solution on immigration. I count myself among those who want to mark this as a Senate accomplishment. But I cannot support ending debate on this bill when there are still so many issues to consider."
