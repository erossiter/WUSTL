SEN. MCCONNELL: UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL VOTE SHOWS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STANDS SOLIDLY BEHIND BURMESE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement today following the United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution supporting national reconciliation in Burma:  
   "I am heartened that, for the first time, the United Nations Security Council has taken up and considered a resolution supporting national reconciliation in Burma. The measure was supported by a majority of the Council. It is unfortunate that China, Russia and South Africa voted against the resolution. Those countries have mistakenly concluded that the threat posed by Burma to the region and its neighbors does not merit action by the Security Council. Nonetheless, the vote taken by the Council sends a message that the international community stands solidly behind Burmese national reconciliation. Fellow supporters of Burma and I will not rest until that goal is a reality."
