SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the Majority Leader's commitment to move three more circuit court nominees by Memorial Day: 
   "I was encouraged by the Majority Leader's commitment to confirming three more circuit court nominees by Memorial Day. That will bring the total for the 110th Congress to 10, and it is a good step toward reaching the goal that we outlined at the beginning of this Congress of reaching the historical average.
   "Because of the Majority Leader's good faith commitment, I'm confident that we'll have these three additional nominees confirmed by Memorial Day."
