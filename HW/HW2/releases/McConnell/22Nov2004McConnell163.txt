SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of nearly $16.7 million for projects at the University of Kentucky. The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature.  
   This brings the total amount earmarked by Senator McConnell for UK in FY'05 to more than $19 million. Since 1998, McConnell has delivered more than $77 million for research initiatives at UK. 
   "The funding I set aside for UK is an indication of just how qualified the University has become at performing state-of-the-art research in a variety of fields," said McConnell. "Dr. Todd and his faculty are to be commended on their achievements." 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for UK: 
   * $3 million for the design of an Agriculture Research Service (ARS) lab, which will house the Forage Animal Production Research Unit. This federal research lab is the first of its kind in Kentucky. 
   * $2.83 million for the UK Forage-Livestock Systems Project in conjunction with the ARS and $393,000 for the UK Forage for Advancing Livestock project for a total of $3.223 million. This funding will enable UK researchers to continue their study into the nutritional value of new forages for livestock. 
   * $850,000 for UK's Health Education Extension Leadership (HEEL) Program. The HEEL program links UK's School of Public Health with the College of Agriculture. This program uses the expertise from both schools to develop and implement programs designed to improve the health of the communities they serve. Since 2002, Senator McConnell has provided more than $3.3 million for this effective public health program. 
   * $680,000 for UK's Precision Agriculture Research Unit. Precision Agriculture allows researchers to use satellites to help farmers measure the amount of seed, fertilizer and water they need for their land, thus enabling them to increase the productivity and eliminate crop inefficiencies. Since 1999, Senator McConnell has secured more than $5 million for this cutting edge agricultural technology. 
   * $730,000 to explore new crop opportunities. This funding will allow Kentucky farmers to be on the cutting edge of the changes taking place in the global marketplace and allow them to emerge as leaders in this field. Since 2000, McConnell has earmarked just under $4.3 million for this initiative. 
   * $650,000 for UK's Advanced Genetics Technology Center. This funding will be used to study ways to eliminate plant and animal diseases, enhance nutritional and health value of foods, and develop new uses for agriculture plants and animals. Since 2001, McConnell has delivered just over $3 million for the center. 
   * $1.5 million for Equipment for the UK Neuroscience Research Institute. UK is constructing a new biomedical research building to provide additional research and lab space for the University's premier research programs, particularly programs investigating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and brain and spinal cord injuries - areas of research where UK is a recognized leader. The University will use the funds Senator McConnell secured to help purchase three pieces of core research equipment that will support neuroscience and neurodegenerative disease research at the new facility. 
   * $1.3 million for the UK Consortium for Applied Oral Health Research and Treatment project. Senator McConnell secured these funds to help UK establish the Kentucky Consortium for Applied Oral Health Research and Treatment by partnering its Center for Oral Health Research and its Center for Rural Health (which has facilities in Hazard, Morehead, and Madisonville) with Trover Foundation in Madisonville. Developing dental facilities at each of these sites will provide the Consortium with the infrastructure necessary to educate dental professionals, provide state-of-the-art clinical care for patients in these communities, and enhance outreach research capabilities. 
   * $1 million for the UK Improving Medication-Related Outcomes Project at the Medication Use Decision Support Center. The University will use the funds Senator McConnell secured to continue to help doctors and patients identify the most expensive and frequent medication errors and develop strategies to prevent them. Senator McConnell has delivered an additional $2 million to the University to support these efforts in previous years. 
   * $1 million for the University of Kentucky Rural Drug Prosecution Assistance Project. The University of Kentucky College of Law will use these funds to help the Commonwealth of Kentucky fight drug-related crime by providing law students to Commonwealth Attorneys, U.S. Attorneys, the Kentucky Attorney General, public defenders, and circuit court judges that serve in rural areas, particularly where methamphetamine manufacturing is an increasing problem. Currently, the prosecution system in Kentucky is unable to keep pace with the rapidly growing methamphetamine problem, and these students will be able to assist the criminal justice system in battling this illegal drug crisis. 
   * $500,000 for Abandoned Mine Reforestation project. The UK Abandoned Mine Land Reforestation project provides an opportunity to convert currently unproductive land to a valuable environmental and economic resource. With new reclamation techniques, as well as proper treatment and management, these areas can be a highly valuable source of hardwood timber. It also improves wildlife habitats and creates jobs in a region that has been plagued by chronic unemployment. Senator McConnell has secured $4 million for this project in previous appropriation bills. 
   * $1.5 million for the Consortium for Fossil Fuel Science (CFFS), of which UK will receive $300,000. CFFS is a five-university research consortium that includes UK. CFFS is conducting a research program in the field of C1 chemistry, which is focused on the conversion of feedstocks such as synthesis gas (syngas) produced from coal or natural gas, methane, methanol, and carbon dioxide into ultra clean, high efficiency transportation fuel and hydrogen, which will be required by cars powered by fuel cells. 
   * $3 million for the Center for Advanced Separation Technology (CAST), of which UK will receive $428,500. CAST is a consortium of seven top mining schools, including UK, focused on developing new technologies to reduce the cost of separations in coal, metals, and industrial mining operations. The industry seeks advanced technologies to separate coal from waste rock near the point of extraction, which is particularly important for mining the thinner coal seams in the Appalachian region. Not only will new technologies produce cleaner coal, but the recovery of minerals in an environmentally acceptable manner also should improve. 
   * $1.5 million for UK's transportation research. The University will use the funding secured by Senator McConnell to support the UK Transportation Center, which develops technology to improve the safety of commercial vehicles. 
   "Each year, the University of Kentucky conducts important research into medical, agricultural and environmental technologies that are vital to our future," said McConnell. "UK deserves this funding and I was honored to secure this funding for this fine institution." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
