AMERICAN PEOPLE SET NEW ECONOMIC RECORD
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement following a record-setting 49 months of consecutive job growth:  
   "This report is a milestone, showing the American economy has created jobs for 49 consecutive months, breaking the record set under President Reagan. Smart economic policies led principally by a lowered tax burden created the economic environment necessary for sustained growth, and the American workforce took it from there. 
   "Some in Washington have proposed turning back the clock and socking our hard working families and small business with higher taxes and more regulation. I couldn't disagree more. I can assure our workers that Republicans will stand firm against any such effort to stop economic progress in its tracks." 
   Background 
   This is the first time the milestone of 49 consecutive months of job growth has ever been reached.
