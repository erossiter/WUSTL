SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON REAUTHORIZATION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today following Senate's passage of the Voting Rights Reauthorization Act:  
   "America's history is a story of ever-increasing freedom, hope and opportunity for all. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 represents one of this country's greatest steps forward in that story. Today I am pleased the Senate reaffirmed that our country must continue its progress towards becoming a society in which every person, of every background, can realize the American Dream. With the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, we are recommitting ourselves to that Dream."
