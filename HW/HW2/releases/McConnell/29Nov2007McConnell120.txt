SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORMER REP. HYDE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the passing of former Illinois Representative Henry Hyde: 
   "Today we lost a true statesman. As a committed warrior in the fight to protect the unborn, Henry Hyde gave a voice to those who were unable to speak for themselves. His legacy exceeds his years as a legislator, and expands far beyond the borders of the district he served and the nation he adored."
