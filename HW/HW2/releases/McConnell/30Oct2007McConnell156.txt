SEN. MCCONNELL: SEVEN MORE YEARS OF TAX-FREE INTERNET ACCESS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Tuesday regarding House passage of a seven-year extension of the Internet tax moratorium. The tax relief measure passed in the Senate last week by a unanimous vote.  
   "Internet users across the country have Sen. Sununu and others to thank for keeping Internet access tax free and ensuring economic growth and innovation can continue without government interference for an additional seven years. By passing the Senate's seven-year tax relief, the House agreed that the four-year ban was insufficient. But our job is not finished - we must continue to fight to ban taxes on Internet access-permanently."
