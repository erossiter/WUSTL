SEN. MCCONNELL: 'OUR ENEMIES AREN'T THREATENED BY TALK-A-THONS'
  U. S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday in response to the Democrat-sponsored talk-a-thon, which will delay consideration of further amendments to the Defense Authorization Bill:  
   "While Republicans are focused on the dangers posed by al Qaeda in Iraq, and the warnings that the United Nations and Baker-Hamilton Commission have given in recent days about the consequences of withdrawal, Democrats plan to spend the next 24 hours in what they have described as a 'publicity stunt.' This issue is far too serious to waste the next day on 'publicity stunts.' This is a serious issue, and deserves serious consideration. 
   "Our enemies aren't threatened by talk-a-thons, and our troops deserve better than publicity stunts."
