SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING SPENDING RESTRAINT FOR REMAINING APPROPRIATIONS BILLS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor Monday regarding spending restraint for the remaining appropriations bills: 
   "House Democrats will soon propose a half-trillion dollar spending bill.
    "They've left it to the Senate to make sure that bill includes troop funding.
   "And we've got another responsibility to keep in mind as we wait for the House to act -- and that's our responsibility to the taxpayers.
   "Nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, we're still 11 appropriations bills short --that's out of a total of 12 bills.
   "We need to act on these, but do so in a fiscally responsible way that ensures they become law.
   "As I've said, and as we've all seen here, there's a way to make law and there's a way to make a political statement.
   "On these appropriations bills, the middle-class tax hike known as the AMT, the Farm Bill, the energy bill, and FISA updates so that we can track terrorists and prevent attacks, the path forward is clear.
   "The only question now is whether Democrats will take it."
