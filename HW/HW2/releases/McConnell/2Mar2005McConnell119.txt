SEN. MCCONNELL RECEIVES 'GOLDEN PLOW' AWARD FROM AMERICAN FARM BUREAU
  Sen. Mitch McConnell today received the "2004 Golden Plow" award from the American Farm Bureau Federation.  
 AFBF President Bob Stallman and Kentucky Farm Bureau President Sam Moore presented the award to Sen. McConnell during the KFB delegation breakfast in Washington, D.C. 
   The Golden Plow award is given annually to one Senator and one Congressman who best represents America's farm interests. Senator McConnell also received the Golden Plow in 1996. In fact, he is one of only 5 senators to win the award twice. "I want to thank my friends from the American Farm Bureau Federation for this great honor," said Senator McConnell. "I have worked hard this year on behalf of Kentucky's farm families, and I am grateful for this recognition." 
   Senator McConnell added, "many long hours of tough negotiations went into securing a tobacco buyout for our farmers, and I am pleased to have led this effort. Kentucky farmers know they have a friend in Washington, and they can count on me to continue to fight for them in the U.S. Senate." 
   Senator McConnell is the Senate Majority Whip - the second-ranking Republican in the U.S. Senate - and a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee.
