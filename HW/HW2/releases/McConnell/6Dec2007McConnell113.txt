DEMOCRATS DELAY ENERGY REFORM WITH TAX HIKES, UTILITY RATE INCREASES
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the House-passed energy bill:  
   "Democrats in Congress are determined to pass an energy bill which will drive up the price of energy for working Americans. I simply can't understand why the majority would take a simple, bipartisan energy bill, and slow it down by hanging the twin millstones of tax hikes and utility bill increases around its neck. 
   "Unfortunately, Congressional Democrats chose to completely disregard the bipartisan agreement negotiators had within reach. Instead of working together to increase the use of renewable fuels and raise fuel economy standards to historic levels without costing American jobs, Democrats added controversial provisions that will increase energy prices and will ultimately be vetoed."
