AMT FIX WELCOME, LONG OVERDUE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Wednesday regarding the House passage of the Senate AMT fix:  
   "Republicans provided the path forward to stop the middle class tax hike known as the AMT. Some Democrats in Congress insisted on a permanent tax increase for some Americans to temporarily stop the AMT from grabbing money from the wallets of millions of middle class Americans it was never intended to affect. If some Democrats had pursued this bipartisan path from the beginning, rather than insisting for months on a tax hike, millions of Americans wouldn't be facing a delay in their tax return. 
   "Passage of the AMT patch without tax hikes is a bipartisan accomplishment, but one that could and should have been achieved many months ago."
