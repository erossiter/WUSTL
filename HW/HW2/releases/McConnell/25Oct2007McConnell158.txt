SEN. MCCONNELL: DEMOCRATIC HOUSE LEADERSHIP SAYS 'NO' TO BIPARTISAN SOLUTION, 'YES' TO POLITICS
  On Thursday, U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the flowing statement regarding House passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and the urgent need to responsibly reauthorize this program: 
   "Today the Democratic leadership of the House missed a real opportunity. They said 'yes' to politics and 'no' to a bipartisan solution.
   "Senate Republicans are committed to finding common ground on this issue, but we cannot do it alone. We must forge a bipartisan compromise to maintain current coverage and extend coverage to additional low-income kids which the President can sign."
