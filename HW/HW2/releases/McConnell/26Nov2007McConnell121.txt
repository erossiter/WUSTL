SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON SEN. LOTT'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO RETIRE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the announcement by Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss.) that he will retire from the Senate: 
   "Mississippi has been fortunate to have a series of giants in the Senate, and they will lose one of the greatest when Trent retires. Mississippi will miss his tireless advocacy, the Senate will miss his experience and advice, and I will miss a good friend.
   "Trent is the best Whip I've ever worked with, and I'm pretty familiar with the requirements of the job. I am deeply grateful for Trent's friendship-he is truly one of the great ones.
   "Elaine joins me in wishing Trent and Tricia all the best as they begin this new chapter in their lives and with their family."
