SEN. MCCONNELL SAYS AGREEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IS 'WITHIN OUR REACH'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday following the President's remarks on a short-term economic growth package: 
   "There is an increasing, bipartisan agreement that an economic growth package must be aligned with our long-term economic interests to ensure maximum effectiveness. And surely we can agree that raising taxes and increasing the size of government are not viable solutions to combat slowing economic growth.
   "Bipartisan discussions as to what the growth package should contain are underway, and agreement is within our reach. If we can work together to keep partisanship from infecting this process, we can quickly have a significant accomplishment to start the year-and a template for making law, not just making a point."
