SEN. MCCONNELL ELECTED SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER
  Sen. Mitch McConnell was selected by his colleagues today to serve as Republican Leader for the 110th Congress. Sen. McConnell will assume the post and lead the Senate Republicans when the new Congress convenes in January of 2007. Following today's leadership elections, Sen. McConnell thanked his colleagues for their support and said he's ready for the job ahead:  
   "I am honored and humbled that my colleagues elected me to serve as the Republican Leader in the 110th Congress. This is one of the greatest recognitions the Senate can bestow upon one of its own and I am thankful for the trust my friends have placed in me. And to my Democrat friends: Today we extend the hand of bipartisanship and will work with you to move America forward. We'll be there to support you when we agree, and we'll have a good, honest debate when we disagree." 
   The last Senator from Kentucky to serve as his party's leader was Alben Barkley. Senator Barkley (D-KY) served as majority leader for nearly 10 years, from 1937 to 1947, longer than anyone else before him. From 1947 to 1949 he served as minority leader, and in 1948 he was elected vice president to President Truman.
