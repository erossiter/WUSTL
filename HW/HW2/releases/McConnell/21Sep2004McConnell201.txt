SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR LAND BETWEEN LAKES, CLARKS RIVER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his requests of over $9 million in funding for the Land Between the Lakes (LBL) and Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge.  
   McConnell's requests of $8.4 million for operational costs at LBL and $750,000 for construction of a maintenance facility at the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge are included in the FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   The funding for LBL will be used for continued operation of the recreational facility located in western Kentucky. The money for the Clarks River National Wildlife will be used to build a maintenance facility that will provide the shelter and space necessary to protect and prolong the life of construction equipment. 
   "The Land Between the Lakes and the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge are two of Kentucky's top tourists destinations," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the facilities to continue to provide their outstanding service to the millions of tourists who visit the recreational spots each year." 
   The FY'05 Interior Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
