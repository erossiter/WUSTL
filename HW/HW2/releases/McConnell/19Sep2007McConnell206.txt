SENATE REJECTS DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Wednesday after the Senate defeated the Webb Amendment: 
   "All of us agree that our forces must be rested, trained and equipped, which is why this underlying bill continues the expansion of the nation's Army Corps and Marine Corps. However, to tie the hands of our military commanders to deploy forces is a dangerous precedent."
