SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF RUTH BELL GRAHAM
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding the death of Ruth Bell Graham:  
   "As a devoted wife and mother, and a trusted counselor to many, Ruth Bell Graham lived the life her husband preached. Her books and teachings were an inspiration to generations of Americans. And her quiet acceptance of suffering and illness toward the end of her journey were a powerful witness to the Gospel she loved. A child of missionaries, Ruth was prepared early on for the challenges that come with being a missionary's wife. And like the Biblical heroine whose name she shared, she followed the path of faithfulness wherever it led. We mourn with the Graham family, and all Americans, at the loss of this good and faithful servant."
