SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate floor today on the situation in the Middle East regarding Israel and Hezbollah:  
   "Israel is America's longstanding friend and an ally in the War on Terror. In fact, the horrors of September 11 awoke many in this country to what Israelis have faced daily for many years. That country has been and continues to be on the front lines in the War on Terror. 
   "I support Israel's efforts during this intense time to do whatever it takes to defend her people and her borders. Maybe some have forgotten, but the terrorist group Hezbollah killed 241 American servicemen and women in Beirut in 1983. 
   "Hezbollah's love of death and destruction is on a par with Al Qaeda. They are enemies to every peace-loving, democratic country. They are a threat, and Israel is right to pursue them wherever they exist."
