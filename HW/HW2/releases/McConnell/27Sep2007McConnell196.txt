SEN. MCCONNELL: INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM SHOULD BE MADE PERMANENT
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made the following statement Thursday on the need to make the Internet Tax Moratorium permanent, and prevent a tax increase on innovation:  
   "Congress should act now to permanently ban taxes on Internet access. Americans' Internet access bills shouldn't begin to resemble their phone bills, with countless separate taxes and fees. Taxing Internet access raises costs to consumers while discouraging innovation, and we should act now to block these taxes permanently. The Congress should encourage innovation and broadband deployment, not tax the life out of it." 
   McConnell also announced that he will cosponsor S. 156, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007. 
   The moratorium on Internet access taxes is set to expire on November 1, 2007. The Senate Commerce Committee is expected to address the issue later today.
