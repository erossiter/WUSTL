MEDICARE MUST BE STRENGTHENED TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued the following statement today on the Bush Administration's proposed legislation required by the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act to bring fiscal stability to the Medicare program:  
   "Medicare is a critical source of health insurance for millions of America's seniors. Yet because of demographic changes like the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation, the program needs to be strengthened so it can continue to serve the needs of older Americans and the disabled. This point was driven home by the Medicare Board of Trustees' recent report to Congress. 
   "This afternoon, the President sent Congress legislation that includes common sense solutions to address some of the challenges facing Medicare. It includes limits on frivolous medical liability lawsuits - which drive up health care costs and have caused good doctors to limit their medical practices in places like my home state of Kentucky. This plan would also limit the premium subsidies to those who can afford them. Most importantly, this plan does not include any benefit cuts that could limit seniors' access to health care. 
   "We should use this opportunity to show the American people we can work together to secure the future of the Medicare program while implementing reforms that decrease costs and improve coverage. This legislation can and should be a bipartisan accomplishment. 
   "I have designated Sen. Gregg to introduce this legislation. As Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg has focused on entitlement reform and long term fiscal responsibility, making him the natural choice to take the lead on this issue."
