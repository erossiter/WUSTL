SENATE PASSES SEN. MCCONNELL LEGISLATION IMPOSING DEADLINE ON CLEANUP EFFORTS AT BLUE GRASS ARMY DEPOT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that the full Senate adopted his amendment to the FY '08 Defense Authorization bill. McConnell's measure imposes a deadline of 2017 on the Department of Defense (DOD) to complete disposal of chemical weapons at the Blue Grass Army Depot (BGAD). Without this amendment, DOD has indicated it would not finish disposal at BGAD before 2023.  
   "Ensuring the safe and expedited cleanup of the dangerous weapons stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot is one of my top priorities," McConnell said. "We all know that DOD will not complete its work promptly without pressure from Congress and I intend to apply that pressure until the work there is done." 
   McConnell added, "I am hopeful that the members of the House of Representatives will also support this crucial provision." 
   Senator McConnell's amendment gives DOD ten years to complete its work on chemical weapons disposal at the Blue Grass Army Depot. And just last week, he attached a similar amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   "This project is too important to the people of Kentucky and I will continue to take every opportunity to accelerate disposal efforts at the Blue Grass Army Depot," McConnell said. 
   The FY '08 Defense Authorization bill is expected to be on the Senate floor for the next several days. If passed, the bill goes to a House-Senate conference for consideration.
