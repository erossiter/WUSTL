SEN. MCCONNELL: 'SURELY THIS ISN'T THE CONSENSUS POSITION OF SENATE DEMOCRATS'
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the Majority Leader's claim that the war in Iraq 'is lost':  
   "I can't begin to imagine how our troops in the field, who are risking their lives every day, are going to react when they get back to base and hear that the Democrat Leader of the United States Senate has declared the war is lost. I can't begin to imagine what their families will think. Surely this isn't the consensus position of Senate Democrats. 
   "If the war is already lost, if it is already time to declare defeat, then why wait another year to do it? Why not simply vote against funding now? Why would anyone ask American soldiers to stick it out for another year if they think the battle is already over? 
   "If Democrats want to end this war, they should vote against funding it. That would clearly end the war. But that is not what is going to happen. They will wait another year. They will supply and equip our soldiers to fight a war they think they have already lost."
