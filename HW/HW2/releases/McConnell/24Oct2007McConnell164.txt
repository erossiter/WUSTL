SEN. MCCONNELL: INTERNET TAX BAN SHOULD BE MADE PERMANENT
  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday regarding the Sununu Amendment to make the internet tax moratorium permanent: 
   "Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for offering this important amendment. We are running out of time.
   "The internet tax moratorium does expire in a week, as the Senator from New Hampshire has indicated. State and local governments across our country could impose taxes on internet access as soon as a week from now.
   "I think it's important that we address this issue. Not that the underlying measure is not important as well. I know it is important to many senators. But the internet needs to be protected.
   "Here's our chance to go on record: are we for a tax on internet access or not?
   "The internet's been at the heart of America's economic growth over the past decade, all because government hasn't gotten in the way. Those days are over if we open the internet to new taxes.
   "I think there is bipartisan support for a permanent ban, for continuing the moratorium forever.
   "And I think the Senate ought to have an opportunity to go on record on that. And the only way, Madam President, in the parliamentary situation that we find ourselves in that a vote on a permanent moratorium could be achieved is if I were to offer a motion to invoke cloture, which I send to the desk now, on the Sununu amendment."
