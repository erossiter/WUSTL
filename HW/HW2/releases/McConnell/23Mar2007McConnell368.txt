SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON FINAL PASSAGE OF DEMOCRATS' BUDGET
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday after the passage of the Senate Democrats' tax-and-spend budget:  
   "This budget is the opposite of good fiscal sense, making it more difficult to cut taxes, but much easier to increase government spending. We pledged at the beginning of this Congress to work together across party lines to accomplish great things for our country. This budget does not live up to that promise. Instead, it lays out a blueprint for reverting back to the tax-and-spend policies of the past that stifled economic growth and unfairly strained America's working families. 
   "With this budget, Senate Democrats have allowed the government to continue its consumption of the money earned by hardworking Americans, while simultaneously asking taxpayers to cough up an extra $736 billion out of their own wallets. This budget is a mistake. If we are asking our families to cut back, then government must cut back as well."
