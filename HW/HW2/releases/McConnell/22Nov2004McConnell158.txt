SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR OWENSBORO WATERFRONT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $5 million for the Owensboro Waterfront Development Project.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   "I recently had the opportunity to visit Owensboro and I was impressed with the city's waterfront," said McConnell. "This funding will enable the city to continue its work to make the waterfront a community gathering spot." 
   McConnell has secured $4.55 million for the Owensboro Waterfront Development Project in previous appropriations bills. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
