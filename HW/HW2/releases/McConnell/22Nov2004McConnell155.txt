SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR LOCKS, DAMS IN WESTERN KENTUCKY
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of more than $100 million in funding for locks and dams in western Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for locks and dams in western Kentucky: 
   * $69 million for the Olmsted Lock and Dam project. This funding will be used for the continued construction of a new facility that will replace locks 52 and 53 on the Ohio River. Once complete, this facility will be the largest locking facility in Kentucky in terms of tonnage. 
   * $32.5 million for the Kentucky Lock and Dam project. This funding will be used to double the lock's size to handle the increased tonnage of today's larger barge traffic. 
   "This funding will be used to upgrade the Olmsted and Kentucky locks and dams which will help deal with the increased barge traffic, which in turn will provide significant economic benefit for the entire region," said Senator McConnell. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
