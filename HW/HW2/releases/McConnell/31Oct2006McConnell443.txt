SEN. MCCONNELL: PRESIDENT'S MULTILATERAL APPROACH IS WORKING
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding North Korea's intent to return to multilateral talks, and the President's diplomatic leadership in the region:  
   "The President resisted calls from his critics to give in to North Korea's demands--understanding that this threat could only be met by a unified international response--and instead worked with the international community to apply international pressure on Kim Jong Il's dangerous, criminal regime. This multilateral response is working. 
   "The President was right to call for additional, tough measures at the United Nations, and the first results are clear. His decision to have the response to this threat be a multinational response was the right one." 
   U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is the Senate's Majority Whip, and chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations subcommittee.
