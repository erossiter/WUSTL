SEN. MCCONNELL'S AMENDMENT SHOULD PUT DISPOSAL OF BLUE GRASS ARMY DEPOT WEAPONS ON TRACK TO BREAK GROUND NEXT YEAR
  Today, the Senate agreed to an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill authored by Sen.  
 Mitch McConnell that should ensure that ground is broken at the Blue Grass Army Depot next year. 
   DOD had requested FY 2006 funds for chemical weapons disposal at Blue Grass Army Depot and Pueblo Depot, Colorado for Research & Development (R&D) purposes instead of construction purposes. The McConnell Amendment would permit R&D funds to be used for construction activities - thus permitting a 2006 groundbreaking. 
   "My provision provides $51 million for construction purposes, which should put us on a path to begin preliminary work at Blue Grass Army Depot next year," said McConnell. "After 20 years of working closely with the local community to ensure the safe and efficient disposal of chemical weapons, that is very encouraging news." 
   This legislative effort comes on the heels of a provision Senator McConnell inserted into the recent Supplemental Appropriations bill that: 1) prevented DOD from using funds intended for Blue Grass and Pueblo at other facilities; and 2) forced DOD to begin spending funds at both sites immediately.
