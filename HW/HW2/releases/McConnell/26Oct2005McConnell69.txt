SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR BLUEGRASS-ASPENDALE HOUSING COMPLEX
  Sen. Mitch McConnell today announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has approved a $20 million HOPE VI federal grant to be used to revitalize the Bluegrass-Aspendale housing complex in Lexington, Kentucky.  
   Earlier this year, Senator McConnell spoke with HUD Secretary Alfonso Jackson on the merits of the redevelopment of the Bluegrass-Aspendale housing complex. "This is great news for the people of Lexington," said McConnell. "This project is important to the community, and I was thrilled when Secretary Jackson called me today to report that Lexington's request will be fully funded." 
   The Bluegrass-Aspendale housing complex is the last remaining barracks-style, multi-family housing project in Lexington. "Many of the current units are poorly configured, extremely small, and are showing the effects of aging," added McConnell. "This funding will allow the city to construct high-quality housing options for families in need." 
   City officials say the funds will be used to demolish the existing units and replace them with a mixture of housing options. Once complete, they expect the complex to feature 260 mixed-financed rental units, single-family homes, a new elementary school and a new community center.
