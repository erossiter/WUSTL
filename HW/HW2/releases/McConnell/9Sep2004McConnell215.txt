SEN. MCCONNELL INCLUDES $5.63 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that a Senate subcommittee has agreed to his request of $5.625 million for agriculture projects at Western Kentucky University.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee as well as the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, included the following funding in the bill: 
   * $2.3 Million for the design of an ARS lab at WKU. Senator McConnell included $2.3 million for the design of an Agriculture Research Service (ARS) lab, which will house the Animal Waste Management Research Unit. 
   * $2.925 Million for Animal Waste Management Research. Kentucky is a top producer of both beef and poultry products, leaving the state susceptible to agricultural waste management problems. WKU will use the funds to work in conjunction with the ARS to examine ways to prevent contamination from waste products and to keep livestock production levels from dropping. 
   "Today's action is the first step in a long process, but I am hopeful a federal agriculture research lab will be constructed on the Western campus," said Senator McConnell. "Researchers at Western Kentucky University are developing new ways to dispose of animal waste, which is important for the long-term safety and sustainability of Kentucky's agricultural products and livestock." 
   Senator McConnell also included $400,000 for a cooperative agreement between WKU and the Natural Resources Conservation Service to conduct water quality monitoring initiatives. 
   The FY'05 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill must now be considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee before going to the full Senate for approval.
