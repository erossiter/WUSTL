SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR KNOBS STATE FOREST PROJECT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1.2 million for the Forest Legacy Knobs State Forest project.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   Kentucky recently established a Forest Legacy Program, a national program to protect forest resources and to ensure good forest stewardship. The Commonwealth identified property in Bullitt County, Kentucky, that is ideal for funding under the Forest Legacy Program. The property, referred to as the Kuhn tract, lies in an area that is quickly becoming a developed residential area and is also adjacent to the 14,000-acre Bernheim Research Forest. 
   "This funding will enable the Forest Legacy Program to protect this land located near Bernheim Forest and use it for educational and recreational activities," said McConnell. "I was pleased to have secured funding for this important project." 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
