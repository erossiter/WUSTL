SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON EXTENSION OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI'S DETENTION
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement today on the extension of Aung San Suu Kyi's detention: 
   "The junta's apparent decision to extend Aung San Suu Kyi's detention for another year is inexcusable. Nothing more clearly reflects the predatory nature of this regime than its keeping this heroic, Nobel Prize Laureate under house arrest. It also demonstrates that more pressure rather than less needs to be exerted on this regime by the international community."
   Senators McConnell and Dianne Feinstein will soon introduce the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which is reauthorized annually and prohibits imports from Burma unless the regime takes a number of clear, concrete steps toward democracy and reconciliation. The legislation currently has 50 cosponsors.
