REPUBLICANS IMPROVE ENERGY BILL, ENSURE BIPARTISAN PASSAGE
  U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor Thursday regarding a Republican modified bipartisan energy bill: 
   "First, I want to thank the Senators from New Mexico, as well as Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, for all their hard work on this legislation, and for their dedication in seeing it through.
   "The final product is not perfect, but it's vastly better than the version that was sent to us by the House. We recognized here in the Senate that the House bill couldn't pass the Senate and wouldn't be signed into law. So we fixed it. And now it will.
   "The new fuel economy standards and the increase in renewable fuels represent a step forward in our common effort to make America more energy independent.
   "And this is something we can all be proud of as we leave here to go home for the holiday recess.
   "This is a good accomplishment - achieved, as everything good in the Senate always is, by cooperation between the parties.
   "What we've done on this bill, we've done together. And in a year that's seen its fair share of partisan tensions, that's no small accomplishment either.
   "So again I want to congratulate the managers of the bill, and I also want to thank my friend the Majority Leader for bringing it back to the floor in a form that guarantees it'll get passed and then signed into law.
   "I'm extremely pleased about this bipartisan accomplishment.
   "And I'm extremely pleased that we're about to show the American people we still have it in us to come together as a body and achieve consensus on an issue that affects all of us."
