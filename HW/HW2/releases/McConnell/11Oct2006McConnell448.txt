SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE, N. KOREA, SHRINKING DEFICIT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statements after the President's press conference Wednesday:  
   On North Korea: 
   "The world is watching and the UN Security Council must act quickly to impose tough sanctions against North Korea. And though I'm encouraged by China's recent statements on North Korea, it's time for them to actively support the effort to sanction their neighbor and provide stability to the region. President Bush took the lead in calling for the Security Council to impose tough sanctions against North Korea, and our ambassador, John Bolton, is leading the charge at the UN. We need to continue to pressure other countries, including China, to support these sanctions and encourage North Korea to participate in nuclear talks. 
   "This should not be a political issue, and certainly Americans don't want anyone playing partisan politics with the threat of nuclear weapons. And I would encourage the President's critics to look past the next election, and focus instead on a multi-national solution to this threat. 
   On the shrinking budget deficit: 
   "The latest budget numbers show that tax relief is doing exactly what we said it would do. Since we passed the President's tax relief package, millions of new jobs have been created, the economy has undergone significant growth, and now the deficit is shrinking faster than anyone could have predicted. Tax relief works. Those who promote heaping new taxes on families and businesses don't seem to understand that. But the economy, and millions of people in newly created jobs, do."
