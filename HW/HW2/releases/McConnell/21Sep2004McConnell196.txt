SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CITY OF RADCLIFF
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $880,000 for the city of Radcliff, Kentucky.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured $880,000 for the City of Radcliff to purchase law enforcement equipment, which will provide increased safety for officers and will allow the police to better communicate with the fire and public works departments during an emergency. 
   "This funding will enable the City of Radcliff to purchase emergency equipment so its law enforcement officers can better protect and respond to the members of the community," said McConnell. 
   The FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
