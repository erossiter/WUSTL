SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON NEED TO PROVIDE PRESIDENT WITH TOOLS HE NEEDS TO PREVENT ATTACKS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the President's speech and the need for the Congress to provide him the tools necessary to prevent terrorist attacks: 
   "The President made a powerful speech and is right to continue pressing Congress to provide him with the tools he needs to prevent terrorist attacks before they happen. 
   "Though some have tried to focus the remaining legislative schedule on attacking the President, surely we can all agree that focus should be on attacking al Qaeda, and on providing the tools necessary to succeed in that effort."
