SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BURMESE JUNTA LEADER'S VISIT TO INDIA
  Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement today on Burmese junta leader Than Shwe's visit to India:  
   "It is absolutely appalling that the world's largest democracy is embracing one of the world's most repressive and illegitimate military juntas. The community of democracies should expect more from one of its members. 
   "The short-term gains from Than Shwe's visit serve only the interests of the thugs in Rangoon - and not the people of Burma. The timing of this trip, coming in the wake of a power play within the illegitimate State Peace and Development Council, sends the wrong message at the wrong time. 
   "I hope it is not lost on India's leadership that their long-term interests are best served by a Burma rooted in democracy, freedom and justice. India has served as an exemplar for nonviolence and should do more for those Burmese who continue to courageously and nonviolently struggle for democracy."
