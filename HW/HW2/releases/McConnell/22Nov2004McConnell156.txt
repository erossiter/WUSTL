SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR MAYFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $160,000 for the Mayfield Police Department.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured $160,000 for a computer-aided dispatch system for the Mayfield Police Department. The system will allow dispatchers to locate the origin of 911 calls on a map and assist responding units. This funding will enable police to respond more easily and provide increased security for the residents of Mayfield. 
   "I am pleased that my colleagues approved my funding request for the Mayfield Police Department," said McConnell. "This critical funding will allow the Department to purchase a computer-aided dispatch system to help them better protect and respond to emergencies because they will know the origin of the 911 calls." 
   In previous appropriations bills, Senator McConnell has secured nearly $3 million to support the efforts of local law enforcement agencies across the Commonwealth. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
