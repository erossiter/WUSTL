SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES $750,000 IN FUNDING FOR HARDIN COUNTY WATER DISTRICT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $750,000 in funding for the Hardin County Water District.  
 McConnell's request is included in the Senate FY'05 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, obtained $750,000 for the Hardin County Water District's Water Quality Assurance Plan and System Improvements Project. The District will use these funds to ensure that the water it supplies to customers is safe and clean and to improve existing infrastructures. 
   "The Hardin County Water District No. 2 serves over 13,000 families, but because of tremendous residential and commercial development in the region, the District has struggled to maintain its infrastructure," said McConnell. "This funding will help provide upgrades to existing services, which will help the District continue to provide high quality water and cost-effective service to the families in the area." 
   The full Senate must now approve the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.
