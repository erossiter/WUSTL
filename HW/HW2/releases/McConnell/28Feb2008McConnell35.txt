ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO KENTUCKIANS WITH QUESTIONS ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS PAYMENTS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has set up a toll-free rebate hotline to provide assistance to Kentuckians with questions on the economic stimulus payments.  
   Earlier this month, Congress passed, and the president signed, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, containing a provision that gives taxpayers a rebate check, depending on an individual's income. 
   Employees at the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Office, located in Louisville, KY., will be available to answer questions in regards to the Economic Stimulus Package. More than 1.8 million Kentucky families are expected to begin receiving rebate checks later this year. 
   Constituents with questions may contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Taxpayer Advocate Office at their toll-free rebate hotline, #1-866-234-2942.
