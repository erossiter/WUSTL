SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON ANNOUNCEMENT BY SEN. DOMENICI THAT HE WILL RETIRE AT END OF 110TH CONGRESS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Thursday regarding the announcement by Senator Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) that he will retire at the end of the 110th Congress:  
   "I've always said that if I was asked to make up a list of the top five Senators I've ever served with, Pete Domenici would be on that list. He is a giant, and New Mexico has never had a more forceful advocate. 
   "Over the next year, Pete will continue to serve his state and nation as New Mexico's voice in the Senate. Elaine joins me in wishing Pete and Nancy well as they enter this new chapter in their lives."
