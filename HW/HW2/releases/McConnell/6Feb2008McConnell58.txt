SEN. MCCONNELL COMMENTS ON STORM DAMAGE ACROSS KENTUCKY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks Wednesday on the Senate floor:  
   "Mr. President, I want to start today by acknowledging the tragedy that has befallen several states in the South, including my home State of Kentucky. According to news reports, rare winter storms have struck across Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi. 
   "News reports indicate at least 44 people have been killed. Seven of those were in my state-four in Allen County, which is down along the Tennessee border; and three in Greenville, which is in Muhlenberg County in the western part of the Commonwealth. 
   "Thousands more are left with damaged or destroyed property or are without power. The authorities are still working to determine the extent of the damage. 
   "I ask my colleagues to join me in praying for the families of the victims, and to all who have been touched by these terrible storms. State and local officials are working as hard as they can to survey the destruction, and get help to anyone who needs it."
