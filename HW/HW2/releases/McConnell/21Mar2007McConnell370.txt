SEN. MCCONNELL: 'WE WILL NOT RETREAT FROM THIS FIGHT'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader made the following statement on Wednesday after Democrats revealed their intention to attach arbitrary timelines for troop withdrawal to the emergency supplemental:  
   "Just last week a bipartisan majority of Senators firmly rejected the same arbitrary timetables for Iraq troop withdrawal that Democratic leaders now want to put in the emergency bill that funds our troops in the field. 
   "Setting an arbitrary withdrawal date will discourage our allies and the millions of brave Iraqi men and women who have dared to stand with America in this fight and encourage our terrorist enemies. We must not risk providing our troops the equipment and supplies they need to carry out their mission by including this risky Democratic leadership retreat plan, this poison pill. We owe our troops better than that. 
   "We sent a clear message last week to our enemies in the War on Terror and to the Iraqi people that America will not retreat from this fight. We will continue to give General Petraeus the support and resources necessary to complete his important mission."
