LEAVING IRAQ TO TERRORISTS WON'T MAKE U.S. MORE SECURE
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding the Democrat 'hearing' on Iraq:  
   "The Democrat leadership, whose plan for Iraq is retreat, seems to forget what the 9/11 Commission made clear: if we leave Iraq before it is secure, it will become a breeding ground for attacks against Americans at home. 
   "What you won't hear at the Democrat event is where they stand on the Patriot Act, the Terrorist Surveillance Program, the CIA interrogation program and other tools that have successfully prevented attacks--tools which they have opposed and obstructed. 
   "This 'hearing' is simply another partisan media event. And while it may rile up their liberal base, it won't kill a single terrorist or prevent a single attack."
