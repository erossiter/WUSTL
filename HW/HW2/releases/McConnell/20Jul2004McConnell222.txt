  Statement Of U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell On Construction Of A DUF-6 Conversion Facility At Paducah
   "In 2002, I authored legislation requiring the Department of Energy to begin construction of a DUF-6 conversion facility at Paducah by July 31, 2004. DOE's announcement today means that the agency will be able to honor this commitment to the community. I look forward to attending the groundbreaking next Tuesday in Paducah and will continue working with DOE to see that the conversion plant begins operations as soon as possible."
