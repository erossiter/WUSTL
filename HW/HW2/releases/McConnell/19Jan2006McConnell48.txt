SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE ALITO
  Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today in support of Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States: 
   "Judge Alito is one of the finest judicial nominees I have seen in my two decades of service in the United States Senate. During his confirmation hearing, he exhibited dignity, patience, and fair-mindedness - personal qualities which led seven of his fellow judges to appear before the committee to endorse him, and which earned him the ABA's highest rating - unanimously well qualified. Judge Alito will make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice, and I will proudly vote for him."
