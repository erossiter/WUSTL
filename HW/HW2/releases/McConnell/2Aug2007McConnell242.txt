SEN. MCCONNELL CALLS FOR FULL SENATE VOTE FOR JUDGE SOUTHWICK
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement on Thursday following the Senate Judiciary Committee vote to report Judge Leslie Southwick to the full Senate for a vote: 
   "With today's vote to send Judge Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to the full Senate, the Judiciary Committee took a step forward in ensuring we are able to confirm qualified judges to our nation's courts. Judge Southwick is an outstanding jurist, and a bi-partisan majority judged him on his record of service.
   "Judge Southwick, an Iraq war veteran, is superbly fit to continue serving his country, this time on the Fifth Circuit. His colleagues know this, as do his home-state senators. The American Bar Association knows this; it has twice given him its highest rating, 'well-qualified.' Even Democrats on the Judiciary Committee know this; just last fall all of them-again, all of them-looked at his record and approved him for a lifetime position on the federal bench. With today's bi-partisan committee vote for Judge Southwick's nomination, the full Senate should now move forward to his consideration on the Senate floor."
