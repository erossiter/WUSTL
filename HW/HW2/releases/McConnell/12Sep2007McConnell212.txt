SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $14 MILLION FOR KENTUCKY PROJECTS IN SENATE-PASSED TRANSPORTATION BILL
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell - a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee - obtained $14.25 million in funding for Kentucky projects in the FY '08 Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The bill passed this Senate this evening and now goes to a House/Senate Conference Committee for consideration. 
   "This funding will provide local communities with the money they need to upgrade several transportation and infrastructure projects," McConnell said. "Whether it's for renovating the Paducah waterfront, constructing a new industrial park in Murray or upgrading transportation projects in Louisville and northern Kentucky, I will continue to use my seniority in the United States Senate to help bring home funding for important projects in Kentucky."
   McConnell secured funding for the following Kentucky projects:
   * $4 million for the Paducah Waterfront Development Project. This funding will be used to transform the Paducah riverfront into a community gathering place. Senator McConnell previously secured $5.3 million for this project.
   * $2 million for the Paducah Area Transit System (PATS). With this funding, additional vehicles and other equipment can now be purchased to help meet the needs of customers of PATS. McConnell previously secured $4.4 million for PATS.
   * $2 million for the Murray-Calloway County Industrial Park Development Project. These funds will be used to help develop a new industrial park, which will help create employment opportunities for the citizens of Murray and Calloway County.
   * $5.25 million for the Louisville International Airport of which $3.25 million will be used for a runway widening project and $2 million for the advanced technology development and deployment program. The runways at the Louisville International Airport need to be widened to accommodate larger aircraft.
   * $1 million for the Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (TANK) in Fort Wright. These funds will be used by the Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky to replace buses in their fleet. The new buses will help TANK continue to provide reliable service to their many riders.
   The FY '08 Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill now goes to a House/Senate Conference for consideration.
