SEN. MCCONNELL: FREE SPEECH IS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement Tuesday regarding the President's remarks on the Fairness Doctrine: 
   "Last year Democrats expressed support for limiting free speech on the airwaves by seeking to revive the misnamed 'Fairness Doctrine.' Republicans stand ready to protect the First Amendment and stop any efforts to take away a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution. Government is not the speech police and I will not support these efforts to restrict free speech. We should encourage, not silence, political discourse in America."
