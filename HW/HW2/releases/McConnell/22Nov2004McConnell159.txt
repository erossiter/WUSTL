SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of more than $166 million for environment and health initiatives at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature.  
   Over the past five years, McConnell has used his position as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure more than $700 million in funding for environmental cleanup and health initiatives at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. 
   "The cleanup of the Paducah plant remains one of my top legislative priorities," said McConnell. "I am particularly proud that this legislation provides DOE the funds necessary to pursue an aggressive schedule to complete construction of the DUF6 conversion facility in Paducah, which is being constructed due to legislation I authored." 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant: 
   * $112 million for cleanup activities at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This money will be used to fund continued environmental cleanup efforts at the plant. This amount includes funding to accelerate the characterization and disposal of 50,000 tons of scrap metal and 41,000 drums of low-level waste. 
   * $50 million for Depleted Uranium Conversion. In recent years, McConnell authored two federal statutes requiring DOE to build a facility in Paducah to convert 39,000 canisters of hazardous depleted uranium hexaflouride into a more stable compound. On July 27, 2004, DOE began construction on this facility, which will employ 150 individuals when completed. 
   * $4.1 million for Worker Health Monitoring. This funding will be used for continued operation of a mobile health unit that screens current and former workers at the plant for the early signs of lung cancer. The mobile health unit travels between the three gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
