RETREAT, BY ANY OTHER NAME, WOULD BE AS DANGEROUS FOR AMERICANS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding calls from the Democrat leadership to retreat from Iraq before the mission is complete, and their letter to the President:  
   "The Democrat leadership finally agrees on something - unfortunately it's retreat. Whether they call it 'redeployment' or 'phased withdrawal,' the effect is the same: we would leave Americans more vulnerable and Iraqis at the mercy of al Qaeda, a terrorist group whose aim - toward Iraqis and Americans - is clear. 
   "And look, it's important to remember that if the Dean Democrats were in charge, Saddam would still be in power, murdering his own people like he used to, and the Iraqis they talk about in their letter would still be under the boot of a dictator -rather than in voting booth."
