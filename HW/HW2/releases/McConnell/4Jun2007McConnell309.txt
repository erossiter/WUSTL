SEN. MCCONNELL: 'THE SENATE IS A LESSER PLACE WITHOUT CRAIG HERE'
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding the death of Sen. Craig Thomas: 
   "Wyoming had no greater advocate, taxpayers had no greater watchdog, and rural America had no greater defender than Craig Thomas. The Senate is a lesser place without Craig here, but the State of Wyoming and our nation are much better places because he was here. 
   "Elaine and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to Craig's wife, our dear friend Susan. We ask the rest of the Senate family to keep both of them in their prayers."
