PROVACTIVE ACT BY NORTH KOREA MEANT TO DESTABILIZE, SEN. MCCONNELL SAYS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding North Korea's claim of a successful underground nuclear test: 
   "Though it has not yet been confirmed as a nuclear test, this is a confrontational move designed only to destabilize the region. This test should demonstrate to other members of the United Nations Security Council, particularly those in North Korea's neighborhood, that a stronger stance is necessary to restore stability and protect the region and the world from this dangerous regime."
