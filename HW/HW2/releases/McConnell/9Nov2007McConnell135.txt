SEN. MCCONNELL, REP. YARMUTH SECURE FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Congressman John Yarmuth (D-KY3) announced Friday that they secured funding for a defense-related project at the University of Louisville.  
   Senator McConnell and Congressman Yarmuth included $1.28 million for the Digital Directed Manufacturing Project at UofL in the FY'08 Defense Appropriations conference report which passed Congress and is now going to the President for his signature. 
   "This is great news for the University of Louisville," McConnell said. "This funding will enable researchers at UofL to continue their work to help the military produce replacement parts for equipment anywhere in the world, which will reduce maintenance down-time and lower costs." 
   "UofL's work with digital directed manufacturing offers us a revolutionary technology that will significantly reduce the time and money the military spends on manufacturing," Yarmuth said. "I am very proud of the University's ongoing commitment to innovation and pleased that we were able to help with their efforts."
