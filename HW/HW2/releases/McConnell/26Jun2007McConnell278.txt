SEN. MCCONNELL GETS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE HIS REQUESTS FOR $5.8 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that his requests for $5.8 million in funding for several crime-prevention and university projects in Kentucky have been included in the FY'08 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill. Once approved by the full committee, the bill moves to the Senate for consideration. 
   McConnell used his seniority on the Appropriations Committee to direct funding to the following Kentucky projects:  
   * $1.3 million for the University of Louisville Rejuvenating Injured Tissues for Enhanced Wound Healing Project. "UofL plans to use the funding to help identify factors that hinder the wound healing process and then develop counter-measures to eliminate these factors so that wounds can self-heal," said McConnell. The funding, provided by NASA, will be useful to trauma victims who do not have immediate access to traditional emergency medical care, such as astronauts. McConnell secured $1 million for this project in 2005. 
   * $500,000 for the University of Louisville Center for Child Abuse Assessment and Prevention. "UofL officials say that as many as 50 percent of deaths from physical child abuse and neglect are unrecorded," said McConnell. "The university would like to establish a center to develop scientific, objective and reliable methods for detecting child abuse. Only by identifying where and when abuse occurs will we be able to take the necessary steps toward preventing it from happening in the first place." 
   * $850,000 for the Louisville Regional Computer Forensics Lab. "This funding will help UofL purchase equipment and technology for the Louisville Regional Computer Forensics Lab," said McConnell, who previously secured $3 million in 2003 to establish the lab, which is part of the FBI network and is used to process large amounts of data for the agency. 
   * $750,000 for the Western Kentucky University Environmental Monitoring Network. WKU currently operates the Kentucky Climate Center, which is the official State Climate Office. "The university will use this money to continue to develop a monitoring system that will collect real-time observations through a statewide grid of stations," said McConnell. "The center will collect and analyze data, distribute the information over the Internet, and provide applications to support crop and livestock management, drought monitoring, flood warnings, and disaster assessment." McConnell brought home $1.5 million for this project in 2005. 
   * $275,000 for the Barren County Sheriff's Department Communication Improvement Project. "Officers and staff at the Barren County Sheriff's Department work hard to serve and protect the residents in their community," said McConnell. "However, their efforts could be enhanced with modern equipment, especially communication devices. This funding will help the department purchase mobile data terminals and other communication equipment to support its law enforcement efforts." 
   * $150,000 for the City of Murray Police Department. "Law enforcement agencies rely upon modern technology for everything from enforcing traffic laws to investigating crimes. Unfortunately, not all local agencies can afford the expensive technologies that will help officers communicate with each other and better respond to emergencies," said McConnell. "The Murray Police Department is one such agency, and this funding will help it purchase a Computer Aided Dispatch System to improve its ability to alert officers of emergencies and to improve response times, thereby enhancing the safety of all in Murray." 
   * $250,000 for the Ohio County Sheriff's Department Mobile Data Terminal Installation Project. "The Ohio County Sheriff's Department will use the funds to purchase mobile data terminals for their vehicles, which will enhance officer safety, reduce investigation time, improve interaction with the Kentucky State Police, and ensure the security of communication systems," said McConnell. 
   * $750,000 for the Henderson County Sheriff's Department. "Law enforcement personnel work hard every day to provide emergency response services to the citizens of Henderson County," said McConnell. "These funds will enable the department to upgrade the equipment used by its deputies to help make their jobs a little easier," said McConnell. 
   * $500,000 for the University of Kentucky Legal Education Access Program. "UK is hoping to help young people from low-income families in rural Kentucky pursue careers in law," said McConnell. "As a University of Kentucky College of Law alum, I was happy to secure the funding which will allow university officials to visit prospective students in their communities to encourage them to study law. It also will help prepare these students to succeed in law school by offering a program to strengthen writing skills, which often is the most challenging aspect of law school." 
   * $500,000 for the Northern Kentucky University Crime Prevention through Internet Security Solutions Project. "Northern Kentucky University has developed a project that aims to support crime prevention and control by increasing the security of the Internet," said McConnell. "This funding will enable university officials to continue their critical work, which will improve security for online records systems used by law enforcement agencies and court systems." 
   The Senate CJS Appropriations bill must now be approved by the full Appropriations Committee.
