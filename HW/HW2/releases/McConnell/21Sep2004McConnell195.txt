  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $100,000 for the Simpson County 911 Center.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate.
