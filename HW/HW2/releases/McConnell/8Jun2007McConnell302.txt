SEN. MCCONNELL: GEN. PACE NEVER FLINCHED FROM THE CALL OF DUTY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding the retirement of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Peter Pace and his successor, Admiral Mike Mullen, recommended by the Secretary of Defense: 
   "As historians look back upon the horrible attacks of September 11, 2001 and review our nation's response to those horrendous deeds, they will be struck by the faithful service rendered to this nation by General Pete Pace. The President and his Secretaries of Defense have relied upon the integrity, courage and invaluable military judgment of one of our nation's finest military leaders.
   "Pete Pace never flinched from the call of duty to this nation starting from his days as a midshipman, as an infantry commander in Vietnam, and finally as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Pete and his wife Lynne for giving so much of themselves throughout this demanding period.
   "Admiral Mike Mullen has served ably as a member of the Joint Chiefs and has established himself as a capable and strategic leader. I trust the confirmation process for Admiral Mullen will be fair, thorough, and swift."
