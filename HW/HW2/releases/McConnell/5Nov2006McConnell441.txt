SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING VERDICT IN TRIAL OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subcommittee, made the following statement Sunday regarding the verdict in the trial of Saddam Hussein: 
   "This verdict is a reminder, if anyone needed one, of the innocent Iraqis that were murdered and buried in mass graves under Hussein's maniacal regime. It is a reminder of the distinction between the summary executions of Hussein's political prisoners, and the full and fair trial given to their executioners. And it is a reminder of the stark difference between genocide and justice."
