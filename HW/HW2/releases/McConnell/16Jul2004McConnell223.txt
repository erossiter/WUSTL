SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR FORT KNOX
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request for an additional $4.69 million in military construction funding for Fort Knox.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate.
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the following earmarks in the funding bill:
   * $1.85 million for construction of a Shoot House. This funding will allow Fort Knox to construct a re-configurable facility for simulated urban assault training.
   * $1.9 million for construction of an Urban Assault Course. This funding will expand and modify an existing assault course to allow units to train in a simulated urban environment.
   * $940,000 for taxiway and airfield improvements at Godman Army Airfield. This funding will strengthen and widen taxiways to allow expanded operations by heavy cargo aircraft at Fort Knox.
   "In today's environment it is vital that our soldiers are trained to fight in urban settings," said Senator McConnell. "Fort Knox is a leader in urban combat training and this funding will allow the installation to expand and improve their facilities in order to provide the best possible training to our soldiers."
   In addition, Senator McConnell helped protect the following project, which was included in the President's original budget:
   * $50 million for construction of a Barracks Complex at Fort Knox. The Army originally placed this project in the budget at Senator McConnell's request in order to alleviate a shortage of adequate barracks at Fort Knox.
