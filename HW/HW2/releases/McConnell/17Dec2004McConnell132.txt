SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD
  Statement Of U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell On Secretary Of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 
   "Don Rumsfeld is an excellent Secretary of Defense and we are fortunate to have a man of his courage and vision serving the President at this critical time. In the past four years, tyranny has given way to democracy in Afghanistan and the Baghdad dictator who gassed his own people and threatened the world now sits in a narrow jail cell while the country he oppressed plans free elections. This kind of progress is never easy and it's never without deep costs but it is worth it for America and the world. In large measure we have Don Rumsfeld to thank for these successes. And while Secretary Rumsfeld has my full support, more importantly he has the President's."
