PRESIDENT SIGNS SECURE FENCE ACT
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement today following the President's signing of the Secure Fence Act of 2006: 
   "By signing this legislation, the President has taken an important step in securing our borders. The tools in this legislation, coupled with the increased appropriations for border security, will have a real impact on our national security now. This legislation will take us much closer to the operational control of our border that our homeland security requires and provide law enforcement with the tools they need to get the job done."
