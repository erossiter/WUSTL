FINAL SCORE: TAX RELIEF WORKS
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Monday regarding growth in the economy despite the predictions of the President's critics:  
   "It often seems the President's critics are attempting to talk down the economy. But continuing to argue against tax relief after it's clear that it's succeeded in growing jobs and reducing the deficit is a little like cheering for a losing team after the game is over. Despite critics' predictions of doom and gloom, the President was right, and tax relief is doing exactly what we said it would do: More than six million new jobs have been created, the economy has undergone significant growth, and the deficit is shrinking faster than anyone could have predicted. 
   "Tax relief works. Those who promote heaping new taxes on families and businesses don't seem to understand that. But the economy, and millions of people in newly created jobs, do."
