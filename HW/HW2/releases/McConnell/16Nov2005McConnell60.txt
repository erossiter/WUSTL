SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES OVER $8 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY IN FY'06 SCIENCE, STATE, JUSTICE, COMMERCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his requests for over $8 million in funding for Kentucky. The funding, which is included in the FY'06 Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Conference Report, now goes to the President for his signature.  
   Senator McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured the following funding for Kentucky: 
   UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE ($3 MILLION) 
   * $2 million for the UofL Space Flight Exploration: The Impact on Perception, Cognition, Sleep and Brain Physiology Project. UofL will use the funding to simulate the microgravity environment of space and perform a series of twelve experiments to study simultaneous changes in brain processing and cognition. Participants will be engaged in perception and cognition during different states of sleep and wakefulness and after different periods of sleep reduction. Senator McConnell previously secured $2 million in FY'05 for this research. 
   * $1 million for the UofL Rejuvenating Injured Tissues for Enhanced Wound Healing Project. UofL plans to identify factors that hinder the wound healing process and then develop counter-measures to eliminate factors so that wounds can self-heal. This technology will be useful to trauma victims who do not have immediate access to traditional emergency medical care, such as astronauts. 
   "The University of Louisville in conjunction with NASA is conducting exciting and important health-related research," said McConnell. "I am pleased to have secured this funding because students and scientists at the University will have the opportunity to better understand the environment and potential dangers astronauts encounter on missions." 
   UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (OVER $1.5 MILLION) 
   * $1.5 million for UK Rural Drug Prosecution Assistance Project. The University of Kentucky College of Law will use these funds to help the Commonwealth of Kentucky fight drug-related crime by providing law students to Commonwealth Attorneys, U.S. Attorneys, the Kentucky Attorney General, public defenders, and circuit court judges that serve in rural areas, particularly where methamphetamine manufacturing is an increasing problem. Currently, the prosecution system in Kentucky is unable to keep pace with the rapidly growing methamphetamine problem, and these students will be able to assist the criminal justice system in battling this illegal drug crisis. Senator McConnell previously secured $1 million in FY'05 for this project. 
   * $650,000 for the New Product Development and Commercialization Center for Rural Manufacturers (UK is a partner and will receive a share of the secured funding). The Center helps small rural manufacturers pursue the development of new products and commercialization so that they may compete in the global market. Small manufacturers often lack the technical and financial resources to develop new products and as a result, rural communities do not enjoy the full economic benefits of manufacturing facilities and the employment opportunities such facilities could offer. The consortium of universities, of which UK is a partner, hopes that linking the agricultural and engineering expertise of their institutions will help generate new products and employment opportunities in rural communities. 
   "The UK Rural Drug Prosecution Assistance Project has been a very successful program," said McConnell. "I am pleased to provide funding to complete the project which has provided UK law students with the opportunity to learn from experts in the field while simultaneously helping combat methamphetamine abuse in Kentucky." 
   WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY ($3.25 MILLION) 
   * $1.75 million for the WKU Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Project. WKU is working to implement a comprehensive project to promote positive youth development and reduce juvenile delinquency in south central Kentucky. The University has established successful alternative suspension and after-school programs through the Warren County Public School System and a center that facilitates the coordination of service providers who work with at-risk youth and their families. The final phase of the project involves the creation of a drug intervention and family counseling component. 
   Since FY'02 Senator McConnell has secured $3.25 million for this project (including FY'06). "WKU and the Warren County Public School System have successfully partnered to help reduce juvenile delinquency," said McConnell. "This has been an innovative program that is now in its final phase and I am pleased to have helped with this worthwhile project." 
   * $1.5 million for the WKU Environmental Monitoring Network. The funding, which will be administered by the National Weather Service will be used for a monitoring system that will collect real-time observations through a statewide grid of stations. The Kentucky Climate Center at WKU will collect and analyze data, distribute the information over the Internet, and provide applications to support crop and livestock management, drought monitoring, flood warnings, disaster assessment, water supply management, and wildfire risk assessment. 
   "The recent tornado that struck Western Kentucky and Southern Indiana reminds everyone of the destruction mother-nature can create. The funds for this project at WKU will allow for a real time weather network to be available for all Kentuckians," said McConnell. "It will not only be helpful in times of emergency but also throughout the year for farmers and others who depend on accurate and up-to-date weather information." 
   ADDITIONAL KENTUCKY PROJECTS ($400,000) 
   * $200,000 for the Edmonson County Sheriff's Department Law Enforcement Technology Project. The funding will be used to purchase state-of-the-art mobile radios for patrol vehicles and portable radios for patrol officers. The department would also like to use the funds to purchase equipment to help their officers fight the growing methamphetamine problem in south central Kentucky and computer equipment to help with criminal investigations. 
   * $200,000 for the Montgomery County E-911 CAD Acquisition Project. The funds will be used to purchase E-911 computer aided dispatch equipment, which will help the County emergency services agencies better respond to incidents more rapidly and efficiently. 
   The FY'06 Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
