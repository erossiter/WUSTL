SEN. MCCONNELL APPLAUDS FINAL PASSAGE OF PALESTINIAN ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF 2006
Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement on the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, which passed the House of Representatives today:  
 "This bipartisan legislation gives incentives to the Palestinian Authority to take another step toward joining the community of peaceful nations and a step away from the abyss of supporting terrorism. Terrorism against Israel will not bring the Palestinians peace and will only mean hardship for both peoples." 
 The legislation restricts assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) unless the Hamas-led PA publicly acknowledges Israel's right to exist, recommits itself to all its prior agreements with Israel, makes progress toward dismantling terrorist infrastructure, and institutes fiscal transparency. 
 McConnell's bill passed the Senate earlier this year and now goes to President Bush for his signature.
