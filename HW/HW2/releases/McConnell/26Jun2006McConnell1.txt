SEN. MCCONNELL URGES DOD TO CONTINUE TO MAKE DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AT BLUE GRASS ARMY DEPOT TOP PRIORITY
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell announced today that an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that he cosponsored passed the full Senate. The amendment exhorts the Department of Defense to continue to make chemical weapons disposal a top priority in the years to come. It also calls on the Department to provide Congress with annual updates on the disposal schedule at each chemical demilitarization site.  
   In early April, DOD notified Congress that it could not meet the 2012 Chemical Weapons Convention deadline to dispose of all the chemical agents stored at the chemical demilitarization sites nationwide. This amendment expresses the strong view of the Senate that the Department should make every effort to dispose of these lethal chemical agents by the 2012 deadline or as soon as possible thereafter. 
   "I want DOD to know that I will continue to keep a close eye on its chemical weapons disposal efforts," said Senator McConnell. "The people of Madison County can rest assured that my goal remains the same and that is to have the chemical agents at the Blue Grass Army Depot disposed of as safely and efficiently as possible."
