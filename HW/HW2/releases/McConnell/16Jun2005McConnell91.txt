SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESOLUTION HONORING DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI
  Sen. Mitch McConnell introduced a resolution today honoring Aung San Suu Kyi. His statement on the resolution follows: 
   "Mr. President, along with my colleagues from California, Arizona, Tennessee, and Indiana, today I introduce a resolution recognizing Burmese democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as a symbol of the struggle for freedom in Burma.  
   "While many may know of the horrors committed in Burma by the illegitimate State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) - and the courage, dignity and determination of Suu Kyi and her compatriots in the face of this repression - some people may be unaware that June 19 marks Suu Kyi's 60th birthday. 
   "I would like nothing more than to pick up the telephone and call her in Rangoon to give her best wishes on her birthday. However, I cannot. Nor can anyone else. Suu Kyi remains under house arrest by the SPDC. 
   "In addition to my colleagues in the Unofficial Burma Caucus in the Senate - Senators Feinstein, McCain, Frist and Lugar to name but a few - it is important to recognize the expressions of support for Suu Kyi and democracy in Burma by other stalwarts of freedom, including Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Mongolian Prime Minister Elbegdorj Tskahiagiin, former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel, former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and a litany of fellow Nobel Peace Prize recipients. 
   "Let me close by reiterating the call for the immediate and unconditional release of Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in Burma. I urge Secretary of State Rice to encourage regional neighbors and allies to redouble their efforts to support freedom in Burma when she attends the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional forum, and post-ministerial meetings in Laos. 
   "Happy birthday, Suu Kyi. You continue to be in our thoughts and prayers."
