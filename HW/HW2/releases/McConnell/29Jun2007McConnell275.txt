SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR GEORGETOWN COLLEGE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Department of Education has awarded Georgetown College a $75,567 federal grant.  
   The money will be used to develop a Center for Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, which will provide professional development to teachers to help prepare them to work with students learning English. 
   "These funds will enable Georgetown College to prepare future educators to use relevant methods to teach students to learn English," said McConnell. "This project is important to Kentucky and to the students and faculty at Georgetown College, and I was pleased to have helped secure the funding." 
   Earlier this year, Senator McConnell wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Education in support of this program.
