SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUDGET REQUEST FOR CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION PROGRAM
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the Blue Grass Army Depot chemical demilitarization program:  
   "Although the President's budget request has not been submitted to Congress, I am obviously concerned about reports of cuts to the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternative program's budget. The Department of Defense has an obligation to the citizens of Central Kentucky to dispose of chemical agents at the Blue Grass Army Depot in a safe and expeditious manner, and I will continue to devote my energy to ensuring that it lives up to that obligation. 
   "The President's budget request is the first step in a long process, and I will work with the Community, and the Department of Defense to prevent the destruction of these dangerous weapons from being unnecessarily delayed. My friends in Madison County know I've been fighting with them to get rid of these weapons for twenty years, and I'm not about to stop now."
