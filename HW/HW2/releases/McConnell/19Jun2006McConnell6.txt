SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON AUNG SAN SUU KYI'S 61ST BIRTHDAY
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the 61st birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi:  
   "As with all supporters of freedom and democracy in the world, I rise today to extend birthday wishes to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Laureate who remains under house arrest in Burma. 
   "Much like her previous several birthdays, Suu Kyi's birthday today almost certainly will not be a happy one. The "gift" given to Suu Kyi by the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) a few weeks ago was the news that it was again extending her detention. 
   "Under the autocratic rule of the SPDC, drug trafficking, disease and human rights violations are rampant and pose growing problems to the region as a whole. The SPDC adheres to policies that seek only to consolidate its own power, and the ruined lives of the Burmese people are the result. Indeed, there is little reason for celebration in Burma today. 
   "The plight of Suu Kyi symbolizes the plight of her countrymen. Moreover, her commitment to freedom and justice through peaceful political change has created a legacy that will endure long after the SPDC's reign is no more. 
   "The best gift the free world can give Suu Kyi is to remain steadfast in support of freedom in Burma today. She can count on my support."
