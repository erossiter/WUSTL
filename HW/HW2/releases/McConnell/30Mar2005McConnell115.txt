SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BURMA'S CHAIRMANSHIP OF ASEAN
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on Burma's chairmanship of the ASEAN in 2006:  
   "I am very encouraged by the leadership of several ASEAN member states - notably the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia - to deny Burma's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006. Given the illegitimate State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC) abhorrent democracy and human rights record, which includes the use of rape as a weapon of war, Burma's chairmanship would be a tremendous loss of face to that Association and the region. 
   "I am disturbed that our close ally Thailand continues to fully and unequivocally support the military junta in Rangoon. Thailand is simply out of step with the region and with other world democracies. Continued Thai support for the SPDC serves only to prolong the suffering of Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her compatriots, who remain imprisoned for advocating liberty and justice. 
   "The European Union (EU) would do well to follow the lead of the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia as it formulates their common position on Burma in the coming weeks. The EU must make clear that Burma's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006 is completely unacceptable. 
   "Let me be clear that should this occur, the United States, the EU and the community of democracies should boycott any and all ASEAN meetings and events. To do anything less would betray the nonviolent struggle for freedom that Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy and the ethnic minorities have waged for over a decade."
