SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR MAYFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has agreed to his request of $160,000 for the Mayfield Police Department.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the full Senate. 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, secured $160,000 for a computer-aided dispatch system for the Mayfield Police Department. The system will allow dispatchers to locate the origin of 911 calls on a map and assist responding units. 
   "Emergency calls require quick action from first responders," said Senator McConnell. "These funds will help the Mayfield Police Department purchase a computer-aided dispatch system. This system will help the Department better protect and respond to emergencies because they will know the origin of the 911 calls." 
   The FY'05 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for approval.
