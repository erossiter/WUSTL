HOUSE MUST NOW TAKE UP SENATE AMT FIX
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Thursday after the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to prevent a middle-class tax hike The bill does not include the massive tax increase proposed by Democrats.  
   "We have finally reached an agreement to prevent a middle class tax hike on 25 million Americans, and we did so without permanently raising taxes elsewhere. The Democrats' unprecedented and indefensible delay on this commonsense solution means the filing season will already be disrupted. Now that the Senate has passed an AMT fix without tax hikes, the House must do the same or explain to taxpayers why they will further delay tax refunds for millions of Americans."
