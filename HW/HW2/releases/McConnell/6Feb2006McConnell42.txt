SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON 2007 BUDGET REQUEST FOR BLUE GRASS ARMY DEPOT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell released the following statement today on the President's FY'07 budget, which includes funding for the disposal of chemical weapons located at the Blue Grass Army Depot.  
 The budget contains approximately $350 million for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA) program, of which approximately $175 million is designated for Blue Grass.
   "Today, we took another important step toward the safe disposal of the chemical weapons stockpile at the Blue Grass Army Depot," said McConnell. "I am pleased to see the Department of Defense (DOD) took my advice and included sufficient funding for ACWA in the budget. While this is only the first step in the budget process, the people of Madison County can rest assured that I will not stop until all the chemical weapons are disposed of safely."
   The overall request for ACWA is nearly $317 million above the $33 million that was requested last year and reflects DOD agreeing to the FY'07 budget level that Senator McConnell proposed last August. In a letter to DOD, McConnell strongly urged them to request between $300 - $400 million for ACWA in the budget.
