SEN. MCCONNELL: GENERAL PETRAEUS IS AN OUTSTANDING CHOICE
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday regarding the Senate's unanimous confirmation of General David Petraeus to command the multi-national forces in Iraq:  
   "We'll now have our very best general in charge of the operations in Iraq. If it can't be done under General Petraeus, then it cannot be done at all. We ought to give him a chance to succeed. 
   "I had the opportunity to see his experience and expertise firsthand, both at Fort Campbell and on my visits to Iraq. His skill in forging partnerships with the Iraqi people, combined with his extensive military experience, will serve him well in this new and very challenging mission. I congratulate General Petraeus on receiving his fourth star today and say, with confidence, that he represents the best that our country has to offer and is our best chance for success."
