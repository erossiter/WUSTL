SEN. MCCONNELL PROTECTS TAXPAYERS, FUNDS TROOPS
  U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that if the House sends an omnibus appropriations bill to the Senate, he will work through the amendment process to improve the bill by funding our troops in the field without micromanaging our military commanders, and reaching a fiscally responsible result on the 11 remaining funding bills.  
   "We are quickly running out of time to take care of one of the most basic functions of Congress: funding the government," said McConnell. "Yet Democrats have insisted on continuing partisan politics instead of funding our troops in the field without restrictions or funding the government at a fiscally responsible level." 
   The McConnell proposal would provide sufficient funds to bring the level for Iraq and Afghanistan to $70 billion. If the House-passed omnibus is above the President's line, the amendment would provide across-the-board savings from non-defense programs to bring the omnibus in line with the President's top-line number. 
   "Republicans will continue to guard against reckless spending and dangerous policy riders, which is why I will work with my colleagues to institute across-the-board budgetary savings," added McConnell. "This is a reasonable and responsible path forward to completing our work in a bipartisan manner that achieves the twin goals of providing for our troops in the field and protecting the taxpayer's wallet."
