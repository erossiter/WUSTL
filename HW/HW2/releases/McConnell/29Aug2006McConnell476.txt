SEN. MCCONNELL: POLITICAL ATTACKS WON'T REBUILD GULF COAST
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement today regarding the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall on the Gulf Coast, and the need to put action ahead of politics:  
   "Democrat concerns about the government response to Katrina would be taken a lot more seriously if their comments weren't wrapped in a political banner, or salted with campaign rhetoric. 
   "We can all agree that the response to Hurricane Katrina, at all levels of government, provided many lessons to guide the response to future disasters. My visit to the region reaffirmed that the ongoing recovery process is unprecedented in its scope and funding, and that the effort is far from over. 
   "But it's important to remember that campaign-style bus tours, political rallies and attacks won't build a single home or create real jobs in the Gulf Coast. Using the anniversary of this disaster as a platform for the 2006 - or 2008 - campaigns is unproductive."
