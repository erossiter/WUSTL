ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY SENATORS PLACE FRIENDLY WAGER ON FINAL FOUR GAME
  Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL), Barack Obama (D-IL) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Friday announced that there is more than just state pride riding on the University of Louisville vs.  
 University of Illinois Final Four match-up Saturday. 
   The Senators made a friendly "pie for a pie" wager, which pits a Derby Pie and a University of Louisville T-shirt against a deep dish pizza pie from Illinois and a University of Illinois T-shirt. 
   "A trip to the Final Four is a dream come true for any college basketball team," said Durbin. "But the Illini are not just any team, they're the number-one college basketball team in the country. And after two more victories this weekend, I'm confident Coach Bruce Weber and the Fighting Illini will be the 'National Champions.'" 
   "I am so proud of the University of Louisville basketball team. This is a great moment for the players, the fans and the City of Louisville," said McConnell. "I am confident that the Cardinals will beat the Fighting Illini on Saturday in the Final Four, and look forward to celebrating the win by enjoying a slice of deep dish pizza from my colleagues Dick and Barack." 
   "The Illini are athletic, well coached, and share the basketball as well as any team I've seen," Obama said. "The entire state is excited about this team, and I think they are going to win on Saturday. The question is who's next - Michigan State or North Carolina?" 
   The Illini and the Cardinals square off this Saturday at 6:07 PM ET in St. Louis, Missouri.
