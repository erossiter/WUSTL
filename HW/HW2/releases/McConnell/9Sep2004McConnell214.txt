SEN. MCCONNELL INCLUDES $9.24 MILLION FOR UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that a Senate subcommittee has agreed to his request of $9.24 million for the University of Kentucky's College of Agriculture. The funding is currently included in the FY'05 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill, which now must be approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
   McConnell's funding requests include $3 million for the design of an Agriculture Research Service lab, which will house the Forage Animal Production Research Unit. 
   "This is the first step in a long process, but I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize the importance of this funding and include it in the final bill," said McConnell. "Scientists and students at UK are shaping the future of Kentucky agriculture and this funding will help them continue their vital research." 
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee as well as the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, also included funding for the following UK projects in the bill: 
   * $2.74 million for the UK Forage-Livestock Systems Project in conjunction with the ARS and $400,000 for the UK Forage for Advancing Livestock project. This funding will enable UK researchers to continue their study into the nutritional value of new forages for livestock. 
   * $900,000 for UK's Health Education Extension Leadership (HEEL) Program. The HEEL program links UK's School of Public Health with the College of Agriculture. This program uses the expertise from both schools to develop and implement programs designed to improve the health of the communities they serve. 
   * $700,000 for UK's Precision Agriculture Research Unit. Precision Agriculture allows researchers to use satellites to help farmers measure the amount of seed, fertilizer and water they need for their land, thus enabling them to increase the productivity and eliminate crop inefficiencies. 
   * $800,000 to explore new crop opportunities. This funding will allow Kentucky farmers to be on the cutting edge of the changes taking place in the global marketplace and allow them to emerge as leaders in this field. 
   * $700,000 for UK's Advanced Genetics Technology Center. This funding will be used to study ways to eliminate plant and animal diseases, enhance nutritional and health value of foods, and develop new uses for agriculture plants and animals. 
   The FY'05 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill must now be considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee before going to the full Senate for approval.
