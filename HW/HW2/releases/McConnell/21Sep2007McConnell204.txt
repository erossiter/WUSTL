SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL MIA DAY
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday recognizing National POW/MIA Day:  
   "Each morning, the National League of Families' POW/MIA flag is unfurled in front of my office in our nation's capital. This flag honors a special group of American heroes, recognizing the unimaginable hardships of those taken prisoner by the enemy and remembering the sacrifices of those who remain missing in action in conflicts both past and present. 
   "Today, we renew our commitment to the troops and to their families and pledge to keep searching until every one of our Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen are accounted for. In honor and remembrance of these brave patriots, I echo the simple statement on the POW/MIA flag that sits outside my office: 'We have not forgotten.'"
