SEN. MCCONNELL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR KENTUCKY NATIONAL GUARD
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved his request of $3.6 million for the Kentucky National Guard to conduct marijuana eradication.  
 The funding is included in the Senate Defense Appropriations bill, which the full Senate may consider as early as this week.
   "The Daniel Boone National Forest is one of our state's greatest treasures," said McConnell. "The Kentucky National Guard has put forth tremendous effort to rid the forest of marijuana, and this funding will add to the Guard's eradication capabilities."
   McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, worked to include $3.6 million for the National Guard's 2005 eradication program, which includes aerial surveillance support, eradication, and interdiction support.
