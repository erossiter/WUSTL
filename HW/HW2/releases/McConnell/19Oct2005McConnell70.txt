SEN. MCCONNELL CALLS ON SENATE TO PASS COMMONSENSE CONSUMPTION ACT
  Sen. Mitch McConnell today urged the Senate to support his bill, S. 908, which would prohibit abusive lawsuits by people claiming a food company is responsible for their obesity or weight gain.  
   McConnell's bill, the "Commonsense Consumption Act," is virtually identical to H.R. 554, "The Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act," which passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 306-120. 80 House Democrats voted with the Majority. 
   The measure would prohibit claims based on an alleged injury related to obesity or weight gain, in state or federal court, against a lawful food manufacturer or seller. McConnell's bill covers all food, as defined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including food ingredients and beverages. The only claims prohibited by this bill are those related to obesity and weight gain. 
   "Personal injury lawyers are trying to convince Americans that someone else is to blame for their weight problems," said McConnell. "I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support my legislation, which will help curb the voracious appetite of the personal injury lawyers and put an end to this ridiculous and costly litigation before it gets out of hand." 
   Senator McConnell is hopeful that his measure will enjoy the same bipartisan support in the Senate that it enjoyed in the 108th Congress when its principal co-sponsor was Democratic Leader Harry Reid.
