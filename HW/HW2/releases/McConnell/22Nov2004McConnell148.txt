SEN. MCCONNELL SECURES FUNDING FOR DANIEL BOONE NATIONAL FOREST
  Sen. Mitch McConnell announced today that the Senate has approved his request of $1.9 million in funding for the Daniel Boone National Forest.  
 The funding is included in the FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report, which now goes to President George W. Bush for his signature. 
   At McConnell's request, the bill designates $1 million for land acquisition and $900,000 for the Forest Service to continue marijuana eradication operations. 
   The Forest Service works in conjunction with the local sheriff's departments, State Police and the Kentucky National Guard to identify and destroy marijuana plants. The eradication program includes both ground and airborne surveillance support to destroy marijuana plants on or near national forest land. 
   "The marijuana eradication efforts in the Daniel Boone National Forest continue to be successful," said McConnell. "Each year, the Forest Service and the Kentucky National Guard do an outstanding job ridding the forest of marijuana. This funding will help them continue this vital program." 
   Earlier this year, Senator McConnell also secured $2.7 million in the FY'05 Defense Appropriations bill for the Kentucky National Guard's marijuana eradication program in the Daniel Boone National Forest area. 
   Since 1999, Senator McConnell has secured $27.7 million for marijuana eradication efforts in and around the Daniel Boone National Forest. 
   The FY'05 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report now goes to the President for his signature.
