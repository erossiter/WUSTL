SEN. MCCONNELL: DO THEY REALLY WANT A 'NEW DIRECTON?'
  U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell made the following statement Friday regarding the increasingly positive direction of the economy:  
   "Unemployment rates are plummeting, wages are growing, a thriving stock market is helping families save for retirement, and tax relief has cut the deficit in half faster than anyone projected. The economy is strong, but for some reason Democrats want a 'new direction.' 
   "The choice has never been more clear: continued tax relief that grows the economy, or a 'new direction' toward higher taxes and a shrinking economy." 
   The Department of Labor on Friday reported that an additional 92,000 jobs were created in October. Revised statistics for August and September show an increase of 139,000 jobs for a total of more than 6.8 million new jobs since August 2003. The unemployment rate also fell from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent, the lowest level since before 9/11.
