SENS. MCCONNELL, BUNNING, REP. CHANDLER URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ENSURE SAFETY OF PEOPLE LIVING NEAR BLUE GRASS ARMY DEPOT
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Senator Jim Bunning and Congressman Ben Chandler sent a letter Tuesday to the Acting Director of the Chemical Materials Agency urging him to take "immediate and decisive action" to ensure that employees at the Blue Grass Army Depot are "properly trained to prevent release of chemical warfare agents" to ensure the safety of the people living near the facility.  
   The lawmakers are responding to a report recently released by the Kentucky Department of Environmental Protection on the status of the storage of chemical weapons at the BGAD. 
   "We need to ensure that the people involved in the storage of the chemical weapons stockpile at the Depot are properly trained so that the people living in Central Kentucky are safe and secure," Senator McConnell said. "I appreciate the support of my friends Jim Bunning and Ben Chandler on this issue and I will continue to work with them until the community is rid of these lethal agents." 
   "I am pleased to join Senator McConnell and Congressman Chandler in the effort to ensure that this important matter is addressed," Senator Bunning said. "We have an obligation to do everything we can to make sure that workers at the Blue Grass Army Depot have the tools and training necessary to deal with these dangerous weapons and keep the residents of Central Kentucky safe from potential contamination." 
   "My first priority has always been to ensure the safety of Central Kentuckians and employees of the Depot. I know I share this priority with Senator McConnell and Senator Bunning, and I appreciate their ongoing leadership in this area," Congressman Chandler said.
