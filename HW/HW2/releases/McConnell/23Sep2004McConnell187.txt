SEN. MCCONNELL RESOLUTION ON BURMA PASSES SENATE
  A resolution on Burma sponsored by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has passed the Senate. S. Res. 431 expresses the sense of the Senate that the United Nations Security Council should immediately consider and take appropriate actions to respond to the growing threats posed to Southeast Asia by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), Burma's illegitimate military junta.  
   "Swift action on this legislation underscores the unwavering commitment of the Senate to democracy and human rights in Burma," said McConnell. "We recognize the myriad threats posed to the people of Burma and the region by the repressive and illicit activities of the SPDC - it is time the United Nations does so, as well. This runs the gamut from narcotics production and trafficking to the use of rape as a weapon of war." 
   "It is my hope that the Security Council will find the time to closely examine this issue," stated McConnell. "The Burmese people continue to suffer under the misrule of the SPDC, with far too many tortured, raped, killed and imprisoned. Today, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest. She and other National League for Democracy leaders and supporters must be immediately released." 
   "It should not be lost on the region that in 2006, Burma is set to take over chairmanship of ASEAN," McConnell added.
