SENS. MCCONNELL, CRAIG, CRAPO PLACE FRIENDLY WAGER ON OUTCOME OF LIBERTY BOWL
  Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Larry Craig (R-ID) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) have put their hopes on their respective home teams.  
 The Senators made a friendly wager today on the outcome of the 46th Annual AutoZone Liberty Bowl, in which the Louisville Cardinals will face the Boise State Broncos. 
   Senator McConnell has offered a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) dinner if the Broncos win, and Senators Craig and Crapo have bet an Idaho trout/baked potato dinner if the Cardinals win. 
   "As a University of Louisville alumnus, I take great pride in Cardinal football," said McConnell. "I have every confidence that the Cardinals will win the Liberty Bowl, and am very much looking forward to enjoying Idaho trout and baked potatoes that my friends Larry and Mike have offered as a wager." 
   "As highly as I regard Senator McConnell and his loyalty to his alma mater, I must note that Coach Dan Hawkins and his superb staff have put together a bunch of tough Broncos who know how to win," Crapo said. "Boise State's football team is undefeated; I am confident it will continue that record and that Larry and I will be dining on Kentucky Fried Chicken after the Broncos' win at the Liberty Bowl." 
   Craig added, "We in Idaho are extremely proud of the Boise State athletic program and what it has become. With that, Go Broncos!" 
   The Liberty Bowl airs on ESPN at 3:30 p.m. EST/1:30 p.m. MST on Friday, December 31, 2004.
