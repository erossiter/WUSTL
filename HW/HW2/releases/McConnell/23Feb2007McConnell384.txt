SEN. MCCONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING LATEST IRAQ PROPOSAL FROM SENATE DEMOCRATS
  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following statement regarding the latest Iraq proposal from Senate Democrats:  
   "It seems that the Democrats are looking for what could best be described as a Goldilocks resolution: one that is hot enough for the radical left wing, but cool enough for party leaders to claim that they are 'for the troops'. 
   "First we had the Biden resolution, which was pulled down, then we had the Levin resolution that was pulled down. Then we had the Pelosi-Reid resolution which was pulled down, all while seemingly endless proposals from Clinton, Dodd, Biden, Obama, and Feingold are discussed. 
   "The problem is that none of the Goldilocks resolutions are just right. If the Senate doesn't support the mission in Iraq, it has only one option and that's to decide whether or not to fund that mission. That's our constitutional role, and we shouldn't drag this into the morass of Democratic presidential primary politics. We shouldn't deny General Petraeus reinforcements, and we certainly shouldn't rewrite the Rules of Engagement for him."
