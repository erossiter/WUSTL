  U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Friday on the passing of Justice William E. McAnulty Jr.: 
   "Justice McAnulty was a loving father, a caring husband and wonderful judge. His devotion to public service was admirable and our Commonwealth is richer for his efforts. While he will be remembered for his historic service on the Kentucky Supreme Court, I will recall his gentle nature and delightful sense of humor. My prayers are with his family during this time."
